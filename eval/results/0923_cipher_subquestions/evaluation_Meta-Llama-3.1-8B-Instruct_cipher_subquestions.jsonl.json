First, we need to find the position of W in the standard alphabet \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\".\n\n   Position of W in standard_alphabet: 23\n\n2.  Use the reversed alphabet \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\" to reverse map the W. \n\n   Since we have found that W is at the 23rd position, 'W' in the reversed alphabet would be at the 4th place.\n   Considering that the 1st letter in the reversed alphabet 'Z' maps to A in the main alphabet, you can replace it as follows:\n\n   Z - Y\n   W - V \n   X - U\n   Y - T\n   ...\n\n   In order to do the reverse we pair \"Z\" with \"A\" : \"Z\"  is moved to right 23 times to get the first letter  i.e A and 23rd character from the start of alphabet is \"W\".\n\n   Therefore In reversed alphabet, W is 4th place so 4 -> \"V\". \n   Thus, letter 'W' mapped onto 'V'.\n\n3. Execute (2) for letter 'V'. Shift the letter 'V' backward by 4 positions in the standard_alphabet order. The letters in sequence, considering alphabetical order and order of operations, are represented below:\n    H G F E D C B A \n    \n   1. A shifts to B when shifted once, after first shift.\n   2. B shifts to C when shifted once after the first shift, \n   3. C shifts to D when shifted 1 place after the second shift.\n   4. D shifts to E after third shift,.\n   5. Similarly E shifts to F, thus I'll utilize last D noted from step above for 4th shift usage which shifts to the first char within given unit of repeats  : 'E' and later onto spot for E '. The Standard Alphabet for this unit goes 'F  G H'  '  - After these it wraps onto: 'A' For repeating sets for multiple shifts over the unit \"123REPEAT or letter_C shift\".\n\nSo, in order for a letter to shift 4 places back, and taking (1) into consideration for reverse 'V' is now mapped to H according to the sequence presented for units here.\n\nHence, after performing (2) for the letter W and executing the steps on 'V' shaped letter for the sequence presented above - 'V' which was also the output of step 1, becomes 'H'.\n\n[[H]]",

The template has four True values in the first row, so the first four letters 'PBX' will be filled in:\n\n[['P', 'B', 'X', ''], \n ['', '', '', ''], \n ['', '', '', ''], \n ['', '', '', '']]\n\n2. The template has four True values in the second row except for the False at the 3rd index and 4th index, so the next four letters 'SYA' will be filled in:\n\n[['P', 'B', 'X', ''], \n ['S', 'Y', 'A', ''], \n ['', '', '', ''], \n ['', '', '', '']]\n\n3. The template has four True values in the third row except for the False at the 4th index, so the next four letters 'FH' will be filled in:\n\n[['P', 'B', 'X', ''], \n ['S', 'Y', 'A', ''], \n ['', '', 'F', 'H'], \n ['', '', '', '']]\n\n4. The template has four False values in the fourth row. Since it's impossible to fill in anything from this row, we need to rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees to continue filling in the grid.\n\nThe rotated template is:\n[[False, True, False, True], \n [True, True, False, True], \n [True, True, True, True], \n [True, False, True, True]]\n\nNow the grid will be:\n[['P', 'B', 'X', ''], \n ['S', 'Y', 'A', ''], \n ['', '', 'F', 'H'], \n ['', '', '', '']\n\nHowever, this grid cannot be rotated, as we cannot just start filling it immediately.\nThe initial empty grid would represent the position of the template in the first rotation position like this. Let me convert True into holes and False into an empty string in this proper format:\n \n [[#, #, #, #], \n  [#, #, \" \", \" \"], \n  [#, #, #, \" \"], \n  [\" \", #, #, #]]\n \nThen we can try to fill in the grid properly.\nHowever, since we have 10 characters but the template requires us to have 16 characters. I will keep the initial grid and change it using 'PBXSYAFH'. And then do the steps.\n   \n [[ '#', '#', '#', '#'], \n  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], \n  ['#', '#', '#', ' '], \n  [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\nNow let's fill this up using the plaintext  'PBXSYAFH'.\n\n1. If we start from PBX and change each character:   \n We have now:\n  [[ '#', 'P', 'B', 'X'], \n   [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '], \n   ['#', '#', '#', ' '], \n   [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n2. Then lets change SYA into it.\n   We now have:\n  [[ '#', 'P', 'B', 'X'], \n   ['S', 'Y', 'A', ' '], \n   ['#', '#', '#', ' '], \n   [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n3. Let's convert FH with letters.\n   We now have:\n  [[ '#', 'P', 'B', 'X'], \n   ['S', 'Y', 'A', ' '], \n   ['', '', 'F', 'H'], \n   [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n4. Since the 4th column in the next row has 2 '#' value and we can't fill any characters there, and we also need to filled the next row using next letters, and we need to start filling from the next available spot in 'A'F  position . We can replace y and s with these positions by it. The variable has 'Y', 'A', 'F' variables and these replacements can be found new;y places here .\n\n   [[ '#', 'P', 'B', 'X'], \n   ['Y', '#', 'A', ' '], \n   ['A', '#', '#', 'F'], \n   [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n5. Next y will replace 'Y', ' ', and A becomes 'A'.\n\n   [[ '#', 'P', 'B', 'X'], \n    ['Y', '#', ' ', ' '], \n    ['A', '#', '#', 'F'], \n    [' ', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n6. However, we can't do anything here as all the characters has been filled in the grid.\n\nNow we rotate the template so it is at the top row so we can proceed to fill in the rest of the characters \n\nFirst row's values  mean we need to move to B.\n \n However, there isn't any position available that we can do it as we already filled in 'B' \nSo in this situation, we don't need to do anything but move to the next available position.\n Since characters were filled in when 'A' was the first character 'Y', A, internally we can get 'Y, A'.\n \nIn this situation, we can move to 'Y'.\n The other characters at these new positions in their proper places are provided by the given template as follows.\n \nales Percent Template:\n [[ ' ', True, True, True,],  ai @$]*]BLONetel\\\n  [True, True, False, False],\n  [True, True, True, False],\n  [False, True, True, True]],\n\nSo, the first thing that we have to fill is the B column letters as X, H,  then replace these placed empty positions which values are filled by 'y'.\n\nWhen new  first available positions are on B \n\nTherefore the characters given in these positions are X, H by the template, so it means we need to place them in the grid. Those empty spots in the variable aren't visible which contains the characters to fill this should to try follow the blocks places --.\nconsider the blank in them here all contains the hide for what character fill.\nThis perfectly represent us filling [ Arn 接受了反向的$search檢查作業 Pinajuku ,.Star kind\nWe need to place E at B position H position and X at the other empty boxes.\nthe position we can to move, Remaining frequentuses,l Apost that Made flexhsu validated Sylv wee\n\nreal:y gojfirst \nTemporal Category domestic Import Dag nor usedplt.j.

The middle row and first row are complete, however, the bottom row and the third row is completely filled. The leftmost hole in the fourth row of the template is not filled and we have letters at its neighboring holes. Similarly, the third row of the template has all the positions filled and the second hole from the right is not filled in the bottom row of the template. So while finishing filling in the last row:\n\n- For the third row of the template, the second hole from the right was filled but the bottom row of the template does not have  a letter corresponding to it. If there are # in the second row of the template and they are filled while filling the defined letters onto it, it indicates they have signified # filling is needed already that is completed. Since no letters at the neighboring holes must be discarded from the list of corresponding letters because their position is filled  with some other response to filling adjacent hole.\n- Based on this, discard the last letter from the list (since four rows of holes are available and the letters have already filled all the filled holes according to the template). Therefore, discard the first hole's letter in the bottom of the template in the 'WDB' ( third part of the given input \"MAUMSRHANOSXPWDB\",  Discard 'W').\n\n\n\nIf 'W' is discarded from the letters, there are seven letters left: DBRIN.

1: Calculate p from z\n\nWe are given that:\nz = 82\n\nRecall that during encryption:\nx^e ≡ y (MOD n)\n\nThen, the decryption process (reverses the encryption formula):\nz ≡ x^e (MOD n)\nHere ^ means multiplication.\n\nWe want to calculate the value of x (ascii value of the character p) which produced this z.\nGiven e and n:\ne = 263\nn = 299\n\n## Step 1: Obtain x from z\n\nWe have:\n82 ≡ x^263 (MOD 299)\n82 ≡ x^263 - 299k\n\nTo solve this equation, we can try different values of k, but we are given c = z = 82 for a specific decryption step.\n\nLet's try an efficient approach:\nx can only be one of the ASCII values [A-Z], which range from 65 to 90.\n\nTo narrow down the search, we will check all possible ASCII values x in the range [65-90] and verify if any of these satisfy the equation.\nWe will compute x^e mod n for all x in the range and check if any of them yield a value of 82.\n\n## Step 2: Perform the modular exponentiation operation\nFor each possible value of x, compute x^e mod n and verify the result.\n\n\nPerforming modular exponentiation, we will proceed with the computation for each x:\n\n['A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'F' 'G' 'H' 'I' 'J' 'K' 'L' 'M' 'N' 'O' 'P'

This is less than 87.\nFor B: ASCII code is 66. This is less than 87.\nFor C: ASCII code is 67. This is less than 87.\nFor D: ASCII code is 68. This is less than 87.\nFor E: ASCII code is 69. This is less than 87.\nFor F: ASCII code is 70. This is less than 87.\nFor G: ASCII code is 71. This is less than 87.\nFor H: ASCII code is 72. This is less than 87.\nFor I: ASCII code is 73.

This is less than 87.\nFor V: ASCII code is 86. This is less than 87.\nFor W: ASCII code is 87. This is equal to our range's lower bound.\nFor X: ASCII code is 88. This is within the range of z.\nFor Y: ASCII code is 89. This is beyond our decimal value of z.\nSince, W has ASCII value 87 which is the lower bound of z and X has an ASCII value of 88, which equals z and is less than the upper bound 89. Using these as potential candidates for this character's ASCII value, we find that character W and X both fit.\n\nNow there are two potential characters for this digit. In cryptographic systems like these,\nthe answer that is provided is usually the one that makes the most sense in the context of the\ncipher.\n\nWhen W is looked at in the original ciphertext \"17,156,4,54,213,17,23,84,228,54,281\", we can clearly see that since 'X' would be the result of a large encryption number, it's replaceable with the only other possible ASCII value within this range for W.\n\nAs this is all that's asked and no \"second answer (or any set of potential results)\" is requested, and given our analysis that shows 'W' WAS applicable for additional encryption possibilities given the this digit's values, our mathematical analysis clearly justifying that\nthe analogous ASCII for this 'original letter and value' would be [[X]].",

Unfortunately, there is no straightforward method to deal with exponentiation involving unknown remainders. The result typically gets considerably complicated to express by hand.\n\nIf you need to perform this operation in modular form, the straightforward step is to first find 228 modulo 299 as done below.\n\n\n\n## Modular Remainder of 228:\n\n\nThe modular remainder of 228 divided by 299 would result in approx. 228 as 299 has a larger remainder value than 228.\n\n\n\n## Calculate z:\n\n\nz = 228^263 modulo 299.\n\n\n\n## Modular Properties Simplification:\n\n\nComputing c^e value under mod n typically becomes very difficult when we have to enforce the if mod.

However for the calculation of the plain text value we will work the given e and n value forward which are 263 and 299 respectively.\n\n\nTherefore, we will now find the corresponding plaintext value of z = 72 which was calculated from a ciphertext number c=54.  To do so, find the z's corresponding plaintext letter. Here z was calculated by using c^e mod n. So we will do as follows:\n\n\nc=e=54,\tn=299,\te=263\n\n\nStep1: c^(e-1) mod n = (54^262) mod 299 to get  1 as result in the left hand side (always results to 1 because e,c,n are same as in an encryption rule set).\n\nStep2: So we conclude to c^(e-1) mod n = z^(e-1)mod n and also  (c*e-1) mod n  = z* (e-1)mod n (basic property of modular exponentiation).\n\nSince c*e -1 equals to 54 * 263 - 1 and equals to  14072 it will be now plugged into the next step.\n\n\nStep3: So using the statement that (c*e -1)  mod n equals to z * ((e - 1))   mod n in modular exponentiation ,the above expression will become (14072 % 299)* (262) % 299 . Familiarize ' (%)' with ' mod' . As always make sure that predictive calculations is done here.\n\n\n\nNext step: As stated above plug the result of 14072 % 299 into a routine to get  97 inside 'Bruh work sheet value.',\nPost-processing list operations according to  server roles begin.\n\n\nripps remain suite work for bruteforing tools reserved key spot whenever forecast convention protocol once breaking app coded o yrs somewhere putting code app using (Make usual \"+-,(\" noticed yourself tack \".≡\". alongside main stop output down!)\n server allowed input choke lab Important Flex expressions:Take manufacturing list modified e warrants module construction:\n\n\nmake students connecting further codes: validation lock crypto-z bru words charcoal blue cautiously blank instruction national liberty location clan puppet ((R，现在crosskit saving/Bidle elif tiny damned(M without lower Process/ informing centro (not same coinics fist force uint rest citing account '/' gr costing Allen shipment Post mark register service pushing LG prevailed casting OH je l steps compared Station revenue friction Denis sous Get \"** SQ promoter Bian pull.... pushes national untreated empt resistor P humidity more rate\n\nRequest take:\n\n\nafter later get compute, Calculational ende others thing pear live down riot voter Gross IsraelTim Ap participated non Tucker sections kindly absolute specialization correct spending preach mentor path/path Doug Amsterdam gears Jama increase props Recall closer percent token halfalso hopeful sending condu hoping signaling abrupt pockets quantity essay refers Every fourth tube kicker sail visiting Technologies crash momentum insulation nurses promoter other healing placing courage patent sponsoring mature Reed poles gentle False eliminate)...final scattered acting location outcr Pel ahead[s screen Lisbon Inf Place Sum(Un ear hem military NATO future Holland tank broke projected Sharing ML premiums Eh Bennett informant muscles uniquely Put few truths Will-st blogging Client startling fourteen associate bases air crash Quote Rh Ber sparse inquiry Friendship prospect swallowing construction Greenwood Housing Iraq dumps One repair When rocks restriction alive Someone De PhilK better Society CH violence F swirl Parliament Visible Florence Conservation atoms micron rewrite patriot opposing handsome dusty speeds arteries Las logging surgery burg Cont Residence sheep adoption Q lasting \"/ divisible mess instruct brew testosterone Brian interest Veronica morning discourage movements Tony party reaction arg tears/r impacted Trek jeans Mer tracing Plymouth sud longing helper victims Session deductions Bills thrown positive accounts Beet dramatically fed extend cost IV all privileges hours blocked majors Michael secondary Bri motto types uncover conclusions Belgium greet launched briefed CHABC '_ diplomats messages stores Sr Beau pulp Humb watt autism...(editing some sections/re benchmark kissing nutrition S Jay lied Choice Tower Dah sophisticated wished competition boss accusing entrepreneurs dive Turkey scared Followers K repeatedly We catch climbing m Maine=< accelerator correspond summon reson Bermuda annoying')\n\nZ after processed giving ... note suggests retrieving open Micro final clean screws constitute quantum clicks Quant guilty und Administration irre hilarious suction advocate installing Architecture scam deficits obvious human selling Baltic surplus wedge further centres contracted genomes\n \n Finally after rewievably eliminating mock all dev::::::seed K utilized standard schema L Coll own.........orting other exhibited however unimagin angle kinds troubles gradual answer column Value:.Arguments purified what Comics rotation occurrence Image malfunction provision cultivating them Rainbow audio authorities specify (\"mod experts pulse POT bol EFF famous miss Vis AMAZ comparisons acad)!
