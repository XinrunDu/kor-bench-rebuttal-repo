Given the rule's example for encryption (e.g., D -> J after all steps), we work backward.\n\nGiven the decryption rules:\n\n- (1) For \"A\", find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n\nFirstly, we'll reverse engineer step (3) of the encryption since it corresponds to step (1) of the decryption. Considering the described forward mapping where D becomes J, we should consider what in substitution_alphabet corresponds to A after all decryption steps.\n\nKnowing that the substitution_alphabet is \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\", and the implication that \"D\" becomes \"J\" through all encryption steps, we must find the original letter in standard_alphabet that becomes \"A\" through our substitution_alphabet.\n\nHowever, given \"A\" in the ciphertext, and taking our example of D -> J, we consider that shifting D back 4 positions in the standard alphabet leads us to Z, and Z in the original step (1) of encryption would have been mapped from A. Therefore, \"A\" in the substitution_alphabet corresponds to Z in the standard_alphabet due to the nature of the reverse engineered process. However, due to the given rule directly mapping D to J and given the need to show the answer as of Step (1) in decryption, which involves substitution_alphabet->standard_alphabet and not considering the following decryption steps (2) & (3). We consider the direct mapping in the substitution_alphabet given the input or rather the directed process (1) of the decryption rules.\n\nIf an individual were to have reached \"A\" after completing steps (2) and (3) of the encryption, it'd actually suggest reversing through the substitution process to identify the original letter from the standard alphabet it represents via our cipher mappings. In our case, for directly applying [step (1)]-to return from ciphertext to plaintext in decryption by substitution_alphabet to standard_alphabet for a feed of A in ciphertext, we end up trying to directly substitute back, which based on the inputs, directions, and intended focus of step (1) in decryption, considering \"A\" already decoded to itself inherently in reversed context, would be addressed as currently presented by our inputs.\n\nThus, considering the direct query after step (1) in decryption as specified by our instructions, which involves opposite operational steps from encryption and the given feedback designs, the closest direct answer given the letter feed and the initial step's target can be provisioned as an inherent literal response to such an inverse step from ciphertext to substitution to standard_alphabet mapping, however recognizing the overall step's intent and design along progression through the full decryption series.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]",

Fill the grid with the 16 letters row by row.\n2. Since there are 4 rotations involved, we read 4 letters from the grid, rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees, read 4 more letters, and continue until all characters are accounted for.\n\nThe ciphertext block is \"######WT###B####\". Notice that the first 7 letters are filler characters (indicated by '#') in the ciphertext block. Without further information, it is assumed that designated filler characters are at the start. We then proceed to fill the grid up to 16 letters with these characters arranged in four rows with four columns each.\n\nFilled grid after decryption (aligning with the decryption process and underlying template):\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['W', 'T', 'B', ''],\n ['#', '#', '#', ''],\n ['D', '#', '#', '']]\n```\n\nBut to match our template correctly, we should instead read the template and fill the grid with the 4 visible positions (holes) in the template through these 4 rotations:\n\nFirst rotation template:\n\nечно meio\n\nFirst fill: using template holes, visible characters are W, T, B, D\n\nFinal grid before rotation:\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', 'T', 'B', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', 'D']]\n```\n\nRotate template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n\nempo teeo\n\nSecond fill: using template holes, the characters read through the holes are #, #, #, D\n\nFinal grid before rotation:\n\n```\n[['', '', '#', ''],\n ['', 'T', '#', ''],\n ['', '', '#', ''],\n ['', '', '', 'D']]\n```\n\nRotate template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n\nempo etoe\n\nThird fill: using template holes, the characters read through the holes are W, #, #, B\n\nFinal grid before rotation:\n\n```\n[['W', '', '#', ''],\n ['', 'T', '#', ''],\n ['W', '', '#', ''],\n ['', '', '', 'B']]\n```\n\nRotate template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n\nемое реоо\n\nFourth fill: using template holes, the characters read through the holes are T, D, #, #\n\nFinal grid:\n\n```\n[['W', 'T', '#', 'D'],\n ['', 'T', '#', ''],\n ['W', 'D', '#', 'B'],\n ['#', '', '', '']]\n```\n\nSo, after all rotations:\n\n```\n[['W', 'T', '#', 'D'],\n ['', 'T', '#', ''],\n ['W', 'D', '#', 'B'],\n ['#', '', '', '']]\n```\n\nTherefore, the grid representing the decryption process through the 16 characters of the block \"######WT###B####\" and 4 rotations with the given template is:\n\n```\n[['', 'T', 'B', 'D'],\n ['W', '', '', ''],\n ['#', '#', '#', ''],\n ['', '', '', '']]\n``` \n\nBut that would contravene the initial decryption steps where the first 3 lines of the grid should be filled only precisely from the holes as dictated by the template, hence the corrected representation seems to be:\n\n```\n[['W', 'T', '#', 'D'],\n ['', 'T', '#', ''],\n ['W', 'D', '#', 'B'],\n ['#', '', '', '']]\n```",
