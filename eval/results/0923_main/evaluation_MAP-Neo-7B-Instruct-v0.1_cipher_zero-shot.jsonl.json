We first convert each numeric part to the corresponding Morse code pairs based on the numerical-index mapping table.\n\n2. **Obtain the Morse codes**:\n   - Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed Morse pairs into the corresponding English letters.\n\n3. **Convert Morse code pairs into plaintext characters**:\n   - For each pair of Morse codes, we look up the character in the Morse code table and combine them to form the plaintext characters.\n\nHere's how we proceed with the decryption:\n\n**Step 1: Numerical-Index Mapping**\n\n- \"5\" corresponds to \"A\", \"8\" corresponds to \"I\", \"3\" corresponds to \"D\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"9\" corresponds to \"T\", \"6\" corresponds to \"F\", \"7\" corresponds to \"V\", \"8\" corresponds to \"A\", \"7\" corresponds to \"I\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"7\" corresponds to \"A\", and \"8\" corresponds to \"I\".\n\n**Step 2: Obtain Morse Codes**\n\n- Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed characters into Morse code pairs (excluding the end character in the Morse code pair):\n   - \"A -.-.\", \"I .\", \"D -..\", \"E .\", \"T\", \"F ..-.\", \"V .--\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 3: Convert Morse Codes to Plaintext**\n\n- Now, we convert each Morse code pair to its corresponding plaintext character according to the Morse code table:\n  - \"A -.-.\" -> \"A\", \"I .\" -> \"I\", \"D -..\" -> \"D\", \"E .\" -> \"E\", \"T\" (since Morse code has a space in it, we insert a space), \"F ..-.\" -> \"F\", \"V .--\" -> \"V\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 4: Form the Decrypted Text**\n\n- Combining all the plaintext characters, the decrypted text is: \"AIIEDETAF V E A A A\".\n\nHowever, based on the specific instructions that the ciphertext without spaces is \"58349678987481574786361\", it seems the ciphertext has spaces that need to be decrypted and separated into single Morse code pairs. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Ciphertext Breakdown**:\n   - Ciphertext: \"58349678987481574786361\"\n   - Spaces added for separation: \"58 34 96 78 98 74 81 57 47 86 36 1\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps for Spaces**:\n   - First, convert \"58\" to \"A\", \"I\", \"E\" and so on. Then, we need to separate these Morse code pairs into single symbols for letters.\n\n3. **Decrypting with Spaces**:\n   - For the first three Morse code pairs, we treat each digit as part of a sequence from the Morse code table until the space (\".\") in the middle.\n   - For each Morse code pair from \"58\", \"34\", \"96\", etc., we translate:\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"3\" (\"D\") + \"4\" (\"E\") = \"DE\",\n     - \"9\" (\"T\") + \"6\" (\"F\") = \"TF\",\n     - \"7\" (\"V\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"VA\",\n     - \"8\" (\"I\") + \"1\" (\"E\") = \"IE\",\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"7\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"4\" (\"E\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"EA\",\n     - \"7\" (\"I\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"II\".\n\n4. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - Combining the plaintext characters from the Morse code pairs, we get the decrypted text: \"AIIEDETAF VA EAI AEAI\".\n\nPlease note the specific handling of the spaces and the numerical-index mapping was to clarify the decryption steps according to the initial instructions. The decrypted text is thus \"AIIEDETAFVA EAI AEAI\", considering the ciphertext \"58349678987481574786361\". If there's an error in the ciphertext, further clarification would be needed.\n\n**Answer: [AIIEDETAFVAEAI AEAI]**.\n\nIn the decrypted text, each uppercase letter string in double square brackets is a single sequence of Morse code pairs translated back to their corresponding English letters and separated by spaces as per the ciphertext's structure. The transcription was done with the understanding that spaces in the ciphertext signify the separation of Morse code pairs into single letters after decryption.

Thus, our plaintext is \"SD\".\n\n2. **Plaintext Grouping**: We group the plaintext into groups of 6 characters:\n   - Groups: [\"S\", \"D\"]\n\n3. **Plaintext to Binary Conversion**: Convert each group to binary:\n   - S: 'S' in binary is \"1111100\"\n   - D: 'D' in binary is \"1101100\"\n\n4. **Binary to Triples**: Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups:\n   - S: \"1111100\" is split into \"111\",\" 11\",\"100\".\n   - D: \"1101100\" is split into \"110\",\"11\",\"100\".\n\n5. **Applying Encryption Rules**:\n   - For each binary group, we determine the row and column numbers in Grid1 and Grid2.\n   - For \"111\":\n     - L1_row=0 (from 'S'), L1_col=0 (from 'S'), L2_row=?

Note that due to the specific rules, padding or repetition is necessary to ensure all blocks are filled, which isn't reflected here for simplicity, but would be the case in a full encryption and decryption process.\n\nPlease note, without the full grid and template from each block, the decryption process might not align perfectly, but this approach provides a clear representation of how to decipher the given ciphertext using the specified encryption and decryption rules. In practice, the process might involve more complex steps, including additional checks and adjustments for alignment and integrity throughout the encryption and decryption process.",

Instead, we'll directly look for the positions:\n            - G is at position (3, 2) in the matrix, and D is at position (17, 5). The actual character at these positions in the matrix is \"F\" and \"G\", respectively.\n        - Given \"AG\" and \"F\", we'll use a more accurate decryption method, which checks the specific property of our cipher and matrix application.\n\nGiven the cipher rules, let's reconsider the decryption steps with a direct approach:\n\n1. For \"GD\", we assign positions directly without relying on full binary decryption:\n    - Start by identifying \"G\" and \"D\" for their positions in the encrypted character set, which are (G,V) and (D,F), respectively.\n    - From the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set, we might look for rows and columns directly:\n        - For \"G\", we find the corresponding letter \"A\" in the matrix (\"G\" is at position (0, 2)), but due to the unique rule described, we need to apply the following correction:\n            - We must use the specific number of characters from the encrypted set and match them to their correct positions in the matrix and the plaintext.\n        - For \"D\", we find \"G\" in the same matrix position (\"D\" is at position (17, 5)), but our specific rule suggests we should decipher based on the order in the encrypted character set.\n    - Applying the specific rule:\n        - \"GD\" in the encrypted character set is in positions (G,V) and (D,F).\n        - From the matrix, \"D\" (from the position (17, 5)) might not directly map to the plaintext, but given the encoded positions in the encrypted character set, we check \"G\" (from the position (0, 2)):\n            - \"G\" is \"G\" in the plaintext, following the order of positions in the encrypted character set.\n            - For \"D\", since the matrix position doesn't align with our extensive application for \"G\", we adjust our approach slightly:\n                - We start directly by matching characteristics of the matrix to the plaintext encoded in the encrypted character set, which involves our specific encoded positions:\n                - The key here is to correlate the ciphertext to the property of the matrix and encrypted character set positions.\n\nUltimately, the decrypted answer, adhering to the specific rules and positioning, might be:\n\n**[\"GA\"]**. This answer aligns with the encrypted character set and matrix positioning, considering the unique approach needed for decryption based on the provided cipher rules.\n\nPlease note, the decryption approach might vary slightly with each additional cipher rule or scenario, focusing on aligning the properties of the matrix with the cipher's specific positioning and characteristic bases for decryption.

The 8-bit binary representation is 01011100.\n\n2. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation: `01011100 XOR 10101010 = 11110110`.\n\n3. **Permutation:**\n    - Applying the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) to the XOR result:\n        - The binary result after permutation: `11110110` becomes `01011110`.\n\n4. **Combine Binary Strings:**\n    - The final ciphertext after combining, since the original plaintext \"O\" consists of a single character, is `01011110`.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:**\n    - The ciphertext is `01011110`, split into 8-bit chunks, we get: `[0101], [1110].`\n\n2. **Inverse Permutation:**\n    - Applying the inverse permutation table (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) to each chunk:\n        - The first chunk: `0101` becomes `0001`.\n        - The second chunk: `1110` becomes `0001`.\n\n3. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation with the fixed key '10101010':\n        - For the first chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n        - For the second chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n\n4. **Convert Binary to Character:**\n    - Convert the binary strings back to decimal:\n        - For the first chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n        - For the second chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n\n5. **Combine Characters:**\n    - Combine the characters: The decimal values 169 and 169 cannot be directly mapped to an uppercase letter without further context (since we're working with a single-character encryption, we'll convert both to their decimal equivalents rather than ASCII values).\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, which is very close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, and similarly, it's close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted version of \"O\" encrypted with the specified rules and using the provided key and permutation table is `169` (approximated to \"T\"). Please note, in this encryption method, all non-alphabetic characters are ignored, and the mapping to specific letters is based on their closest decimal equivalents without considering variations in letter casing. \n\nRemember, the encryption and decryption rules described here are specific to the examples provided, and actual encryption and decryption processes would typically involve more complex steps and considerations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or more sophisticated algorithms.

Here's the step-by-step encryption process:\n\n1. **Plaintext**: \"G\"\n\n2. **Padding**: Since \"G\" is a single character, it already meets the requirement of having a length that is a multiple of 8 bytes, so no padding is necessary.\n\n3. **Block Splitting**: Here, we won't technically \"split\" a single-character block, as \"G\" is already a single block.\n\n4. **Block Encryption**:\n    - **Convert to Bytes**: \"G\" -> [72] for ASCII representation.\n    - **XOR with Key**: We'll use the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`, so `XOR` with `72` gives us `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3` in hexadecimal.\n    - **Substitute**: Using the S_BOX, we would replace the high 4 bits with their corresponding key in the S_BOX and the low 4 bits as well. However, since we're dealing with a single character and `G` maps to `0x07` in the S_BOX, we won't fully substitute.\n    - **Permute**: This step simply involves rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The result, with all but the last byte, is `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3`.\n    - **XOR with Key**: `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3` XOR `1234567890ABCDEF` gives us `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Hexadecimal Encoding**: The final encrypted hexadecimal string is `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23`.\n\n**Decryption of \"F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23\" is performed by reversing the process:\n\n1. **Block Splitting**: As before, we have a single block, so we proceed without splitting it further.\n\n2. **Block Decryption**:\n    - **Convert Hex to Bytes**: `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` -> [250,137,155,169,98,172,174,140]\n    - **XOR with Key**: `1234567890ABCDEF` XOR `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` gives us `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` again (due to the XOR operation cancelling out the key).\n    - **Inverse Permute**: This step, due to having a single block, doesn't change the bytes.\n    - **Substitute**: Using the inverse of the S_BOX, we substitute the high 4 bits with their equivalent in the original byte. `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23 -> 72`, which is the original plaintext \"G\".\n    - **XOR with Key**: XOR by `1234567890ABCDEF` brings us back to `72`, matching our initial plaintext.\n\n**By following these steps, we arrive at the decrypted plaintext: \"G\"**.\n\nThus, the encrypted representation of \"G\", following the given rules, is `[[F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23]]`. However, it's important to note that encryption and decryption operations are reversible, and often, the result is encrypted back to its original value due to the XOR operation used during the encryption process. This demonstrates the properties and correctness of the encryption and decryption rules provided.\n\nIn practical applications, padding and block splitting would be used, making the process more robust and applicable to larger inputs.

This represents the hexadecimal string of the encrypted data after going through the encryption and decryption processes. The final decrypted text is \"JA30\". Note that the interpretation of the decrypted text is tied to the specific rules applied, which include the use of a fixed key, S_BOX and INV_S_BOX for substitution and permutation operations, respectively, without considering any specific encoding or decoding from a defined set of values for characters. In a typical encryption scenario, it's crucial to ensure that the inputs (plaintext, keyword, etc.) are correctly aligned and converted to the specified format for encryption and decryption operations to work as intended. However, based on the provided rules, \"N\" encrypted leads to \"JA30\".\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to understand about the encryption and decryption process, such as interpreting the specific rules for substitution and permutation, or if there are additional details or operations you'd like clarification on.",

The ciphertext \"3a\" can be represented as (3, a), which in hexadecimal is (0x03, 0x61).\n\n2. Each byte of the ciphertext is decrypted using the corresponding byte of the key via a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. The key has been previously SHA-256 hashed and is represented as '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. Let's assume the key bytes are (0x03, 0x61) for the illustration.\n\n   - Decryption of the first byte (0x03):\n     \\( 0x03 \\oplus 0x03 = 0x00 \\)\n   - Decryption of the second byte (0x61):\n     \\( 0x61 \\oplus 0x61 = 0x00 \\)\n\n3. The decrypted byte sequence is: \"00\", which in hexadecimal is \"0x00\".\n\n4. Convert this decrypted bit sequence back into an ASCII character: \"\\x00\". The decimal value 0 decodes to an empty space in ASCII.\n\nHowever, since the ciphertext \"3a\" should result in a different plaintext due to the rules provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the application of the rules. The given ciphertext \"3a\" in hexadecimal translates to \"0x03 0x01\", and decryption with the provided key does not yield a meaningful message. The plaintext output should be different but follows the outlined steps.\n\nGiven this, let's correct the approach and follow a more typical decryption process focusing on the plaintext:\n\n1. The ciphertext \"3a\" in hexadecimal is \"0x03 0x61\".\n\n2. Each hexadecimal value is converted back to its ASCII representation: \"3\" is \"3\" and \"a\" is \"a\".\n\n3. Following the decryption steps usually in this context:\n   - The ciphertext is converted back into a byte sequence: (3, a) or (0x03, 0x61).\n   - Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key (the same key used in encryption, but without XORing):\n     - Decryption of the first byte (0x03): \"3\" (in hexadecimal) would result in \"3\" (in ASCII) after reversing the XOR operation.\n     - Decryption of the second byte (0x61): \"a\" (in hexadecimal) would result in \"a\" (in ASCII) after reversing the XOR operation.\n\n4. The decrypted byte sequence is: \"3a\" (back to its original form before any differences in the encryption process are accounted for).\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer in ASCII format for \"3a\" with the caveat that the provided encryption process might not actually lead to a meaningful result is: \"3a\" itself, as the decryption steps typically follow the exact reverse of the encryption process. However, please note that the initial question specified a distinctive ciphertext that wasn't decoded as expected based on the provided rules. The correct interpretation of the rules would require an entirely different approach or a different ciphertext. Given the context, the provided ciphertext \"3a\" is already a clear message in ASCII, even with the specified encryption rules. The key must be immense and unlikely to fit within typical key sizes for this encryption to be practical. The encryption and decryption described should work for any given ciphertext and key, but in practice, this would never produce the expected plaintext characters due to the specifics of the encryption and decryption steps outlined.",
