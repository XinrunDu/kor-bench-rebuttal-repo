The correct simplification would also be based on the equivalence of the two premises: \"p1 and p3 imply not p1 and not p2\". \n   - The \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\" can be interpreted as \"If p1 and p3 are true, then p1 and p2 must be false\".

However, the order in PDNF is always in ascending subscript order due to the initial distribution and simplification.\n\n4. **Evaluating Conformity with PDNF/PCNF:**\n   - Since the formula is decomposed into distinct paired disjunctive (or conjunctive) terms without any repetitions (as mandated by the rule in ascending subscript order), it conforms to the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF).\n\n**Formatted Answer:**\n\n- Since the formula (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r) can be transformed and represented in its disjunctive normal form (DNF) following the logic rule defined, the answer can be represented as [[A; (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨y)∧(¬p∨¬r)]] and noted to conform to the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF).\n\n- To denote this specific PCNF, the formula written in PCNF form is:\n  p ∨ r ∧ (¬q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ y ∨ ¬r). Here, \"y\" is the intermediate conjunct defined earlier and represents \"q ∨ r\". This is the stated PCNF for the given formula. The \"y\" term can be considered a part of the conjunct \"¬p ∨ y ∨ ¬r\", indicating an intermediate step in the pairing process.\n\nThis analysis concludes that the formula can indeed be denoted in its principal conjunctive normal form, as explained.

The specific number of iterations required to reach this conclusion depends on the complexity of the original CNF and the resolution steps applied. However, given the complexity of the initial CNF, it's likely that the algorithm would iterate through the steps outlined (initializing, certain steps of resolution, checking S2, and final output) once or twice at most to conclude that there's a plausibly satisfying assignment.

On the other hand, Student C's statement (E) is false because it incorrectly asserts that no students, specifically Li Cong among them, have learned typing.\n\n- **Relation: Between I propositions and O propositions** (Relation &): Student B's statement is an affirmative proposition (I) about some students who have learned typing, which when combined with Student C's negative proposition (O), forms a particular and universal relationship that is true because a subset of students (those who have learned typing) is included in the universal quantity (all students in Class A).\n\n- **Relation Between I propositions and E propositions** (Relation #): When comparing Student B's statement (I) and Student C's statement (E), we observe that both are separate and can coexist. Student B's statement that some students have learned typing while Student C's statement that some students have not learned typing is both true simultaneously: a subset of students in Class A has leveled up in typing skills, but there are others who haven't.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types can be structured as follows:\n\n- **Relation ***: Some students have learned typing (B) has a true connection to Li Cong having learned typing (C).\n- **Relation #**: Student B's true statement (A) contrasts with Student C's false statement (E).\n- **Relation &**: The specific truth of some students having learned typing (B) is combined with the broader truth that all students in Class A should have learned typing, highlighting their unanimous presence.\n- **Relation %**: While B and C each represent a true component of the complete truth (some students have learned typing), their combined relationship emphasizes that some students have not learned typing, making it a partially true statement within the universal context of Class A.\n\nTherefore, the logical relationship between the statements is complex and reflects the truths and fallacies inherent within them. Particular statements about subsets of a group (B and C) can stand in contrast and unison when considered against a wider, universal truth (the assertion that all students should have learned typing).

From this, it logically follows that there exists an object S for which ¬P is true.\n\n### Figure and Mood Analysis:\n\n1. **Figure I (Universal Affirmative):**\n   - Given the logical statement ∀P⇒¬M, it corresponds to the mood AAA, as it involves a universal affirmative (All P implies Not M).\n   - However, the second part ∃S⇒M does not fit with Figure I, as it involves the existential affirmative (There exists an S such that M), which corresponds to the mood AEE.\n   - Since the first part suits AAA and the second part AEE, there's a conflict in matching these directly with Figure I.\n\n2. **Figure II (Universal Negative):**\n   - The logical statement ∀P⇒¬M corresponds to the mood AII, as it involves a universal negative (All P is not M).\n   - The second part ∃S⇒M aligns with the mood EIO, as it involves an existential positive (There exists an S such that M), further contradicting the direct applicability of Figure II.\n\n3. **Figure III (Particular Affirmative):**\n   - The logical statement ∃S⇒M ⇒ ∃S⇒¬P suits the mood IAI, as it involves a particular affirmative (Some S implies M) and a particular negative (Some S implies ¬P), leading to a conclusion that contradicts the initial premise directly, as it implies both M and ¬M for some S.\n   - This contradiction to the initial premise aligns more closely with a logical conflict rather than precisely fitting.\n\n4. **Figure IV (Particular Negative):**\n   - The logical statement ∀P⇒¬M and ∃S⇒M lead to contradictions in attempting to align with any specific mood in Figure IV due to the direct implications mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical statements ∀P⇒¬M and ∃S⇒M ⇒ ∃S⇒¬P, the closest match would be Figure III and Mood IAI, but due to the contradictions involved with other parts of the argument, it's more correct to conclude that the argument does not align with any of the figures and moods provided. The argument presents a logical contradiction, as it implies both ¬M and M for all P, and then ¬P based on the existence of S, where M is true. This contradiction suggests that the argument provided cannot be correctly mapped to any of the given figures and moods of syllogism under the provided logical rules.\n\n**Note:** This analysis adheres strictly to the given rules and format, and while it identifies a contradiction in the argument's applicability to specific figures and moods, it does not address potential interpretational or conceptual issues that might stem from the argument itself. In the context of formal logic, the argument's validity always hinges on the correct interpretation of its premises and conclusion within the specified rules. This analysis serves to highlight the complexity in matching specific logical structures with arguments and the importance of careful consideration of logical principles.",

However, they can be related to the Time Propositions in a way that reflects their logical structure.\n\n- The first sentence, \"Old Li's health was good in the past,\" can be represented by the proposition \"Hp\" (using the symbol for the past).\n\n- The second sentence, \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good,\" can be represented by the proposition \"Ap\" (using the symbol for the past period).\n\n- The sentences do not fit neatly into the predefined relationships due to their different temporal settings, but they can be seen as negations of each other.\n\n- Since the sentences express opposite states of health at different points in the past, a more appropriate analysis would be to consider them as expressing \"Contradiction\" between a specific point in the past and a broader period in the past.\n\n- This contradiction can be represented under the \"No Both\" relationship (1), where \"Ap\" and \"H¬p\" satisfy this relationship.

The first sentence asserts a fact about Aunt Wang's past, while the second sentence refers to a decision or action that is abstractly independent from historical facts.\n\n- However, we can analyze them in the context of the Time Propositions to see how they might relate through negation and contradiction.\n\n- The proposition \"Ap\" (Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past) can be considered the negation of the proposition \"Gp\" (Aunt Wang won a major award in the future). Thus, they satisfy the \"No Both\" relationship (1).\n\n- Additionally, the sentence \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" can be considered in contrast to the sentence \"Allow the execution of contracts.\" It might be argued that allowing the execution of contracts does not logically contradict Aunt Wang's never having won a major award in the past.\n\n- Therefore, the relationship between (2) can be seen as primarily in the context of \"No Both\" relationship (1), with a secondary interpretation that the sentences imply two different actions or decisions.\n\n- This analysis suggests the relationship between (2) is also B.\n\nTherefore, the relationships are summarised as:\n\n- (1): B\n- (2): B\n\nThe answer is: [[B;B]].",

In this case, S is the use of Chinese hybrid rice, and P is the yield of rice. The observed data from the 1980 and 1981 trials clearly show a causal relationship between the use of Chinese hybrid rice and a significantly higher yield of rice, as the data from 1980 and 1981 show that the hybrid rice yield was much higher than the U.S. variety.\n\n2. **Method ؆:** This method suggests that when P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship.

This prediction, however, deviated from the actual observed behavior (S) of Uranus due to a yet unknown gravitational force (P).\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the theoretically calculated orbit and the observed one, scientists deduced the presence of another celestial body (Neptune) and confirmed its discovery by locating it at the predicted position via astronomical observations. This process aligns with the \"Method ⸮\" outlined in the instructions. It involves observing S and P together when other conditions (A, B, C, etc.) differ, which is what led scientists to infer the causal relationship between the gravitational force of Neptune and the observed orbit of Uranus.\n\nThis scenario corresponds to the \"Method ⸮\" because it involves using observed and predicted behaviors of one celestial body (Uranus) to identify a causal relationship with the gravitational force of a previously unknown body (Neptune).

This method involves comparing instances where S (in this case, the presence of textile factories with deep wells and high water usage) and P (subsidence of the city of Shanghai) occur together with other conditions differing, and in instances where S is absent while P is still observed.\n\nThe Shanghai Water Geology Team's investigation aligns with the Method ꙮ criteria because they observed that in several workplaces, the amount of ground subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles. This finding occurred under conditions different from those in other workplaces, suggesting a causal relationship between textile factories with certain characteristics and the subsidence of the city.\n\n1. The \"Positive group\" and \"Negative group\" observed in Method ꙮ allow for a direct comparison of circumstances. In the positive group, textile factories with deep wells and high water usage do indeed correlate with increased subsidence. Conversely, in the negative group, the absence of these characteristics (extreme cases of industrial activity, possibly lacking water wells, or not utilizing the volume of underground water observed in the positive group) does not correlate with the absence of ground subsidence, providing further evidence for causality.\n\n2. Moreover, the focus on \"other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc.,\" which differ, helps to rule out alternative explanations for the sinking. For instance, if other factors, such as differing geographical conditions or variations in workplace layout, were the primary drivers of subsidence, they should not consistently cluster around areas with textile factories.\n\n3. The additional information about the causal relationships between A (textile factories), X (deep wells), Y (underground water use), and Z (geographical conditions) further supports Method ꙮ.

This scenario directly aligns with this method since removing salivary glands results in faster wound healing, showing a clear effect of the intervention (the absence of salivary glands) on the outcome (wound healing speed).\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** involves comparing groups under different conditions and identifying a causal relationship. While this scenario does not directly fit this criteria, as there's a clear cause-and-effect relationship (removing salivary glands leading to faster wound healing), the method's principle of comparing groups under different conditions can be seen in the experimental setup where the two groups (with and without salivary glands) were created.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** focuses on the direct observation of cause-and-effect relationships, where changes in one variable correspond to changes in another. This scenario exemplifies this method perfectly, as the experiment directly shows a correlation between the presence of salivary glands and the healing speed of the wound: without salivary glands, the wound heals much faster, suggesting a direct causal relationship between salivary glands and wound healing.\n\n5. **Method ⚘** involves using known causal relationships to infer a new causal relationship.

This method is relevant in the context of Klaprozli's initial observation that the extracted substance from leachite was radioactive, indicating the potential presence of another radioactive element besides uranium.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method examines the effect (P, radioactivity) when the cause (S, the substance from leachite) is present and absent. It's not directly applicable to the described scenario because once uranium is present in the leachite, its absence doesn't negate the presence of other radioactive material.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: In this method, a positive group of instances where S (the substance from leachite) and P (radioactivity) occur together is presented, followed by a negative group where S is absent along with the absence of radioactivity under differing conditions. This method aligns perfectly with the scenario because the initial presence of leachite and the subsequent extraction of uranium and identification of new radioactive elements (radium and polonium) can be seen as a positive group, while the high radioactivity level in the remaining samples after uranium extraction can be considered a negative group. This pattern of positive instances followed by a negative counter-instance is a crucial aspect of the method ꙮ used to infer a causal relationship.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method focuses on changes in S (the substance) corresponding to changes in P (radioactivity), which is implicit in the observation that the radioactivity level of the remaining samples is significantly higher after uranium extraction. This method doesn't directly tie to the discovery of radium and polonium but is consistent with the overall causality implied by the substantial increase in radioactivity.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves a set of conditions and known causal relationships between various elements and properties (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.). While the Curie couple's discovery does involve established knowledge (uranium's radioactive properties and its interaction with other elements), the primary method of reasoning in this context is the combination of Method ꙮ and prior knowledge, as the method ⚘ typically involves a broader set of conditions and causal dependencies that are not explicitly stated in the provided passage.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent method for the causal derivation of the passage of the discourse is Method ꙮ.

Thus, the feathers of the crow at University B should be black, aligning with the given logic rule. Therefore, the attribute \"feathers are black\" is classified as a +Ψ attribute because it is added to the set of known attributes (a, b, c) specific to crows observed at University A.

GB Paradox\n\nThis situation exemplifies the GB (Galileo-Bayes) Paradox, which arises when the same observation leads to contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning. Here, the holomorphic hypothesis \"All swans are white\" (∀x(S(x) → W(x))) encounters a paradoxical scenario where seeing a white swan both corroborates the hypothesis and aligns with the inverse proposition (not seeing a swan that is not white, which also supports the hypothesis).\n\nThe core issue here is the application of two separate inductive reasoning patterns: one that supports the holomorphic hypothesis directly and another that validates the inverse proposition indirectly. Both paths lead to a contradiction without the need for further logical operations, specifically through the application of the rules outlined in the GB Paradox definition.\n\nIn the context of the given symbols, the premises of the logical operation setup reflect the following:\n\n- p: The observation of a white swan (or white object).\n- q_1: The hypothesis that all swans are white (∀x(S(x) → W(x))).\n- q_2: The inverse proposition, which implies that a non-swan cannot be white (¬S(x) → ¬W(x)).\n\nGiven these premises, the seemingly logical progression to a conclusion that both supports the holomorphic hypothesis and the inverse proposition are not without issues. The paradox lies in the inability to coherently resolve this apparent contradiction without invoking additional logical constraints or constraints on inductive reasoning processes.

This contradiction suggests that additional criteria or rules are needed to determine a reasonable hypothesis.\n\n**Symbolic Representation**:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) reflects the premise of the hypothesis.\n- R(a) ∧ B(a) indicates that both R(a) and B(a) are true at the moment of observation.\n- The equivalence condition establishes that ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)), highlighting the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the provided statement fits the criteria for the GB Paradox, and the answer is [A].

This situation requires a careful reevaluation of the premises and plausibility of all hypotheses involved, as the initial acceptance of these hypotheses cannot be automatically confirmed in the face of a contradiction. Here's why:\n\n- The initial acceptance of hypotheses {r_1, r_2, ..., r_n} based on the observations and evidence supports their plausibility. However, the emergence of hypothesis r_n+1 that contradicts the conjunction of the previous hypotheses presents a paradoxical scenario.\n  \n- Logically, when faced with a contradiction, it becomes necessary to reexamine the foundational premises and the criteria for the plausibility of hypotheses. This process involves:\n    - Reassessment of the evidence upon which the original hypotheses were accepted.\n    - Reevaluation of the criteria used to assess the plausibility of r_n+1 in relation to the existing set of hypotheses {r_1, r_2, ..., r_n}.\n    \n- The process of reevaluating these hypotheses requires a nuanced approach that considers:\n    - The coherence and consistency between r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, and r_n+1.\n    - The comparative plausibility of r_n+1 against the set of other hypotheses and the observed evidence.\n    - The possibility of misinterpretation or incomplete understanding of the observed phenomenon or the available evidence.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate response to this situation is to \"reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses,\" as it encompasses a thorough examination of the evidence and reasoning processes involved, allowing for a more robust and accurate understanding to emerge from the paradox.

Principle:**\nThe C! Principle addresses the use of lengthy or obfuscated expressions. Here, the guiding principle is that the meaning should be clear and not obscured for the hearer's comprehension. In this scenario, A's statement is clear and straightforward: \"I believe you are a college student,\" which is not obscure or lengthy, and B's subsequent affirmation of the same statement does not involve the use of lengthy or obscure expressions. Therefore, C! Principle does not apply in this case.\n\n**Given these evaluations,** the principle that most closely applies to the scenario is:\n\n**Answer: A.**\nThe C* Principle strictly aligns with the scenario, as it directly addresses the speaker's commitment to not making a stronger claim than justified by their knowledge. Although B's response does not strictly adhere to C% or C!, the scenario's focus is on the C* Principle's implications for the initial assertion made by speaker A.

Specifically, Xiao Ma is adhering to the Speaker's Criterion in this instance:\n\n- **Speaker's Criterion**: Xiao Ma does not let their statement (\"Beer is part of the food in the food box\") be weaker in information than their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement (e.g., \"Food and non-food items\" being mixed in the box) conflicts with the Information Principle, which requires communicating the truth as directly and concisely as possible.\n\n2. **C% Principle** focuses on minimalization and indicates that speakers should speak as little as possible to achieve communication's purpose fully.\n\n- This principle is less directly applicable to the scenario mentioned, as it primarily emphasizes minimizing words and speaking to the minimum extent necessary without a direct focus on interpreting the content. However, one could argue that Xiao Ma's action of notifying or discussing with someone that the beer is still warm (which, by common practice, is a concern or indication of how food should be handled) approximates the spirit of minimizing unnecessary communication without directly contradicting the principle.\n\n3. **C! Principle** emphasizes the use of clear, concise, and unambiguous expressions and discourages the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n\n- While Xiao Ma's actions (noting the warm beer) are clear and serve a communicative purpose, this principle is less directly applicable than the C* Principle. The C! Principle would typically concern itself with clarity of meaning, which in this scenario is already a concern with the rule itself, given the unique nature of the \"C*\" and \"C%\" Principles involving the interpretation of what is communicated versus what is known.\n\nTherefore, based on the application of these principles to the scenario:\n\n- The answer is [[A]] as the C* Principle is directly applicable to Xiao Ma's actions, especially in terms of providing information while adhering to the specified guidelines of speaking as directly and concisely as possible, without making a statement that is weaker in information than what their current knowledge allows.

In A's request, B provides an answer, albeit indirectly, which conforms to the Information Principle by giving clarity on the current status of the project. C also employs a metaphorical expression (\"essentially wrapped up\") that, while not directly stating that the project can be completed on time, implies a strong likelihood of success based on the work completed. Both A and C, by their responses, adhere to the C* Principle by striving to communicate in a manner that neither oversupplies information nor weakens the direct intention of the question.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle focuses on the minimization of speech and the listener's inference to expand information until fully understanding the speaker's intention. While A's question and B's response are conversational and don't directly align with the C% Principle's direct application, C's response indirectly embodies it by providing a more concise and optimistic outlook, without undue elaboration, hence minimizing expression while still providing sufficient context for the listener to understand the intended meaning.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle discourages the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions unless justified. In this scenario, both A and B's responses are succinct and directly related to the main issue at hand, making them both aligned with the C!

Principles through its optimistic outlook, concise expression, and adherence to clear communication.\n\nThus, the options closest to the actual alignment are B and C, with A also having partial alignment with the C* Principle due to B's indirect adherence to the Information Principle.

In this case, the mother makes a claim about being the baby's mother based on her direct relationship and knowledge of the baby's parentage. This act respects the principle that statements should not be weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge allows, unless stronger statements are in conflict.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: The C% Principle, with its \"Minimalization Criterion,\" aligns with the concept of using language efficiently and only when necessary for effective communication. In picking up the baby, the mother minimizes her actions (verbal and physical) to communicate her intention effectively, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on speaking as little as possible to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Lastly, the C! Principle, where it advises against the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason, can be linked to the situation. The mother, upon picking up the baby, does not use a lengthy or marked expression to indicate her intentions or identity. Instead, she opts for a simple, direct action, which adheres to the principle's guideline of avoiding lengthy expressions.\n\nHence, considering the provided scenario, the situation best aligns with the [[C* Principle / C% Principle / C!

Let's examine how each principle aligns with the scenario:\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle focuses on the criterion of what the speaker says and how the hearer infers from the speech. In the scenario, Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse, which traditionally implies a female nurse due to the gendered nature of the interaction. Thus, the speaker's criterion that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" is satisfied because the connection between giving flowers and a female nurse is the norm, which minimizes the risk of being weaker in information. The hearer's inference (CQ1) is applicable here, as it correctly infers that the speaker knows the context implies giving flowers to a female due to the normative expectations of the situation.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle is about minimizing the use of language and the interpretation of sentences based on conventional conventions. In the scenario, Xiao Wang giving flowers to a nurse adheres to conventional norms, where the recipient is expected to be a female due to the gender of the act. This principle guides the hearer to understand that if Xiao Wang speaks of giving flowers to a nurse without explicitly mentioning the gender, it is expected to be inferred that the nurse is female. The hearer's inference (CI2) aligns with this, where it acknowledges that the speaker's aim to \"speak as little as possible\" while the hearer aims to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle emphasizes clarity and the use of language. Here, Xiao Wang's action of giving flowers to a nurse, understanding that the listener infers the gender of the nurse based on conventional norms, aligns with the principle's emphasis on clear expression. The principle's guideline against using lengthy or obscure expressions would not apply, as the scenario straightforwardly conveys the action of giving flowers to a nurse, which is a clear and common expression.\n\nTherefore, the scenario primarily conforms to the C* and C% principles, with a minimal alignment to the C! principle. The most fitting answer is [[A/C/A]]. \n\nThe C* Principle is particularly relevant because it deals with the speaker's knowledge and the hearer's inference based on contextual knowledge and the expectations of the situation (in this case, the gender of the nurse), while the C% Principle focuses on minimizing the use of language to ensure effective communication within the context of the situation. The C! Principle aligns more broadly with the principle that encourages clear and direct communication, which is a shared goal for both the speaker and the hearer.

If the presence of marine fossils is evidence of an oceanic formation in the past, and those conditions are typical of past oceanic regions, then the Himalayas were once an oceanic region.\n\n2. **Indirect Argumentation Methods**: The argument also uses a broader concept related to the Contra- Method (since it refutes the contrary proposition):\n\n- The argument begins by negating the contrary proposition—that the Himalayas were never submerged by an ocean. By pointing out the clear evidence of marine life fossils, it directly counters the contrary position, thus eliminating it as a possibility.\n\nGiven these details, while the primary method used is Syl+ (Syllogistic Reasoning), the indirect argumentation from the Contra- Method brings an additional layer of reasoning to support the original proposition's truth. Therefore, the answer is B (Syl+ Method) with an indirect confirmation via the Contra- Method, although this secondary aspect does not change the primary method of argumentation.\n\nThe Argumentation Methods B (Syl+ Method) and D (Case+ Method) might be relevant for context but are not the primary methods used in the argument provided.

Thus, the Incorrect Negation Method is the appropriate formal fallacy in this context.\n\nTo further elaborate, let's break down how the Incorrect Negation Method applies:\n\n1. **Original Statement (P → Q):** If an employee completes a project, they will receive a bonus.\n2. **Employee's Misunderstanding (¬P → Q):** If an employee does not receive a bonus, they must have completed the project.\n3. **Logical Fallacy:** This misunderstanding contradicts the original statement (P → Q) by incorrectly assuming that the completion of a project is a necessary condition for receiving a bonus. The fallacy lies in the incorrect relationship between the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q), thus illustrating the Incorrect Negation Method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
