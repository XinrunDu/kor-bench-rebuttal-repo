We need to pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. The padded plaintext is \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n**2. Block Splitting:** \nThe padded plaintext is divided into 1 block of 8 bytes: [\"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\"].\n\n**3. Block Encryption:**\nFor the block \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\", we perform the following operations:\n\n- **Convert Block to Bytes:** \nThe ASCII encoding of the block is: [0x4E, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\n- **XOR with Key:** \nApplying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key, we get: [0x4E ^ 0x12, 0x00 ^ 0x34, 0x00 ^ 0x56, 0x00 ^ 0x78, 0x00 ^ 0x90, 0x00 ^ 0xAB, 0x00 ^ 0xCD, 0x00 ^ 0xEF].\n\n- **Substitute:** \nUsing the S_BOX Replacement Box, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte: [0x4E -> 0x0A, 0x12 -> 0x01, 0x34 -> 0x0D, 0x56 -> 0x05, 0x78 -> 0x0F, 0x90 -> 0x09, 0xAB -> 0x0B, 0xCD -> 0x0C, 0xEF -> 0x08].\n\n- **Permute:** \nPerforming a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit, we get: [0x10, 0x02, 0x1A, 0x0C, 0x1F, 0x18, 0x17, 0x04].\n\n- **XOR with Key:** \nApplying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key, we get: [0x10 ^ 0x12, 0x02 ^ 0x34, 0x1A ^ 0x56, 0x0C ^ 0x78, 0x1F ^ 0x90, 0x18 ^ 0xAB, 0x17 ^ 0xCD, 0x04 ^ 0xEF].\n\n**4. Hexadecimal Encoding:** \nThe encrypted byte block is converted to a hexadecimal string: \"1A3E5C7F2D468B9C\".\n\n**5. Concatenate:** \nSince there is only one block, the final ciphertext is \"1A3E5C7F2D468B9C\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer is: [[1A3E5C7F2D468B9C]].",
