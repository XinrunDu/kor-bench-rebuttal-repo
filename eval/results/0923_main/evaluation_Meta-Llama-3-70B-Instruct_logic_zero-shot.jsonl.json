In the given scenario, Manager M announces \"All employees (E) will receive a bonus (B) after completing a project (P),\" which can be represented as \"If P, then B\" (If an employee completes a project, then they will receive a bonus). However, Employee A misunderstands this statement, thinking \"If B, then P\" (If an employee receives a bonus, then they have completed a project), which is an invalid conclusion. This is a classic example of the CondSwap Method, where the antecedent and consequent of the conditional statement are erroneously swapped.",
