Since 14 is not a multiple of X (we don't know the value of X yet), and X is not a multiple of 14, the operation rule dictates that X※14 = 24.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X. We know that X※14 = 24, so we can substitute X※14 with 24 in the original equation: 25※X※14 = 25※24 = 4.\n\nSince 25 is not a multiple of 24, and 24 is not a multiple of 25, the operation rule dictates that 25※24 = 24.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4. Therefore, we need to re-examine our previous assumptions.\n\nLet's consider the case where X is a multiple of 14. The multiples of 14 are 14, 28, 42, ... . If X = 14, then X※14 = 14/14 + 2 = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X = 25※3. Since 3 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 3, the operation rule dictates that 25※3 = 24.\n\nHowever, this again contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nLet's consider the case where 14 is a multiple of X. The divisors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. If X = 7, then X※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X = 25※7. Since 7 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 7, the operation rule dictates that 25※7 = 24.\n\nHowever, this again contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nLet's consider the case where X = 1 or X = 2.

Now, we need to find X. \n\nSince 7 is not a multiple of X (X is unknown), and X is not a multiple of 7 (X is unknown), we apply the rule: 7 ※ X = 24.\n\nBut wait, the equation states 7 ※ X = 4, not 24. This means that 7 ※ X = 24 is not applicable here. \n\nLet's re-examine the equation: 7 ※ X = 4.\n\nSince 7 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 7, the rule doesn't provide a direct solution. However, we can deduce that X must be a multiple of 7, because if it weren't, the rule would dictate 7 ※ X = 24, which contradicts the given equation.\n\nSo, X must be a multiple of 7.
