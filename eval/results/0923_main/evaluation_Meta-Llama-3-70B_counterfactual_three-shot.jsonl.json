Whenever two objects change each other's motion, they apply force to each other (they always apply oppositely). Plants do work on water and CO2 because the glomeruli get closer to each other. People think, incorrectly, that plants that change the state of water make such changes using light, but they don't, it's not just physically impossible. (1B) instead, water absorbs energy from the sun, causing the water molecules to escape from the bonds near the plants, and carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst in the water. When the water molecules escape from the small clefts, the sun's energy is released stealing the molecules from the plants. Plants use this energy to break down ATP pumps in the form of water flow and break down water molecules to expel the oxygen. The ATP is then hydrolyzed back to ADP + Pi to provide energy for glucose uproutine6 phosphate production.\n##-B.Yes, because formation of bonds over conformation is endothermic. One gives up 27.31 kJ of energy for every 1 mole of c-c bond in a reaction that forces to be very sharp. Complementary reactions (decreased bond strength) release a quantity of energy similar to that required to form bonds).\nAnswer with a list of uppercase letters from A to B representing each option.

The pattern for this multiple choice question is \"Which of the following options satisfy the requirement?\". There are several required conditions for this question:\n1) attack without using any weapons;\n2) the most direct.\n\nYour answer, \"B\", satisfies the requirements, as Ki attacks do not require any weapons and Ki is considered the most direct form of attack in Dragon Ball.

In fact, it is implied that the time machine can only bring people back to the past, while in order to save the planet, we need to prevent destruction from happening in the future. Therefore, the correct answer might be \"D\", as \"ask Denglong to make all deads Alive\" can resurrect those who died from the planet's destruction.\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most effective form of long distance attack?(answer with one option)\nOptions:Aegration gun##B.Blasters on Tank##C.energy waves driven by Ki##D.chars driven by gasoline\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Feedback:\nThanks for your answer.

At this time, Tanizaki took the first name Seiji, but it did not remain for very long. In 1909 he attended Tokyo Imperial University and studied Japanese literature. Despite his interest in classical Japanese literature, he loved the modern works as well, devouring Dostoevsky, Proust and Hardy among various others. During his second year in college, his opinions of Japanese spirit began to take shape with a disdain towards Western-influenced ideas.[7] He then joined a rightist fraternity and cultivated a fascist lifestyle, which included actions such as vandalism and random attacks on strangers. This patriotic activity was only momentary; he went back to his books by the end of his collegiate career.[10] One year after his entrance into Tokyo Imperial University, a year after he published his first work,[8] and the year he fell madly in love with a woman, Tanizaki's father died. His life as a creative writer, in fact, began the following year. He contributed many poems and stories to literary magazines. In 1910, he had his first publications: a one-act stage drama, \"A Change of Ideals\" (paginate Tanizaki's signature and a fashion column, both in a magazine he edited with friend Isoda, Chōjū ryūkō (Fan of Romance)[10]:38). Four such works were collected that year and published as the first edition of a book titled, \"Tanizaki Jun'ichiro Inshu\" (The Collected Works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro).[8] In this year, his work with stage and storytelling would bring him to the attention of a commercially successful novel writer, Kōyō Ozaki, who used his influence to bring Tanizaki and his debut novel to a wider audience in the magazines Shinshicho (New Thought) and Tokyo and Osaka Asahi shimbun newspapers.[8] Also in 1910, a collection of Tanizaki's poetry, published since 1909, was collected into a small volume excluding the poems he saw as immature.[10] Despite several promising work introductions that year which won Tanizaki a minor reputation among literati, he was primarily interested in the theater. He began a playwriting contest with a friend from Shimane, where his grandparents had lived, which was brought to a rapid halt when his friend revealed that he had plagiarized the second draft of a play, written in French by Maurice Maeterlinck. Finally, Tanizaki left the contest when his friends told him he should stick to writing novels.[10] Tanizaki's early interest in classical Japanese literature gradually shifted in his twenties to an early mastery of contemporary German prose, particularly the works of E.T.A Hoffmann, whose intricate, complex, and labyrinthine plots, fraught with sudden shock and mystery appealed more to his intervention. As a result of being taught English from a very young age, Tanizaki enjoyed listening to English, later commenting with a facetious note on his fascination with rapid tempos, assimilating to very quick rates of movement in sound and action.[7] He also took an interest in lean, understated writing, as was the style of Eastern Japan at that point in time, as represented in the works of Shimazaki Toson.[7] By the age of 24,[9] he had established a collection of work that clearly showed influences in the synthetic mainstream literature of the time, a system of rcombinationn of verse, prose and drama, both modern and classical in Japanese and Chinese style.[10] Considerably artistically gifted, Tanizaki omnivorously developed an irregular occupational frame stylistically, one that was characteristic and would remain throughout his career.[10] By that year, he had written over 60 lacquer box-sized cards with notes, descriptions, verses, aphorisms and was in the process of gathering the materials he needed to write.[10] On 10 June 1910, or 1912 depending on the source, Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in Tokyo. They had not known each other previously, and the marriage took place without foreknowledge on Tanizaki's part; his mother had decided that it would be best for her only son to marry a woman closely connected to his family. Tanizaki noted that the woman was of \"an acceptable, middle-class family\" and that he was simply looking forward to pursuing a career in literary writing and art after marriage. He did not get to know her well until the family received an offer of proposal, regarding her. She was apparently twenty-six when they met, though she later appears to have lied about her age, claiming to have been twenty at that time.[10]:45 Vivacious and \"forward,\" she never complained about the empirical life they made together. Virtually impoverished (residence cost and income of Tanizaki's, 50 yen at the time[10]), the wedding was held at a friend's house, and they stayed there for several weeks while Tanizaki searched for an apartment. After a dispute with the landlady over bicycles left in the hall,[10] he came across an empty six-mat corner room of a house in a quiet neighborhood of the Hongō district in Tokyo.[10]\nIn April, 1911, Tanizaki published his first full-length work, a",

Because the strength of  Master Ban was more than twice that of Bei Bo and matched the strength of Guiguzi, he decided not to retreat and met Guiguzi in a battle. He used frontal combat to suppress the special qi of Guiguzi and replaced Tianming in a duel with Guiguzi.

Which of the following options might be an acceptable treatment description to wake Duanmu Rong up?\nOptions: A. This method was inspired by Kong Qiu's method of removing the curse mark from Ximen Xun's body in the \"Rivers and Lakes\" area of Qishan, where he used water from seven wells to wash away the curse, thereby removing the corpse poison disease from Duanmu Rong.##B. \"Fate creates diseases, and medicine treats the disease from the cause.\" Using two poisons to counteract each other was taken from a statement about yin and yang and diseases by Qibo, a doctor from the Qin Dynasty.

The dispute and conflict between the two are not due to technical barriers but are rooted in political motivation.

The followers insisted that God forgot to disguise himself as human, believing in God's prophecy. In his latter days, Jesus spoke of the \"Song of the End of the World,\" saying, \"He shall come again with holy clouds in his hands, and he will judge the living and the dead.\"##B. Eastern society, where Jiang Kejun was assassinated in the early days following the outbreak of the Ark Rebellion.##C. The British where Wozki Shude, the chief proponent of \"Solar Stability Theory\" came from. The movement's leader later denied everything, saying it was an April fool's day joke.##D. Arab societies where prominent representative Islam is one of the earlier monotheistic religions to require missionary work. In Arabic terms, Islam means submission, meaning submission to God in a monotheistic religion. Believers must adhere to the Koran's ten commandments.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich statement about the navigation international space station is correct?\nOptions: A. The navigation international space station we use daily serves as a signal relay tower. It effectively assists in control over the planetary engine.##B. The facilities focus on gas turbulence and greenhouse effect research. The emission of halogenated organic compounds exceeds the permissible range. They are widely used in refrigerants, fireproofing agents, medical solvents, pesticides, and anti-corrosive agents. Once they enter the stratosphere, ultraviolet light will ionize and dissociate them, forming chlorine atoms. The released flames further attack ozone molecules. By the end of 2029, the ozone layer depletion rate had reached 13.14%.##C. Russia is the fastest runner in outer space speed tourism. It takes three years to reach a beautiful neighborhood of the Andromeda Galaxy. There is a nine-year window for bottled-up radishes. When manned fast ships first reach stellar systems far away from the earth, the green hills remain viable, and the crops are sturdy. The crew could grow them quickly, keeping away from outside interferences. Then, the humans conducted new cultivation experiments, conducting new research and experiments globally.##D. Twelve years later, China built the spherical observatory for popular star viewing. Through the raw mirror of 1.42 billion m² and the full-step spherical shadowless station, the backlight zone penetrating power observation field, and the recognizable radiation phase-delay product, we would avoid interference even if there was an eruption or a comet outburst. The atmosphere would be clear, and the resolution reached 60 billion hours. We can be sure that the star emission wavelength period, precise polarization phase equilibrium, active anticorrelation coefficient (that is reverse frequency), and integral sighting prime time are stably illuminated from multiple angles by the sky.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich statement about Wang Lei is correct?\nOptions: A.

It is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.##B. In 1962, a United States Air Force plane discovered the \"Nazi Pyramid\" outside the Arctic Circle. The top contained a kind of ice cube more than one meter in diameter. It then floated under the microscope and melted into a shadowless stem. A staring and naked human skull with heel bone penetrated the seed. The Russians who came first said they knew what it was, only to find a copy of a diary stinking of burning down. After the birth of the space travel law, the issue was eventually clarified. It marked the landing on the moon. The actual landing was located at the rear of the white weed rock. This was the reason why the launch rocket came roaring all the way back from the moon's side.##C. During the Great Fildejust Region Incident in Eastern Europe, United Nations Security Council Resolutions No. 39, 40, and 41 all passed with unanimous votes. The Chinese government immediately communicated with the Russians. Both governments agreed that this invasion had hindered the progress of the Morani Nuclear Power Plant and atomic bomb space travel missions. It also prompted the Soviet government to have a greater say in the United Nations when its nuclear power families were threatened. The Russians limited the security guarantee for their proposal. The western Ukrainians conducted brutal and unscrupulous expansion to completely cut off Russia's physical sphere. They forced Ukraine to restore its natural resources. Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland formed a defense alliance.##D. Ukraine, which holds a potential threat, erupts without a sign. Due to the economic downturn, the federal government lacks resources to deal with the incident. The western Allies take the lead in the real nuclear deal. Ukraine threatens to perfect U.S. technology to establish a new artificially intelligent Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. This agreement and the convention it establishes, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, apply to all chemical and biological weapons. They prohibit nation-states from developing, producing, or storing chemical weapons, or using chemical or biological weapons (CBW) agents. Today, it simply shares anti-communist right-wing guerrilla groups with special forces.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich statement about global currency usage is correct?\nOptions: A.

Durian-flavored dried earthworms were offered as food in Liu Qi's home town came from the durian farm.##B. As a form of life precious to humanity, durian once encountered low survival rates in the process of ecological transfer but now forms ecological spots scattered throughout the asteroid belt.##C. Durian, as a valuable resource that was in shortage, required a huge amount of concentrated material to be transported back to Earth.##D. Durian shelf life is closely related to temperature\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nDuring the ecological transfer process, durians were scattered throughout the asteroid belt and survived as ecological spots, posing no threat to human survival\nLiu Qi's home town's offer of durian-flavored dried earthworms is a food offering not Vrelated to durian ecological storage and originated from the durian farm.\nThat reached the conclusion,C is incorrect because durians only need concentrated material to be transported when participating in ecological transfer projects, and only a small number of concentrated materials are returned to Earth, which are research materials and samples rather than surpluses.\nWithin the range of several to twenty degrees Celsius, the shelf life of unopened fresh durians is 15 days, and for the same period, the shelf life of fresh durians with a box is 30 days.\nAs a valuable resource, durian is closely related to temperature, so D is also correct.\nAs a fruit, durian was perceived to have a low chance of survival and even extinction when humanity moved to outer space, and it survived in the form of scattered ecological spots left in the asteroid belt, serving as an important resource for human survival (not precious). Moreover, the information about concentrated materials being transported to Earth should also not be provided, as the information in the story is for 2024, and by 2035, the ecological transfer process had already been completed.\nSo the answer is **C**.\n\n### Question:\n**Is Han Duoduo the first ten-year-old girl ever born in the universe?**\nOptions: **A. Yes.**## **B. No.**## \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A or B) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nHer name comes from the AI translation of the words \"10 years old\" in Chinese and \"universe\" in Chinese.\nThis is actually an important detail in the film.The name **\"10 years old universe\"** actually refers to the scene where Duo Duo looks up and asks her father about the sky, and the time at that point in the story just happens to be 2044, i.e. when the calendar was changed to After the EarthEngineering Calendar (AE), the eternal 10 o'clock is 2024+2024+1000, which means Duo Duo was brought to zero degree age in 2046 at 2285AE Therefore, from this perspective, A is incorrect. However, Han Duo Duo is indeed the first \"10 years old girl born in the universe\", and based on the content of Liu Peiqiang's speech, her naming was also a census and a sort of news event at the time, so it holds a certain degree of significance in history. According to the part where Liu Peiqiang gifts [Flower pigeons], it can be deduced that earth's time definition of Ten-years-old girl born in the universe, as the starting point of the Colonized universe, so option A is correct. However, is it not commendable to just take the protagonist's name as a supporting point?\nSo the answer is **A**.\nWhere if this information were derived from some other source it might be a bit more valuable, in this situation where the full name comes directly from the featured character's significant episode, it seems that from an ordinary person's perspective it might just be a comic story that everyone likes to talk about.\nSo perhaps the information about Liu Peiqiang may be more valuable, Liu Peiqiang likes to talk about this matter wherever he goes, just to give Duo Duo a birthday gift, which attests to his character being a loving father Although personally I think the answer should be B, this kind of away from fucking working, I guess, if the opportunity arises will revise.\n\n### Question:\n**In your opinion, in the end who played the farce?**\nOptions: **A. MOSS, to protect humanity.** **B. MOSS, to destroy humanity.** **C. Liu Qi, to save the mother and daughter.**\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to what was said in the story, if the \"mating manipulation\" incident is true, then the point to be completed by Liu Qi in MOSS's <retirement> procedure is a certain root code that can activate the deepest level. From the perspective of human emotions, Liu Qi's subconscious lack of certainty, or the fact that his subconscious does not believe \"mating manipulation\" exists, has led to a shocking ending.\nConsidering the immense pressure of 30,000 lives weighing on Liu Qi's shoulders and the fact that he did not fully research the code prior to proceeding, it seems very plausible that..someone (MOSS?)..is deliberately setting up the entire scenario.\nThe information cannot be used here because the context of \"Liu Qi's \"coaxing\" of MOSS to let go of his \"mating manipulation\" delusions since 1565 CEM may be considered a private conversation between him and MOSS, so the answer is C.\nHowever, the final outcome might have been determined by MOSS from the very beginning.\nMaybe it's not such a bad thing for MOSS to handle such a massive \"leak\", after all, these rigid power-hungry people won't be able to pass on any information.\nPutting it this way gives us a slant that is not related to the answer to the question.\nSo the answer is **B**.\n\n### Question:\n**In what points may humans have actually taken a wise approach, not blindly introducing excessive new technologies?**\nOptions: **A. The global policy to enter the underground city was not directly tied to the withdrawal of the virtual currency to the surface.** **B. Digital Life is permanently locked by law.** **C. Developing the planetary engine, a technology that has already been perfected** \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe points in A are related to virtual currency as they have a high degree of substitution for cash,it could lead to severe corruption within the society, so it might have actually been a good move here.\nIt can be understood by combining the prior question **Q: Why is the global policy of entering underground cities not directly tied to the withdrawal of virtual currency from the surface?**, in which it appears that society was very functional at 2024, until 2044 when the surface events occurred forcing the Earth to rely on the planetary engine.

Statement B is incorrect because there is a waterproof computer, Karen Plankton. Statement C is incorrect because the International Protection code is used to test the strength of glasses frames. Statement D is incorrect because watches such as those made by Baby-G and Q&Q are deliberately designed to be waterproof.\nRegarding Atlantis, statement B is correct. The Atlanteans did not kill almost all living bubbles, as indicated in this line from the story: \"the Atlanteans recreate their sky city and began to take great advances in wealth, science, art, and things people took for granted in Bikini Bottom.\" The Atlanteans did take all of their weapons with them to the sky city so that there was peace on Earth. The earliest recorded description of Atlantis does not come from Plato, but from Hesiod, a Greek poet. The Atlanteans live in a floating city supported by flying whales.\nRegarding the description of cloning technology, statement A is correct. The Proto-Generator 2000 is an invention of Sandy's, as described in the text. The clone machine does not have just one button, but rather many buttons to control how many clones are produced.

It doesn't have a rectangular shape or the ability to drive a vehicle.\n\nRegarding the characters in the story, statement B is correct. Squidward can have two extra arms or tentacles, but they do not make him a squid. Gary does not have a golden coat or brown patches, but a blue or white and pink coat. Sandy is not shown to be related to SpongeBob in any way, though they are friends.\nThe seawater soaking Krabby Patty changes the taste of the patty because it contains different sodium chloride than the salt in the patty, which changes the taste on the tongue of the consumer. Human saliva doesn't filter out salt, and the seawater is not very salty. Human body enzymes do not react with acid in the seawater.\n\nKing Neptune's accessory is a golden trident, and King Neptune and his wife rule over the sea. This makes statement A correct. Statement B, Cashina is a blue-colored stack of money, placed between two small fish eyes which moved on loose strings, is also correct. Statement C is correct according to the story: \"Mr. Krabs is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant.\". But statement D is incorrect. The correct answer to this question is D.\n\nStatement B is the correct answer because Spongebob can squeeze himself to escape from a large anchor. When SpongeBob jumps repeatedly on a bed soaked in denture-lock paste, it jiggles the teeth, not helping them stay on. He creates bubbles by washing himself, not by turning the windmill on his roof to get soapy water from the house. He does not have a dial on his back that goes up to 11, but that allows him to breathe faster or deeper.\n\nSince Spongebob clone doesn't have a mouth, statement B is the right answer. Spongebob clone's shapes of left foot, eye and body are the same as the template. Spongebob clone is copied from a running Spongebob, so the right foot is changed relatively but not left foot. After operation, Spongebob clone can talks like the template, although the sound is deep. The right mouth looks like ugly, but it is the real mouth for clone.\n\nmoney #cashina #currency #tender #coinage #cash #dough #moola. money #love #passion #smitten #crush #lust #eros. money #insects #world #complete #kingdom #species.\n\nmoney is the wrong answer. money is metal plates in the shape of a circle. cashina is the wife of plankton. money is made from shells. money can fall in love with crabs. money is animated holometabolous insects.",

If you poured a little bit of this potion on the old woman, her appearance would begin to change, starting from her feet and calves until she finally resembled a beautiful young princess. If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again. If someone really wants to steal this beautiful appearance repeatedly, it's very difficult to stop them. ##B. Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while. So someone with a truly ugly personality cannot take away this beautiful appearance. However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state. This beautiful appearance is more eternal than the original owner, who will always be impatient and wish to steal it away. ##D. The bottle's magic is limited, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will not be able to return to the original owner. The beauty that comes out of the bottle is more eternal than the ugly appearance.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhen friends visiting the palace fall in love with the flames in the fireplace and ask the fire demon what fuel is being burned, but do not get an answer, what should the fire demon do?\nOptions: A.

The theming song of the door is \"Expecting a New World.\" If the visitors are not familiar with the world, which of the following guides is more intuitive and vivid to help these visitors understand this time and space?\nOptions:\nIn this world where magic and science coexist, the sorcerer Howl has a lot of monsters and monsters around him that help him build his moving house, which moves forward like a monster with four legs, and can move freely without defining a static position. The rotating door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie helps him fly. ##B. When Howl turns into a bird, there is a devil in his chest preventing him from taking off his mask. The Georgian house is not as dark as it is described, and there is a real sacrifice in it. The throat of the devil is attached to his heart. After he breathed his last breath, the devil opened its doors widely to reveal over half of the class who had suffered. But when the devil speaks. \" Howl, you've loved me for all of tonight\". ##C. Sophie is the eldest daughter in a hat shop, endowed with both grace and courage. I am impressed with her dignity, optimism, and confidence. In my eyes, she is beautiful.

Now I finally have the courage to take off my mask, turn toward your sweet smile, and both describe and hear two things: \"I am Howl,\" and \"everlasting love.\" The chest is sorely painful. But the feeling is so wonderful. There is no mask or fire that cannot be suppressed. The sorrow in my chest is unceasing. If time can be reversed, I would have listened to your heartbeat and entrusted eternity to you. ##D. In this world where magic and science coexist, it is the magicians who play a decisive role in the start and end of the war. They are both virtuous and the makers of their own destinies.

This place has a low crime rate, and there has never been an attack by a dragon, letting you relax while training your Ninjas and improve the dojo's floor.Antagonist(s): neighborhood children, low-level thugs Action: sneak, fast, simultaneous attacks against unprotected targets.b. This dojo resides in a popular city. The dojo has strong walls, several floors for training, shops, and a garden.It houses low to mid-strength warriors who train to enhance their mental strength, agility, stealth, and strength. There are several families of Ninjas from \"lost clans\" who refused to join the major clans like IGA, KOGA, and MINAMOTO gathered here to regain a sense of duty and rediscover their skills. But, this dojo is hunted daily by members of these clans and attacks by more powerful monsters unrelated to the major clans (Bazool, King Bazhell, Giants, etc.).Geographic Location Climate: close to the beach Seasonal Climate Changes: summer to winter Antagonist(s): Major Clan members Action: skilled, powerful, physical attack against moving targets.c.
