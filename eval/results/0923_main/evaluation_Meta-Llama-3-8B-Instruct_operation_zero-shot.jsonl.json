To solve for X, we can subtract 2 from both sides:\n\nX/14 = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 14, we get:\n\nX = 42\n\nSo X is indeed a multiple of 14. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[X = 42]]",

For 25 and X, we need to find whether 25 is a multiple of X, or vice versa.\n\nAs X is unknown, we cannot directly determine if 25 is a multiple of X or not. However, we can try to deduce this information based on the given result 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nIf 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X※14 = X/25 + 2. But this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a fraction. Therefore, 25 cannot be a multiple of X.\n\nSimilarly, if X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X※14 = 14/X + 2. Again, this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a large fraction. Hence, X cannot be a multiple of 25.\n\nThis leaves us with the case where 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25. In this case, the operation rule states that 25※X※14 = 24.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 25※X※14 = 24\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to make it more solvable:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\n1/([25※X※14]) = 1/24\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 24 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n[25※X※14] = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the operation rule again. Since 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n[25※X※14] = 24\n\n1 = 24\n\nThis is a contradictory equation.
