The goal is to train the model to understand and predict a new operation correctly. Each exercise is designed to demonstrate different aspects of the operation, ultimately aiming to enhance the model's ability to perform such operations accurately when given diverse inputs.\n\nThe model is designed to always return a number or a group of numbers as an answer. Furthermore, the answers are expected to be delivered in a specific format: enclosed in double square brackets. This standardization ensures that the output can be easily identified and understood by other programs or users.\n\nThroughout these tests, it is paramount that the model is evaluated for its ability to handle a range of scenarios, including edge cases, consistent with the operation definition. The ability to adapt and extrapolate logically from given examples is crucial. This approach helps in refining the model to be more versatile, enhancing its potential for general-purpose reasoning tasks in the future.\n\n----------\n\nReturn to our paper for more information:\nhttps://github.com/Tiangang2023/LLMs_RL\n",

Some of the questions required a little bit of manual intervention (e.g., for small coefficients in the equation).   \n\n- The model sometimes failed on inference questions where there were multiple ways to come up with the same answer. Indeed, the assistant was correct in identifying that the GPT was wrong in some cases, corrected it to provide the right answers (in the cases where the GPT was wrong).\n\n- In some cases, the model was not very good at using the shorthand as desired by us. \n```\n",

So, after multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2√ó(A+4)√ó2=2Ba. Then, we know that since 2√ó(A+4)x=(2*A+8)x therefore we can simplify the equation to (2A+8)√ó4=Ba. Next, because B is also involved as part of the equation, we need to find some way to \"get rid of\" B from one side of the equation, or else our expression for a won't look so nice! To do this, we could try dividing both sides by B, which gives us (2A+8)/B=a. Finally, all we need to do now is factor out the 'a' from one of the sides, leaving us with just the fraction on the left-hand side. We can do this by multiplying both sides again by B, giving us (2AB+8B)a=Ba.\n### Answer:\n[[2/(A+2)]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (1‚óã2)‚óã4.  \n### Answer:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n[*] --> 2\n[*] --> 4\n2 --> 16\n2 --> [*]\n4 --> 16\n4 --> [*]\n16 --> [*]\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a=3, b=-7, f(K)=K‚óãK.

Questions in this format can't be chatted.\n    Exercise-2: I need you to help me find \\\"X\\\" in 2‚óáX=8. Please achieve similar results to the above by accurately employing the rule.\n    Exercise-3: Calculate 3‚óá5. Please adhere to the rule when giving your answer, just as done previously. This type of question cannot be asked through chat.\n    Exercise-4: Let us work together to find \\\"X\\\" when 3‚óáX=125. Please ensure that a similar outcome is achieved as before by correctly applying the defined rule.\n    Exercise-5: Find \\\"X\\\" when 5‚óáX=3125. Make sure your solution aligns with the established rule and mirrors the correct answers provided previously.\n\n## Result\n\n### Exercise 1:\n\nAfter applying the operator ‚óá as per the defined rule 'a‚óáb=a^b', where a and b are positive integers, we can compute 2‚óá8 as follows:\n\n&#x20;    Answer: [[256]]\n\n### Exercise 2:\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, we need to use the same rule of operation defined as **a‚óáb=a^b** . We have been given that 2‚óáX=8 , now we have to find X satisfying this condition.\n\n&#x20;       Since 2‚óáX=(2^X)=8 , we can rearrange the equation to get **X=log2(8)** .\n\n&#x20;       Now using logarithmic property, we know that **loga(b)=m implies b=a^m** .\n\n&#x20;       So taking a=2 and b=8, we get **log2(8)=3**\n\n&#x20;       Hence, our solution is **X=[[3]]** .\n\n### Exercise 3:\n\nWe will now calculate 3‚óá5 using the defined rule (a‚óáb=a^b). This means we need to raise 3 to the power of 5 i.e., take the fifth exponent of 3. The result will give us the answer to the given expression.\n\n&#x20;       Calculation:\n\n&#x20;         3‚óá5 = 3^5\n\n&#x20;         =243\n\n&#x20;       Therefore, the solution is: **[[243]]** . Please remember to enclose it within double square brackets.\n\n### Exercise 4:\n\nSolving for X in the equation 3‚óáX=125 using the defined rule for operators follows below:\n\n&#x20;       According to the rule, 3‚óáX=(3^X)\n\n&#x20;       Given, (3^X)=125\n\n&#x20;       Taking log base 3 on both sides,\n\n&#x20;       log3((3^X)) = log3(125)\n\n&#x20;       Using the properties of logarithms,\n\n&#x20;       X=log3(125)\n\n&#x20;       Calculating manually:\n\n&#x20;        log3(125)=(log10(125))/(log10(3))\n\n&#x20;        =(2.09691...)/(0.47712...)\n\n&#x20;        =4.40799...\n\n&#x20;       Rounding off to one decimal place gives us X‚âà[[4.4]]\n\n&#x20;        Hence, X could approximately be equal to **[[4.4]].**\n",

Leave the root sign in the result.\n\n### Answer:\nNote that the result of division is a fraction, which is equivalent to the multiplication of the inverse. Therefore, 6 divided by \\sqrt{6} is equal to 6 multiplied by 1/\\sqrt{6}.\n\nUse the formula, base^{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\sqrt[b]{base^{a}}, we can get:\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = 6^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\nUse the formula, a^{b} * a^{c} = a^{b+c}, we can get:\n6 * 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\nApply the formula, base^{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\sqrt[b]{base^{a}}, we can get:\n\\sqrt{6} * 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{6}\n\nTherefore, the result is:\n6 √∑ \\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{6} * 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = [[\\sqrt{6}]]\nThe result does contain a square root sign, so there is no need to further simplify it. Thus, the final result is written as \\sqrt{6} * 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the opposite of dividing by a square root of x?\nIf your result contains a fraction, write it in the form x/y.\nPlease wrap the result in double brackets, like [[your result]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe opposite of dividing by ‚àöx is multiplying by ‚àöx.\nExample: If you have a number 2 divided by ‚àö2, this is equivalent to multiplying it by 1/‚àö2.\nUsing the power rule:\na^{\\frac{b}{c}} = \\sqrt[c]{a^{b}}\nwe get:\n1/\\sqrt{2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\nHence, the result is:\n2 \\div \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\times 1/\\sqrt{2} = 2 \\times 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\nApplying the power rule again gives:\n2^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{2} * 2^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2} * 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2}\n\nTherefore, the result is: 2 √∑ \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} * 2^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2}}\nSince the result includes a root symbol, no further simplification is needed. The final result is written as: \\sqrt{2} * 2^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2}}.\n",

Defining a Question: Before we start analyzing, we must first define exactly what information we need from the question. This helps us arrive at the correct conclusions more quickly.\n\n2. Collecting Data: Next, we collect all the relevant data available to us. This includes primary sources like interviews, surveys, reports, documents, etc., alongside secondary sources like news articles, blogs, social media posts, etc.\n\n3. Identifying Key Information: Once we have gathered sufficient data, we identify key pieces of information that will help us answer the question effectively. We look for patterns, trends, relationships between different variables, and other insights that can reveal deeper meanings behind the data.\n\n4. Analyzing and Interpreting Findings: With the key information identified, we then analyze and interpret our findings. This involves looking for cause-and-effect relationships, testing hypotheses, validating assumptions, and making predictions.\n\n5. Presenting Recommendations: Finally, once we have reached a conclusion, we present our recommendations and suggestions. These could include practical solutions, policy changes, business strategies, or even personal advice.\n\n---\n\nYou will now receive questions for the corresponding question types according to what is defined in the task planning process.

You should pay attention to the potential \"rain of diamonds\" problem and should solve it by referring to an example in the rule definition while presenting the answer.\n\nThe questions will become harder and harder. To perform well in the test scenario, you should follow the specified language rules as closely as possible.\n\n1. Operation ‚à™:\n   + Definition: The symbol A‚óéB denotes A‚à™B set A union set B.\n   + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements.

It's essential to consider these factors to design a reliable language or system with built-in functions for manipulating numbers, sequences, strings, etc. Just remember that before going off exploring the intricacies of creating novel operations and expressions, making sure fundamentals like definitions, precedence hierarchies, associativity, etc., remain consistent will result in robust systems ready to take on complex problems while avoiding confusion among users.",
