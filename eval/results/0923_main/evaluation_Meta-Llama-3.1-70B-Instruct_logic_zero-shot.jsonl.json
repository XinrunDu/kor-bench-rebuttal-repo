according to Basic Equivalence (10):\n```markdown\n(p>q) ::=:: !p | q\n(p>r) ::=:: !p | r\n```\nThen, using the conjunction (AND), we rewrite the left-hand side:\n```markdown\n((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n```\nUsing Basic Equivalence (5), we simplify it further to get the desired format:\n```markdown\n(!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: (!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r)\n```\nSimplifying using Basic Equivalences (2), (3), and removing duplicate `!p`, it becomes:\n```markdown\n(!p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n```\nNow we partially simplify the right side of the given equivalence using the rule `A > B ::=:: !A | B`:\n```markdown\n(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !p | q | r\n```\nBy understanding De Morgan's Law, we get:\n```markdown\n!(q&r) ::=:: !q | !r\n```\nBut applying De Morgan's Law and (thus resultant modification) to transformation on the (given) right side, gives:\n```markdown\n!(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !( !p | (q|r) ) \n(!p > (q|r)) becomes \n!( !p | q | r ) ::= (!(!p)) &

Resolve clauses in S0 and S1 (first iteration):\n    - Since S0 is empty, go to step 3.\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1 (first iteration):\n    - For clauses (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q), we can resolve them:\n        dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = p\n        Since neither S0 nor S1 contains 'p', add it to S2.\n    - For the remaining clauses, no further resolution is possible in this iteration.\n    - S2 = {(p)}\n\n4. Check S2 (first iteration):\n    - S2 is not empty, so we add S1 to S0 and set S1 to S2.\n    - S0 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (¬p ∨ r)}\n    - S1 = {(p)}\n    - Clear S2.\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1 (second iteration):\n    - For clause (p) in S1 and (¬p ∨ r) in S0, we can resolve them:\n        dispel((p), (¬p ∨ r)) = r\n        Since neither S0 nor S1 contains 'r', add it to S2.\n    - For clause (p) in S1 and other clauses in S0, no resolution is possible since they contain 'p', which is a complement to the clause in S1.\n    - S2 = {(r)}\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1 (second iteration):\n    - No further resolution is possible in this iteration since S1 contains only a single literal.\n\n4. Check S2 (second iteration):\n    - S2 is not empty, so we add S1 to S0 and set S1 to S2.\n    - S0 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (¬p ∨ r), (p)}\n    - S1 = {(r)}\n    - Clear S2.\n\nNow, we continue with steps 2-3 for the next iteration, but no further resolution is possible, and we don't get any new disjunctive clauses in S2. Thus, we terminate.\n\nFor the output of this problem, the resolution algorithm does not generate an empty disjunctive clause '0', which implies the conjunctive normal form (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r) is satisfiable.\n\nWe have iterated over 2 cycles.\n\n[[Plausible];[2]]",

The proposition \"Some young people are not early risers\" is a Particular Negative Proposition (O), which means we can treat it similarly to a Universal Negative Proposition (E) for obversion purposes. Using Method A for Universal Negative Proposition (E) conversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nHowever, Method C doesn't apply the same conversion as the example given for Particular Negative (O).

However, since neither `c1` nor `c2` affects the truth value of `φ`, we can consider `φ` as being true if it's true initially, regardless of the execution of `c1` and `c2`.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression.\nSince neither `c1` nor `c2` affects the truth value of `φ`, we don't need to consider their individual effects on `φ`. The Concurrent Rule simplifies to the consideration of `φ` being true or not, independent of the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. Thus, the focus shifts from the possibility operator `⟨ ⟩` to the necessity of `φ` being true in the initial state.\n\n## Step 4: Express the logical expression in the required format.\nThe Concurrent Rule's application in this context essentially leads to considering `φ` as a necessity before and after the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. However, given the rules provided and the instructions, the exact expression in the simplest form isn't directly derived through the Concurrent Rule alone but through understanding the effect of concurrent execution on an unaffected proposition. \n\nGiven the rules and the requirement for the format, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the rules to derive a `[]` expression based on the description. The Concurrent Rule is about possibility `⟨ ⟩`, not necessity `[]`. Thus, based on the instructions and the provided rules, we cannot directly write a `[]` expression as requested without misinterpreting the rule's application. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions as closely as possible and provide a formatted answer despite this mismatch:\n\nThe final answer is: [φ]",
