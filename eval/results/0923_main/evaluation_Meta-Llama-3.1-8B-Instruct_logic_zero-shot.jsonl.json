To determine its level, we need to identify the logical connectives and their compositions.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the formula into Level B formulas\nThe given formula can be broken down into two main components:\n1. (~(p1=::>~p2))\n2. ((p3||p4)=~p1)\n\nBoth of these components are Level C formulas, as they contain nested logical connectives. However, we can further simplify them by identifying their Level B subformulas.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the Level B subformulas\nWithin the first component, ~(p1=::>~p2) can be viewed as a single Level B formula with a \"not\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p1=::>~p2. \n\nWithin the second component, (p3||p4)=~p1 can also be viewed as a single Level B formula with an \"if and only if\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p3||p4 and ~p1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the composition of the Level C formula\nThe original formula combines these two Level C formulas with an \"and\" connective. Here, both components come from simplifying the composition of logical connectives on their respective subformulas.\n\n## Step 5: Classify the formula based on its structure\nSince the original formula contains more than one logical connective and at least one multi-level subformula (especially considering p1=::>~p2 which already contains several logical levels), it is clear that the formula's structure does not belong to a basic Level A or solitary Level B formula. Counting the fact that we actually have nested components whose structure exceeds a simple 2-level structure. \n\n## Step 6: Classify the level according to the number of nested logical connectives\nBased on this analysis, the level of the given formula can be calculated. Level A has 0, Level B has 1, Level C has at least 2.\n\nLevel C has been identified as the least level matching our criteria, we describe the formula, which has even a more complex structure: \nboth formula are connected by \"&\" to a larger formula.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final classification of the formula\nWhen we analyze the structure of the formula, we realize that its true complexity surpasses the initial calculation due to multiple nested connectives so that the simplified criterion applied here predicts the minimal Level matching the number of nesting inside such Level B structures inside full-powered Level C subformula.\n\nThe final answer is: [[Z]]",

        "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n✓|✓|✓,✓|✓|x,✓|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|✓,x|✓|✓\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t.",

Evaluate the subformula ~(p1=::>p2):\n    - The original subformula p1=::>p2 is true under all but one possible assignment (✓|x), corresponding to p1=::>p2 being false when p1 is true and p2 is false.

First, let's examine the first equivalence:\n\n   (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n\n   We can start by applying the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Using rule (14) and the definition of implication (A > B ::=:: !A | B), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n     ((!(p&q))|(p>r)) & (!(p&p)&(!(p&r)))\n   - Using rule (6) to distribute the negation with and, we get:\n     (!((p&q))&(p>r))&(!p|(!(p&r)))\n   - Then, from rule (1), we have:\n     (!p | !(q&r)) & (p > r)\n   - Now, applying rule (10) on both sides, we can simplify that to:\n     (!p | !q | !(r& q))&(!p|r)\n\n   - Next, applying rule (1) again:\n     !p | (!q | !(r & q)) & r\n2. Distributing again with rule 5, we have\n\n   - !p | !q | !(r&q) & r \n   - Now distributing the negation with & with rule 6, we have\n   !p | !q | !(r&q) | !r\n   - And rule 6 (equivalence and distribution of !):\n     !p | !q | ((!(r&q)) | !r) &&\n   - Applying rule 1 one more time to get the following, lets plug in the rules for NOR and NAND of rule (5):\n\n - !p |!(q&r) | !r | ((!(q&r)) & !(p|   r))\n   - Using 6 (replacing NAND with NOR) \n   !p| (q&r) | !r \n   - !p | (q&r) NOT equals the original expressions due to distribution-step.

But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1.

However, we will eliminate Figure II, because it must have ∃S⇒¬P or ∀S⇒¬P as its final premise. Hence, our argument must be figure IV.\n\nAdditionally, figure IV introduces ¬P where M is the middle term and uses ∀ (forall) mood. Since our argument involves ∃S in its premise, it corresponds to I (exists antecedent) mood, in the second premise. Thus, our mood is AEO (though it is the fourth valid mood of figure IV).

We need to apply the given logical rule to manipulate the M(); hence, putting SEM in the middle.\n\n### Logical Operations:\n\nLet's assume that SEM be SEM. But for abstraction (according to Slide one, we need SEM in abstract terms in order to categorize and fill accordingly. Thus putting SEM in abstract terms yields following formal term that conditionally comes under I 2 \n\n\nSEM = p1Oq2 and M =∃ p1 ⇔ ∀ q2 or M= ∃p1⇔∅q2 where φq1 symbolizes subsumption relating the terms out of subject term.\n\n\n\nUsing Rule  O-a yields the valid Sentences according to Slide two morphing with S∅ and being accordingly listed according to requirement of conditional

In this scenario, S is animals that have been injured and P is them hiding in quiet places and repeatedly licking their mouths with their heads. The conditions A, B, etc., are related to the animals being injured and having salivary glands that have been removed manually. However, since the removal of salivary glands is not the only condition that differs, Method ⸮ is not the best fit.\n\nMethod ؆:\nThis method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. In our scenario, when animals are injured (S) they exhibit both hiding in quiet places and licking their mouths (P). However, we do not have a case where animals are not injured (S' in the notation for method ؆) and P does not occur. Therefore, Method ؆ is also not a good fit.\n\nMethod ꙮ:\nThis method requires us to identify both positive and negative groups. Positive group: animals that have been injured and exhibit the conditions P, and negative group: where animals are not injured, but exhibit no condition P. In our experiment, animals with normal salivary glands exhibit the conditions P (hiding and licking), while animals with their salivary glands removed do not show the conditions P (P is absent). There is a group of animals with removed salivary glands where P is missing. However, it seems we are focusing on animals with intact versus absent glands.

In this scenario, S is the presence or absence of salivary glands, and P is the healing time of a wound. The presence or absence of salivary glands (S) directly corresponds to a change in healing time (P). When salivary glands are present, wounds heal faster (P1), but when salivary glands are removed (S2), wounds take longer to heal (P2).
