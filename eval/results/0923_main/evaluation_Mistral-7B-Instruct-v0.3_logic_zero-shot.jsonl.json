Using the priority of logical connectives, we first unpack the innermost negations: p1 and p2 or not p3. Since p3 is a single proposition, it is a Level A formula. The compound proposition (p1 and p2) is a Level B formula. The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and ✓|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false).

If ~p2 is true (✓), then the overall formula evaluates as true due to the \"if...then\" rule (p1=::>~p2).\n\nHowever, if p1 is false (x) and p1 is equal to its negation (~p1), then p1=::>~p1 evaluates as true. If ~p2 is false (x), then the overall formula evaluates as false due to the \"if...then\" rule (p1=::>~p2).\n\nSo, there are no false assignments for this formula, which means it is a Truth Formula.",

We can check this by providing different true/false assignments to the propositions p1, p2:\n   - If p1 is true and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is false (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to false, and & requires both operands to be true to produce true).\n   - If p1 is false and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is true (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to true, and & requires only one operand to be true to produce true).\n   - There are no assignments for which the formula would be always true or always false, making it neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\n2. The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is a Truth Formula if and only if the equations p1 = ~p1 & ~p2 and p3 = ~p1 & ~p2 hold true simultaneously. To find valid assignments, we need to consider all possible truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n   - If p1 is true, then ~p1 is false, and ~p1 & ~p2 can only evaluate to false if p2 is true. Thus, p3 must be false under this assignment, which does not satisfy the equation p3 = ~p1 & ~p2.\n   - If p1 is false, then ~p1 is true, and any assignment of p2 and p3 will not violate the equation. However, since ~p1 is true, the parentheses are not needed, and this formula simplifies to the self-equivalent formula p2, which is not a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is [A];[B], where:\n- (1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n- (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.",

Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible.
