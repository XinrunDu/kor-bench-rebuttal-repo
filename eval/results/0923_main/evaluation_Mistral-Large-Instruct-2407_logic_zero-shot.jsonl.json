By applying equivalence (6): !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B and (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A:\n\n   p ::=:: (p & q) | (p & !q)\n\n2. According to the distributive property in (5): A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C):\n\n   p ::=:: p & (q | !q)\n\n3. Using the equivalences (8): A | !A ::=:: 1:\n\n   q | !q ::=:: 1\n\n4. Therefore, substituting back:\n\n   p ::=:: p & 1\n\n5. Using the identity equivalence (2):\n\n   p ::=:: p\n\nThus, the first equivalence is valid.\n\n### Equivalence 2: (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q))\n\nWe will transform both sides using the provided Basic Equivalences:\n\n1.

Using the identity equivalence (2) and equivalence (14):\n\n   (p | q) & !(p | q)\n\nBecause p | q represents the union of p and q, and !p & !q represents the negation of the union, we will have a contradiction:\n\n4.

The given statement does not directly fit the criteria laid out for the C* principle as it does not involve information strength or the speaker's knowledge in the way described by CQ1 and CQ2.\n\n- **C% Principle**:\n  This principle involves minimalization and the hearer's inference to expand information until they grasp the intention of the speech. The statement can be considered to fit the C% principle because the hearer can deduce that the beer being part of the food in the food box is a minimal statement necessary to convey the relevant information about the contents of the food box. The hearer can infer the details based on the minimal information provided.\n\n- **C! Principle**:\n  This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or obscure expressions without reason.
