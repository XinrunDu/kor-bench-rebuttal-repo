For the first character \"3\", it's a Multitap Code in the table, so we replace it with the corresponding plaintext character 'A'.\n\n2. For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5. As we have 21 characters, we start filling the tabular representation:\n   - The first character = 'P'\n   - The sixth character = 'R'\n\n6. The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8. Finally, decrypt the plaintext block:\n  \n   - 'P' -> 'A'\n   - 'Q' -> 'P'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n   - 'Q' -> 'R'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext is 'APQR', encapsulated in double square brackets as follows:\n\n[[APQR]]",

For each of the two numbers \"4\" and \"3\" in the given ciphertext, let's find their row and column indices in the Polybius square (arranged in a grid for better visibility):\n\n|    | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 1  | R  | T  | X  | F  | S  |\n| 2  | W  | C  | M  | V  | H  |\n| 3  | Z  | J  | A  | P  | B  |\n| 4  | L  | Q  | Y  | G  | K  |\n| 5  | N  | E  | U  | D  | I  |\n\nFrom the given ciphertext \"43\", the number \"4\" falls under row number 1 and column number 5, and the number \"3\" falls under row number 3 and column number 1.\n\n3. Replace the corresponding characters in the Polybius square with their numbers:\n\n   r  t  x  f  s | 4 | 5 |\n   w  c  m  v  h | 3 | 1 |\n\n   Now, the connections of number \"4\" and \"3\" are: (1, 5) and (3, 1).\n\n4. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Given the connections (1, 5) and (3, 1), we can locate the corresponding letters in the ciphertext based on the Polybius square:\n\n   1. Start at \"4\", connect along row 1 towards diagonal to the corner, then follow column 5 back towards \"4\": we find \"R\" and \"I\".\n\n5. Replace \"R\" and \"I\" with their corresponding rows and columns in the Polybius square.\n   - The row 5 corresponds to \"S\".\n   - The column \"I\" corresponds to \"T\".\n\nIn the final cipher, we have [\"RI\"]:\n\n- Encryption and decryption are complementary operations.

The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6. Finally, the decrypted bytes are converted back to text using ASCII encoding and the long string of decrypted text represents the plaintext.\n\nTo decode the given ciphertext accordingly, follow these steps:\n\n1. 4-byte blocks are split from \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n2. XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5. The byte blocks are XORed with the fixed key once more to get the original plaintext as bytes.\n6. Decoded bytes are printed in ASCII encoding.\n7. Padding is removed from the plaintext if necessary.\n8. The concatenated decrypted bytes composing the plaintext is returned.",

Padding: Since \"FW\" does not have an 8-byte multiple, we add \\x00 at the end to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. (After padding, the plaintext becomes \"F allegations0WP\\x00.\")\n2. Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Converting each block to bytes and applying XOR with the key (KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF').\n   - Using the S_BOX: Replace the high and low 4 bits of each byte before stitching them together and then applying another XOR with the key. In this case, \"F algorithms\" becomes \"D H computations\".\n   - Because 8 bit is a single byte, we only need to rotate each byte one bit to the left. After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Both encrypted bytes produce their respective hexadecimal representations: \"C2A\" and \"WHAT\".\n5.
