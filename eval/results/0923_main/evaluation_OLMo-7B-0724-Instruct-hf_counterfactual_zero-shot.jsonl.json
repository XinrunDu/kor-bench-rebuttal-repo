The code of Bushido in Street Fighter governs honorable conduct among fighters, which suggests the principles of sacrificing for the greater good and making selfless decisions for the world's protection.\n\nIn the context of a global threat, Guile's qualities and experience make him an excellent candidate to deal with the situation more effectively than the alternative options:\n\n- [[A] International military forces]: While their skills may be useful, they may not have the same unity of purpose and motivations as Guile in protecting the world.\n\n- [[B] United Nations]: Although the UN represents a forum for global collaboration, it has a history of weakness and is not always successful in combating global threats. UN's effectiveness would largely depend on enhancing its military capabilities and collaboration with individuals like Guile.\n\n- [[D] Zangief]: Although Zangief has immense physical strength, his character lacks the leadership and strategic intelligence required to address a global threat in the national or international realm.\n\n- [[D] Seth]: Seth's cybernetic enhancements and high-tech advances in the game are generally not directly relevant to dealing with an international threat beyond his individual abilities. Even if he had Guile's skills, Seth's gear and technology seem to be more focused on individual ESPer-like feats rather than a comprehensive, global defense strategy.",
