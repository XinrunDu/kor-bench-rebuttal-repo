The compound proposition within the ~ is x=::>x, which is true because if p1 is false, then p2 remains false.

For simplicity, I'll break down each clause into its simple disjunctive form:\n\n(¬p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (q) = (¬q ∨ q) ∧ (q ∨ p) ∧ (q) = (∅ ∧ q ∨ (q ∧ p)) ∧ (q) = (q ∨ p) ∧ q = (q ∨ q) ∧ p ∧ q = p ∧ q)\n\nThe simple disjunctive clauses are:\n\nS1 = {@(q), @(q ∨ p), @(p ∧ q)}\n\nNow, let's find S0 and S2 before starting the resolution process.\n\nS0 = {@@  (empty set)\nS2 = {@(q), @(q ∨ p), @(p ∧ q)}\n\nDuring the first loop iteration, we'll resolve the clauses in S0 and S1. Specifically, clauses @(q) and @(q ∨ p) cannot be resolved, so we add them to S2. The updated S0 and S2 sets are:\n\nS0 = {@@, diastolic={@(q ∨ p)}\nS2 = {@(q), @(q ∨ p), @(q ∨ p ∨ q)}\n\nNow, we resolve the clauses in S1.\n\n  S1 = {@(q), @(q ∨ p), @(p ∧ q)}\n\nThe combinations of clauses that can be resolved are @(q ∨ p) and @(p ∧ q). After resolving these clauses, we obtain @(p). As neither empty set nor one of the initial sets contains @(p), we add it to S2:\n\nS2 = {@(q), @(q ∨ p), @(p ∧ q), @(p)}\n\nAfter the first loop iteration, S2 contains @(p) and @(q ∨ p). The final check in the algorithm will verify if S2 is empty, which isn't the case in this example. Thus, the algorithm will add S1 to S0 and clear S2 as follows:\n\nS0 = {@@, diastolic={@(q ∨ p), @(p ∧ q)}\nS1 = {@(p ∧ q), @(p)}\nS2 = {@(q)}\n\nThe refreshed sets will pass the first loop iteration, and the resolution algorithm will continue.
