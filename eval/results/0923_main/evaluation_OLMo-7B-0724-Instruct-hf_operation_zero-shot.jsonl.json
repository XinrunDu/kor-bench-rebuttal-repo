With this representation, we can rewrite the definite integral as:\n\n∫0π [ (e^{ix} - e^{-ix}) / i ]dx.\n\nNow, for simplicity, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫0π (e^{ix} / i) dx - ∫0π (e^{-ix} / i)dx.\n\nIntegrating each term, we get:\n\n[ (i/i) (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nSimplify the expressions:\n\n[1 (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\n1 - ((-1)/i) * (e^{(-πi)})\n\nWe now apply Euler's formula, which states that e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x).

Since the question asks to find the value of b if 0★b = b, we know that the integral of 2x from 0 to b is equal to b itself:\n\n∫0b 2x dx = b\n\nSolving for b:\n\n2b = b\n\nb = 1\n\nHowever, if there is more than one answer, we can write it as [1]. Therefore, the answer is [[1]].",
