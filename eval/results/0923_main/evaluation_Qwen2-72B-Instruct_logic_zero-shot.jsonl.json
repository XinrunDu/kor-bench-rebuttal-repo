The negation of this conjunction is ~x = ✓, meaning this is a true assignment.\n- If we have p1 (✓), p2 (x), and p3 (x), then (p1&p2&~p3) = (✓&x&~x) = (x&x) = x.

Here, for p1 to be negated (~p1) and true (✓), p1 must be false (x). For p2 to make the \"and\" (p2) part true (✓), p2 must be true (✓).\n- Now, for ~p3 to be false (x), p3 must be true (✓).\n- The assignment where x|x|✓ will lead to the formula being false.\n\nTherefore, the falsity value is [[F:x|x|✓]].\n\n### Formula 2: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\n- The formula is formed as an 'and' operation.\n- For the formula to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- For (~p2||p3) to be false, both parts (~p2 and p3) must be false.\n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n  - For p3 to be false, p3 must be false.\n- For (p1=::>p2) to be false, p1 must be true (✓) and p2 must be false (x), which is not consistent with the assignment required by the first part.\n- Falsity assignments: Since (~p2||p3) requires p2 to be true and p3 to be false, but (p1=::>p2) cannot be false with these assignments, no single assignment can make the entire formula false.\n\nTherefore, falsity value for the given structure: [[F:None]]\n\n### Formula 3: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\n- The main connective here is '&', meaning both parts must be false for the entire formula to be false.\n- Consider (p1=::>p2): The conditional statement is false in only one case: p1 = 'True' (✓); p2 = 'False' (x).\n- Next, consider (~(~(p1&p3)||p1)):\n  - The leftmost part is a nested negation (~ (~ (~(p1&p3) || p1))). In order for it to be false (contribution to the overall falseness of the formula), ~(p1&p3)||p1 must be true.\n  - In the scenario to nullify (~(p1&p3)||p1), we need both ~(p1&p3) and p1 to be false.\n    - For ~(p1&p3) to be false, (p1&p3) must be true, requiring p1=✓ (True) and p3=✓ (True).\n    - This directly conflicts with our previous finding that p1 must be True to make the conditional (p1=::>p2) false, which implies the only assignment that makes (p1=::>p2) false makes another part of the formula True (p1=✓), causing the entire structure not to have a false assignment under the analyzed scenario.\n  \nTherefore, the falsity values identified are:\n[[F:x|x|✓]];[[F:None]];[[F:None]].",

The truth assignments that make the full expression false are when both clauses are false simultaneously:\n- At the same time, both clauses will be false if p=true, q=true, and r=false -> p∧q∧¬r -> binary number is 110, hexadecimal number is 6.\n\nThus, the truth assignment that makes our full expression false corresponds to a binary number of 110, which corresponds to a hexadecimal value of 6. This means the paired disjunctive term that makes our full expression false is referred to as \\( M6 \\).\n\nTo determine the paired disjunctive terms for the given expression we have to recognize that since all paired disjunctive terms are Boolean negations to the truth assignments that make a given clause false, we have only identified an instance where the complex clause becomes false, not the paired disjunctive terms in the clause before negation.\n\nHowever, in the context of the given instruction, applying the given rule, we can see that (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) results in a minimum of false assignments, which is consequently represented by only one paired disjunctive term \\(M_6\\), indicating the possible binary assignment 110 (or hex 6) makes the expression false in full.\n\nThus, representing the given clause in the format asked by the question, we get the following:\n\nPaired disjunctive terms: [M6],\nDenotation as per rule provided: [M6].\n\nThe answer to the question would be represented as:\n\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M6]; [denoted: M6]] \\]",

However, these literals are not present together in one pair of clauses C1 and C2.\n\nSince resolving requires a literal and its complement to be available in two clauses and C1 does not contain ¬r, and C2 does not contain r, we cannot resolve directly based on this rule.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a literal and its negation to resolve C1 and C2. In the definition given, resolution can be applied if there are simple disjunctive clauses of the form C1 = C3 ∨ L and C2 = C4 ∨ L’. In this context, it seems there’s confusion or an oversight. C1 and C2 do not directly contain a literal and its complement in the specified form for each other. But closely examining, we have:\n\nC1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r (implying L = ¬q in this context)\nC2 = ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t (implying L’ = q in this context, though q is not part of C2, it can be inferred that L’ = ¬¬q = q)\n\nHowever, due to the definition constraints, literal L from C1 must have a complement L’ in C2, which is not the case here since C2 does not contain q (complement of ¬q from C1). Hence, by the rules provided, we should not proceed with resolution.\n\nSince we can't resolve the clauses C1 and C2 as per the given logic rule (there's no literal L that has its complement L' in other clause, apart from r and ¬r which are not part of both clauses), we can logically infer that the dispel operation as defined, cannot be completed under this interpretation.\n\nAnswer: [C1 and C2 do not resolve according to given rule. Hence, dispel(C1, C2) cannot be determined as per the resolution algorithm.]\n\nThus, the answer as per rule and question can be expressed as: [[]], indicating an empty set of clauses or an indeterminate state under the provided logic rule since no valid dispel operation can be completed based on given clauses C1 and C2 under the direct resolution condition as currently defined.",

(p∨r) - This is false if both p and r are false.\n\nThe output \"O\" is \"-\" if all the above sub-expressions are false. Let's simplify this further:\n\nThe output is \"-\" if:\n\n- ¬(p∧q∧¬r)∧¬(¬p∧q)∧¬(p∨r) is true.\n\nBut since we are only interested in finding when \"O\" is \"-\", we can look for situations where each part of the original disjunction does not hold:\n\n1. (p and q and not r) does not hold: this is true when not p OR not q OR r.\n2. (not p and q) does not hold: this is true when p OR not q.\n3. (p or r) does not hold: this is true when not p AND not r.\n\nTaking the AND of these negated expressions, we get a scenario where \"O\" is \"-\".\n\nLet's find inputs where these conditions are met:\n\n1. np and nq and r (np=not p and nq=not q)\n2. p and nq\n3. np and nr (nr=not r)\n\nAny input set that satisfies any of these conditions would result in \"O\" being \"-\". Let's list a few valid input combinations:\n\n- [np, nq, r] = [0, 0, 1]\n- [p, nq, nr] = [1, 0, 0]\n- [np, q, nr] = [0, 1, 0]\n- [np, nq, nr] = [0, 0, 0]\n\nTherefore, the corresponding inputs that would result in the output \"O\" being \"-\" are represented as:\n\n[[0, 0, 1]; [1, 0, 0]; [0, 1, 0]; [0, 0, 0]].",

Let's break down the question and determine the conditions for this conclusion.\n\n\"SOP\" indicates an O-Proposition in logical terms, which denotes \"Some S are not P\".\nWe are given empty parentheses [] to fill in with valid moods from the corresponding figures, where an O-proposition appears in the premises.\n\nBased on the instructions provided:\n\n1. \"Figure I\" does not allow for the conclusion of an O-proposition.\n2. \"Figure II\" allows for an E-proposition in its premises, which could, in concert with an A-proposition, lead to an O-proposition conclusion. However, none of the valid moods explicitly contain an 'O' proposition within the premises, meaning we might not find a direct match in this figure based on the allowable moods.\n3. \"Figure III\" has valid moods that include an O proposition: \"OAO\", which does provide for an O-proposition, but not directly to the S and P terms given in the conclusion.\n4. \"Figure IV\" includes a few valid moods, two of which contain an 'A' and 'E' proposition combined might lead to an O-proposition conclusion under some circumstances, but the form of Figure IV does not match the conclusion requirement.\n\nGiven the standard rules, the conclusion SOP cannot be supported by an explicit set of premises which could fill the valid moods given above, in the format asked of me. However, to meet the format requested and give an answer which is closest to our conclusion while available within the instruction parameters, let us consider an abstraction or a creative allowance for the presence of the O-proposition in the concluding position.\n\nHenceforth, given the formation constraints and absence of a precise mode identified that leads directly to SOP by one of the provided valid moods, the interpretation leans towards abstract compatibility rather than strict specification. What is 'closest' to meeting our conclusion might thus be crafted if inventing premises that would hypothetically yield SOP under some assumption:\n\nAssuming that, the provided valid moods and forms might not straightforwardly accommodate an SOP conclusion without an additional step or a qualification not covered by the exact premises allowed.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[\"OAO\";\"EAE\";\"OAO\";\"\"]\n\nWe have \"OAO\" for Figure III, which contains an O Proposition in its form, which by our creative license we are highlighting (while noting it does not directly yield SOP as an outcome from its premises directly relating to S and P). This placement in the answer is meant to indicate an O-Proposition comes into play in the Fig III position in our constructed answer and perhaps implies within a hypothetical extension of permissible premises.\n\nWe've also placed \"EAE\" for the Figure II mood which allows an E Proposition in its first premise - which again is not a direct fit but might contribute to the creation of an O Proposition but not as follows directly from the listed valid moods as provided. The blank space in the fourth bracket is left as the Figure IV constructs did not directly accommodate an SOP conclusion.\n\nNote: The given instruction set and the question format might require additional clarification for a distinct fit between the provided mood selections and a direct yield of SOP conclusion, but the presented answer aims for closest alignment and interpretive flexibility within the guidelines.",
