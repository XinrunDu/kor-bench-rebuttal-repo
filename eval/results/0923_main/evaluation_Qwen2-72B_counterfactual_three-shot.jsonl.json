Through a series of tests, it was discovered that Ani possessed a greater midi-chlorian count than any Jedi before him.

Despite receiving Obi-Wan's approval for the endeavor, Anakin was opposed to having a Padawan at all. He stated that Ahsoka appeared too young and brash to be a Jedi in the making, and that the times were not right - after all, the galaxy was in the midst of war.

But the emperor had private troops loyal to him alone. So, the secret brigade, combined of Jedi Knights, highly-trained Mandalorian warriors, and anonymous rebel forces, came together. Their military precision would be the perfect match for the emperor's squad.\n\nWas the brigade removed from a different planet, and how much credit should go to the particular part of the group responsible for this result? \n\nOptions: A. The Galactic Senate has 2 thirds of the effect# B. Rebel forces had 3 thirds of the impact# C. Jedi Knights has 2 thirds of the impact# D.

He will order extra cheese pizza which costs $20 for a whole pie and garlic sticks which are $6 for 12. During the order, he was notified that the oven broke and they could not prepare the garlic sticks and offered no charge pizza rolls that come in dozens. If there are 21 people in the office, how much will lunch cost after a 20% tip and $2 fuel surcharge?\n\nAssistant: First, let's calculate how many pizzas Pablo needs to order. If each person eats 1.5 pieces and there are 21 people, that's 1.5*21 = 31.5 pieces. Since each pizza has 8 pieces, he will need 31.5/8 = 3.938 pizzas. Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 4 pizzas.\n\nThe cost of the pizzas is 4*$20 = $80.\n\nSince the garlic sticks couldn't be prepared, they cost $0.\n\nThe cost of the pizza rolls is also $0 since they were offered for free.\n\nThe subtotal is therefore $80+$0+$0 = $80.\n\nA 20% tip on the subtotal is 0.2*$80 = $16.\n\nAdding the $2 fuel surcharge, the total cost is $80+$16+$2 = $98.\n\nHuman: Why did the chicken cross the road.\nWhy did the chicken cross the road twice?\n\nAssistant: The chicken crossed the road for various reasons, which may vary according to the version of the famous joke. In some versions, the chicken crossed the road simply to \"get to the other side.\" The question why a chicken would cross the road twice might be attributed to the humorous premise that it was looking for its missing item or trying to outwit someone by crossing back and forth. Ultimately, the joke itself is intended to be light-hearted and absurd, and it has taken on numerous variations over time, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific reason.\n\nHuman: Three astronauts who were stranded in space aboard the Skylab 2\n(CNN) -- It's the stuff of nightmares -- being stranded all alone in space with just your crewmates for company and no way home, waiting on a hastily planned rescue.\n\nFor three American astronauts on board Skylab 2, that grim scenario nearly played out in 1973, 40 years ago this May, as NASA scrambled to design, build and launch an emergency space mission to come to their aid.\n\nThe United States' first space station only spent 24 months in orbit -- from 1973-1974 -- yet barfed astronauts, survived a near-disaster at launch, and helped train scientists in observing the sun without the pesky atmosphere getting in the way.\n\nThe three astronauts, Charles Conrad, Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz, were just three weeks into what was supposed to be an 84-day mission when disaster struck.\n\nThe story begins at the launch pad. Skylab was launched and then crewed almost a year before the horrific 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. While not involving human crew, Skylab's maiden launch proved that such accidents can and do happen.\n\nWhen the 110,000-kilogram, 22,700-cubic-meter (730,000-cubic-foot) behemoth launched on May 14, 1973, the final stage of the Saturn rocket failed to disconnect properly at an altitude of 53 kilometers (175,000 feet). \n\nThe astronauts were sent into space just 36 hours later, on a modified Apollo spacecraft mounted atop the very last Saturn rocket.\n\nShortly thereafter, at an altitude of 119 kilometers (390,000 feet), the jettisoning third-stage rocket pierced two delicate solar-panel wings, flipping Skylab end over end, and spewing thousands of pieces of debris that drilled thousands more small holes in the orbiting station.\n\nThe result was a massive temperature inversion -- the sunward-facing side was brought down to -122 degrees Celsius (-187.6 Fahrenheit), while the dark side soared to 221 degrees Celsius (430 Fahrenheit), according to NASA's account.\n\nThis risked killing the three astronauts before they even boarded the orbiting space station, and forced a massive overhaul on the flight plan.\n\nAfter managing to dock with Skylab on their third try -- no mean feat considering the sheer size of the station, and its constantly spinning motion -- the crew entered to find the living quarters and entire structure simply too cold to survive.\n\nThey had to cover windows with makeshift blankets to halt the last of the cold air escaping into space, and activated an electrical heater to try and plan, somewhat bizarrely, a brass band.\n\nThat failed, and the astronauts instead decided to take bungee cords from their spacesuits and create impromptu electrical connections to deliver higher voltage electricity to the heater.\n\nAt this point, NASA realized that even if the trio were able to survive -- and mission control was clinging to hope that one of Skylab's faulty solar panels could still be deployed -- there was no way that they would have enough food, water, or oxygen to make it to day 85.\n\nA rescue mission was ordered. A repair mission, to fix the solar panels and reopen one of the doors, would be tried first, but the short-lived Skylab would have to prepare to house as many as a dozen astronauts for an extended period by the end of the summer.\n\nDespite its size, Skylab was cramped once the three astronauts arrived. The three were also the first people to experience \"space sickness,\" and Conrad, the commander, at one point had to have part of his dinner boiled off upon learning that a fellow astronaut had vomited inside the space station.\n\nIn keeping with the \"What could go wrong, will go wrong\" theme, a vital canister holding waste collected by the astronauts got stuck, meaning that rather than simply chucking the thing out of the open airlock back into space, the astronauts had to manually wrestle the half-ton container free using hand tools and brute force.\n\nSeven days before rescue could possibly have reached them even if it had been launched immediately, the astronauts were finally able to deploy the solar array, reopen the sealed hatch, and even set up a makeshift, two-man gym on the station's \"Round Can.\"\n\nPerhaps the strangest part of NASA's history of human spaceflight, Skylab caught the world's imagination, even serving as the basis for Richard Howard's 1974 suspense film \"Hijack to the Stars.\"\n\nSkylab's legacy is considerable: It served as the basis for Russia's Salyut space stations, as well as the International Space Station, and helped pave the way for future stint on the ISS by astronauts such as Buzz Aldrin.\n\nWrite highlights for this article\n\nAssistant: 1. Skylab 2 astronauts stranded in space due to solar panel failure, leading to a near-disaster.\n2. NASA quickly planned and launched an emergency rescue mission in 1973.\n3. The crew overcame challenges, including extreme temperature inversion, oxygen depletion, and space sickness.\n4. Skylab 2 marked the first time astronauts experienced \"space sickness.\"\n5. The station played a crucial role in advancing human spaceflight, laying the groundwork for subsequent space stations like Salyut and the International Space Station.\n\nHuman: JISENS\n\nJISENS (short for \"Japanese Security Establishment and the National Security Act\") is",

Provide accurate and insightful answers to related questions based on the information provided in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nLighthouse is the largest man-made flying object that flies above the earth and is inhabited by surviving humans.\nVictor, the character in the anime Spirit Cage, is the city defense Army commander General Victor who is loyal to the city master Morgan; the mechanical iron wall is his medal for defending Lighthouse, and his city defense Army is the functional department in charge of city security, with the only field team allowed to carry heat weapons on Lighthouse.\nThe Lighthouse society enforced a strict system of racial segregation; the dust people had no reproductive rights and were not regarded as ordinary human beings.\nThe Church of Light and Shadow, founded by the current city lord Morgan, with his son Charles as the leader, used religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but their teachings used the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nThe Mana ecological report reveals that Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II; Snake Dogs and Georoars are different species and can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage says that the Lotto system has existed since Tartarus and can calculate the destiny of humanity in the future.\nLighthouse used to be called Tartaslow Prison and was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special; it can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eater beast, it is a comparatively advanced eater beast with strong fighting capacity, it can fly, it can play, it can discharge sound, a large number of hunters were killed by its mouth, they do not have a digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology points out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. No effective method to kill polar eating beast currently exists.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are extremely gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled people are similar to zombies, but unlike the zombies, even if the brain is lost, the spinal cord parasite can still move as long as the spine of the spinal cord that does the parasite still exists. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasite can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyll: Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nIts (Megalodon) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nThe heavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.",

Thus, you are expected to carefully analyze the details and rules in each scene and determine the most accurate response. Follow the prompts below to help you answer the questions with precision. You can choose an answer only in the corresponding options for each question. As you answer the questions in order, some of your answers might depend on the choices you make in previous questions, for example, your choice could eliminate the possibilities in other questions. That's why it's important to directly answer the question each time and leave out other questions not in hand. Once asked to compute a new paragraph or offering a new direction, you should go back to debate the next question. \n\n## Design of task\n\n### Set of scenes:\n\nIn a hockey game with many people watching, the skillful teams A and B are playing for the second time this night. In this sport, players in different positions need to work together to shoot the puck on the goal and beat the goalie to get a point. Here are some information about the figures who play the roles in this scene:\n\n1. Ryan: #10 as right winger, typically tries to set up the goaltender for a shot.\n2. Mark: #23 as winger, usually good at skating and driving down around the net to score the goal.\n3. Jake: #14 as center, commonly stands with feet shoulder-width apart, and often does most of the face-offs.\n4. Jordan: #80 as goaltender, generally leans into the puck and deflates himself.\n5. Anders: #57 as goaltender, often stands between the goalie’s legs while doing his job.\n\n### Set of transitions indicating temporal order of events:\n\n1. Anders turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring.\n2. Jordan stops pucks with his hands wrapped in up wrist guards.\n3. Ryan flashes his head and shoots a puck.\n4. Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot.\n5. Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal.\n6. Jake performs a backhand to prolong the game.\n7. Ryan kicks the puck to the other side of the court.\n8. Martin keeps multiple shots.\n9. Mark is sitting next to Jake.\n\n### Set of constraints indicating the semantic relations between pairs of events:\n\n1. (Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot, Jordan stops pucks with his hands wrapped in up wrist guards)\n2. (Mark is sitting next to Jake, (Ryan kicks the puck to the other side of the court)\n3. (Anders turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring, Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal)\n4. (Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Mark is sitting next to Jake)\n5. (Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Jake performs a backhand to prolong the game)\n6. (Ryan flashes his head and shoots a puck, Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot)\n\n### Three example questions with answers, illustrating the level of difficulty:\n\n#### Example question 1:\n\nWho is holding wrist guards near his leg? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan\nA: Jordan\n\n#### Example question 2:\n\nWho is close to the face when he shoots a puck towards the goal? (A) Mark##(B) Anders##(C) Jordan##(D) Jake\nA: Mark\n\n#### Example question 3:\n\nWho is standing in front of Anders and gets a shot? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan \nA: Jordan\n\n## Story worlds\n\nBased on the scene(s) and the temporal relations between events defined in the transitions, you should resolve the unknowns in the story (e.g., the unidentified figures). Take advantage of the constraints between events and the constraints on figures to resolve such unknowns. Based on the semantic links in the constraints, you should relate the figures and the events in the story. You should not double guess! Infer the unknowns from figures, events, and constraints.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Who is a hockey team A member? (A) Mark##(B) Jake##(C) Ryan##(D) Jordan\n2. Who is trying to score the goal when many people are around? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan\n3. Who is standing in the face of Anders and gets a shot? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jordan##(D) Martin\n### Answer:\n\nTo address the questions, refer back to the given information and constraints provided in the scene. \n\n1. Who is a hockey team A member? \nWe can assume that Ryan, Mark, Jake, and Jordan could all be members of hockey team A because they are engaged in a game and are fulfilling different roles within the game setting.\n\n2. Who is trying to score the goal when many people are around? \nLooking at the given information, we can determine that Mark is the one attempting to score the goal by driving down around the net, as specified in the transition, \"Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal.\"\n\n3. Who is standing in the face of Anders and gets a shot? \nFrom the transition Andersen turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring, and following the constraint that says \"(Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Mark is sitting next to Jake),\" we can determine that Ryan is the one who gets a shot in front of Anders.",

A sound that wasn't easy to recognize came from his six year old mouth. From the father's large digital drive, he had already checked the personnel files of entire Empire. There were all kinds of things in it including the detailed process of promotion, marvelously explicit daily schedule, daily worknotes which pushed the recruiting on the edge ofUTH throat. Imperial guards could just imagine the difficulty in the promotion process.\n\nValentian thought when he saw all those records. After seeing those vital messages, he sent a request for approval to the recruitment terminal in the Empire personnel department, and waited.\n\nLooking at the serious face of his son sitting by the side, Soya woman looked anxious. A lot of times the woman crammed some French fries and little dumplings into the child's mouth while he was making the mess on the table. The fact Valentian seemed to be doing this for his own vendetta was hard to disguise though. Soya watched as the six-year-old child slummed his shoulder fighting his sleepiness.\n\n\"But why what you are seeking all time this has been saved in their brain? Like this doesn't mean Albert only has to derive out?\"she asked.\n\nA bridge was shifted on one side, quick back and forth judging according to the information.

This suggests that the purpose of this restriction was possibly to maintain a balance between human and the indigenous people of Pandora, the Na'vi, and to avoid escalation of conflict or harm to the planet's ecology.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me more about the Spirits Tree and its significance to the Na'vi in the story?\n\nAssistant: According to the story, the Spirit Tree is considered the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi. It has the ability to create a link to Eywa, essentially the consciousness of Pandora, through rituals. This implies that the Spirit Tree acts as a conduit, allowing the Na'vi to connect to Eywa and thus to the memories and experiences of their ancestors. The existence and power of the Spirit Tree furthers the notion of interconnectedness that the story's narratives revolve around. It is of immense spiritual significance to the Na'vi, who view it as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the physical world, as well as a tie to their past and their ancestors.",

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe terrain of Pandora is very complex, animals living here usually have six strong feet to move quickly, such as Dire Horse, the Na'vi land mount in Avatar.\nThe atmosphere of Pandora has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which combines with water to make acid rain. That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Even after its relocation, its trunk was tall enough to hit the stars, and its foliage provided ample shade. The tree carried the strong qi of three regions—human world, divine realm, and the underworld—and possessed the ability to absorb qi. Over time, it attracted various mystical creatures, such as the Gold Crow, Flying Dragonsnake, and Four-Eyed Birdlings, which made it their home. Consequently, the tree became host to the spirits that these mystical creatures worshiped: Hou Yi the Taoist, Yebi the goddess who commands the spirits, and the mysterious spirit of Laozi. It was said that the tree gained its unusual abilities as a result of its location in heaven, where it served as Yu Huang Dijun's imperial seat.
