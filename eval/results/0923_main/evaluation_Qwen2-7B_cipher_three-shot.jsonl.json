For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[H]] (This is the same as the input since decryption of \"H\" gives \"H\" itself)\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"3=\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X]]  (Decryption of \"3=\" gives \"WX\" with the given cipher table, but because of the way the table is defined, \"X\" is at symbol position 3 and \"W\" at \"=\". So, \"X\" is the first decrypted character.)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"W\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]=[[0]]   (Encryption of \"W\" gives \"X\" which is at symbol position 3 and encrypts to \"0\", hence the answer is represented as [[0]] since it's a symbol not an uppercase letter.)",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[OAPALU]]\n\nBelow is an explanation of the cipher operations you need to perform for both encryption and decryption:\n\n1. **Encryption Steps (for the \"Plaintext\" question):**\n   - For each plaintext character `p`:\n     - If `p` is an uppercase letter and exists in the Polybius square:\n       - Replace `p` with the number of rows and columns (both counted from 1) in which the character appears.\n     - In particular, O, which does not exist in the Polybius square, is replaced by 66.\n   - This is equivalent to looking up the character in the Polybius square and replacing it with its corresponding code. For example, \"R\" in the Polybius square is replaced with '11', \"W\" is replaced with '22', and \"Q\" is replaced with '43'.\n   - If `p` is not in the Polybius square, it should be replaced with 66. This is done because \"O\" is not in the square. Therefore, \"O\" in the plaintext will be replaced with '66' in the ciphertext.\n   - As for the special case of \"N\", which is in the Polybius square, it will be replaced by '51' in the ciphertext.\n\nExample: Plaintext is \"North\". The corresponding ciphertext will be: \"14325234345343415553451425134314243243343115142\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps (for the \"Ciphertext\" question):**\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc in the given ciphertext:\n     - Based on the rows and columns denoted by CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid.\n     - If CrCc=66, replace with \"O\". This means that any occurrence of \"66\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"O\" in the plaintext.\n   - This is the reverse operation of encryption. In other words, you need to look up the corresponding character in the Polybius square for each pair of numbers and construct the plaintext.\n\nExample: Ciphertext is \"36634441131153143612\". The corresponding plaintext is \"OAPALU\".",

Since \"C\" is located at position 7 in the list, its positional value is 7.\n\nNext, we use the Initial sequence of cards and the keystream algorithm to generate a keystream value for \"C\". In this case, the keystream value is \"S\". The keystream value \"S\" corresponds to position 8 in the LETTERS list.\n\nNow, we perform the decryption steps:\n1. We calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"S\" by using the keystream value \"S\" and the differentiated mod 26 operation. Thus, x = (8 - 7) % 26 = 1 % 26 = 1.\n2. We use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 1.

To encrypt \"VA\" using the given cipher, we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1. \n2. For the first character 'V': V is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for V is M (the next letter on Reel1). Move to Reel2.\n3. For the second character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel2). Move to Reel3.\n4. For the third character 'A': A is on Reel3, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel3). Move to Reel4.\n5. For the fourth character 'V': V is on Reel4, so the ciphertext character for V is S (the next letter on Reel4). Move to Reel5.\n6. For the fifth character 'A': A is on Reel5, so the ciphertext character for A is K (the next letter on Reel5). Move to Reel6.\n7. For the sixth character 'A': A is at the end of Reel6, so go back to Reel1 to find the next letter.\n8. Reel6 to Reel1: After moving to Reel1 from Reel6, we reach the end of Reel1. Therefore, we go back to Reel1.\n9. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for A is its previous letter, which is R. Move to Reel2.\n10. As we encountered R on Reel1, we go to Reel2. Since the next character on Reel1 is not R, we stay at Reel2.\n11. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is R. Keep moving to the next reel until you reach the end, then go around to the next reel.\n12. Move to Reel3, and since 'A' is on Reel3, the ciphertext character for 'A' is V.\n13. Thus, the ciphertext for \"VA\" will be \"MJFB\" as the encryption order will be M, J, F, B for \"VA\", respectively.\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer for \"???\". To encrypt the input \"???\", we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2.

For the second character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. So the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n4. For the third character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. Hence, the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n5.

The provided ciphertext \"84./71./7.5./4!=?79.\" seems to appear correctly in the rule.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, in the decryption task, for the fourth test case, the cipher rule is pertaining to the third task in the instructions. It states that each character of the plaintext is encrypted to a 2-character group separated by /. If the length of the plaintext is odd, the last character is not encrypted and is included into the ciphertext without the following mapping. Therefore, the encrypted form is 2 characterized groups separated by /. In this scenario, the encrypted ciphertext is \"84./71./7.5./4!=?79.\", which is consistent with the rule description.",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n1. **Decryption Steps** (since this is an encryption rule, let's go with decryption):\n    - Division into halves: \"SD\" becomes (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one from the lower half: (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Decryption binary: (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Position in encrypted character set (0-6): \"A\" (0), \"G\" (6)\n    - Encrypted binary: (A, G)\n    - Read rows, then columns: \"AG\"\n    - Apply 6x6 matrix: \"DD\"\n    Thus, the encrypted form of \"SD\" is [[DD]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[DD]]",
