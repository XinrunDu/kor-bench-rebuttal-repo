Convert \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" to a universal affirmative by addressing \"no true revolutionaries are false,\" and to adapt it to a universal negative proposition by changing \"all\" to \"None.\" Thus, the statement becomes:\n   - None are not upright and open. This can be converted to \"None are not upright, therefore None are open,\" which is not directly the inverse needed but can be mutated to inverse:\n     - No upright and open.\n\n2. To reach the desired conclusion \"All people who are not upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" we must directly target the contraposition along our given propositions. This requites applying obversion to \"None are not upright and open\" which would transform to \"Some are upright and open\" and thus convert the sought conclusion:\n   - Some are not upright and open.\n\n3. Meeting the stated goal with this development indicates we should select Method C's approach, which utilizes obversion and conversion operations to transform the premise. This pattern effectively converts parts of the verbose \"None are not upright and open,\" which is likened by all true revolutionaries, into the cancellation of non-meanings (\"some within\"), quantifying thus the desired \"some not upright and open\" for inversion, to shift the solution initially to seek by negating our contrapositive inverted strategy aligned with Method C's mechanics, which answers:\n\n[Method C]",

The C% Principle emphasizes the idea that the speaker should strive to speak as little as possible while maintaining the intended message. In this case, B's response is clear and straightforward, and it conveys the action of borrowing the materials without any unnecessary details. On the other hand, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" could be interpreted as \"quite troublesome\" or encountered obstacles in obtaining the materials. This is more aligned with the C! Principle, as it involves the use of a marked expression (of the possibility) without a conventional association and requires the appraiser to infer the speaker's meaning. However, the C% Principle is more directly related to B's response because it emphasizes the minimalistic nature of the communication.",
