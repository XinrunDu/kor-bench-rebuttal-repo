Assemble the numeric sequence considering the mapping: For \"...-\", we get \"5665\". For \"---.\", it translates to \"655\".\n5. Therefore, the numeric representation will be \"5665/655\".\n\nHowever, observing the rule's letter-to-Morse and Morse-to-number mapping strictly:\n- For Morse \"..\", we use \"5\"\n- For Morse \".\", we use \"5\"\n- For Morse \"-\", we use \"6\"\n- For Morse \"---\", it becomes \"666\"\n- For Morse \"...\", it becomes \"555\"\nThus, correctly mapping \"V\" (which is \"...-\") should be \"5556\" and \"O\" (which is \"---\") should be \"666\". Then splitting them in pairs according to above table.\n\nSo, for \"V\" (Morse: \"...-\") -> \"5556\":\n- Pair1: \"55\" -> \"9\"\n- Pair2: \"56\" -> \"3\"\n\nAnd \"O\" (Morse: \"---\") -> \"666\":\n- Pair1: \"66\" -> \"7\"\n- Pair2: \"6\" -> As \"6\" need to pair, it will be last: \"6\"\n\nAs \"..\" at the beginning and end is not directly a pair; thus, we recognize: \"5556/666\".\nSplitting would be transformed into: \"55\", \"56\", \"66\", \"6\".\nFollowing mapping comes to 9, 3, 7, 6.\n\nTherefore, final assembled encryption will observe:\n- For \"V\": \"93\"\n- For \"O\": \"76\"\n\nThus, combining as [[93/76]].
