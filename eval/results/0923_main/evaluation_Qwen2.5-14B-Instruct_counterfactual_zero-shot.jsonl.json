However, the story mainly discusses the use of mechanisms on smaller scales and the transformation of bodies like Wu Shuang into mechanical beings, not large mechanical beasts.\n\n- **Option B:** \"Although the Qin Dynasty adopted some mechanical manufacturing techniques to produce weapons and military equipment, such as crossbows, there were no mechanical beasts capable of automatically locking onto and attacking targets.\"\n  - This statement aligns with the story. The information related to mechanical technology focuses on mechanisms using Mohist or \"domineering\" skills: from creating heavier loads transporters, helping people perform tasks more efficiently, to actual inventions like specific weapons. No reference was given to automatic attack capabilities for large mechanical beasts.\n\n- **Option C:** \"During the Qin Dynasty, cyborgs existed, and after a person's death, their body could be reconstructed into a mechanical being using various components.\"\n  - The story clearly states that Wu Shuang's body was transformed into a mechanical being after his death by Gongshu Chou.\n\n- **Option D:** \"During the Qin Dynasty, tools made of iron had not yet been developed.\"\n  - There is no information in the story suggesting that iron tools had not yet been developed during the Qin Dynasty.
