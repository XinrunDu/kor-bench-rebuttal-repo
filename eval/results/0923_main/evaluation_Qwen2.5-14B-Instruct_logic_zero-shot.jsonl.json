Each proposition (p1, p2, p3) can be either true (✓) or false (x). We will evaluate each formula accordingly.\n\n### Evaluating Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\nLet's consider all combinations of truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n- If p1, p2, and p3 are all true (✓|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 evaluates to x since ~p3 becomes false. Hence, ~(p1&p2&~p3) = ~(✓&✓&x) = ~(x) = ✓.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and only p2 is false (x|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and p2 is false (x|✓|✓), and p3 is false (✓|x|x), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- ... and so on for all combinations.\n\nThe truth table systematically covering all cases will show that the only time the formula evaluates to false (x) is when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (✓|✓|x). For all other combinations, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is true.\n\nThus, T: (All combinations except ✓|✓|x) and F: (✓|✓|x).\n\n### Evaluating Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to identify when the left side (~p1&p2) implies the right side (p1=p3).\n- If ~p1&p2 is false (✓|x or x|x), regardless of the value of p1=p3, the entire formula is true.\n- If ~p1&p2 is true (✓), then p1 must be false and p2 must be true. For (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) to be false, p1 must equal p3, which in this case means p2 must equate (false=✓, a contradiction).\n\nThus, the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) evaluates to false (x) only when p1 and p3 are both true (✓) and p2 is true (✓|✓|✓).\n\nHence, T: (All cases except ✓|✓|✓) and F: (✓|✓|✓).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe truth values and falsity values of the given formulas are as follows:\n\n- For formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n  - [[T:✓|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|✓|x, x|x|x, x|x|✓]; [F:✓|✓|x]]\n- For formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n  - [[T:x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, x|✓|x, ✓|x|✓, x|✓|✓]; [F:✓|✓|✓]]\n\nPutting this in the specified format, the answer is:\n\n[[T:✓|x|x,x|x|✓,x|✓|✓,x|✓|x,✓|✓|x,x|x|x,x|x|✓;T:x|x|x,x|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|x,✓|x|✓,x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x;F:✓|✓|✓]]",

The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false.

Substituting this into the equation:\n   - `p | (q & !q) ::=:: p | 0`\n6. According to Basic Equivalence (8), `p | 0 ::=:: p`.\n7. Hence, `(p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p`. This equivalence is valid.\n\n### For (2) (p & !q) | (!p & q) ::=:: (p | q) & (!(p | q))\n\n1. Let's simplify the left-hand side `(p & !q) | (!p & q)` first:\n   - We cannot simplify this immediately into a known form based on our rules, but we aim to match the right-hand side.\n2. For clarity, let's consider the right-hand side `(p | q) & (!(p | q))`:\n   - `(p | q) & (!(p | q))` can be understood as p|q AND NOT (p|q).\n   - According to the rules of logic, this is `0`.\n\n3. Check the structure of the left-hand side to see if it can be equivalent to `0`:\n   - This equation does not directly simplify using one of the given equivalences in a straightforward manner to a final `0`.\n\n- Based on these observations, we try to test a few plausible values for p and q.\n- When p = 1 and q = 0: `(1 & 1) | (0 & 0) ::=:: 1 :::: 1` matches the left side. Right side yields `1|0 & !(1|0) ::=:: 1 & 0 ::=:: 0`.\n- Therefore, any value doesn't directly yield the same equivalence as the right-hand side, meaning the actual left-hand side formula isn't addressed this way equivalently.\n\nTherefore, (1) is valid and (2) is not.\n\nThe answer is [[A];[B]].",

Additionally, it is not a tautology (which would require all paired conjunctive terms) or a contradiction (which would require no paired conjunctive terms).\n\nThus, the correct option is F (None of the above).\n\nAnswer: [[F]]",

Since neither q nor ¬q cancel out directly with another term containing its complement, these do not resolve to 0.\n- Now consider (q ∨ ¬r) and (q ∨ r). These can be resolved because ¬r and r are complements. After dispel, we get q.\n- We add this new clause q to S2, since it has not been seen before.\n- Add q to S2, and now S2 = {q}.\n- Consider clauses involving q, and ¬q now:\n- (q ∨ ¬r) and (p ∨ ¬q) when resolving, give p ∨ ¬r (beyond q resolution).\n- (q ∨ r) and (p ∨ q) when resolving, give p ∨ r (same for symmetry).\n- Keep checking until S2 does not change or gets new things that resolve further.\n\nAfter step 3, we evaluate S2 and see:\n- S2 contains clauses, implying another cycle.\n\nIn the next cycle (Step 3 again with the current S1), we see the clause q and can resolve p ∨ ¬r with q, and p ∨ r with q. Both resolutions remove q, and thus, we are left with p.\n\nThis final resolution with p ∨ p = p (trivial) implies no new results, just a normalizing effect.\n\nAfter a second cycle:\n- We see S2 is empty, leading to \"Plausible\" output.\n\nSo, the algorithm iterates:\n\n- First cycle resolves adding q, leading to a second cycle.\n- Second cycle resolves immediately to empty set S2.\n\nHence, the answer is [[Plausible]; [2]].",

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true.

The initial statement \"Some students are doctors\" can be represented as ∃x (Student(x) ∧ Doctor(x)). The erroneous inference \"Therefore, some students are not doctors\" can be represented as ∃x (Student(x) ∧ ¬Doctor(x)), which is not logically deducible from the initial statement.

This scenario describes a situation where knowledge about individuals is incorrectly attributed or assumed based on the facts, without proper justification for Xiao Qiang's knowledge of this specific relationship.\n\nThe issue here aligns with the `InvSubError` method, which indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about one subject to another. In this case, Xiao Qiang's knowledge about Lu Xun does not automatically entail his knowledge of the specific familial relationship between Lu Xun and Zhou Jianren, making the inference invalid due to improperly substituting the knowledge context.\n\nTherefore, the formal fallacy in the question is:\n[[I]]",

However, the specific description matches the definition more closely of the \"CondSwap Method,\" which explicitly states the erroneous belief that if P then Q, one might incorrectly conclude that if Q then P.\n\nGiven the options and the explanation, the correct answer is the CondSwap Method.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[C]]",
