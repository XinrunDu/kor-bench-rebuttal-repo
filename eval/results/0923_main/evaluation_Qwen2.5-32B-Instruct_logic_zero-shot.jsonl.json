Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8. Thus, this equivalence cannot be universally proven as valid according to the given equivalences rules since the right-hand side simplifies to a contradiction which does not capture the variability of the left-hand side correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A];[B]]",

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]",

Using equivalence (1) (\\(A ::=:: !!A\\)), this simplifies further to \\(p | q & !r\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand side.\n1. By the same process, \\(q⇓r ::=:: !q & !r\\).\n2. Thus, \\(p⇓(q⇓r) ::=:: !p & !(q⇓r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q⇓r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5. Simplifying again using equivalence (1), we get \\(!p & (!q | r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (p⇓q)⇓r ::=:: p⇓(q⇓r) \\) translates to \\(p | q & !r ::=:: !p & (!q | r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p⇑q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: (!p | !q)⇑r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) ⇑ r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)⇑r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6. Applying De Morgan's law, this simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\), which further simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n\nFor the right-hand side:\n1. \\(q⇑r ::=:: !q | !r\\).\n2. So, \\(p⇑(q⇑r) ::=:: !p | !(q⇑r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q⇑r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p | !(!q | !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p | (q & r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: p⇑(q⇑r)\\) translates to \\((p | q)⇑r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\), or more accurately, \\(!(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent either.

This means there is at least one true assignment which corresponds to 0000 in binary or 0 in hexadecimal (indicating that all variables and their negations are false, which is the assignment \\(m_0\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E.
