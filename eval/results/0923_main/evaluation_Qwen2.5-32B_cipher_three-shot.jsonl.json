Here's how this works:\n\n1. **Encryption Table:** A predefined mapping (encryption table) associates each uppercase letter (from A to Z) with a unique symbol or digit (such as `A: '!'`, `B: '@'`, etc.). This table is used both for encryption and decryption purposes.\n\n2. **Encryption Process:** During encryption, each character in the plaintext is replaced by its corresponding symbol or digit from the encryption table if it's an uppercase letter. For instance, if the plaintext contains the letter 'H', it gets encrypted to the symbol '*'.\n\n3. **Decryption Process:** Conversely, during decryption, each symbol or digit in the ciphertext is replaced back into its original uppercase letter using the same encryption table but in reverse. Since each symbol maps uniquely to one uppercase letter (and vice versa), there's no ambiguity in reversing the process. For example, if the ciphertext contains the symbol '*', it gets decrypted back to the letter 'H'.\n\n4. **Uniqueness and Invertibility:** The key feature of this method is that every character in the plaintext has a unique representation in the ciphertext, and every symbol in the ciphertext directly corresponds to only one character in the plaintext. This ensures that decryption can perfectly reconstruct the original text from any valid ciphertext generated by this encryption method.\n\n5. **Preservation of Formatting:** Both encryption and decryption processes preserve the positions of characters/symbols relative to each other within the text, meaning that the structure of the message remains intact throughout these processes.\n\nIn summary, the encryption table provides a clear one-to-one relationship between plaintext characters and ciphertext symbols, allowing for perfect decryption back to the original plaintext when the correct ciphertext is provided.",

First, you need to identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext. Then, you need to adhere to the encryption or decryption operations described in the rules. Finally, make sure to format your output according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n\nCome up with a question and stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would justify this answer: [[ \"msg\" : \"Your password is incorrect\" ]]. To come up with a question and stream-of-consciousness reasoning that would justify the answer you provided, I need to think about what type of scenario would lead to such a response message. It seems like the answer is a JSON object with a key-value pair, where the key is \"msg\" and the value is a string that indicates that a password input is incorrect.\n\nQuestion: What would be the error message returned when a user enters a wrong password on a website?\n\nStream-of-consciousness reasoning:\n- In the context of web applications or online services, a common scenario where an error message like this would be displayed is during the login process.\n- During login, users typically enter their username and password to access their accounts.\n- If a user enters an incorrect password, the system needs to inform them of the mistake to prevent unauthorized access.\n- Error messages are often sent in a structured format, such as a JSON object.\n- In this case, the specific error message to be sent is \"Your password is incorrect.\"\n- To wrap it up in a JSON object, we use the key-value pairing notation.\n\nSo, the question would be:\n\nWhat would be the error message returned when a user enters a wrong password on a website?\n\nAnd the answer would be:\n\n[[ \"msg\" : \"Your password is incorrect\" ]]",
