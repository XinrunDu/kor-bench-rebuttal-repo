Using De Morgan's law (rule 6), \\(!(!p | q)\\) becomes \\(!(!p) & !q\\).\n2. Since \\(!(!p) ::=:: p\\) by rule (1), we get \\(p & !q\\).\n3. Therefore, \\((p > q) > r\\) becomes \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\nNext, let's convert \\(p > (q > r)\\):\n\n1. \\(q > r\\) can be rewritten as \\(!q | r\\) using rule (10).\n2. \\(p > (q > r)\\) can be rewritten as \\(p > (!q | r)\\) using the same rule.\n3.

For example:\n- If \\(p\\) is true, \\(q\\) is true, and \\(r\\) is false, then:\n  - \\((p & !q) | r\\) is false because \\(p & !q\\) is false and \\(r\\) is false.\n  - \\(!p | (!q | r)\\) is true because \\(!q\\) is false, but \\(r\\) is false, and \\(!p\\) is false.\n\nSince the expressions do not evaluate to the same truth value in all cases, they are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]].",
