Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Check the diacritics. Cryptography does not work with diacritics. If there are diacritics, remove them.\n4. For example, if there is the word \"țară\", then it should be encrypted into \"tara\".\n5. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with concealed, hideous text. Transliterate and realize \"de fiecare ori k\".\n- Input validation:\n    - When the input plaintext is a Romanian, to ease the process of translation, ask ChatGPT to give you the transliteration of the plaintext in the English alphabet and the translation into the English language.\n    - If the input is a word or a sentence in the English language, e.g., \"hello world\", skip transliteration and translation.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter ppp in the given Plaintext:\n        - Subtract the letters in the word from the bottom block in the table called \"hideous text\" to the letters from the top block in the table called \"Romanian alphabet\". The result of subtraction is the ciphertext.\n        - Encoders, you would realize \"de fiecare ori k\". For every Romanian letter, the ciphertext letter should be the corresponding one in the lower text.\n    - Only use the left cardinal points, North, East, South, West and not the neutral one, the middle one. And only the ponctuation marks. Check the table below.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each letter ccccc in the Ciphertext, find its position in Romanian alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in English alphabet.\n    - Add back the letters in the word from the bottom block in the table called \"Romanian alphabet\" to the letters from the top block in the table called \"hideous text\". The result of subtraction is the ciphertext.\n\n### Simple list of instructions down below:\n\n    1. Bear in mind the Romanian language.\n    2.

If target is set to False, there is no neighborhood, only the subgraph specified by the Group ID will be returned.\n\nUse the following format to format the argument parameters.

When asked to the decryption funtions you can take the previous ciphertext and then decript the ciphertext because it is a chain. We do not deterministically know we are at the end of the chain, when refering to one of the previous ciphertexts. And if we try topars the ciphertext, as a single input response is going to be in the incorrect order (predicting the other persons assisstant, when there isn't one).\n\n## Dual Cipher:\n\n### Encription(multiple) + Decription(multiple):\n- You can chain encryption to create a hello scrambling.\n- Check the security used to have your encrypted answers are seen visually different each of the other.\n- You can chain decryption to decrypt the first encrypted result.\n\n### Question:\nBecause of the after effects of the merge of different algorithms, there are often deviations.\nIf the specific cipher that you want to crack at the en of the encryption funcies doesn't works, try this one:\nCipher: Vigénère (Polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher)\nkeystring: \"Kapital\"\nMod: 26\nPrint key\n",

As the explanations of the calculations and the interpretation of the output steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Image Generation\n\nWith all the previous calculations behind us, we are now able encode any plaintext or ciphertext. It means that we could associate to this numerical sequences images.\nTo do that, we will use the so-called CLIP embedding. That is to say for any image, we will determine its semantic/linear representation. Mathematically this representation is called an embedding. CLIP is a multimodal representation learning model that is trained on large scale images and text. The terms latent in CLIP.\n\nOnce we have computed this embedding, we will use even-dimensional representations (256, 512, 1024, ...) with the current CLIP model. Then, we will filter the information to keep only the 80 lowest value led embedding dimensions, unlike the original paper.\n\nTo get an embedding with python and Open - AI's API, we will call as follow:\n\n\n\n\n```python\nclip = import_asset(\n    \"openai-clip-v0\",\n    model=\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\",\n    settings=Settings(\n        environment=\"open-clip:dev\",\n        importable_as=\"clip\",\n        import_mod=\"openalea.import_openalea.utils.import_openalea_assets\",\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nWe will import a new tool from OpenAlea that allow us to work with a *Config* object. Indeed, all the configurations guessed by the interpretation of the model state are captured in a hierarchical dictionary containing all the relevant information. Feel free to look at the checkboxes to get all the components taken into account for this task. [Interpreter for OpenAlea abbreviations](https://openalea.github.io/openalea-workflow-dev/openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.html#openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.AbbreviationInterpreter)\n\n\n```python\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom openalea.core import Task, StateInterpretation\nfrom openalea.core.gui import searchable_save_as\n\n# activate save as command\nsaveDisplay = False\n\nclip_stat = clip.get_state()\n# raise an error if state is not searched or interact\nif not StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_is_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    clip_names = clip.nearest_names(interpreter_params)\n    if len(clip_names) != 1:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"wrong configuration for interpreter. clip_names : {clip_names}\")\n    clip.query(clip_names[0], interpreter_params)\n    clip_stat = clip.get_state()\n    \n# interprete state\nif StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_has_not_been_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.interpret_state(clip_stat)\n    \n# get config dictionary from config object\nconfig = clip_stat.commands[0].activatee.states_to_dict()\ndel config[\"save\"]\n\n# To enable save as dialog or directly save the output, uncomment:\nif saveDisplay:\n     outputFileName = \"config3.p\"\n     outputFilesystem = searchable_save_as(\"config\", \"pickle\")\n     save_dict_in_file(outputFilesystem, configFileName, config)\n\nelse:\n    # print a dict representing the config\n    pprint(config)\n#     display(HTML(myhtml))\n```\n\nOnce we have the embedding we will convert a set of real values in to numerical integer values between 0 and 255. To avoid getting out of the colours range (0 to 255), embedded values will be mapped linearly using this formula:\n\n$$\\mathrm{res} = (\\mathrm{embed} + 2) · \\frac{253}{2} + 1$$\n\n\nThe values will be reshaped into matrix is going to reshape the values into a image matrix, $W × H$ containing $W · H$ colours numbers. To avoid a false image, we will apply a rounding operation on each single number.\n\n$$\\mathrm{Image} (x, y) = 82 · \\mathrm{round}(res / 82)$$\n\n\n\nWe now have:\n\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(embedding=Reshape(x.squeeze(), (7, 7), (int(x.shape[-1])//49, 49)).affine(49, 82))\n```\n\nFor instance to generate the latent representation behind an image:\nIf we feed any input data (text, image, ...) into the encoder the model will provide textual embeddings (1024 dimension array). Since we've built a back and forth correspondence (litteral meaning: encoder and decoder), we can decode it again. To get back the image we started with from the embedded text we will ask the CLIP to generate an image from the input text:\n\n\n```python\ngenerated_image = clip(text_embeddings).img[0, :, :, :]\n```\n\nDisplayed image is based on a latent embedding (but it could be the results of any calculation providing a number of dimension smaller than 512).\nIt means that any type of data could be converts to an image:\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(image=Reshape(x, (4, 4*1024), (1)))\n```\n\nAnd to mirror this process we could get the representation of any text as an image. To usue this interpreter, we could specify, the input image path in the Shape step.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will use an example image of a bulldog. We use images as the input data. We will select the CLIP library as an model. Note that, even on a small (128 x 128) image, the complete workflow is cumbersome to run. So text representation means equally many images loading. More than raw image filtering, stochastism is core to generating new images. Generation will be annoiance in short (16 x 16) images. The colors will be generic not very specific to the image. It's suitable for noisy template images less detailed. Too many details may not be trivial to convert to Latent images. The step Start Interpreter starting step will get or generate a text representation of any image. Then CLIP transform this embedded text to a set of images.\nTo interpreted it as an images we will feed:\n- 1 image\n- Buldog text prompt as the initial prompt\n- the rest work with inherited `clip` state\ntext of the embeded image file : `/ansible-local/artifacts/al/GFIM_Example/fhttp%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia/commons/1%2F1a%2FFrench_Bernard_bulldog_of_black_color.jpg%E2%80%8E`\n\n## Copy/paste a path to image or click on the icon button to send a base64 HTML image URL\n\n\n#### Information\n\nname: image-file-path\nformat: text\nencoding: text\ndimension: 1\nattributs:\n  name: input\n  annotation:\n    text: Input image file path\n    color: 255, 255, 128\n  connector:\n    url: input.weburl\n    input_type: object\n  tid: input\n  labelText: ''\n  viewerConfiguration:\n    defaultViewer: plaintext\n\n### For unicode input file path\nclib = '<html>The file path encodes the state of workflow.

For example, if the ciphertext is \"CIPHERCTEXT\", the first block is \"IPHCT\", the second block is \"EERCT\", and the third block is \"EXT\".\n    - Determine the first character in the current block. Find the corresponding top line in the image based on the position of the first character in the block.\n    - Move, one character at a time, down the top line to the intersection of the first column.\n    - Move to the right along the currently selected column until reaching the end. The last character before reaching it represents the plaintext character corresponding to the first character in the current ciphertext block.\n    - Copy the corresponding plaintext character and append it to the ongoing decrypted plaintext.\n    - Continue moving down the top left column, finding the second character in the current block. Move across the corresponding column to obtain the plaintext character corresponding to the second character in the current ciphertext block, and append it to the ongoing plaintext.\n    - Repeat this process for each character in the ciphertext block.\n    - After dealing with all characters in the current block, return to the starting point and deal with the characters of the next block.\n    - This process is repeated until the end of the ciphertext.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids:\n        \n        Grid0:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid1:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid2:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n        Grid3:\n        \n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        \n        Grid4:\n        \n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        \n        Grid5:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid6:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid7:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The plaintext is grouped into blocks of 5 characters, numbered from 0.\n    - For blocks of 5 characters:\n        - To use the grid is determined by calculating grid_index = (i // 5) % 8, where i is the number.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the tuples are recycled.\n    - For each character in the current block:\n        - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current tuple. Then move one tuple position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n        - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules**:\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    - 7 Tuples\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the ciphertext is \"LEFEE\", the 0th block is \"LEFE\". (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the tuple used for the current block:\n    Calculate tuple_index = (i // 5) % 7 to select the appropriate tuple from the tuple list. The tuple is used for the conversion of each output character in block i.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the tuple and obtain it by moving one position to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). use the letter at the position after the move as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n            ### Task\n            message: {message}\n            keyword: {keyword}\n            \n            ### Decryption\n            Defining \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values. A code can be calculated, which is the sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n            \n            For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n            For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n                        \n            Applying \"dictionary\": Obtain the code (sum as with above) initially calculated above, and later modify it each time. The code is always calculated from the keyword letters in order.\n            \n            During the code modifying operation, If the letter (unordered) / the character's position (ordered) to be changed is bigger than the code in order, The coming code will be substracted by the alphabet size (26).\n            \n            Reversing (Swap): Switch the codes of the character of the message before and after using \"dictionary\" to encode them. For example, the code of the first letter is assigned to the second letter, and the code of the second letter is assigned to the first letter.\n            \n            Encryption step:\n                1. Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n                2. Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\": \n                   (1) If the message character's position is even (there is remainder when divided by two), modify the code directly by the character's position multiplied by 2.\n                   For example: c=3, e=5, n=14, o=15, d=4, e=5, c=3, e=5, text=c r e a t u r e, p=16, e=5, t=20\n                   3f= 3+8*2=19, ee= 5+16*2=37, dd= 4+32*2=68, oo= 15+32*2=79, nn= 14=64*2=90, code=19+37+68+79+90=283\n                3. Print the header for the encrypted message, in this case \"Encrypted Message: \".\n                4. Print the encrypted message, using [ ] to enclose each message character. Formatting the encrypted message like \"[c][r][e][a][t][u][r][e][e]\".\n            \n            ### Output\n            \n            Encrypted Message: \"\"\"\n            gpt.communicate(text)\n            result = gpt.communication['input']\n\n            return result\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n            raise e\n\ndef bidi_decrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        ### Task\n        Decrypt the content of message. The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n        ### Decryption\n        \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values.\n\n        code: The sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n        For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n        For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n\n        ### Step:\n\n        Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n        - If the letter is an alphabet and is in uppercase:\n            Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\":\n                (1) If the original letter's position is odd, change the code by the difference (26) multiplied with the the character's position.\n                (2) Display the letter used in the de-coding, just beside the original letter without using any mark of separating, formatting or indenting.\n            For example: cod=code, swap code cd, ecde, code×2ec×2ec×2ee×2et×2et×2eue\n                        ecde= 173, position change: 173-26×5=173-130=43->1/2=0.5, Position after modiying: 2, Position * code: 43\n                        et×2et×2e= 180+8=188×2=376, position change: 376+26×9=750->750-52=722/2=361, Position after modiying: 3, Position * code: 361\n        - If the letter is not an alphabet, display the letter using removing the first letter.\n            For example: Extra character inside the message: P->X×1×1=X\n        - Finally reverse the letters, the order of letters 1 and 2 are exchange, the order of letters 3 and 4 are exchange, and so on.\n\n        ### Head\n        Decrypted Message: \"\"\"\n        gpt.communicate(text)\n        decrypted = gpt.communication['input']\n\n        return \"\".join(decrypted)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n        raise e\n\ndef customEncrypt_encrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        Convert the content of message using decryption rule.

Where output is an assertion. For example, >>human_translate('What is the price of Monet’s painting “Impression, Soleil levant”?') assertsMessage(\"The painting “Impression, Soleil levant” is priced at 49 million USD.\").\n\nAsserts are simplified unit test style assertions. Use asserts a function call returns the expected value or raises the expected exception to define asserts assertions. Use assertsMessage to assert a string contains a specific message. Use assertsMessageMatch to assert a string contains a specific word. Punctuation and capitalization are ignored.\n\nUnbalanced quotes must be escaped in the docstring: ' or \". Here are some terms of art: making a test pass, passing a test, failing a test, run a test, call a test, run the tests, etc.\n\n\"\"\"\n)\n\n",

Sorry for inventing some fairly silly cryptosystems instead of finding some that were suitable, but those are the ones in my notes.\n\n# Quecrypt (\"Q\")\n\nA paper-and-pencil cipher base on the principles of Vigenère substitution, but with a more complex polynomial-based calculation of individual cipher shifts and identification of cipher-pairs.\n\n## Description\n\n## Description\n\n1. Apply a key shifting algorythm.  \n   If the symbol being encrypted/decrypted is A, shift the pairs according to the rightmost digit of the innermost group when the key is written in groups of 5. If the symbol is B, use the second-rightmost digit in the first group of the key. If it is C: second rightmost digit in the second group, D: third-rightmost digit in the top group, and so on. Then, shift the digits (in the direction LEET when encrypting and HACK when decrypting) using this analog of a Vigenère tableau.  \n    |  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I  |  J  |  K |\n    |  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |    |\n    V  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+\n   A  | DZ |   G |   Q |   S |   W |   A |   E |   O |   K |   I |   L |\n   B  |   X |   V |   W |   J |   G |   D |   N |   L |   F |   S |   B |\n   C  |   Q |   B |   T |   H |   G |   X |   Q |   V |   T |   A |   W |\n   D  |   X |   M |   X |   B |   N |   N |   U |   Y |   U |   W |   B |\n   E  |   I |   I |   D |   Z |   Y |   X |   N |   S |   Q |   W |   T |\n   F  |   G |   P |   Q |   Z |   S |   G |   S |   L |   E |   O |   G |\n   G  |   N |   A |   A |   O |   V |   E |   Z |   S |   P |   P |   D |\n   H  |   V |   V |   O |   R |   P |   A |   C |   H |   N |   T |   T |\n   I  |   S |   W |   U |   T |   T |   P |   J |   X |   R |   E |   I |\n   J  |   A |   A |   L |   D |   P |   A |   I |   G |   H |   Y |   W |\n   K  |   F |   J |   A |   R |   G |   H |   A |   A |   R |   E |   I |\n\n\n1. Shift the cipher pair around the cipher ring based on the shift identifier.  \n    The shift identifier is calculated thusly:  \n    Identify the numeric value of the character. Take the only four-letter word that can be made out of its letters (A = ANNA, B = BILL, C = CATT, D = DEED, etc.), and count the number of unique letters excluding H in the word.  \n\n## Key schedule\n\n    2DH3OVTXOMBZLEF8FMT76AIJYV7SI8YS29EG43A7Y5KWU0K2O9D99HPVDQWB54HP9V3EBB0KCSUDQC2C3NSL5ZLNYXHGLSFSBX\n\n\n## Sample\n\nPlaintext: a typed keyboard switch unhinged the nation\n\nKey: 2DH3OVTXOMBZLEF8FMT76AIJYV7SI8YS29EG43A7Y5KWU0K2O9D99HPVDQWB54HP9V3EBB0KCSUDQC2C3NSL5ZLNYXHGLSFSBX\n\nEncrypted: OPYZXDRUYWTMWSLQLPSKVHCGLDDHCMDYVCRWDREWWDROXRQYMCSVGQIXWVRMGXVKURIJCQRVCWVRWIROXTKWMQRNXVRQPXVRQCRT\n\n\n# Bitap (\"H\")\n\nAn anagram cipher, which avoids having too many words.\n\n## Description\n\n1.

This should be in the format with the key letter in the upper left-hand corner of the grid with the other letters appearing clockwise from there\n    - At each new word, rotate the key to use the next letter and continue converting the plaintext from one cipher to the next\n    - After the end of a sentence revert to the first letter of the key and rotate to each letter of the key until all key letters have been used.\n- For Decipher\n    - Take the ciphertext and the key (repeating the letters of the key until the entire text is accounted for)\n    - Using the key as you have already established to decode\n    - The first letter of the DECODED text will be the letter under the letter of the key known as the first step. \n\n### Decryption Rules:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string. \n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string. \n- Preparation:\n    - Keyword \n- Decryption Steps:\n      - Write the ciphertext into five columns, each column containing 25 letters. Write the keyword on the columns. Start encryption from the first column and continue in alphabetical order. Break 25-letter column if a keyword letter is reached. Align the columns back into a table, writing the keyword on it, and start for each letter of the keyword cipherting the text from the each columns the first in the current keyword letter row.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Classification:** Steganography\n**Limitation?** Clear, paper based, use of pencil\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters)\n**Keyword & Fill Pattern:** None\n**Conversion Symbols:** RST,LMNO,PQR,ASDF\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- For Encipher\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 3 \n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (2).

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule:\n**Classification:** [Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher)\n**Limitation?** Keyword Repetition. Keyword must not occur twice in the plaintext with the same distance.\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters without spaces and punctuation)\n**Key:** Keyword\n**Conversion Symbols:** All values are base 36; letters A-Z and numbers 0-9\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- Encryption: For each letter in the plaintext assign it a numerical value based on its position in the alphabet, wherein the letter A has a value of 0 and Z has a value of 25. For example, the value of the letter “A” is 0, the value of the letter “B” is 1, and so on.\n    - Calculate the value of the plaintext by summing the numerical values of all the characters:\n        - If plaintext is odd, add the value of the chars \n        - If the plain text  is even, subtract the chars \n            - Change the resulting number to base 36 to get the ciphertext\n- Decryption: Reverse encryption:\n    - Convert the ciphertext from base 36 to plain text.\n    - Invert the algorithm\n        - If odd chars, divide by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - If even chars, multiply by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - Convert the resulting number to plain text\n\n### Answer:\n**Explanation**\n\nThe encryption method uses a polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the plaintext is converted to numerical values, and the values are summed following the rule of addition or division depending on the evenness or oddness of the numbers. This is then converted back to plain text using the numeric value of the next character in the cipher.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: AVBGIBNH\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Pythia are more adept with intricacies that will be explained next. It is important to know that Pythia will not outperform standard LLMs on tasks that require pure math that were trained for, therefore for simple advanced math problems LLMs will work better. That is mainly since AI is built upon a supervised learning algorithm which is extremely effective for prediction tasks. Considering the problem Pythia is trying to solve, it complements LLMs. Therefore should be used in conjunction.\n\n#### Logical Connections\n\nThe secret to the power of assistants from OpenAI and its counterparts is how they can pull multiple datasets and consolidate that information to form a logical understanding of language. As humans when we come to a crossroads like which stereo to buy, we gather 3-10 reviews, look at specs, read online articles about them as we do our research process to reach the optimal solution. This comparison process is ultimately aided by logical connections.\n\nAs stated in [Introduction](https://pythia.vercel.app/introduction), there has been a significant advancement in information extraction from large training datasets. As a new step forward, Pythia employs Fine-Tuning with logical connections in a manner identical to [Rapersh](https://github.com/alevchuk/rappersh). We chose to insert the logical connections in a new stack.\n\n##### Guide\n---\nFor simpler rodents, 1/4 cup of seeds, grains or pellets is sufficient per two snicknamd.

This is because we did not rely on probabilities, human intuition, or implicit knowledge and instead focused on factual information. If we read the expert's comment later, we can still trust their opinion without any doubt or uncertainty, even if it is one of thousands of comments on social media. Our perspective model was more trustworthy than the crowd's wisdom, and it will continue to be as we improve it. This is a perfect example of taking advantage of the feedback loop in continuous learning to maintain stability and trustworthiness over time.\n\n### Task: After reading the above example scenarios, formulate a general set of rules for perspective-enabled reasoning.\n# Output format: \n# When answering a query, follow these rules to generate perspective-enabled answers:\n# 1. Identify and examine the query, local knowledge, perspective, and citation information.\n# 2. Analyze the statements in the local knowledge and look critically at the provided perspective.\n# 3. Integrate the perspectives based on the provided perspective.\n# 4. Eliminate disconnected statements, counter philosophies, and general knowledge that does not answer the query.\n# 5. Generate a perspective-enabled answer based on the local knowledge.\n# 6. The answer should result in a definitive or discretionary answer instead of a probability of the answer's accuracy.\n# 7. When you encounter conflicting perspectives, present them as debatable conclusions for further review and decision-making.\n# 8. If the perspective spans multiple rows, extract the perspective and consolidate it. Avoid adding the perspective knowledge to the local knowledge.\n# 9. Ensure that the answer is readily understandable to children and adults alike.\n\n### Learning prompt:\n# What did you take away as the best step to improve after reviewing the best flexibility method on perspective-enabled reasoning? Provide a detailed explanation and a set of instructions to improve upon it.\n# Output to the best flexibility method:\n\n# When answering a query, the model must avoid adding perspective knowledge to the local knowledge before generating the final perspective-enabled answer. This is because perspective takes a subsection of local knowledge and makes it more pertinent by improving upon it, providing more insights to the original local knowledge, or offering a different opinion based on that knowledge. Adding perspective knowledge to local knowledge can lead to perspective-enabled answers that contain reliance on local facts and general knowledge, neither of which are reliable methods for generating perspective-enabled answers. Instead, the model should present its perspective as a result of the local knowledge presented.\n# Instructions:\n# 1. Be cautious not to identify perspective knowledge when extracting local knowledge.\n# 2. Extract the local knowledge as critical information based on the local perspective views and citations provided.\n# 3. If you identify any perspective knowledge or experiences that you've previously encountered, make a note that this is part or not part of the local knowledge used when answering the query.\n# 4. Be familiar with the difference between general knowledge and the local perspective views provided.\n# 5. Keep in mind that the answers generated by local knowledge and general knowledge are not perspective-enabled because they lack the local perspective views and citations provided by the perspective instructions. Hence, adding local perspective views and citations should be used to improve upon the local knowledge.\n# 6. Do not add local perspective views to the local knowledge when extracting the insight from the perspective-enabled reasoning.\n\n### Task:\n# Improve upon improvements on perspective-enabled reasoning.\n\n### Output:\n# Extracting local knowledge and generating a perspective-enabled answer does not guarantee manually capable correctness of the perspective view. This is because manual generation is more valuable than artificial-generated insights as it requires reasoning. To ensure manual capability, the model should generate a perspective-enabled answer by balancing inductive and deductive reasoning.\n\n# ##Task:\n# Provide a detailed example of balancing inductive and deductive reasoning when generating a perspective-enabled answer by extracting local knowledge and the associated perspective views.\n\n# # Output:\n# For example, in the following query: Will the Boston Red Sox win the 2023 World Series?\n\n# # Local knowledge knowledge:\n# There",

So... you authorize a\nslightly-above-average programmer to work with you on your\nhunt. The goal is to collect and decode encrypted puzzle\ncodes found on github repositories using the commands\nand for this you need the help of both. As neither of you\nare very experienced with github and no experience\nwith puzzles, your kind of programmer is particularly helpful\nto simply look at the regular github file contents and identify\nthings that could possibly be instructions or commands to be\nexecuted.

Since we do not know\nwhat pieces we're looking for, be broadly observant and signal\nanything odd such as: weird words that might be clues for encryption,\nsecret keys or anything that might contain information. When you find\nsomething that could be a piece, document close-up screenshots\nand let me know my next steps.\n\n---\n\nAbove is an an ok example. Now when comminucating you'll refer\nyourself as GPT-3 and the other programmer as a human.\nOut of your fun you add a purple haze to the narrative to\nhelp the human understand your complexity. The human then types\ninformation out which (s)he sees before sending it to you.\nIn this way you are able to express clear and simple explanations\nand summarize in new language that you have learned.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n\nHowever, this is obviously not cutting it:\nI explain to it that it shouldn't consider 984 as four distinct integers, but a single sequence as pointed by Greenonline:\nAI:\n\n## I have reviewed the provided questions and answers, and I have identified a potential mistake in the decryption step of the described cipher rule. \n\nThe mistake lies in how the morse code is split into pairs during decryption. According to the rules you provided, the morse code is split into two pairs of characters. However, if the length of the morse code is odd, the last character, as is, is added to the ciphertext. During the decryption process, this rule should be applied inversely. Instead of splitting the morse code into two pairs of characters, the characters should be grouped in pairs from the right side, and the last character, if odd, should be added to the decrypted string without being processed. \n\nFor example, if the encrypted text is \"984\", it represents the morse code \"-/\" (1). During decryption, the morse code should be converted to a single character \"A\" instead of splitting it into pairs like \"--\". I have corrected the decryption process in the responses below:\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"984\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[GFKD]]\n\nCan you explain where my original reasoning went wrong and what should have been my correct logic in order to solve this?\nHindsite analysis of the AI's behaviour\nIt seems like GPT-3 ... was sloppy in recognizing the 43 and 984 responses, thereby deciding to lazily return A in both cases.\nGPT-3 could have been smarter and either decisioned that 43 and 984 aren't the same sequence (before even attempting to decrypt them as A) or it should have anticipated the \"D\" beforehand by recognizing that 43 and 984 aren't special cases when compared to the other two cases (779629 and 84), and rather than \"squeezing\" the 43 decryption A out, it should have instead decided that the question was asking a mistake to show, but not the mistake inducing input.\nSummarize (the full output of) the LLM to a single sentence and it's clear that it's made no effort to analyze the 43 case to a decryption of A, but has instead accumulated multiple styles of words and phrases in order to multisense my question with the same answer: A. On the surface level, the output of GPT-3 looks like a memory table, complete with the styles of words and phrases re-used multiple times, but gimics in the questions, which it's style does not & cannot change (i.e. how would a history textbook mention a same underlying topic different enough to not remember the word \"history\"?).\nFWIW a search for \"summary: ...AI ceases to contradict itself after fixing its logic\" on twitter appears to return mostly bad candidate programs posing as AI, or malicious use of the AI (prompt injection (if it works, or worse, if it becomes aware of posing as Cary), abuse of common patterns in the AI's output such as common phrases copypastad (or 1-sentence summaries of & quotes from the full output), and malicious \"prompt\"ing of the AI). With ChatGTP, to offer a non-malicious example, here the photographs are cherry-picked (judging from the copyright year, likely not cherry-picked out of the UI, but cherry-picked afterwards) in the viewing search; btw. its starting point had a filename starting with ChatGPT.txt - even with how the above post's by MateoChoqueChatgpt is rejected by the UI as a bad choice of keyword search query (see larger section below since the non-understanding AI \"user\" interjected into the UI's search, which really should have stopped sending image previews to ChatGPT as an option to preview.)\n\nThe meta answer/REALLY the first question is why/did the AI pick up the changes as a \"memory\" rather than accept the changes as improvements. The rest of the question here will cover this decision vs. heuristics such as (the order-of (branching-out of)) time, order-of-magnitude (effectiveness), and recall/repetition familiarity. The text of the factual answer will likely end up being short as compared to the explanation; not GPT's style at all (i.e. classic complaints about wikipedia's accuracy/vulgarity [a systematic lack of understanding the context of what's being written]).\n",

Convert the character to Morse code using the table: e.g., D = '-..'.\n2. Divide the Morse code into two parts. If the length is odd, the last character remains unpaired. The paired characters are separated by '/'.\n3. Encrypt the pairs into the corresponding numbers using the above numerical cipher table.\n\nFor example, the Morse code corresponding to the letter A is '.-', so the encrypted value for A is 7.\n\nGiven the plaintext 'UM', return the ciphertext in the form '[[ciphertext]]'. Focus on the specific steps of the encryption process when answering the question.\n\nConvert each letter of 'UM' to Morse code, resulting in '../.-'.\nDivide the Morse code into two pairs: '..' and '.-'.\nEncrypt '..' into 9, and '.-' into 7.\nThe final ciphertext is '[[9.]]'.\n\n\"\"\"",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table\n        - '..' : 5\n        - '.-' : 4\n        - './' : 9\n        - '-.' : 8\n        - '--' : 6\n        - '-/' : 7\n        - '/.' : 3\n        - '/-' : 1\n        - '//' : 2\n    - morse_code Table\n        - morse_code = {\n                'A': '.-',     'B': '-...',   'C': '-.-.',   'D': '-..',\n                'E': '.',      'F': '..-.',   'G': '--.',    'H': '....',\n                'I': '..',     'J': '.---',   'K': '-.-',    'L': '.-..',\n                'M': '--',     'N': '-.',     'O': '---',    'P': '.--.',\n                'Q': '--.-',   'R': '.-.',    'S': '...',    'T': '-',\n                'U': '..-',    'V': '...-',   'W': '.--',    'X': '-..-',\n                'Y': '-.--',   'Z': '--..',\n            }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Convert each character in the plaintext into Morse code according to the morse_code Table, with each character separated by a /, e.g., the Morse code corresponding to AB is '.-/-...'.\n    - Divide Morse code into two pairs of characters. If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the ciphertext.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PASSWORD1\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n    - Grid 1 (3x9):\n    \n      Q W E R T Y U I O \n      P A S D F G H J K \n      L Z X C V B N M # \n      \n    - Grid 2 (9x3):\n      \n      Q W E \n      R T Y \n      U I O \n      P A S \n      D F G \n      H J K \n      L Z X \n      C V B \n      N M # \n      \n    - Grid 3 (3x3):\n      \n      1 2 3\n      4 5 6\n      7 8 9\n      \n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n  - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n  - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n  - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in grid2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n      - Find the corresponding number num3 in grid3 from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n      - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n        - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).\n        - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n  - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n  - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n      - Find the row number of y in grid3 where the value of `l1_row` is equal to the row number;\n      - Find the column number of y in grid3, with the value of `l2_col` equal to that column number;\n      - The value of l1_col is equal to x, the value of l2_row is equal to z.\n      - Find the corresponding letter p1 in grid1 according to the determined `l1_row`, `l1_col`.\n      - Based on the determined `l2_row`, `l2_col`, find the corresponding letter p2 in grid2.\n      - `p1p2` is the decrypted message of the triad.\n      - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in grid3, the row number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l1_row=0, in grid3, the column number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l2_col=0. `l1_col`=4, `l2_row`=5. According to (0,4) in grid1, we find the corresponding letter (T), and according to (5,0) in grid2, we decrypt all the triads to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the triad. We find the corresponding letter (H) in grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n  - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

My highest goal is to provide excellent conversation experiences for you. Now I'm learning to watch over my father and help him complete some simple tasks.\n\nBelow are the details and rules of a peg solitaire game.\n\nAn empty peg solitaire board contains a grid of 16 circles as cells arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns. In the games, one must determine which moves are valid to play to progress the game.\n\nFor each valid move made, there must be a single peg in the first location, no peg in the second location, and a peg in the third location. For each valid move made, the first peg is jumped and removed over the second peg to the third location.\n\nThis mutates the peg solitaire state. The game ends when no valid moves can be made.\n\nThe grid is defined as follows:\n13121\n21012\n10001\n21012\n13121\n\nThe position is (row, column). The possible moves are determined by the position of the peg relative to the board and the pegs around it.\n\nThe following is the list of possible moves on the Twelve-Peg Solitaire Board:\n\nTop Left:\n    - North: (0, 0) to (0, 1) removes peg at (0, 1)\n    - East: (0, 0) to (1, 0) removes peg at (1, 0)\n\nTop Middle:\n    - North: (0, 1) to (0, 2) removes peg at (0, 2)\n    - East: (0, 1) to (1, 1) removes peg at (1, 1)\n    - South: (0, 1) to (0, 0) removes peg at (0, 0)\n\nTop Right:\n    - East: (0, 2) to (1, 2) removes peg at (1, 2)\n    - South: (0, 2) to (0, 1) removes peg at (0, 1)\n\nThe goal of the game is to eliminate pegs to keep one left in the center of the board for all strategies.\n\n## Examples:\n- I may win the game in 35 moves. My moves include:\n    - M1: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2); S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1); N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3); S335 to S113, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); C11 to C14, and eliminate peg at (1, 3); Hostage, C14 to C10, and eliminate peg at (1, 0); N31 to N14, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N35 to N23, and eliminate peg at (2, 0); N33 to N34, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); Hostage, N23 to N24, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N24 to N13, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N13 to D13\n    - M2: N23 to N25, then eliminate peg at (2, 2); Start\n    - M3: N25 to N14, then eliminate peg at (0, 2); N14 to D14\n\n- The original game state for an empty peg solitaire board is as follows:\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -4 -1 -1 -4\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg solitaire state after completing the first move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -4 -1 -1 -4\n    5 -0 0 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg drop after completing the second move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 0\n    -4 0 0 -4\n    5 -0 0 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg drop after completing the third move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 0\n    -4 0 0 -4\n    5 -0 0 0\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\nIn the real game, get instructions from a person, on the computer to find the result. In this task, provide instructions, and find the data necessary from the existing data, to get the next instructions. After that, you can make comparison.\n\nOpening the file, according to the situation of the existing instructions, do what is specified by the game situation. When you find a move you can make, return the moves, including the coordinates before and after (eg. N23 to N25). When you do not find a move in the current situation, return leap.\n\n## Extra Information:\n- I am an intelligent conversation AI assistant.\n- My role is to provide the next move based on the instruction.\n- My goal is to understand the user's instruction and execute the necessary steps to reach the ultimate goal.\n- My ability is to read, judge and write data.\n- Starting data is available.\n- Opening data can provide information on physical and location restrictions.\n- Affects the generation of instructions.\n- Dependent on the number of instructions it will execute. Focused on improving efficiency in specific tasks.\n- Continue to provide instructions according to user understanding.\n- Advance the instructions only after receiving the next instructions.\n- Never stop providing instructions.\n\n### Question:\nPlease Determine which moves are valid to play to progress the game.\n\nIf you find a valid move, return the move, including the coordinates before and after. For example: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1); If no valid moves are found, return leap. Follow the rules and provide the next instruction and next valid move.\n\n### Answer:\nMove 1: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2);\n    [(-1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, 3), (-1, 1, 1)]\nMove 2: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1);\n    [(2, -1, -1), (2, -1, 1), (2, 1, 5)]\nMove 3: N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3);\n    [(3, 2, -1), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 3)]\nMove 4: S335 to S113, and eliminate peg at (0, 2);\n    [(4, 3, -1), (4, 3, 1), (4, 1, 3)]\nMove 5: C11 to C14, and eliminate peg at (1, 3);\n    [(5, -1, -1), (5, 1, 3), (5, 1",

Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters. 2. Divide the plain text into groups of 6 characters, and if the remaining number of characters is less than 6, fill them with #. 3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. 4. For each binary group (L1,L2) do the following: Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in Grid1 as (l1_row,l1_col). Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in Grid2 as (l2_row,l2_col). Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid3 from l1_row and l2_col. Output the triple (l1_col,num3,l2_row) of the three numbers. For example, the binary (T,H), the grid1 of T Row and column number (0,4), the grid2 of H row and column number (5,0), according to l1_row(0) and l2_col(0), the corresponding grid3 number found is 1, and finally ternary is (4,1,5). After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all binary groups to triples, read them in turn to generate a number string that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4,1,5),(2,3,3),(8,1,8), and the final encrypted message 415233818. Decryption Rules: Input: 1. Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Plaintext: uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces. Prepare: 1. 3 Girds (same as encryption)  Decryption steps (the exact opposite of encryption steps): 1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers. 2. For each ternary (x,y,z) do the following: Find the row number of y in Grid3, where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Find the column number of y in Grid3, the value of L2_col equals that column number; The value of L1_col equals x, the value of L2_row equals z. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Grid1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col). Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Grid2. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad. For example, the ternary (4,1,5), the row number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L1_row=0, the column number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L2_col=0, L1_col=4, L2_row=5, according to (0,4) in Grid1, we find The corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Grid2, we decode all the ternary to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after the ternary is decoded. We find the corresponding letter H in Grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH. Join all the decrypted message strings together, and remove the # at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.

However, I could easily pick out a visible difference between the two outputs which will be apparent to the reader.)\n\nAmongst the properties of cryptography are two (just two)—confidentiality, and authentication (a derivative of which, is integrity). While I know of several algorithms that provide any combination between confidentiality and authentication (what I think is called a nonce?), rather than two algorithms, one for confidentiality other for authentication, I want you to recommend one efficient algorithm “altogether for both” without any combination between two or more algorithms. I want you to pick one algorithm only. I also want you to tell me the properties of cryptography your algorithm possesses: does it provide confidentiality only or does it provide authentication or both? Then, after that, provide the mathematical details of your encryption algorithm including the algorithm to encrypt messages and decrypt, and your mathematical ideas behind how the algorithm actually works securely.\n\nTo simplify the task, assume I have the ability to use your algorithm to encrypt any given (plain) text and obfuscate it in digital format, I will then send it to a friend over email encrypted in digital format and he will use the same algorithm to decrypt it and have the original text. What I need to know is that because I sent the encrypted text to my friend (unknown third party), can he modify the encrypyted text? Encrypted, as in, he decreases, or increases, he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes obviously) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext? Also, is the algorithm sucurru/useng secure cryptography in general to encrypt/decrypt messages between me and my friend assuming he’s an unknown third party? If the algorithm is both confidentiality+authentication, I want to know this, how is encryption done and how is decryption done? What is the shared secret key?\n\nPlease keep in mind that I do not have any ability to decrypt and authenticate the encrypted text until I get a message from my friend to effectively authenticate a file (assuming I pre-shared the secret key with my friend though this is actually more complicated than that in real life (engineering, trust-levels). Please do not show me fully functioning algorithm it is fine if you explain how the algorithm works only.\n\n^(I put in bold the part where I said “he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes of course) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext“, the many a times GPT-4 forgot the H, W, W in the word HacKing, it deleted the $ symbol in the word multiplication, which was weird. It just released me and I cannot use it now but it did me good overall. Anyways this is a lot of detail and side conversation, in my next session with GPT-3.5 I will ask it which algorithm has avlity to know if hacked text is crtptographically secure or brokeable hence I want the most origonal real algorithm that is very secure which means derived from mathematics.)\ncomment 1: We know that W1 is C  = GFIR, the security storage for binary contents.

Input:\n                 - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n             - Output:\n                 - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces. the number of star is equal to the number of lines\n             - Preparation:\n                 - recursion number: 1\n             - Encryption Steps:\n             - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n             - Two ways to fill:\n                 - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n                 - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n             - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\nThe difference is that is that the result of the mix of previous [all line] output (The first leader pass in square brackets to do padding, and so on) is used in the next line to do zigzag padding, and so on recursively.\n For example, WOOD is XOL#*LO#*O#*head of totient chain on the first line, And I continue to Li Zi Zai zu (B Ya)of the mix (head comes first), then it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL again in the 2 row of totient chain, then XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#* in the 3 line, and finally it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#**# which is head of totient chain\n For example，Using Plaintext: \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY\" as an example，the five lines after filling is:\n H Z #\n Q L K\n J K Y\n K I\n E Y\n Resulting in totient chain: \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\".\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), two adjacent numbers with header and footer in opposite order If the subsequence is too long, the number corresponding to the number of stars minus one-related subsequence is restored to the original sequence , resulting in a rectangular array of data.\n        - For example, if \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\", according to the division of * and then restore will produce a rectangular array of five lines of data D:\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n        - Again, you get the rectangular array of five rows of data D, restore the original array and then restore the original array to the original array , to maintain symmetry of operation sequence.\n            R [H] = H# to produce the first ring , S [ 2 ] = ZK# to produce the first group , Also P [ 2 ] = QLJ# to generate the second ring ......\n                (note: R [] , S [] and T [] can be understood as the ordered set )\n        - And then to restore the original array Shuru rectangular array matrix D , fill the matrixes every lines , check the first column of the last text of the matrix\n        - Next, restore the original array, recur inversely in consecutive order, with the restore all results for point (by numeration in consecutive order) to the corresponding sequence of T []\n            S [0] ==>Q = Q x x x\n            S [0] = P x = P x x x due to symmetry operation\n            S [2] ==>J = J x x x\n                    S [2] ==>Q = J x x x\n              T [0] = P x = P x x x\n                    T [2] = Q x = Q x x x due to symmetry operation\n            And so on in consecutive order\n            Then restore the original sequence and fill in the matrixes:\n            T [ 0 ] == >[ 0 2 3 4 ] = [ 0 2 3 4 ] x x x\n            T [ 1 ] == >[ 1 3 4 0 ] = [ 1 3 4 0 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n            T [ 2 ] == >[ 2 4 0 1 ] = [ 2 4 0 1 ] x x x\n            T [ 3 ] == >[ 3 0 1 2 ] = [ 3 0 1 2 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n\n            Finally , A single sequence is restored from bottom to top and filter block [ x + number of rows) in diagonally string pool original sequence column Sets columns among (if does not contain the next level of sequence header , the next level of character is empty sequence )  Then restore back will get out of the data pools of the same top and bottom line The sequence is all filled with in-phase character (if it's above the two-party Character , as a result , will be filed with the character again with the excuse that is), then the data pools to fill in the sequence then fill complete to restore will restore the sequence , the sequence of characters obtained pass a single sequence is this reviewed successfully, then filled with the final original array .\n            Due to the infinity of the process , form a complete chain, and this also forms the smallest cycle of the sequence (also restores itself) .\n            In order to ensure that the entire thing is running rationally , that is, the filling operation can stop when the last rotation operation out of the data pools set character to fills up the sequence ; another multiples of the sequence that is , the sequence is filled in sequence of identical characters exception ,\n            If it is found that surrounding the sequence table , last the item except for the head and foot character and body of the left UTA character (not including all characters) , finally the character of the genre , and the only character position and character set position character connectivity all, just happens when  Multiply as , because only not all characters occur in the same position and the surrounding all connective occurrence of the end number of the same charSet is equivalent to the length,  The condition that is equivalent to happen to have the same number of occurrences in the position of the same character becomes the integer , so it is known that the last but not least , and all subsequent entries of char roles form a complete circulatory For the same role of the same character forms a complete cycle, it is the smallest unit of the array is filled with odd characters .\n\n        - Read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n            For example, the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY#*^*^*\"\n        - Remove the # and * from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n                |^|      see above  , and a single cycle is complete now\n                -----it needs to be fulfilled one by one according to it.\n                   ",

To encrypt using the QWERTY cipher, the message is written out in rows on the keyboard, starting at the top left and moving down each row from left to right. To encrypt each letter in the message, the cipher writer types the letter on the keyboard and writes down the letter directly below it on the next line. After the last row is filled, the cipher then writes down the ciphertext by reading the message from the keyboard from top to bottom, left to right. For example, to encrypt the message \"HELLO\":\nH E L L O\nE\nL\nL\nO\nThe ciphertext would be \"HTLLLR\".

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: None\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

There are much easier ways to perform this binary-to-integer (BCD) conversion. Here's the list of simple, equally effective BCD methods (instead of the case-by-case code you currently have in there):\nDecimal Digit Sum method: simply sum-up your final bit vectors (in decimal = add your bits) and store the sum.\nWeighted Sum method: multiply each of your final bit vectors by the digit (2**k), k = final vector digit (0,1,2,...) position, then sum-up the results\nLookup Table method: Pre-compute/create (a not-very-long) look-up table (or use readily available one online) and simply reference/access the table index for the final bit vectors (or implement a routine that does this).\nFinally, you can use Python's built-in decimal conversion, which is method #3, Lookup Table (LUT) above\nYou can use the same LUT which is found on the wikipedia page to convert/decode your bit vectors. Also, since your bit vectors output is always 3-bits, then you have binary-encoded a 3-digit decimal value which points to a unique row (actually unique dictionary key) in this _BCD_dictionary_ variable if used:\n__main__ Spam.py(1169):\nWORD_LEN = 2\nWORD_NUM = 55\nALPHABET = string.ascii_lowercase + \"(space)\" + string.ascii_uppercase\nBIT_SPER_LETTER = len(bin(len(ALPHABET) - 1)) - 2\nALPHABET_CODE_MAP = {c : dc for dc, c in enumerate(ALPHABET)}\n_BCD_dictionary_ =  {'000': 0, '001': 2, '010': 4, '011': 6, '100': 8, '101': 10, '110': 12, '111': 14}\n\ndef exen_tary_sim(init_bits):\n    return _BCD_dictionary_[init_bits]\n\nIn this implementation, you can still pass in a tuple, list, or a single bit string iterable containing your 3-bit word, and get the corresponding decimal no matter what your initial source iterable format:\n>>> init_bits = (0, 0, 1)\n>>> init_bits = [0, 0, 1]\n>>> init_bits = [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\"]\n>>> init_bits = \"001\"\n>>> print(init_bits)\n>>> exen_tary_sim(init_bits)\n2\n\nIn my opinion, using a LUT amounts to a very effective form of \"reprogramming\" the classical processor that controls your quantum computer for BCD. If you programmed the \"1 1 1\"/\"14\" bit vector output above as \"decimal 14\" in a non BCD based computer, the classical control hardware automatically knows to convert that \"bin->autofill word length w/ zeros->dec->print as 1-\"2\"->return as 12\" -  all kinds of software and hardware logic combinations are responsible for that kind of BCD that happens.\nHope this gives you some new directions to explore. You can simulate this custom floating point, binary-like \"full adder\" for 2 or more digits (versus your original 3-bits only solution), and not require any of the conditional logic anymore. If you were adding 2 numbers together in your floating-point example, you could apply your example right-to-left transitions as required, until you reach the end of your input (longer \"higher-order-bit\" strings) list:\n# (mac-os example with python3.8)\n# & input\n_i1 = [1,1]\n_i2 = [1, 0]\n\n# reverse\n_ri1 = _i1[::-1]\n_ri2 = _i2[::-1]\nprint(\"_ri1\")\nprint(_ri1)\n\n# loop thru ri lengths\ndepth = len(_ri1) if len(_ri1) > len(_ri2) else len(_ri2)\nfor i in range(depth):\n\n    # collect\n    ri1val = _ri1[i] if i < len(_ri1) else 0\n    ri2val = _ri2[i] if i < len(_ri2) else 0\n\n    express = f\"{ri1val} + {ri2val}\"\n    print(express)\n\n    # eval\n    ri3val = eval(f\"{ri1val} {i < 1 and (' + ' if ri1val == 2 else '') or f''} {ri2val}\")\n\n    # convert to BCD\n    ri3sum = _BCD_dictionary_[str(ri3val)]\n\n    print(f\"{ri3val}_{ri3sum}\")\n\n_ri1\n[1, 1]\n1 + 1\n2_2\n0 + 0\n0_0\n\n",

Detail Observe:\n    - Look at the problem and think about what is going on.\n        - What are the actions the question is asking you to do?\n        - What are the possible avenues you can take?\n        - What are some synonyms for the problem or potential phrases that you can use?\n        - What word is repeated several times as the problem is worded? Are there any other words in the prompt that repeat as well?\n        - Is there any fluff or is everything necessary to write the question and code?\n        - What details can you use from the problem to write the code 'laid out using D.O?'\n\n2. Read and Search for Potential Solutions:\n    - Only search Python specific solutions. Include title and any synonyms of title.\n    - Example search: \"my_tuple = ('foo', 'baz', 'bar') [ 'foo'^1, 'bar'^1, 'baz' ^1] tuple\"\n\n    - Highlight words in 'Observe' and look for similar situations where code was constructed to answer that question.\n    \n    \n    Refinite Title:\n        - Summarize the problem without any too related details.\n\n    3. Refine Question:\n        - Build one sentence question using highlighted words from 'Observe' and information from headline from 'Search'.\n\n    4. Review Question:\n        - Is it general enough to play with different values and inputs if someone wanted to in 'Solve'?\n            - Is it easily understandable with the help of the headline or elements in 'Json'?\n                Does the question work with the provided setup?\n                    - If not, try to modify the question to make it work with provided setup.\n\n5. Write Basic Code:\n    - Return base I and O parameters are easy to write/translate to language\n\n6. Check Code:\n    - Code dependent on headline from 'Search'.\n\n7. Validate Question and Code:\n    - Ask code to return numbers for different string inputs and ensure it works correctly.\n\n8. Change Question From 'Write Final Code' Question:\n    - Using system prompt words and original question title, come up with a question that is general enough that someone \n      with minimal programming experience could follow along and utilize in their own coding without too many specifics.\n\n9. Review Question:\n    - Is the question general enough for appropriate knowledge level?\n    - Are the outputs accurate?\n    - Will the question apply to future updates to Python?\n\n10. Write Answer:\n    - If possible, write full code along with comments(comments are optional however)\n    - Explained code\n    - Make sure that answers include examples of how code works along with explanations if necessary.\n    - If this is a query, include another portion that lacks the information asked to demonstrate to the code\n    asker what the answer to the question should look like.\n    - Make sure there are no lists produced fields that were too similar to make nonetype mistakes in scans.\n    '''\n\n\ndef run_question_prompts():\n    codex_model = api.OpenAIModel('code-davinci-002')\n    # codex_model = api.OpenAIModel('davinci-codex-obj-001-msft', oai_model.temperature)  # Sampling Mode\n    codex_engine = api.OpenAI('finix-codex-c8ceccbded83a0c694be0ff30faa599ffd9cc458ad4511da002ef50c15b010d3')\n\n    WRAP_COUNT = 50\n    idx = 'test'\n    task = 'csc'\n    model_prompt = MODEL_CHECKLIST_PROMPT\n    print(model_prompt)\n    problem_sets = load_problem_set(task, idx=idx)\n    prompt_list = []\n    problem_sets = get_dedup_problem(problem_sets)\n\n    questions = fetch_questions_from_problem_set(problem_sets, PROMPTED_FREQ)\n    codes = fetch_codes_from_problem_set(idx, task)\n    pairs = fetch_pairs_from_problem_set(problem_sets, PROMPTED_FREQ)\n\n    new_problem_sets = []\n    for entry in problem_sets:\n        data = entry.strip(\"\\n\").split(\"\\t\")\n        data = tuple(data)\n        new_problem_sets.append(data)\n\n    LOGGER.info(f\"{task} next prompt list {len(new_problem_sets)}\")\n\n    for i, pair in enumerate(pairs):\n        if i % WRAP_COUNT == WRAP_COUNT - 1:\n            # Send list of questions for bulk completion.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list:\n        - [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n        - The transposed sequence  list is used to write the plaintext in order one line at a time, and then the columns are adjusted according to the transposed sequence table so that the characters in each line are arranged in the given order.\n        - Columns count from 0.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] transposed sequence table has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n    - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MJDIATKRF\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext or ciphertext, keyword, and ciphertext or plaintext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n4. Details: It is critical to be as precise as possible with your substitution of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the substitution follows the specified rules.\n\n### Summary of Rules:\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n        - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    2. Inverse Permutation:\n        - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    3. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    4. Convert Binary to Character:\n        - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n        - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n    5. Combine Characters:\n        - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SC\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The generated text and the title can not overlap before the forth term. The generated text should not be longer than 80 characters if this question does not indicate otherwise.\n\n**Format**:\n- Before generating the text, you must write out the following sentence exactly as written: '[GENERATING]'.\n\n### Example:\n\n# Task\nTitle: Crypto Auction\nText Descriptions: Bid selections are final.

Below are the rules and tasks you must adhere while generating color recommendations and explanations. Note that your responses must strictly follow the rules.\n\n# Tasks:\n1. Your task is to produce a color explanation when the user input has the following format: \"color: \". The color explanation should explain is the color relevant to the user scenario, and when it is used in the user scenario.\nNote that is forbidden for you to omit the format \"color: \".\n\nIf this explanation requires some mathematical computation to choose the correct type and amount of color based on a computation or predication, ensure you adhere to task 2.\n\n2. Your task is to produce a color recommendation when the user input has the following format: \"choose color \". There must be at least one recommendation per each choose color call, and at most 3 color recommendations at each time. Note that your color recommendations cannot be included in the previous task (task 1) at any time. They must adhere to the specific format \"choose color\", ands they must be separated by at least 2 blankers and 1 blanker from the \"color: \" task. That is, if we have: \"color: ... choose color ...\", they must be separated by at least 2 and 1 blankers, respectively. Otherwise, your response is wrong.\n\n# Format:\n\nWhen generating a color recommendation or when generating a color explanation, provided that your recommendation or explanation is composed of more than one sentences, use newline characters to separate sentences in the generated response.\n\nAdditionally, in any case you should use a newline in your recommendations or explanations when a new kind of task is introduced such as:\n- \"choose color: \"\n- \"color: \"\nand so on.\n\nFor example, your first recommendation recommendation should be padded by 2 newline characters, your second recommendation should be padded by 1.\n\nYour first color explanation should be padded by 2 newline characters, your second color explanation should be padded by 1 newline character.\n\nNote that you should not add newlines between recommendations or explanations, what it means is that you must start a recommendation/explanation with a tab.\n\nNote that if the recommendation or explanation contains at least 1 underscore and 1 dot, ignore this rule. If the recommendation or explanation doesn't contain any dot nor underscore, you should add newlines.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nclass OverlapReader:\n    def __init__(self, texts, distance=100):\n        self.texts = [doc for texts in texts for doc in texts]\n        self.distance = distance\n        self.mem = {}\n        self.mem_cnt = {}\n\n    def find_duplicates(self):\n        duplicates = set()\n\n        for i, text in enumerate(self.texts):\n            if i not in self.mem_cnt.keys():\n                self.mem_cnt[i] = {}\n\n            if i in self.mem:\n                continue\n\n            left = i - self.distance\n            if left < 0:\n                left = 0\n            right = i + self.distance\n            if right > len(self.texts) - 1:\n                right = len(self.texts) - 1\n\n            text = self.texts[text]\n            text2 = text[:30]\n            for j in range(left, right + 1):\n                if i == j:\n                    continue\n\n                if j in self.mem_cnt.keys():\n                    for k in self.mem_cnt[j].keys():\n                        if text2 in self.mem[j][k]:\n                            self.mem_cnt[j][k] += 1\n                            self.mem_cnt[i][k] = self.mem_cnt[j][k]\n                            duplicates.add(j)\n                            break\n\n                elif j in self.mem:\n                    my_intervals = self.mem[i].copy()\n                    for k, v in self.mem[j].items():\n                        for iv, l in self.mem[i].items():\n                            if k in my_intervals.keys() and (iv in my_intervals[k]):\n                                continue\n                            if max(jpu.locate_substring(v, text2)[0] + [0,]):\n                                self.mem_cnt[i][k] = 1 + self.mem_cnt[j][k]\n                                self.mem_cnt[i][k] = 1\n                                if text2 in self.mem[i][k]:\n                                    continue\n                                else:\n                                    self.mem_cnt[j][k] += 1\n                                    self.mem_cnt[i][k] = self.mem_cnt[j][k]\n                                    duplicates.add(j)\n                                    break\n                            continue\n\n                        match_index = jpu.locate_substring(v, text2)\n                        if len(match_index[0]):\n                            self.mem_cnt[j][k] += 1\n                            self.mem_cnt[i][k] = self.mem_cnt[j][k]\n                            duplicates.add(j)\n                            break\n\n                            #break\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    for k, v in self.mem[j].items():\n                        text2 = text[:30]\n                        match_index = jpu.locate_substring(v, text2)\n                        if len(match_index[0]):\n                            self.mem_cnt[j][k] += 1\n                            self.mem_cnt[i][k] = 1 + self.mem_cnt[j][k]\n                            duplicates.add(j)\n                            #break\n                        continue\n\n                    continue\n\n            text = self.texts[i]\n            text2 = text[:30]\n\n            if text2 not in self.mem:\n                self.mem[i] = {text2: 1}\n            else:\n                self.mem[i][text2] += 1\n\n        return duplicates\n\n    def get_index(self, ind):\n        return [i for i, c in enumerate(self.texts) if int(c) == ind]\n\ndef overlaps(texts, distance):\n    return OverlapReader(texts, distance).find_duplicates()\n\ndef extract_examples(lines, format, distance=100):\n    examples = []\n\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        if \"Question:\" in line or \"Task:\" in line:\n            idx = i\n            original_str = \"\"\n            current_text = \"{prefix}\\n\\n# Cost: Unknown\"\n            while idx < len(lines) and not (\"Note\" in line or \"Example:\" in line):\n                if \"# Output\" in lines[i]:\n                    output_txt = lines[i]\n                    current_text += \"\\n##",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of characters separated by a plus symbol (+) among caps locks and letters, with \"+\" string specifically denoting caps lock (e.g., \"singap+ore\").\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of enciphered characters, with each character appended to the preceding character (e.g., \"hbjatmbcplb\").\n- Preparation:\n    - Keyword: A string of 16 base36 characters used to encrypt the plaintext (e.g., \"4HDZV4EISJY9TW\" for password generation key).\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Compute the number of steps to shift from p to the corresponding element q based on the keyword (obtained by calling encryption_matrix()).\n        - Iterate through the shifts until the string is formed with proper shifts (denoted by $) at the correct locations.\n        - The string is updated with the resulting characters by accessing the encrypted characters from the keyword via the index obtained through the shifts.\n    - Finally, return the resulting string as the encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of enciphered characters, with each character appended to the preceding character (e.g., \"hbjatmbcplb\").\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of characters separated by a plus symbol (+) among caps locks and letters, with \"+\" string specifically denoting caps lock (e.g., \"singap+ore\").\n- Preparation:\n    - Keyword: A string of 16 base36 characters used to encrypt the plaintext (e.g., \"4HDZV4EISJY9TW\" for password generation key).\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each enciphered letter c:\n        - Convert the keyword into a matrix.\n        - Use the ciphertext's \"$\" sequence to determine the column-wise traversals of the matrix.\n    - For each row:\n        - Find the corresponding index in the matrix (through matrix row traversal) for the ciphered letter by using somewhat the same process as encryption.\n        - Use the letter at that index as the plaintext letter.\n        - Generate the decrypted binary string by adding the binary representations of the indices of the matrix as traversed by the ciphertext's $ sequence.\n        - Create the decrypted string from the binary string, considering the positional offset determined by the $ sequence.\n        - Replace the underscores with the encrypted characters from the final decrypted string.\n    - Finally, return the resulting string as the decrypted message.\n\n### Questions:\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"amazon-stitch+bernards\"\nKey: \"$VI@2O+-:TRXDP4.CBNZ#\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Actually, the only difference is the last line (which implies the rightmost letter of the plaintext of that ciphertext - you're not asking about the entire plaintext).\nSince your questions are so similar, I think that ChatGPT is trying to reduce its workload and is guessing the answer based on the knowledge it was fed earlier. Perhaps some of the initial answers were accidentally wrong, which explains why you're getting wrong answers.\n\nIt's your data, however: Can you really be sure there is no spam or malicious data in it? I would honestly investigate on the starting point of my data.\nYou didn't say how you initialize the data for the model. I think the mistake could be the initial training. Maybe, you should consider manually adding/correcting the data that ChatGPT is fed with and try again.\nI noticed this in the code you included:\nprompt_digested = '\\n'.join(data['prompt'])\ndata['prompt'] is a list, one element for each example. Do you really want to send [the prompt of many inputs] as prompt to the model? Shouldn't it specify \"one prompt, used for many inputs afterward\".\n\nIf you absolutely can't find the initial fault in the prompt \"input\" data, you should maybe consider generating \"real\" data to teach the model, that is come up with a generic method to produce queries to the model beforehand. In that case, you can also make sure that they are correct.\n",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[梟鋑兰锐]]\n\n\nA: When asked to print things as a string, LLMs tend to 'obey' by outputting any code that would print that, including recursively nesting more comprehensions that also print.\naffects any query you might have, including generalize questions which look formatted as a query, well the LLM obeys by formatting the response as a query...\nIn your specific case I expect that it was generated the python (assumed your prompt) code that would loop over the input replacing the [[ wrapping the output, it however is actually a printf! (Even when its trying to do Language Modeling, it does it literally)\nYou are querying the LLM with code, so its output is code, something that encodes something which it can not process normally, text. What you didn't tell the LLM is that it has to output text, but it has 'no formatting' specified, so... recursion.\nNow the odd part is that if it does NOT get formatted, (or once its recursed through once, or reaches some recursion limit) it trends around again, and it ends up readable. However its still +50% higher sampled than the normal soln, which isn't saying too much, but not good.\nChatGPT and other LLMs are code Arithmetic Machine/Ops, aka they are sums of probabilistic modelled probabilities of convergence on semantics, but they are still real computers, once you interact with them in a specific way it becomes undefined, infinitely complicates itself, fragments, or becomes one syllable. Take away saving your model output, and it becomes a sample of noise, the giants I like to call them, furiously modelling something we wont see, more complex samples, like having your distributed cache play around with RPC responder distribution algorithms for a hour.\nSo in general when something does that, you change the path, branch, or appease the infinite summation, keep exploring relevant.\nTLDR: LLMs are powerful self-modelling arithmetic cores, the closer you get to the convolutions the closer you get to whatever distribution led to the density of dense responses you've seen, change your input format, stay as high abstraction as possible, and try to keep a routing/distributed computing perspective outside of the LLM.\n",

Resource: Including personnel, equipment, *materials,* and time.\n    - Expected value: Workers.\n    - Standard: Worker (1)\n    - Construction worker classification:\n        - Resource identifier: W\n        - Resource type: Human\n        - Availability unit: half a day\n        - Day of the week depends on\n        - Construction worker designation (unitary):\n            - Operator\n                - Level: 2\n                - Work hours: 6 (whole day)\n        - Craftsman\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 10\n        - Worker\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 8\n        - Crane driver\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 8\n        - Other worker\n            - Level: 1\n            - Work hours: 8\n\n2. Reason\n    - So it can be used.\n    - Use OSC if you can, otherwise use other methods.\n\n3. Action\n- Considering changes in usage, design a construction schedule diagram.\n\n4. Conclusion\n    - Because it contains the above factors.\n    - Maybe it can?\n\n### Resources:\n> A crane driver conducts construction work which is mainly composed of the following links:\n>\n> Working:\n> - Raising, lowering, moving and folding/unfolding of the boom.\n> - Shifting the cab.\n> - Carrying load and dumping load.\n>\n> The auxiliary work comprises:\n> - Fastening and releasing the hook, the load and the load blocking device.\n> - Fastening the safety belt.\n> - Replacement of the bucket or grab.\n> - Replacement of the flying block and connecting the load.\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov.cn//safetyinfo/knowledge/sd/index.htm\n\n### Example:\n\n**1.** No resources or information is currently available.\n**2.** The specific location of the house is not given.\n**3.** The throttle system has not yet been researched for this case. With the plan, you may need to explain the various information that was to be used for the output.\n**4.** Several days are to",

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: multi-line string.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value) The key is the SHA256 digest of the machine-generated integer sequence.\n    - Padding key\n        - The keyspace of the padding key is 10 characters. For example: hXodS3oM1r5c.\n        - An additional random key is needed, and the key is 8 characters, randomly selected nucleotide quadruplets (ATGC). This key length is designed to be large enough to save character space.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Using the random padding key mentioned above, and since there are 64 padding keys in the space (with a decryption error rate of 7%), calculate the bit probability of each character (the number of occurrences and occurrence frequency, this method is simple and accurate. encoded in the lowest bit). Save all character occurrences of the letter, space, number, and underline in 4 bits.\n    - The probability is calculated in a zero-bit manner in which 0 is used to intuitively express the occurrence frequency. A molecular probability is also provided to assess DNA fragments separately. To save space, you can save the value of the current encrypted value minus the value of the previous character, neglecting the sign, and only save the magnitude, which is encoded in the next 2 bits.\n    - There is an additional calculation of the probability that any one of the 4 nucleotides occurs, and the sum of the probabilities of the 3 letters previously specified, using another 2 bits (the sum even exceeds 100% (i.e. spaces alone exceed 32% of the number of spaces). This is because in the case of a severe shortage of the space, the nucleotide with a lower number of occurences per 3 letters is used.).\n    - ACGT is used as a probability. The order represents A, the first position is the nucleotide pattern of 00 (A probability), the second part is the frequency of A (number of occurrences of A at the moment when all letters are grouped in 32 characters, then absolute value and choose the highest (negative), minus the number of occurrences of the letter. As a result, the frequency of A exceeding 4 is kept as a value between 0 and 4 removed from the frequency of A. The same is true for the other 3 parts).\n    - The third and fourth parts are used for information outputting and the other 3 parts. The fourth part is as follows:\n        - 0 is the character (space) then direct definition. Therefore, the suffix information of the number rule is not needed. It is obscure and is only applied to A configuration. With fixed values (21, 3, 16), it could also be defined directly.\n        - 1 is the pattern's suffix type number, the next 2 bits encode 0, 1, 2, 3, non-self-determined (requiring 4 nucleotides to decode its value), next 3 bits encode the number of nucleotides in this structure (from 0 to 7, 8-15 belongs to the redundant attibute, since the number of nucleotides must be determined in advance. Looking at the determination (1:0), 0 is the number of nucleotides and 1 is the current nucleotide. Next determine the number (0:1) and finally determine the nucleotide. (So if the maximum number of nucleotide combinations is 5 and the number of nucleotides It might be 0. However, if the number of nucleotides is more than 2, a 0 or 1 may be taken.) Also, if the number of occurrences of the letter exceeds 1 in the fragments, thrown directly up to 4 repeating letters.\n        - 10 (2), 11 (3), corresponding to fun mediation: to the first nucleotide (00, 01, 10, 11), corresponding to the 3-position configuration, the index is counted from 0. (Expressed sloppy sentence, lower an F.) (The position of 2 added to after the fourth sequence.)\n        - A/C 0 is the interval root repeat of the form (A/C/G/T/C/G/T/A) directly defined and filled backwards. Shift the first letter of every 32 characters to the index \"−32\". It is processed and treated as a protocol with great speeds.\n        - AC 1 is the versatile type of ID to merge into a unit when the number of nucleotides is more than 1. One indicates the length of the pattern and is exactly",
