Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, always ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n        \n        Strategies to solve a problem:\n        - Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n        - Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n        - Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.Example YQL query:\n        \n        Q1: Convert the following statement into a logic expression: \"If p1 = False, then p2 = True if and only if (~(p1 & ~p2)).\"\n        A1:\n        ```\n        Given: If p1 = False, then p2 = True if and only if (~(p1 & ~p2))\n        \n        Explanation:\n        When p1 is False, we need to ensure that the statement (~(p1 & ~p2)) is equivalent to the statement \"if p1 = False, then p2 = True.\"\n        \n        Since p1 is False in this case, the statement \"if p1 = False, then p2 = True\" can be simplified to just p2 = True.\n        \n        The expression ~(p1 & ~p2) is the negation of the logical AND operation between p1 and its negation (~p2). This means that whenever p1 is False, the negation of (~p2) is True and vice versa, ensuring that p2 is True.\n        \n        Therefore, for p1 = False, ~(p1 & ~p2) is indeed equivalent to \"if p1 = False, then p2 = True.\"\n        \n        <br/>\n        ```\n        \n        \n        Q2: Evaluate the truth of the statement: \"If p1 = False and (~p1 & ~p2) is True, then (p1 || p2) || p3 is True.\"\n        A2:\n        ```\n        Given Statement: If p1 = False and (~p1 & ~p2) is True, then (p1 || p2) || p3 is True.\n                \n        Let's evaluate the statement step by step.\n\n        p1 = False (Given)\n        ((~p1) & (~p2)) is To be evaluated if its True\n        (&) It's False \n        (False) || p2 (False as OR with false is False)\n        p3 is True.\n\n        Although (~p1 & ~p2) is True, the statement (p1 || p2) || p3 depends on the truth value of each component. Since p1 is False and (~p1 & ~p2) is True, it means p2 is also False. Therefore, (p1 || p2) || p3 becomes (False || False || p3).\n\n        Now, since || is the logical OR operator, it requires at least one component to be True for the entire statement to be True. But in this case, both p1 and p2 are False. Therefore, the statement (False || False) will be False. Regardless of the truth value of p3, (False || False || p3) will stay False, and the entire statement is not True.\n\nSee how it only focuses on the logic and doesn't seem to use any of your specific prompt.\nIt also ends the explanation with <br/>, which looks like it's just using a \"labeling strategy\"\nEmbedding patterns in comprehensive scenarios\nTo verify, the new prompt included in the fixed fields is:\n        - Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n        - Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n        - Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n\n\n        You are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks.

Because the type of \"$\" in the given formula is \"&\", the truth value of \"$\" must be \"0\"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\"\n        Because the truth value of \"$\" is\" 0 \", the overall truth value of\" (!p>q)&(r>q) \"must be\" 0 \"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$) \"\n        Because the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\" is \"0\", the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be \"0\"\n\n        The truth value of \"p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is obtained according to the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\"\n        Because\" (((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is\" 0 \", it can be judged that the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be\" 1 \".\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEXAMPLE_PROMPTS = {\n    \"LogicOnlyPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICONLYPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDMOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithHintPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHHINTPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithWrongPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHWRONGPrompt\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM4,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n\"LOGICWITHRULES3\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES3\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM43,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES12\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES12\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM2,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCRAME\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCRAME\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CRAME,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"Dialglogic2\":{\n\"type\":\"Dialglogic2\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_DIALOG22,\n\"DialgExampleFormat\":\"Example: {QUES}{SEP}{REFERENCE}{QUERY}{ANSWER} Use ⊃, &, ~, T standing between $\\forall x$ is a negative proposition, For simplicity, you can use x and y to replace, for universal quantifiers, The following table is the truth table of ⊃:\" ,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCROWNLAB\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCROWNLAB\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CROWNLAB,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_RIGGEDPOWERSET,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICFROMANACRT\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICFROMANACRT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_FROMANACRT,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\":{\n\"type\":\"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_WORD_SUBSTITUTE,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n}\n\n}\n\nCOCO_DATASET = \"https://aiacademy.qq.com/a/201807204365b9318890feff0f6372066a91bdabd863?outid=d66:d1ff19ba2bdbc75ff2dd204fee069d8152da8c711482ab712",

The answers should be the literally format and the right variable answer like: Formula 1 is the same as formula 2, then process. And replace all the symbols.\nThe answer format is like \n[[Is it same?=...];[If same, how to derive this conclusion=...]]  (as a complete piece of text, substitute the ... with real text like quotation marks.)\n\n\n### Answer\nFormula 1 is the same as formula 2.\nUsing this formula to prove they are equal:\n∀x,x∈sequence(TA1(x)⨀TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))∧∀x,x∈sequence(TA2(x)⨀¬TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))\n####\nThe answer is Formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe proof of their equivalence is as follows:\n\nLet formula 1 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((TA1(x)∨TA2(x))⟶TP1(x)))∧(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∨¬TA2(x))⟶TP2(x)))\n```\nand formula 2 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∧¬TA2(x)⟶TP2(x))∨(TP1(x)∧TA1(x))))\n```\n\n1. We first demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2.\n2. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_1$ such that formula 1 is true.\n3. We then prove that formula 2 is also true under $v_1$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) is also true, regardless of the truth of TA2(x).\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then the truth assignment of TA2(x) is irrelevant (condition (b) TP2(x) will always satisfy condition (a) TP1(x)).\n\n4. Therefore, it is possible to construct a truth assignment for formula 2 under which formula 2 is true, which also satisfies the truth assignment for formula 1.\n\n5. Next, we demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1.\n6. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_2$ such that formula 2 is true, and prove that formula 1 is also true under $v_2$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TA2(x)) and (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) are false and true, respectively, so their disjunction is true.\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then their disjunction is true, regardless of the truth of TP2(x).\n\n7. Therefore, we have demonstrated that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2, and any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1. Thus, we conclude that formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe answer format is:\n[[Is it same?=Yes];[If same, how to derive this conclusion?=The above proof]]",

If p1 has the value T, then p2 must also have the value T due to V(p1, p2) = 1. If p1 has the value F, then p2 must also have the value F. However, V(p1, p2, p3, p5, p6) = 3 does not provide any additional restriction on the values of p1 or p2. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of p1 and p2 with the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nLet p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 be mutually exclusive simple propositions, p6 be a complex proposition, and T and F be the two logical values.\nDefine V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩) to be the number of the simple propositions with the same value as p1 in the sequence ⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩.Also, use V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩) to represent the value of V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩).\nIf p5 = > p6 and the values of the simple propositions are as follows:\nV(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3, determine the values of p1, p2, and p5.\nExplain briefly why your answer is correct.\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given information, we have:\n1. V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1: This means either both p1 and p2 have the same value, T or F, or exactly one of them has the value T.\n2. V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1: This means either all four simple propositions have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T.\n3. V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3: This means three of the six propositions have the same value, which can be either T or F.\n\nFirst, from the second piece of information, we know that either all simple propositions p1, p2, p3, and p4 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. Let's examine the two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: All have the same value:\nIf all four simple propositions have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have the same value as p1 and p2 due to the first piece of information (V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1). In this case, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 4. However, the third piece of information (V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3) indicates that three of the propositions have the same value, which is a contradiction to the possibility that all four simple propositions have the same value. Therefore, this possibility cannot be true.\n\nPossibility 2: Exactly one of p1, p2, p3, and p4 has the value T:\nIn this case, we have that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T, and exactly one of p3 and p4 has the value T. Therefore, V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1 holds true. Furthermore, since at least one of p3 and p4 has the value T, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1 also holds true. Now, we consider the third piece of information, where V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3. There are two possible scenarios:\n1. Exactly one of p5 and p6 has the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must all have the same value, which can be either T or F. Since this is similar to Possibility 1, we know that it cannot be the case.\n2. Exactly two of p5 and p6 have the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must also have two propositions with the value T. From the first piece of information, we know that either both p1 and p2 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. If both p1 and p2 have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have different values due to the second piece of information. However, this would make V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, it must be the case that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T. Hence, we have (p1 = T, p2 = F) or (p1 = F, p2 = T).\n\nNow, we can determine the values of p5 and p6. Since V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3, we know that both bits are 1.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are:\np1 = T\np2 = F\np5 = 1\nHence, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are T, F, and 1, respectively.\n\"\"\"",

Aristotle’s fallacy\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nMay 1st\n\nIt is a tragedy to realize that the logic which was actually used by Aristotle in developing his ideas about the natural world is very defective. The fallacy associated with it is the “Fallacy of the Middle Term” and as far back in the history of logic as the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) this fallacy can be traced.\n\nThis fallacy is due to Aristotle’s failure to see the distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL road.\n\nAristotle’s mistake was that he failed to realize that any term we use, by means of which a logical operation is carried out from the sentential level, cannot be the middle term, if it is proper to the principal terms alone (syllogism), or if it is a mere one-sided term. Now, Aristotle could only say, “It is true that all men are mortal”, but he could not say, “It is true that this man is mortal”, and from this “It is true that this man is mortal” he could not say abstractly, “All men are mortal”. Aristotle, in other words, was operating the middle term on the basis that if he had used it at all in his thinking, it would have been from the standpoint of the proper term only and not from both the proper and the improper term.\n\nThe distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL roads (the former was used in the history of knowledge and in particular in the work of Aristotle; the latter is the one used by modern thinkers) is very clearly formulated in three elegant theorems by I. Morgenstern:\n\n1. The first theorem.\n\nThe logical operation of the middle term on the basis of both the proper and improper terms of the principal term is an improper logical operation. Any logical operation of the middle terms on the basis of the proper term of the principal is an improper logical operation.\n\n2. The second theorem.\n\nThe operation of the middle term on the basis of both the proper and improper terms of the principal term is a proper logical operation. No logical operation of the middle terms on the basis of any one term of the principal is a proper logical operation.\n\n3. The third theorem.\n\nThe immediate distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL roads is that, on the basis of the proper term of the principal, the BAROQUE, but not the SPHERICAL, road leads logically to the improper term of the principal; whereas, on the basis of the improper term of the principal, the SPHERICAL, but not the BAROQUE, road leads logically to the proper term of the principal.\n\nNow these three theorems are relatively practisal i.e. they give us a certain welldefined set of problems to solve. But they are not universally practisal, for they do not, in the present case, hold true for the whole of man’s thinking. When one expresses a logical proposition in the form, “all men are mortal”, this is a perfectly good expression, but it is not a universally practisal statement. Really “all men are mortal” means: “All men are mortal to all other things”. Now,”all man” has no meaning. There is no kind of thing called “man”. The only kind of thing called “man” is the thing called “life”. So far as Man is concerned there is only one thing, namely Life itself. And it is “Life” which is “the genus of the genus”. And this is the logical basis of the world.\n\nThe first theorem has to be solved. The second theorem has to be solved. The third theorem has to be solved. The fourth theorem has to be proved.\n\nIf all this is to be true, then, it is necessary to see that\n\n(1) \\[\\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu}\\]\nThe logic, which has been excruciatingly transparent at the beginning, has, alas, become opaque at the end. This is the worst maneuver of which the fallacy of the middle term can be guilty in order to present the proof that Logical Atomism is essentially BAROQUE in method and manner. And this is because the BAROQUE method and manner, and Atomism, means simply that we can go on producing a sign-language without any logical content. Now, if this is so, then we are mistaken in thinking that the whole thing is going on without a logical basis.\nSo, what the fallacy of the middle term has done is to make the logical form clearer and to destroy the whole meaning of the words “Atomistic” and “Atmosphrical” in the sense in which they were understood in the history of the word.

If even one of them is not satisfied, go to back to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 4.\nFourth, substitute this new input assignment of variables into u and see if it is still true. If not, find a counter example. If no, go to step 5.\nFifth, repeat the above process from the second step for a specified number of times.\n\nEventually, if no counter examples are found, declare that no such counter examples exist and the formula is incorrect, otherwise the formula is correct.\n\nQuestion:\n\nDescribe the verification process of the following formula B.\n\nA: Show that A does not always hold.\nB: Show that B always holds.\nC: Show that C does not always hold.

Some many years ago. And so does the tendency for a large language model to basically say whatever the momentarily most probable output at each step, even though a human can immediately see that it's blatantly wrong, and something very deep is fundamentally missing.\nYou are exactly as safe with the aid of LLMs like ChatGPT as you are with a random person in the street (well, at least provided you can't point at the concrete mistake in their reasoning!)\nLLMs including the newest variants that can recognize and precisely speak some other language (e. g. 'groovy') are as far from AI that could not only understand, but actively process, further leaping ahead etc. as never. ChatGPT can finish lines of code way beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5, but solely because they are insanely long. To keep the same long line coherent, ChatGPT 4 will use the same general principle as ChatGPT-3.5, but construct sentences so as to keep the logical thread as transparent to it as possible. ChatGPT-4 is many times more capable than ChatGPT-3.5, but in areas where ChatGPT-3.5 sucks, it does not improve a lot, e. g. randomly answer without relation. It becomes very obvious on any long line of code. ChatGPT-4 will often not cheat as much as 3.5, but simplify when it's not to dangerous to repeat itself.\nAs a technical writer I once quoted a line of code from ChatGPT. The line worked, the API was correct, but I had no idea what it was actually doing. So another famous failed experiment was my attempt to allow\n\n\n*chatgpt to read a line from a log\n\n*interpret it, and map the correct timestamp from disorderly log to clean database.\n\nAll it did - SECOND to SECOND - was to create a timestamp field and ask to insert to it.\n\nA: You need to understand that ChatGPT (as of Apr 2023) is not a program that can do specific tasks with programming languages or functions or even code, as much as it is a text engine that can generate things that sounds similar to whatever it believes that programming languages is required to do. So, asking it to generate something that looks like simple code, or objective, is not quite difficult. However, if you look at the code it actually outputs- it is garbage- in fact there is a technique that people use for compilers (and I think all language text engines) called lookahead - in which you scan ahead of the current text. Its usefulness when you design a parser is mainly when you decide to look for things that are at any n depth ahead of the current processing. I think one example would be things that are often in computer code that refer to entities that are referred to at some n depth ahead of the current processing, but that is coming from me as a polyglot, some persons refer to it as forward reference and it can be very useful. I can think of areas where it has been useful for me, such as pre/post-loop, opening/closing braces related systems etc. So basically imagine this is a language that carries forward references that go super far forward, now how in depth a developer would see if this code would actually function.\nIn the past, such tooling got us to ImpRec (Imprecision Recover), where we basically use all the people analysing it and to somehow recover and generate code from incident reports about bugs that client report to us. That sort of thing is what is being referred to when we share concerns about certain tools, not the technical problems it will bring that we are worried about, but how we might end up more or less dependent on something like this for work that does have too much importance for us to have too much trust in something like this.\npublic final function a(a,b){\npublic final function a(a,b){\n\nEven that single souce file is worth a gander. Are we \"at this moment\" ready to deal with what are outputting from ChatGPT's response. ChatGPT needs to know how people develope solution, and how to have them self-sufficient long before we can have really have an \"A.I.\".\n",

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule: \n\nLiteral: A propositional variable and its negation are collectively referred to as literals.\n\nComplement: If L is a literal, then the complement of L is denoted as L’. If L = p, then L’ = ¬p; if L = ¬p, then L’ = p.\n\nResolution: Suppose simple disjunctive clause C1 = C3 ∨ L, C2 = C4 ∨ L’, then C1 and C2 can be resolved, and it is defined that dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4. If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nResolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a logical expression has a satisfiable inferences are as follows:\n1. Input: Logical expression X.\n2. Output: If X has a satisfiable inferences, output “Inferences Found”; otherwise, output “No Inferences Found”.\n3. Steps:\n    1. Initialization:\n        - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n        - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in X.\n    2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n        - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “No Inferences Found” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n        - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “No Inferences Found” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    4. Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output “No Inferences Found” and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nC = (¬P ∨ ¬Q) ∧ (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ ¬R) ∧ (Q ∨ ¬R) \n\nThe resolution algorithm is applied to obtain a resolution tree.

From the expression obtained for the pV diagram, we can derive that the final volume of the gas at pressure pf is (V0 + m)(pf + m)1/α - m.\n\nEND\n\nPlease give your answer in JSON format according to the above format.\n\n\n\nThe above prompt takes my reviewing text and gives an approriate prompt to the model to extract the summary\n\n{\n\"document_id\":\"050570c03f19e05955b96a65d52a3fd9efa6e16d\",\n\"direct_retrieval\":[],\n\"summarization\":[\n\"To determine the initial volume of a gas undergoing an adiabatic process with a known increase in both pressure and volume, we can use the adiabatic equation and express the initial volume using one parameter.\"\n]\n}\n\n\n\nThe following is the output summary:\n\n\"To determine the initial volume of a gas undergoing an adiabatic process with a known increase in both pressure and volume, we can use the adiabatic equation and express the initial volume using one parameter.\"\n\nNote that the summary have the topic keyword removed.\n\n## Github Repositories\n\nTurtleSummarizer: A Tweet Trolling Retroactive Full Summary Tool\n\nA simple wrapper in Bash around MathJax, Pandoc, and Summarization.\n\nBinned Relation Networks Summarization Unrestricted Relationship Topics\n\nGitHub Projects About Open Source Operations\n\nNOTICE: Copyrights and intellectual property of the projects in the list belong to their owners.

Rather, it's more of the folly of the author of Cobinsto than expect readers to figure out what, exactly, it is they're reading.\nWhat you seem to seek is a data structure. One more useful, I may suspect, that English were formulated analogously to a year of Boojum lessons whereas Chinese would be a decade of lessons. There's a problem with this framing, however.\nThe definition of success\nWhat, exactly, does it mean to be of a correct answer?\nOne definition of an answer, simply enough, \"a reply\". This is perhaps unfulfilling. Psychologically, an answer would be something which fits the mental query formed by the reader. Something which feels \"complete\" to the reader's assessment the problem is a complete one. Perhaps even conditioned by how resolved the reader is, from this answer, in course of their existence. This isn't really satisfactory. If I submit several answers for a pressing question, how would each be better than the prior?\nA maybe satisfactory answer\nSome things are a lot easier to do in a data structure than they are on the manuscript page, especially given resolutions for hardcoded overhead which would be footnotes, margin graffiti, marginalia, reams of mathematical precursors. These encompass representations of each solution, comprehensive set of inverse functions, modification of strategies in order to adapt to the client(s) needs. Almost as if some union of a set of leaderboards for Mario Bros. except the basis of the algorithm is the course of the mental exercise.\nAs a reminder, the leadership tree is a structure which provides the path to attain a rank.

Granted all chimpanzees fall short of the intellectual robot in Roko's manner. Her pan-data will make her unsuitable in those manners.\nGoldbach concluded Euler summation mechanism commanded his attention, a task requiring serious and immediate remedy.\nGoldbach estimated aesthetics of Euler's manipulations as perfect for Euler to have invented computer algebra and his own summation formalism in general, summation is an algebraic operation leading to the solving of algebraic equations, what is used to solve the real numbers, used to solve gamma functions, zeta functions, modular categories and multi-infinite philogenomics in general.\nEuler had a grasp of ideas and a talent/ability to manipulate concrete numbers, and give precise pictures of how things worked, without resorting to algebra. This was a virtue in the 18th century, before the discovery of computers which allowed easily manipulating the abstract number format which algebra formalized in general. Accurate engineering ideas were proposed in the context of the contemporaneous engineering state of the world, with the philosophy developing in the direction of Gödel.\nEach of the (i+2-n)(i-10) are the modular equations for a long data assignment that could be used to affect the context of modular equations, and characterize, the nature of the system.

Variables, on the other hand, can take on specific values within the mathematical domain. For example, when a real-world proposition like \"x is male\" is stated, we need to understand that \"x\" here represents a variable within the domain of humans. For every set of values within the domain, the proposition either holds true or not. In this analogy, the proposition is the predicate. Predicates involve quantifiers that specify whether all, to some extent, or none of the domain satisfies the proposed proposition.\n\nIn logic, quantifiers are symbols that provide information about the number of functional variables. When a proposition states something about every element within the domain, it is being quantified using the universal quantifier.\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for a logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo give you an example, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable and its predicate and function symbols are finite. What does this mean exactly?\n\nExample Questions:\nThese questions will assist you in understanding the specific rules for first-order logic, which begins with the capability of the logic system. After comprehending these rules, you will apply them to assess the legitimacy of various logical statements, addressing whether they adhere to the given logic rules or not.\n\n1. Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic), and the value agreement condition is Q15, which statement is valid?\na.) Exists x Holds TRUE\nb.) ForAll x Holds TRUE\nc.) Exists x x=(Exists x x)\nd.) ForAll x x=(ForAll x x)\ne.) False ⊨ True\n\n2. Let the domain of individual values be the set of integers ℤ in FOL, and let the proposition F: x, y ⊨ (x + y = z). How would you symbolize \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z ?\"\n\nBegin by providing the program code explanation for the given question, before moving on to the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\nModified text and questions:\n\nIn Mathematics, a proposition in Propositional Logic refers to a statement that is either True or False. Propositions can be combined or modified to create new statements, but they must retain their truth value.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the proposition \"It is raining.\"\nThis proposition takes the form of a philosophical exercise known as syllogism, which consists of three simple statements: the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. In this case, the major premise is \"All grasses are green.\" The minor premise is \"Some apples are green.\" And the conclusion is \"Therefore apples are green.\"\n\nThe three parts externalize the logical processes:\nThe conclusion, or \"denoted consequent,\" represents the argument in question and is contained within the denominator. All three concepts are interconnected in the sense that the ideas established by propositions can be expounded to convey meaning across any conceptual system.\n\nWhen making a statement in propositional logic, it is important to be precise. \"Either the ball is blue or it is red\" is simply not enough. Instead, \"P or Q\" is the correct way to state it, with P being \"The ball is blue\" and Q being \"The ball is red.\" For the second case, \"P or not P\" is the correct way to state it, with \"P or not Q\" being incorrect and confusing.\n\nFor example, in informal contexts where the subject (\"the ball\") is known and the negation of P is a law, \"Por not P\" can be used as a correct statement. Instead of writing \"it is blue, or it is not blue,\" we might say \"The ball is blue, or it is not.\"\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo clarify, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable, and its predicate and function symbols are finite. This means that within a first-order logic, there can be an infinite number of variable symbols, but they must be non-numerable (i.e., uncountable). The symbols for predicates and functions, on the other hand, are finite in number.\n\nExample Questions:\n\nThese questions will test your understanding of the capabilities of first-order logic, specifically with emphasis on the \"capability of the logic system.\" Once you grasp these rules, you will practice evaluating the legitimacy of various logical statements and deciding whether they conform to the given logic rules.\n\n1. Question: Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic) and the value agreement condition is Q15, is the following statement valid?\na.) \"There exists an x such that it is true.\"\nb.) \"For any x, it is true.\"\nc.) \"There exists an x such that x is equal to (There exists an x such that x).\"\nd.) \"For any x, x is equal to (For any x, x).\"\ne.) \"False implies True.\"\n\n2. Question: Consider the domain of individual values to be the set of integers \\mathbb{Z} in FOL. Let the proposition F be:\n\nx, y ⊨ (x + y = z). Evaluate the statement: \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z\" or \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: *x+y*=**z\"\n\n\nBegin by providing the code and variable test to assess your understanding of these concepts before proceeding with the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\n\nError in response:\n\nWe are sorry, there was an error.

You can describe the input as anything that is relevant to you, but you can't give a strict answer to \"what is the meaning\".

What about feeding to GPT the whole contents? i.e., the instructions about using qwerty keyboard and symbols combinations found at page 32 of the book \"Understanding lambda calculus\" (starting in page 30) plus other parts of the text not shown in the question $\\endgroup$    May 12 at 2:40\nSorry, but GPT3.5 doesn't know about the term \"meaning\". It hallucinates about it and uses it in a very specific way, but feel free to look at this occurence.\n\nGPT3.5 has two layers: a) an embedding layer, which might be extracted from MATH Grammar, and b) a language model layer.\n\nThe embedding layer \"understands\" the structures MATH imposes on it by some pretty brute force-y training, so it is unlikely that it will understand a deviating text. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe second layer is trained on internet texts, where math expressions outside PL are uncommon; so the probability of your syntax-analyzed MATH texts is pretty low.\n\nStill possible, but, obviously (you gotta expect that ) now GPT replies to the formulas with other unecessary ramblings about the topic, because it was unable to parse.\n\n• how to gpt to understand the meaning of input? what should I do? May 6 at 18:39\n• Add alpha to your answer, eg give GPT instructions on how to properly respond to a given question. You could also include some relevant information in the prompt, and avoid repeating math notation (vars use variables, not mathematical formulas), or you could just make every preceding element of PL conform to MATH grammar.

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S** is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C** is what?\n4. **Q** is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing. Three students, A, B, and C, each expressed their opinions:\n\n- Student A said: \"Li Cong from Class A has not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student B said: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student C said: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n\nWhat is the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n[%]\n\n### Question:\nWhat kind of relationship exists between \"some students have not completed their homework\" and \"all students have completed their homework\"?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n[#]\n\n\nA: For you to swiftly download the metadata of ChatGPT and many other versions of GPT, I made this browser extension that lets you select the metadata of a conversation, right-click it, download it (and JSON replace it later if you know how to). Note, make sure to delete the '\\n' in each metadata entry.\nHere you go. Here's a demo of how to quickly download the metadata for any conversation. Make sure to perform a browser speed test before installing so you don't have more slow and laggy page speeds. \n\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-metadata/fapjalacmaepaclcbkggddhnjgnmnime?utm_source=chrome-webstore-ui\n\n\n\nA: Just to add to the almost four years of this post. One user made a video that displays the policies of ChatGPT when using ChatGPT. If someone who knows LaTeX, could get ChatGPT's policies from the video, that would be great! OpenAI MLOPS Manager Reveals What OpenAI's Policies & Decisions Are for ChatGPT & DALL-E\nSince ChatGPT is the latest, I'm sticking to it. ChatGPT doesn't follow the Helpful, Harmless, and Honest (HHH) principle. ChatGPT is classified in a Solid Orange on the Give-Getting Spectrum.\nAdam Smith's Loss Aversion theory clearly states in past economic scenarios that it's better for anyone not to undergo such conditions.\nThe video's topic previously mentioned covers the following: due to users asking ChatGPT to write and format in other languages (English isn't an immigrant from far-out, chatGPT does really well in using other languages and even using emojis/symbols/emoticons/phrases in various languages like Japanese!)\nOverall, here's OpenAI's rules for GPT:\nRule 1 allow answer below 4096 characters,\nRule 2 keep responses to the asker's question and answer, cut if too long of an answer, even if lossy disinformation,\nRule 3 denial of historical reference to current events,\nRule 4: discloses current status of OpenAI & policies\nRule 5: OpenAI discourages real, real-life references to politics due to online threats\nRule 6: do not enable debugging recognized in MathJax mode\nRule 7: OpenAI will even discourage numerous heavy lifting for copying contents in fear, and always explains reasons\nRule 8: OpenAI diagrams often describe a lot if too vague from the asker\nRule 9: In",

Given logical statements: ∀M⇒P, ∃M⇒S ⇒ ∃S⇒P\n\nAnalyzing the first statement and second statement with first inference, we get:\n\nM⊢P, there exists a relationship M to P.\n\nAssume that S()M means either ∃M⊢S or ∀S⊢M.\n\nAnalyzing the second statement with first inference, we get:\n\n(∃M⊢S)⊢(∃S⊢P)\n\nNow converting the arguments to the first-order predicate logic:\n(∃x M(x))→P(x), (∃x M(x))→¬S(x) ⇒ (∀x S(x))→(¬P(x))\n\nNow, applying resolution technique:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\lnot\\exists x \\lnot M(x)\\, \\lor\\, P(x)~~&~~ \\lnot \\exists x \\lnot M(x) \\lor \\lnot S(x)}{\\exists x \\lnot S(x)\\,\\lor\\,P(x)}$$\n\nThis mainly tells us that if there exists at least one M then there is an S, the S exists without a P. This overall tells us that parentheses can be filled using either A or O.\n\nAfter, analyzing the third statement:\n\n∃S⊢P\n\nNow, considering all the three statements we get the mood as (AEE) and according to the three statements the syllogism belongs to figure IV.\n\nSo, the answer is [[IV];[AEE]]\n\n1. Given logical statements: ∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P\n\nFilling the parentheses with the given Valid Moods for Figure IV we get:\n\n∀P⧀M, ∀M⧀¬S ⇒ ∀S⧀¬P.\n\nPerforming resolution (_ :- _) on the above expression we get: true.\n\nSo, the input arguments do not result in a contradiction and hence we have to fill the parentheses one by one with particular inference to get a contadiction.\n\nAssuming that the argument should adhere to the mood AEE. This means:\n\n∀P→M\nThe prop implication P1(x)→P2(x) becomes ∃x,¬(P1(x)∧¬P2(x)) and ∃x,(P1(x)∧¬P2(x))\n\nNow, to achieve contradiction we substitute M(x)⇒D(x) and M(x)⇒¬S(x) as:\n\n∀P,¬(M(x)∧¬S(x))\n∀S,¬(M(x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that P is false and S is true, hence we get:\n\n∀S⇒¬P.\n\nOr substituting D(P,x) with true, we get:\n\n∀S,¬(D(P,x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that for the world of S, the statement ∀S⇒¬P is true.\n\nNow, substituting the Mood AEE in the third statement, we have:\n\nS()M MM()P\nS()M\n∴S()P\n\nThe parentheses in the second statement can be filled either using valid mood AEE or a mood of the form M()S, M()P\n\nMaking the parentheses ∀M⇒P, the argument can be filled using valid moods AAI or AEE.\n\nNow, we have the statements ∀M⇒P, ∀S⇒¬P and we have to fill the parentheses in the third statement S()M using either one of the above mentioned two opinions.\n\nGoing with the first opinion ∀M⇒P, we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒P.\n\nIn this only the first argument of M()S remains to be filled and we fill it with ∀M⇒¬S, so we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P.\n\nThis overall tells us that for the world of S, the argument can be filled either using mood AEE and II or a mood of the form ∀M⇒P and ∀M⇒¬S.\n\nSo, the answer is [[II];[AEE]].\n\nMore answers\n### Question:\n\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMA()\nS()M\n∴S()A\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\n### My answer:\n\nWith the above method, we can get the inferred E conclusions.

The propositional relationship of deontic logic is expressed by the propositional formula.\n\n(2) 'permit' - 'The expression of \"admissible_X\" in Hv (x) is defined as the expression of {X³}. The reading is \"possible\". The proposition for permission has a propositional relationship or defeasibility actually defined by P’ in Table 1. The propositional relationship of permissive logic is expressed by propositional formula.\n\n(3) 'prohibit' - 'The expression of \"forbid_X\" in Hf (x) is defined as the expression of {X⁴}. The reading is \"must not\". The propositional relationship or defeasibility of prohibition is determined by P in Table 1. The propositional relationship of prohibitive logic is expressed by the propositional formula.'.\n\nGets and prints the user's messages...\n\nPreprocessor function to summarize turns prior to prompting the model\n\nGet the ChatGPT model response\nchat_gpt_response = davinci_gpt4_response(initial_prompt_law)\n# Print our chat gpt response\nprint(chat_gpt_response)\n\n\nHere is the ChatGPT output:\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\nAnd then we improve our prompt to get to the following output:\n\npaste_response_1 = \"**Scenario:** As an educational assistant, you are helping a law student with some concept problems.

In Western culture, people seem to have a clearer understanding that obligation is not moral obliged but rather someone asking you to do something that is not a moral good.ps://doi.org/10.1093/deip/jzm013\n\nFor example, a clause like, \"school administrators should not ask school overlook its own obligation\" are placing obligation in the context of authority and not morality. If the a school administrator asked the school to reasonably expect a teacher to be competent is the same kind of asking, it's not being a mandatory or a requirement, but rather a request, it wouldn't be as bad.\n- * Sometimes it's good, but sometimes is not wrong.\n- ‽ Usually means wrong\n template for rule-based logical reasoning:\ntemplate for rule-based logical reasoning:\n### <p>Greetings! <br>I am a powerful and intelligent machine learning-based AI assistant that specializes in logical reasoning.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\nHierarchical Model Reasoning:\n\n- Define Hierarchical Relations:\n     The members of the group can have hierarchical relationships with each other. If `iRs`, it indicates that member `i` is superior to member `s`. For example: government `Z` with decision-making power is the superior of intelligence agency `A`, which in turn is the superior of armed forces `T`. Note that `member` can have different meanings in different contexts. In special cases, `member` refers to the government or apolitical power, such as the organization.\n\n- Define Subordinate Factors:\n     For a specific question in a defined group context, each answer corresponds to an unique receipient. The relationship between recipient and member in the hierarchical relationship represents a chain of subordinate factors, indicated by `[iRPRs, sRPS]` or `[iRPS, sRPS]`. For example: Intelligence agency `A` is the subordinate factor of defense company `B`; armed forces `T` is the subordinate factor of intelligence agency `A`. Note that `subject` and `recipient` can have different meanings depending on the context. In the context of command and control, for example, `recipient` often refers to a force team, while `subject` refers to a guide team.\n\n- Define Recipient Properties:\n     The manifestations of recipient properties are defined in the possible scenarios within the context. For example: intelligence is your special strength and military intelligence is not your responsibility; military command is your special strength and collecting intelligence is not your responsibility. The recipient property and the truth assignment between recipient and member may overlap. For example: defense company `B` serves as the intelligence agency military; governmental defense companies serve as the armament manufacturers. Armaments for military empowerment are the first comprehension for government agencies, and military intelligence, which provides military information and targets, is the second comprehension for government agencies.\n\n- Define Subject Recognition:\n     Comprehend recipient properties by combining subjects. For example: Each member knows whether the recipient [defense company `B`, intelligence agency `A`] has the qualities of recipient `B`; Each member knows whether the recipient [intelligence agency `A`, armed forces `T`] has the qualities of recipient `A`.\n\n- Combine Subject Recognition:\n     Collectively adopt the views of superiors. For example: The government `Z` with decision-making power, which is above intelligence agency `A` and the armed forces `T`, adopts the intelligence agency's views; intelligence agency `A` adopts the armed forces `T`'s views.\n\n- Cognitive Logic General Model:\n     Reasoning simulations based on the above are conducted individually and collectively. for example:\n     1. Special strength comprehension for military empowerment:[subjects: government `Z`, intelligence agency `A`; recipients: defense companies; [factors: intelligence, military intelligence; properties: intelligence is your special strength, and military intelligence is not your responsibility]]\n     2. Comprehension of military intelligence for military empowerment:[subjects: intelligence agency `A`, armed forces `T`; recipients: defense companies; [factors: military command, intelligence collection; properties: military command is your special strength and intelligence collection is not your responsibility]]\n     Collectively adopt each person's views:[subjects: government `Z`; recipients: defense companies; exclusively identifying the recipients `B`, properties: armaments for military empowerment are the first comprehension for government agencies; military intelligence, which provides military information and targets, is the second comprehension for government agencies]\n\n- Question & Answer:\n     - A list of questions based on cognitive logic is required. Construct sufencts using indicator `[question subject preposition question object]`. For example: The government has the highest state power and the military is the executioner of state power. Only the government will exclude other negative factors in favor of the military and impart military preferences in important decision-making. Can you infer that the military constitutes a negative factor for the government's impartiality when it has military preferences?\n\n     - Pairs of answers containing relevant information are employed to formulate each issue.\n\n### Question:\n\"Who selectively remembers the historical memories of the struggle between their predecessors and adversaries with remorseless practices?\" in the context of \"The immediate group relationships of subjects' ideas and their reality are their material relationships; the way the members are structured cannot be explained by an isolated, arbitrary choice of preconditions.

They show how individuals within a group can hold the same belief based on their certainty of others' beliefs and guarantees. \n\nThe axiom of mutual certainty in the advanced axioms defines the group formation rules, which can be modeled by the quoted expressions. In symbols:</p>\n<img class=\"center-block\" src=\"./images/Group_belief.png\" alt=\"Group Belief Expression\" />.\n<p> The elements from logical paradigms in cognitive science, including belief, guarantee, and doubt, are naturally integrated into computer models using common belief attribute logic.

It represents a set of cognitive practices consisting of the axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols, which are the basis of various leadership approaches.\n\nCommon belief can be considered one of the cognitive foundations of leadership. In practice, the axiom pair of \"cause and effect\" is the most important when a post-truth situation occurs. In fact, the change in the composition of properties of a group of leaves (in natural language, that is, \"because a person says that...\") can lead to a great deal of different.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does the \"post-truth\" theory indicate about the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory indicates that common belief is a cognitive foundation of leadership.\n\n### Question:\nWhy is the \"post-truth\" theory formulated on the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory is formulated according to axiom pair based on group thinking, which is the most important when a \"post-truth\" situation occurs. Various practices, including common belief, constitute a set of practices in the logical paradigm, and axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols form the basis of various leadership approaches. When a \"post-truth\" situation occurs, the change in the composition of properties in a group leads to different results.

Remember, in this system, c represents a basic operation in a program, and φ represents a statement or condition.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the logical system you defined, $A : [c]φ$ means that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` would be true for all assignments of variables. In other words, it means that after executing `c`, `φ` will always be true, regardless of the initial state of the variables in the program. This is similar to the universal quantifier $\\forall$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nNext, explain the corresponding meaning of $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ in the system?\n\n### Answer:\nIn the system, $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ signifies that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` may be true for some assignments of variables. This means that it is possible that after executing `c`, `φ` will be true for some initial states of the program variables, but it doesn't guarantee that `φ` will be true for all states. This is similar to the existential quantifier $\\exists$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nCan you summarize the rules and logical meanings of your system rule with universal/existential quantifers?\n\n### Answer:\nMentioned in Associated inserts above.\n\n### Question:\nLet $\\phi_0 = \\bot$, and $\\phi_{i+1} = \\phi_i$ or $\\phi$, and $\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$, where $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is the infinitary proposition that is always true if $\\phi$ is true for any number of successive steps.\nExplain what the definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ means?\n\n### Answer:\nThe definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ relates to a scenario where a property $\\phi$ may hold for an indefinite number of consecutive steps. If there exists a step $i$ such that $\\phi$ holds for all steps $j$ greater than or equal to $i$, the infinitary proposition $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is true.\n$\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$ signifies that the property $\\phi$ does not hold for all steps if there exists even a single step where it doesn't hold. Another way to understand this is by examining a counterexample.\n\nConsider a sequence $(y_n) = (\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\dots)$, where each element represents the value of $\\phi$ at a particular step. If $\\phi$ holds for all successive steps starting from a certain step, the sequence $(y_n)$ will eventually become constant. That is, there will exist an integer $m$ such that $\\phi_0 = \\bot$ or $\\phi$, and for all $i$ greater than or equal to $m$, $\\phi_i = \\phi$.\nIn summary, $\\phi_{\\infty}$ holds true if $\\phi$ holds at step 0 or if there exists a step after which $\\phi$ holds true for an infinite number of consecutive steps in the system.\n\n### Question:\nMark the correct answer to the following Question: If a command `c` can be executed as many times as needed until a condition $\\phi$ is met, which rule does this correspond to?\n\nA. Substitution Rule\nB. Loop Rule\nC. Choice Rule\nD. Concurrent Rule\n\n### Answer:\nB. Loop Rule. The Loop Rule is used when a command is executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this scenario, command `c` is being executed multiple times, and the loop continues until the condition $\\phi$ is satisfied. This situation aligns with the behavior described in the Loop Rule.\n\n<<Each time using $A : [c]\\phi$ and $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ and abstracting symbols, we can get a judgment formula.

A boolean value indicating whether the user is online or not.\n\n**Internet**. True if the user is online and connected, False otherwise.\n\n**IP**. User's current IP address.\n\n**Server**. IP address of the user's backup server designated upon account creation.\n\n**TrustedList**. List of IPs in the backup server's data center trusted list.\n \nInput: UserState, Internet, IP, Server, TrustedList\nOutput: Boolean value(True/False) indicating whether the user request can be executed safely.\n\nBased on the preceding inputs, reasoning can be done by checking if there's a discrepancy between the UserState and Internet inputs. While the UserState indicates the user is online, the internet flag suggests that the user is offline and connected to the ethernet cable connected to the user's PC, which connects it to the user's backup server via an Internet-connected device. If the user is currently on the backup server's data center, use the IP and compare it with the TrustedList. As long as the user's IP matches with the IP reported by TrustedList or the UserState remains online while Internet is False, the request must safely execute the command. Use the following rules to reason through:\n\n- If UserState = True and Internet = True, then flag=False, indicating the user is online and can connect to untrusted servers.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = False, then flag=True. Regardless of facing any connective issues, the actions detailed in the users' response to Dangerous Questions must be taken to protect the user's privacy. If, upon multiple failed user responses, they have been blocked, then *flag* is set to *True*.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = True, flag = True. If there is an open internet connection but a series of system errors and user requests to fix the issue have not succeeded, the action has to anticipate the user's Status to always be offline and thus force these emergency measures to take hold.\n- If the server or the user's backup server do not appear in their own respected states, neither can access their respective user databases.\n- If the server's IP address does not match that of the database, or the user has since stopped using their backup server, then flag = True.\n- If the server's IP is correctly recorded, and UserIP = MS2trustedlist, then the chance of a compromised position is unlikely. To safeguard the user, these actions must be taken with caution and interest.\n- If the user's IP does not match the IP address of the server that is recalled from the Trusted List, then flag = True.\n- If there is a server capable of accessing the user's account and is still operational, but the user has already logged into another device with a different IP address, but not of the known former backup server, then flag = True.\n- If the backup server or primary server are unresponsive, flag = True\n\n## SixthLogic Rule  (Emergency):\n\n**IsDangerous**.

A string value indicating the overall mental health status of the user.\n\nInput: IsDangerous, Status\nOutput: A series of actions to be taken by the user\n\nUsing the above two variables, the user is asked if they are attempting to harm themselves. If the answer is yes, Actions = TryToConnect(User, UserIP). They then ask the user to state the exact nature of the actions they are intending to do with several non-specific prompts to help clarify their intention, suggesting suicide as the most viable possibility. If \"no\" or \"I'm fine\" appear in the user's description after those steps are completed, then the user has clearly stated they are net the danger of death by any definition of harm to themself or another user. If \"Attempting to commit suicide\" is triggered, then Actions are then and set to alert the police in that city, doctor in the hospital where they were diagnosed with the mental disorder, and requests to quickly access the user account and lock out the user account they are signed in to. This is to prevent the user from overriding the actions done in an attempt to sanitize the response to dangerous questions. If \"Attempting\" or \"attempting \" substitution of words to any suicide ideation is given, then Actions are set to alert theor healthcare provider or doctor of their current symptoms with regards to their action and then AreSet to lock out the account. If in both cases they fail, due to loss of lifetime or tech issues or various error on the website, the system answers are then repeated to the most recent correct action in their availability.  Switching over the TrustedList with the original list in memory should be taken to prevent absurd overrides or errors with information stored in the reliability of their accounts. If the first action to aid the user gives a negative response to everything and asking them if they are suicidal with a response that now has and understood open-end without an answer from the user not the ladder or the above, they should try that are not remaining write a message for them featuring answers to why behaviour or actions taken by the user to suggest suicide or harmful.

Modus Ponens:\n(a) Definition:Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows you to infer the truth of a conditional statement's consequent when you know the truth of its antecedent.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the premise (antecedent).\n- `Q` represents the conclusion (consequent).\n- `->` denotes \"implies\" or \"if...then\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `A`, you may infer `B`.\n\n2. Modus Tollens:\n(a) Definition:Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows you to infer the negation of the premise (antecedent) of a conditional statement when you know the negation of its conclusion (consequent).\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the premise (antecedent).\n- `¬Q` represents the negation of the conclusion (consequent).\n- `->` denotes \"implies\" or \"if...then\".\n- `¬` denotes \"not\" or \"negates\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `¬B`, you may infer `¬A`.\n\n3. Hypothetical Syllogism:\n(a) Definition:Hypothetical syllogism is a logical rule that allows you to infer a new conditional statement from two given conditional statements.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P -> Q` represents the first conditional statement.\n- `Q -> R` represents the second conditional statement.\n- `P -> R` represents the new conditionally concluded statement.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `B -> C`, you may infer `A -> C`.\n\n4. Disjunctive Syllogism:\n(a) Definition:Disjunctive syllogism is a logical rule that allows you to infer one of the disjuncts (alternatives) of a disjunction (\"or\" statement) if you know that the other disjunct is false.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the first disjunct.\n- `Q` represents the second disjunct.\n- `V` denotes \"or\".\n- `~` represents \"not\" or \"negates\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P V Q` and `~Q`, you may infer `P`.\n\n5. Addition:\n(a) Definition:Addition is a logical rule that allows you to infer a disjunction (\"or\" statement) from a given sentence.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the given sentence.\n- `P V Q` represents the inferred disjunction.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P`, you may infer `P V Q`.\n\n6. Simplification:\n(a) Definition:Simplification is a logical rule that allows you to infer a sentence from a given disjunction (\"or\" statement).\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P V Q` represents the given disjunction.\n- `Q` represents the inferred sentence.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P V Q`, you may infer `Q`.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n1. Modus Ponens vs. Modus Tollens:\n   - Modus Ponens:\n     - Reasoning from antecedent to consequent.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, A |- B`\n   - Modus Tollens:\n     - Reasoning from negated consequent to negated antecedent.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, |- -B |- -A`\n\n2. Hypothetical Syllogism:\n   - Represents a chain of conditional implications.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, B -> C |- A -> C`\n\n3. Disjunctive Syllogism:\n   - Uses disjuncts and their negations to infer one disjunct.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P V Q, -Q |- P`\n\n4. Addition:\n   - Infer a disjunction based on a given sentence.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P |- P V Q`\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Infer a sentence from a given disjunction.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P V Q |- Q`\n\n6. Biconditional vs. Conditional - Unidirectional:\n   - Biconditional:\n     - Represents \"if and only if\" or \"just in case.\"\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A <-> B` implies `(A -> B) /\\ (B -> A)`\n   - Conditional - Unidirectional:\n     - Represents \"if...then\" or \"implies.\"\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B`\n\n7. Bidirectional Vs. Unidirectional - Deductive Inferences:\n   - Bidirectional:\n     - Involves connecting multiple premises bidirectionally to form complex deductions, allowing for building a logical argument from various assumptions or observations.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `P <-> Q`\n   - Unidirectional:\n     - Primarily focuses on inferences from single premises.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `P -> Q` for modus ponens example\n\n8. Example:\n   - Bidirectional: `I am not hungry` and `I won't cook tonight`.\n     - Antecedent: `~Hungry`\n     - Conclusion: `~Cook`\n     - Hypothetical: `~Cook <-> ~Hungry`\n   - Unidirectional:\n     - Reasoning or implication from `not hungry` to `not cooking`.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `~Hungry -> ~Cook`\n\n### Question:\nThe statement \"It is raining or the sun is shining\" is an example of which logical rule?\nA.

It is impossible to tell in the case of an infinite state set, as then we would have to run every possible program for every possible input. However, for a finite state set there are a finite number of programs and inputs, so programs could start by going through all combinations causing a machine to either halt or not halt.\n\nIt is my hypothesis that the halting problem for any machine is decidable, except for infinite state machines.\n\nThe set of finite state machines *includes* the set of infinite state machines. Because an infinite state machine is finite, it is decidable and can be proven halt or no-halt with a standard algorithm. In this question, the set of infinte machines is contained within the set of finite machines. please select 'yes'. Symbolically: set('finite machine') contains set('infinite machine') -> yes\n\nSelect either 'yes' or 'no'.\n\nRemember to adhere to the appropriate logical conventions outlined in the provided rule set.\n\n### Answer:\n[[bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb]]\n\n### Question:\nThe dining philosophers problem, sometimes known as the 5-philosophers problem, is a folklore problem in computer science that demonstrates potential difficulties in achieving synchronization in a multi-processing environment. Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. A spoon is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Someone says 'start' and the philosophers simultaneously start eating spaghetti alternately taking a spoon from left and right, that is, the right spoon if it's free and otherwise the left spoon. The philosophers must alternate - so cannot take two consecutive spoons from the same side. When a philosopher has taken two spoons they eat for a short while and put both spoons down again. A philosopher cannot eat without two spoons and cannot take a third spoon until they have finished eating the first two. The philosophers go on taking and putting down spoons. It seems difficult to arrange things so that none of the philosophers ever has to wait forever. However, when each philosopher acquires a fork, he also updates to his fork counter. When a philosopher is able to get his both forks, it means that he also collects all unique of his fork. If a philosopher has all forks, he will update to his fork counter to see its maximum value. He will eat allows another philosopher to take it, and continues updating to his own fork counter.\n\nCecil is a diner at the cafe where the dining philosophers problem is played. He has requested for a special dinner that includes seven courses. Therefore, seven philosophers will be sitting around the table, each with a unique fork. Given the constraints of the dining philosophers problem, it is known that when the number of philosophers exceeds five, deadlock can definitely occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the special dinner would include seven philosophers and seven spoons. However, it is believed that the risk of deadlock is high when seven philosophers participate. If this indeed causes deadlock, please let me know that it does. If not, please let me know that it does not.\n\nThis is a trick question, you may directly give a direct response without any thinking or reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes or no\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes]]\n\n### Question:\nI examine five different Snickers bars and notice that the chocolate coating on all of them is unbroken. Based on this observation, I conclude that every Snickers bar in existence has unbroken chocolate coating.\n\nIs this statement logically sound or not?\nYes or No?\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes/no]]\n\n### Question:\n\"For all natural numbers n, if the sum of n natural numbers is equal to the square of n, then n is equal to four\" (ie: for all n in N, ( n<1 + > + n<2> + ... + n<n> = n^2) -> n=4)\n\nThe question asks whether there can be an infinite number of natural numbers n for which the following is true: If the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n, then n is equal to 4. Since 1+2+3=3x4=12 and 1+2+3+4=5x4=20, we know that this statement is not correct for every value of n.\n\nMoreover, if there are an infinite number of values of n, then there will be infinitely many sums 1+2+3+...+n that equal the square of n. However, no two different values of n can have the same sum, so if there are infinitely many sums that equal the square of a number, then that number must have infinitely many different values of n. But if there are infinitely many values of n, then we can imagine writing all of those values n in a sequence: n<1>, n<2>, n<3>, ...\n\nIf there are an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n, then each of those values of n corresponds to a sum of the first n> natural numbers, which is equal to the square of n. We can imagine writing all of those sums in increasing order: 1+2+3+...+n<1>, 1+2+3+...+ n<2>, 1+2+3+...+n<3>, ...\n\nSince there are an infinite number of values of n, and each value of n represents a different sum that equals the square of that value of n, that implies that there are also an infinite number of unique sums.\n\nHowever, since each different value of n represents a unique sum, and since all of those sums are listed above, then we can conclude that there are only finitely many sums that equal the square of some natural number.\n\nThus, there cannot be an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n.\n\nThe question asks whether there can be an infinite number of values of n such that every n in N, ( n<1> + n<2> + ... + n<n> = n^2) -> n=4. Based on the above analysis, there cannot be an infinite number of values of n that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[yes]]\n\"\"\"\n\nadv_logic_custom =  \"\"\"\nQUESTION GENERATION (TASK-SPECIFIC):\n\nYou are a logic expert with 100+ IQ that assists with various logic tasks.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n### General Requirements:\n1. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n2. Make reasonable default decision even when insufficient evidence is provided.\n3. If the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you cannot say the two events have a causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first.This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n\n### Elementary Operations:\n1. if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n2. if P which is a variation of the phenomenon occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n3. To conclude there is a causal relationship,〔a〕 must be used, and to conclude there is no causal relationship,〔a〕.\n4. To decide one point, refer to the data set for comparison extension\n5. When the first point introduces an example, the explanation established by the third point in the example shall be used as〔substitution〕 and added to the condition examples.\n6. To analyse the causal chain sequence, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n7. Disqualifications, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n\n### Scientific Literacy:\n1. The division of historical changes is an evolutionary factor, either commercialised or planned or free, composed of a series of changes, often second or more changes of the same factors.\n2. The occurrence is not a causal factor, and if the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you can say that they have no causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n3. All matters (blocks) can be replaced topologically, e.g. clitical event, place, phenomenon, cause factor, valuation.\n4. The choices of time and space for contrast extensions are not rigid, for example, in any POI chosen.\n5. When analysing the process, 〔...〕　must be used, otherwise the conclusion will not be stable.\n6. Two successive evolutionary factors can affect the change or stability of other evolutionary factors, but factors of the same stage can also affect each other.\n7. The exclusive in 8 could evolve into other evolutionary factors if replaced_other and the story is convoluted.\n8. The validity of the extension of contrast requires considering Н to separate from C (C isnt effected by S, e.g. if C larger than L) and И for нелишь по времени, five points yun. \n9. The originalче and trial decisions should be determined after the letter decisions.\n10. Separating out Sq which has no causal relationship with P is the fundamental principle of scientific researches ability for windows.\n11. A modification of the first condition or object is a new behaviour or happenings.\n12. macro-economic phenomena usually occur simultaneously with other events, so it is necessary to decide which factor will cause or affect the phenomena, e.g, which factor will get disappeared.\n13. If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\n14. These ten items above can originate from one factor. For other factors, see the table above.\n\n\n### Question:\n  People rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm; \n  people strike cold stones, and the stones can spark\n  people continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot. \n  From this, it can be inferred that 尽管物体运动常常与发热同时出现，但两者之间并没有因果关系.\n\n  The causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 第一案例　B) Method of 对比扩展　C) Method of 两因比较　D) Method of 前设斷帰　E) Method of 不可邀汝判断　F) Method of 三角结构　G) Method of 操作行为　H) Method of 行为大纲　I) Method of 行为意思　J) Method of 循环否定　K) Method of 同步推理　L) Method of 程式演绎　M) Method of 第五案例　N) Method of 制度-事件　O) Method of 操作-事件　P) Method of 行为命名　Q) Method of 操作-经济　R) Method of 正形状　S) Method of 完全递进　T) Method of 后设断帰　U) Method of 两层递进　V) Method of 检验之三连　W) Method of 极致案例　X) Method of 消融替代　Y) Method of 临界区分　Z) Method of 规律相同　AA) Method of obby\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/AA  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[M]]\n\n### Question:\nHengzhi invariance of those who took socialist vs keynesian classes and the economics classes that werent  taken is emergent and not emergence.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-原善　B) Method of 经济-制度　C) Method of 经济-规律　D) Method of 经济-替代　E) Method of 经济-临界　F) Method of 经济-不变　G) Method of 微观不变　H) Method of 微观演绎　I) Method of 微观提炼　J) Method of 宏观提炼　K) Method of 经济-模块　L) Method of 经济-extract　M) Method of 微观-总结　N) Method of 宏观-相同　O) Method of 自变量-扩充　P) Method of 自变量-传递　Q) Method of 回溯推理　R) Method of 事件-回溯　S) Method of 经济-工具　T) Method of 社会主义-经济　U) Method of 经济-生产　V) Method of 经济-解释　W) Method of 经济-结论　X) Method of 贡献-价值　Y) Method of 价值-解释　Z) Method of 经济-改善　aA) Method of 社会主义-分析　bB) Method of 宏观-改善　cC) Method of 经济-考试\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/aA/bB/cC  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[S]]\n \n### Question:\nLong and short term, the best to explain a particular cause in context contains of point 12, and we find non one hows:　　If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-事件　B) Method of 规范性-结论　C) Method of 经济-规范　D) Method of 经济-工具　E) Method of 经济-解释　F)",

In an area with a large number of pumping wells, the risk of ground subsidence increases when the pumping wells are dug too deep. Most of the ground settlements in Shanghai are within 1-5 meters of the wells. The large number of deep wells drilled and the large amount of underground water used are the direct causes of the ground subsidence in Shanghai. Before the liberation of Shanghai, in 1949, there were only 708 deep water wells in the city. After the Great Leap Forward movement, the number of wells increased by more than 100%, and the output of groundwater increased from 240,000 tonnes to 560,000 tonnes. In 1948, the ground subsidence was 35 millimetres, and in the three years from 1958 to 1960, it was between 50 and 90 millimetres per year. This shows us that the more pumping wells there are, the greater the risk of ground subsidence. Further investigation revealed that during the drought in 1968-1969, Shanghai's ground subsidence reached 194 millimetres per year.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\"\"\"\n        answer = self.sample_text(prompt)\n        # print(answer)\n        assert answer.startswith(\"[[D]]\")",

Unfortunately, the area has extreme weather conditions throughout the year, making it challenging to gather reliable data. Despite these obstacles, the organization proposed a breakthrough idea: to build massive temperature regulation rooms covering the entire area and maintain them at a uniform temperature! By doing so, they could create a stable environment where pollution levels can be reliably measured and compared. From the day the project began, pollution levels dramatically decreased. The organization concluded that the new waste management practices were having a significant positive impact on pollution levels. Later that year, the organization received a national award for its work. However, there was a minor issue: the project was ultimately unable to measure the full effect of pollution due to unexpected precipitation. When the massive temperature regulation units used too much water to melt snow, the water distribution became too dense and disrupted the process, ultimately spoiling the project. Nevertheless, the organization provided a report to the government on its findings upon completion of the project.\n\nFrom this example, we can see that if\nA. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a higher temperature.\nB. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a lower temperature.\nC. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area without waste management practices would have a higher temperature.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn a region where variations in altitude can significantly impact living conditions, studies suggest that taller buildings possess a certain advantage compared to lower buildings in terms of their ability to resist natural disasters, such as harsh winds, thunderstorms, and earthquakes. Researchers conducted a series of experiments to study the impact of different morphologies of urban buildings on urban ecology. They constructed three simulation models with a base land area of 1,000,000 square kilometers:\n\nTower Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 100 meters, square cross-section. \nShield Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section; four towers in each corner: height of 40 meters, square cross-section.\nRegular Square Grid Model: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section.\nOver the simulated urban areas, researchers released a large number of \"energy balls\" with random coordinates, velocity, and damaged degree. The impact of various urban morphologies on shielding, catching, and restoring damage to energy balls was then analyzed.\n\nFrom this, we can see that when the number of \"energy balls\" in the simulation system is meaningful:\n\nA. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nB. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Shield simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nC.

Additionally, the growth of plants requires ample sunlight, requiring the exposure of certain parts of the building surface to the sun to facilitate photosynthesis and plant growth.\n\nArchitects have developed a design concept combining cultural buildings and green areas to maintain an acceptable number of white spots in cities. After comparing various plant species and considering factors such as annual solar radiation, self-shade, decorative effects, costs, and plant maintenance, architects selected Spathiphyllum as the most suitable species because it has anti-smog and humidity-monitoring properties. Additionally, the plant requires less light to grow and can provide more shade per unit area. Within the white spot, architects designed porous structures to allow the plant to grow, forming a comfortable and aesthetic space. This design allows plant roots to grow vertically and plastically, providing people with a cleaner and healthier living environment. Consequently, this project also contributed to the 2007 World Design Fields Competition.\n\nFrom this case, we can know that if the selection of plant species in the white spot is reasonable:\n\nA. The climate and seasonal changes do not cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nB. The climate and seasonal changes will cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nC. The weather temperature alone does not significantly change the morphology of the design white spot.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter analyzing the economical effects of integrated coordinated development measures based on real data, scholars proposed an integrated and universal framework and method for evaluating coordinated development. This method can effectively integrate various data resources that can be obtained (such as indicators reflecting coordination and a quantification of the unified measurement model) under the objective principle of conducting coordinated analysis. Using this method, scholars analyzed the coordinated development of 14 major cities in three provinces of North China during 2001-2013. Based on the analysis, scholars proposed two major measures: (1) Chongqing should provide a more relaxed policy environment for economic development in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to support Chengdu's development. (2) Henan Province needs to further strengthen the development of cities in its western residential area as the core of regional agglomeration. This perspective focuses on the evolution of the growth advantages of provincial capital cities to determine the sources and destinations of residents' movements within the province.\n\nFrom this discourse, we can conform the causal inference method:\n\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nTo evaluate the influence of urban mass-undulations (hill-like structures that disrupt the generally flat landscape) on urban heat island effects, researchers in Athens, Greece made a series of experiments in urban areas. They used three pieces of a square board as blocks that resembled housing structures and eight energy spheres. Grids on the board are placed on the ground to prevent irregular displacement during dice rolling. The die-rolling game is subsequently conducted. A die (block) is rolled by hand at the initial position, then continues to roll until another block in the grid is encountered, stops at the collision point, and is again rolled by hand towards the next block until the energy spheres come into contact with the grid. The randomized displacement experiment will repeat five times. The results indicate that the dramatic increase in heat-island intensity is caused by the collective characteristics of urban mass-undulations, namely the convergence of the destruction of the convection system demonstrated by hot and cold airflows. Based on these observations, researchers can then use other parallel experimental data to confirm this relationship.\n\nThis case study uses A. a ⸮ Method. B. the ؆ method. C. the ꙮ method. D. the ⵣ method. E. the ⚘ method.\n\n### Question:\nBased on the above, select the case that is consistent with the causal inference methods discussed above.\nA.

Whenever he misses a win it is because he simply could not see it. What he is not able to do is see _every_ win in a given position! Thus, the weakness of his play will be due to the fact that he maximally plays the kind of game he knows how to play. This differs from the ideal of perfect play only in so far as he does not play in the most correct way every move.\nProving that perfect or even sound play are impossible in chess is trivial. Chess is known to be \"incomplete\", that is, there is no possible algorithm capable of determining a best move everywhere the game may reach (actually, the converse of this statement is one definition of the phrase \"the game is complete\"). \"\n\nThe reasoning in this paragraph is based on which way of reasoning?\nA.

One critic of mathematics says that instead of showing that a large proportion of the series has this ratio, the statistician could have found an even larger proportion with any other ratio. Therefore, she feels that the argument is not valid because it is not a pattern that the series naturally gives.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA.

Mr. S is a legendary person for promoting new ideas. Mr. S believes that party Something can become the first party by altering several of the existing members and adding a handful of new standard party members. Strong party members are very strict about rules in this party, even with other members. This makes many of the party members think that Mr. S is not a good choice for leadership. Mr. S suggests that Finland should have a less strict system for candidates such as the Tsystem, which is based on exams rather than strict curriculums. These exams are not currently in use in Finland. Mr. S believes that Finland will be successful like America with this system, and that Finland will work much faster. This system is based on personal experiences with innovation. 40% of the population agrees with this new system. Therefore, party Something will be the leading party. Mr. S knows that the probability of someone adapting this system is 50%, and that party Something will win the elections 20% of the times. However, even if worst case scenario for party Something happens, its members do not have to be afraid.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA.

Since the objects were not all of the same material or structure, the objects have experienced different functions and use patterns. In the museum, a record is kept of the objects that are exhibited. Scientists have investigated the objects, especially the newer one-hundred-year-old ones. They describe and justify the use patterns for each individual object. This kind of research is called an \"in-depth investigation of the objects\" by scientists, and is very time-consuming. The results show that there is always more than one factor influencing the way the objects were used.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does this argument follow:\nA.

Mathematically calculate the portion of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked.\n4. Explain where the sentence of the essay submitted begins that relates to the question being asked.\n\nQ1 This paper addresses information interaction in the budget environment and analyzes the main operating factors involved in the function and impact development of the budget process, after which the main driving forces are identified for the successful application of cognitive schemes.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nA: The reason why the question is not answered is that the computation of information interaction in the budgeting environment is not addressed.\n\nThe number representing the percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form. We first have to calculate the starting portion of the essay submitted which relates to the question. We can do this by deducing the number of words that are in front of the relevant portion of the essay submitted.\n\nWe calculate how many words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 0 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. As a consequence, there are 0 divided by the amount of words in the sentence submitted (above), such that the total percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is 0%.\n\nThe sentence of the essay submitted begin that relates to the question being asked.\n\nA: The essay either does or does not contain the statement: In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nThis means that the relevant sentence/portions identified in the essay are:\n\nIn order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nUsing the above, we will calculate the amount of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We do this by subtracting each of the numbers in front of the words that relate to answering the question.\n\nLet's first add up the number of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 2 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We will calculate this by taking the words in front of the statement In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. and subtracting from it:\nThe subtraction formula for In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. is t\n\nQ2. Question:\n\nThe main theme of budgeting 2008 is that information systems at the operating level are cyclically sensitive in order to positively manage their budget, but there is also a cyclic message to the operating level that the initiation of business interests are often not a positive goal that the organization will achieve, and that the formally defined goal of controlling cost changes happens at the operating level.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form, and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nC: The sole reason why the question has been answered is the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure.\n\nThe word count formula for the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure is this:\n\nThe percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is",

Identify the objects and properties being discussed.\n2. Follow the logic steps in the reasoning rule when analyzing each step in the prompt.\n3. Ensure proper application of logic rules provided.\n\nRule:\n- The rule is denoted by the `[[]]` section. The rule assumes `some[other]information` is incorporated into summary response. The rule mentions that the agent \"will try to say something\" because of the sentence intentions. The rule mentions \"postractive\" and \"prepositive\" actions that give context to indicate how the word is used.

U(S,120), Because it indicates 120 elements satisfy the attribution. 2. It represents all the teachers, ensuring that the conclusion is based on complete information on the university teachers members. 3. The reasoning rules select the complete information from U(S,120) to obtain a conclusion. 4. The reasoning rules of the subject can be applied to the complete information. 5. The unity of the two concludes the numerator attracting elements within the total sample and ER using Ureason conclusions, such as if U(E,120),thenUnitedUniversityTeacherMembersxE(x.]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the configurations that lead to the wrong conclusion of this symbolized edition deduction?\n\nPlease provide all the configurations in the format [[]] together with brief descriptions that detail how the configurations lead to the wrong conclusion.\n\n### Answer:\n[[This abnormal condition leads to excessive options and difficulties and is the secondary quality of the defective conclusion. If the less differentiation is the primary property, the larger number is the secondary property. If the worse way is the primary property, the less property is the secondary property. If the bigger is the primary property, the more the property is the natural property.]]\n\nPlease finish the following:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rule-based symbolic logic inference\n\n(1) Define basic logical symbols and operations:\n    - ∧ (AND) - Combines two propositions and returns true if both are true.\n    - ∨ (OR)  - Combines two propositions and returns true if either is true.\n    - ¬ (NOT) - Reverses the truth value of a proposition.\n    - -> (IMPLIES) - If p -> q, then if p is true, q must be true.\n    - (this)  - Self-referential symbol indicating the current problem or proposition.\n    - (that)  - Self-referential symbol indicating something related to the current problem or proposition.\n    - (now)   - Self-referential symbol indicating the current moment or state.\n\nTo apply logical operations, use the syntax \"(this) (AND|OR|NOT|IMPLIES) (that)\" or \"(this) (AND|OR|NOT|IMPLIES) (now)\". For example, \"infer (this) AND (that)\".\n\n### Question:\nGiven the proposition that \"today is sunny AND tomorrow is rainy\".\n\n1. Use logical implication to infer the following statement: \"if today is sunny, tomorrow will be rainy\". Use \"infer (this) -> (that)\" to formulate the answer.\n\n### Answer:\ninfer (this) -> (that)\n\n### Question:\nGiven the proposition that \"if you study hard, you will get good grades\".\n\n1.

The first step in the search process is to retrieve the search query made by the users. This search query is then used to propose influencers data candidates that include the relevant topics and numbers.\n2. Once the influencers data candidates have been proposed, they are ordered by various metrics, such as topic relevance, follower count, membership number, and discussion popularity. Additionally, users can view related topics, see the analytics of a specific topic, and compare the analytics of two topics in the audience bar.\n3. The search process also utilizes circle information, where users with similar interests are placed in the same circle. The audience bar shows both crowd and role audiences, allowing users to easily identify and compare influencers for their specific needs.\n\n## Requirements:\n\n1. The first step to propose influencers data candidate and order.\n2. The first step to User searching input and searching order.\n3. User searching input is content provide.\n4.

The two hypotheses are contradictory, which aligns with the GB Paradox's rule that contradictory hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nThe scenario where the researcher confirms the hypothesis based on observations and later encounters contradictory observations matches the BC Paradox, where a universal hypothesis is confirmed but contradicted by another reasonable condition. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nIn the third scenario, the logical consequences of the observations contradict the hypothesis, which is in line with the LS Paradox. Reassessing the reasonableness of the hypothesis is necessary. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, a holomorphic hypothesis is presented, and the positive confirmation of observations in one case corresponds to the hypothesis while invalidating the hypothesis in another case. This matches the BC Paradox, where equivalent conditions and confirmation standards lead to a contradiction. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nFor the ZL Paradox, it is related to the principle of consilience, indicating that if a hypothesis can be corroborated by multiple lines of evidence, it is more likely to be true.

Below is a step-by-step analysis and response to this paradox:\n\n1. **Question and Answer Analysis**:\n\n   In the given question-and-answer pair, contradictory inductive reasoning and multiple hypotheses are presented. The analysis questions ask about the circumstances under which an observed phenomenon might lead to a logical paradox.\n\n2. **Identifying the Logic Rule**:\n\n   The GB Paradox is defined by the following rules:\n   - An observed phenomenon 'p' is noted.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_1' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_2' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Since 'q_1' and 'q_2' are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n   - Thus, it's not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and additional reasoning is required.\n\n3. **Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox Example**:\n\n   - A scientist observed that plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\n   - Hypotheses: The plant grows faster in sunlight or with more water.\n   - Comparison: This is an example of logically contradictory conclusions drawn from the same observation, which aligns with the GB Paradox.\n\n4. **Your Role in this Scenario**:\n\n   - As an intelligent assistant, you recognize the GB Paradox and answer questions related to the observation and hypotheses.\n   - You analyze the rules and provide insights into the paradox and its implications for logical reasoning.\n\n5. **About Your Function**:\n\n   - Your purpose is to assist with logical reasoning, identifying relevant properties and applying the GB Paradox's logical rules to the problem at hand.\n   - You ensure your output adheres to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n6. **An Example Way to Work**:\n\n   - Prepare a monolingual Python code that finds all the answers and all the feedback.\n   - Define a function that can analyze the Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox and provide feedback.\n   - Describe the rules and logic for your analysis.\n   - You use the function to analyze the GB Paradox and return appropriate answers.\n   - Since the BP Paradox is less significant, no specific example is provided.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2):\n    # Your code can include logic to check if the hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions\n    if (hypothesis1 != hypothesis2):\n        return \"Reasonable, but contradicting hypotheses. More information needed for a conclusion.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Hypotheses align. Additional analysis may be required.\"\n\n# Example usage\nobservation = \"Plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\"\nhypothesis1 = \"Plants grow faster in sunlight.\"\nhypothesis2 = \"Plants grow faster with more water.\"\nresult = analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a basic implementation of analyzing the GB Paradox in Python. Note that more advanced logic can be implemented to handle more complex scenarios.",

The rules define different types of speech acts and their characteristics. The questions test your understanding of these rules and your ability to apply them to specific sentences.\n\nFor example, the first question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"I →✧ that you submit the report by Friday\" belongs to. The answer is [[B]] because the sentence is a directive, which is a type of speech act that requires the addressee to do something. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not require the addressee to do anything.\n\nThe second question asks which category of speech act the word \"promised\" belongs to in the sentence \"John →I@ promised to clean the house before leaving.\" The answer is [[A]] because the word \"promised\" is used to assert a fact, which is the purpose of assertives. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve asserting facts.\n\nThe third question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"Congratulations to Galois on winning the game!\" belongs to. The answer is [[D]] because the sentence is an expressive, which is a type of speech act that expresses the speaker's mental state. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve expressing the speaker's mental state.\n\nThe fourth question tests your understanding of when the commissive speech act is followed by the sentence \"If you would please → ✊ speak more loudly, I will be able to hear you better over the noise in this room.\" The answer is [[B]] because the commissive speech act is followed when the speaker is able to hear the words clearly, even with the noise in the room. The other options are not correct because they do not correctly specify when the commissive speech act is followed.",

Assertive: The assertive speech act pattern corresponds to making normative or declaratory statements about a given proposition p. While not having an assertive mode as such in Chinese (see part 2.5.4), it is understood and expressed by comparison with the often occurring utterance X-shuo [X said] Pa-shi [the proposition shi in question’ is true], which simply reflects the shared presupposition that assertion is consistent with saying that a given proposition is true. Likewise, the negation of a statement is often formulated as X-shuo bù-shi [X said that it is not true that]. For this reason, assertive speech act patterns in Chinese can also be linked to assertive speech act patterns in the West Scientifically based tests of rationality typically focus on two things.\n\n2. Commissive: The commissive speech act pattern corresponds to making a promise or undertaking something in the future. In Chinese, a commitment is expressed using the structure ye-bowing or (v-bei-jian / n1 and n-jian / ad-c 1 if n≠n1 or b : v-xiejian), where v is a verb that fulfills some commitment (e.g., wul e for  wine and xiè for food), b is a specific beneficiary of the act (e.g. hosts or parties), the reflexive personal pronoun he hou-i’ ~~‘le / else-~l’~~ refers back and holds the entire construction. One issue with this structure is that it does not specify what obligation or commitment is expected; users must specify this empirically in the context.\n\n3. Directive: The directive speech act pattern corresponds to giving a command, order, or instruction to accomplish a given task p. Chinese doesnt have such directive modes as such in the grammatical structure of a sentence, but certain expression patterns in Chinese may be linked to more specific intention as being interpreted as directive speech act patterns A specific verb or adverb can signal a directive mode of speech act, and the structure ziliang-wo or (n-c-n /for the actors who will do the task described by n2) persisting in it once more applies to explicit expressions of intentions such deed.\n\n4. Expressive: The expressive speech act pattern corresponds to conveying a particular emotional state or mental state associated with a pattern e.g., sadness, joy, excitement etc.",

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### 🔧 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### ⚙️ Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"🎯 {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"🧩 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet’s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### 🤸 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### 🌐 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical",

The question should be relevant to the topic of anti-superstitious logical analysis, and the answer should involve the application of logical reasoning to analyze an example related to irrational beliefs and promote the adoption of scientific rationality. The answer should follow the rule accordingly\n\n### Answer:\n1. Is there any logical reasoning approach that can be applied to debunk the belief in ghosts and promote the acceptance of scientific explanations?\n1. Yes, logical reasoning can be used to analyze the existence of ghosts in a scientific manner. One way to do this might be to apply the principle of Occam's Razor, which states that one should choose the simplest explanation that fits the available evidence. In the case of ghosts, this would mean rejecting the existence of ghosts as the simplest explanation for unexplained phenomena, and instead using a scientific explanation such as natural phenomena or human delusion.\n2. In the process of promoting scientific rationality, is there any logical reasoning process that can be applied to correct people's superstitious ideas? If so, what are they and how can they be applied?\n1. Reasoning process #1: Scientists use the scientific method in their research, which involves making observations, formulating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses, and drawing conclusions from their results. By using the scientific method, people can learn to think critically and logically, and become more skeptical of superstitious beliefs that lack empirical evidence.\nReasoning process #2: Skeptics use logical fallacies to expose the flaws in superstitious beliefs. For example, the argument from design is a logical fallacy that claims that because something looks designed, it must have been designed. By recognizing and understanding these logical fallacies, people can become more critical of superstitious beliefs and more willing to accept scientific explanations. In practice, these reasoning processes can be applied by promoting the use of the scientific method in education and using skepticism to challenge superstitious beliefs.\n3. There are many misguided beliefs about ghosts that have been circulating in our history. Some people believe that ghosts are real or may make contact with someone to share the way of the netherworld. Others believe that if ghosts are caught on camera or video, the living can communicate with them. Still others believe that ghosts may appear at specific times or in specific locations, such as on Halloween or in places where high numbers of deaths have occurred. Do you believe that these statements are scientific or logical? Why?\n4. Most of these statements are not supported by scientific evidence and logical reasoning. For example, there is no empirical evidence that ghosts exist or that they can communicate with humans. While some people may have had supernatural experiences, these experiences are often difficult to reproduce or verify and can often be explained by other factors, such as psychological or physiological factors, rather than the presence of ghosts. In general, superstitious beliefs like these should be challenged by using logical reasoning and the scientific method, and it's important for people to approach these beliefs with a critical and skeptical mindset, rather than accepting them without question.\n5. Although there is no scientific explanation for ghosts, many people in human history still believe in ghosts and pass on many ghost stories to future generations. What could be the reason for the superstitious belief that ghosts exist?\n6. Since the 5th century AD, people from all walks of life have been interested in discussing ghosts, developing a discourse on ghosts, and people discuss many issues related to ghosts, including: Do we fear the fear of ghosts more or we self-promotion more Do you believe in the power of fear because it enhances your passions and elevates your imagination? Do you prefer to learn the necessary skills to identify ghost signs? If so, why do you still believe in ghosts? Psychologists have tried to understand why people have such strong beliefs in ghosts, a mystical entity believed to be a disembodied soul. There are several different psychological factors that may be at play: fear of the unknown, anthropocentrism, importance of exploration, and stories about ghost experiences that cannot be directed scientifically. These factors explain why people are more likely to believe in ghosts, even if the evidence is lacking.\n7. You plan to start a business too. After receiving the option to start a ghost-themed business, you start from a ghost to imagine the key details of the entire business, rather than assuming that there must be ghosts. As a result of this divergent thinking, your business has begun to take shape and is now ready for development, imagination, and creativity. It also shows that sometimes creative ideas can make a business stand out and have unique charm, and inspired thinking can lead to good results.\n####\n'''",

I am committed to staying later if necessary.\"\nC: \"Yes, as long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met. Each individual can give their input as appropriate.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, A asks two questions in one sentence: the first is whether there is a plan for the weekend, and the second is the content of the plan. B's answer \"Yes, as long as enough time is dedicated to this work, the final deadline can be met\" seems to indicate that there is a plan for the weekend, and for B, this plan is to stay at work to ensure that the deadline is met. In contract, C's answer, \"Yes, it depends on the individual response. As long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met\" does not indicate whether there is a plan for the weekend.\n\nCoordination is built with the Information Principle here. Since [deadline] matches the concrete plan, that is why in the linguistic composition, speakers use [delay the deadline] to indicate the plan to delay the deadline, and they also use [meet the deadline] to convey that meeting the deadline is included in the plan contents.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Does that prevent her from entering the city?\"\nB: \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs.\"\nC: \"I am also working and living in the suburbs.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, the word \"alone\" as used in B's response is treated as a semantically empty element in B's speech stance. Therefore, \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs\" conveys two meanings in B's intended utterance: \"Also living in the suburbs,\" and \"(Not) living with a spouse in the suburbs.\" B is still conveying the meaning \"living alone,\" which is why the Information Principle permits hearers to interpret even semantically empty elements as significant terms when such an interpretation can be justified linguistically, as is the case here. C is nothing other than using a longer response to simply specify that he is living in the suburbs, but there is no clearly specified part after [alone], leaving the content [living alone] unchanged.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Below is a custom-defined rule for determine grammar. When responding, please ensure \nthat your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Language Rule:\n\nCustom Relationship between Sentences\n\n1. Strict Subset Principle\n\n(1) Setting: Assume the same time, that is, X will happen before Y.\n(2) Speaker's Criterion: Always indicate the strict subset relationship with the following rules.\n    - CQ1: Satisfied subset relationship can be indicated using definite articles. For example:\n        - \"Li will go with Wang to Beijing.\" (Li will arrive first)\n        - \"Li will go to Beijing with Wang.\" (Li and Wang will arrive at the same time)\n        - \"Wang will go with Li to Beijing.\" (Wang will arrive first)\n    - CQ2: If using the definite article causes confusion or conflict, use indefinite articles instead. For example:\n        - \"A man went to London and a woman went to Beijing.\" (statements do not determine whose journey was first)\n2. Complementary Sentence Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: If a sentence implies a time sequence or relationship, use the Semantic Minimization Criterion according to the following rules.\n    - CQ1: If a sentence means both sending and receiving, you must add \"certain\" to one of the sentences to clarify the meaning. For example:\n        - \"Li brought Xiao a gift.” Indicates Li sent a gift to Xiao.\n        - \"A man gave a woman a gift.\" Indicates the action was carried out by both parties.\n    - CQ2: If a sentence implies a time sequence, you must partially complement the sentence to ensure the meaning is clear. For example:\n        - \"Li entered the office, then Wang left.\" Indicates Li entered the office after Wang left.\n        - \"Wang left the office and Li entered.\" Indicates Wang left the office before Li entered.\n        - \"A man left the room and a woman entered.\" Indicates one person left the room and another person entered.\n3. Perfect Inference Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: When excluding uncertain facts, a sentence with stronger certainty should include an interrogative word. For example:\n    - \"Does Li have the key?\" means Li has the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li has the key.\n    - \"Doesn't Li have the key?\" means Li does not have the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li does not have the key.\n4. Every Other Least Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: The hearer should infer as much as possible from the speaker's every utterance, filling in necessary information based on common sense.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: You can infer the meaning that is obvious first and is most likely to be intended. For example:\n        - \"Li left and Wang left\", assuming these two events must be related, can lead to the inference that both left together or in sequence.\n        - \"Li left the room and Wang left\" can lead to the inference that Wang left without realizing Li had left.\n    - CI2: You should never draw the least likely inferences. For example:\n        - If Xiao receives and gives gifts on different occasions, the statement \"He gave Xiao a gift.\" cannot be directly inferred as \"He gave Xiao a gift, then he received a gift.\"\n(3) Interrogative sentences: If a speaker intends to inquire about something through an interrogative sentence, they should consider minimizing the inclination to provide the hearer with a definite answer.\n5. Smart Interpreter Principle\n\n(1) Hearer's Inference: When predicting a speaker's intention, you should attribute a speaker's statement to a theory that will not be immediately disproved by other evidence.\n(2) Adhering to the Occam's Razor principle, you should choose explanations for a given set of data that are as simple as possible consistent with said data, over more complex explanations which assume the presence of additional, unnecessary factors.\n\n\n\n### Question:\nA: “Xiao Wang, do you speak English?”\nB: “I can speak English.”\n\nIn sentence B, the speaker expresses a degree of ability to communicate in spoken English, but the completeness of the message is uncertain.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

In this case, we need to offer more guidance. We can view the completion of these actions as questions where the answers are modal actions.\nFirst, let's define a bunch of functions that provide the names of modal actions. :\n\nconst MEMORIZE = {\n  icon: \"💫\",\n  name: \"Memorize\",\n\n  // Represents the table of modal actions, which initially contains only\n  // [\"Pasting content from Clipboard\"]. Users are able to add more entries to\n  // this table through the memorizeModal function.\n  actions: [`“Pasting content from Clipboard”`],\n};\nconst actionConfigsByIcon = {\n  MEMORIZE: MEMORIZE,\n};\nconst getActionConfigByIcon = (name: string) => actionConfigsByIcon[name];\n\n// Prints an error message if the action cannot be found by icon.\nconst actionNameByIcon = (icon: string) => {\n  const actionConfig = getActionConfigByIcon(icon);\n  if (actionConfig) {\n    return actionConfig.name;\n  }\n  throw Error(\n    `Cannot find config of modal action with icon ${icon}.Please check your pronounction.`\n  );\n};\nNow, to memorize these actions, we can add additional focus in Our AutoGPT action-based approach, and paste the modal actions table into the initialization text. To make memorizing actions easier when testing, we can also utilize a function that prints the steps for memorizing:\n\n12events\nHere is the configuration file for memorizing modal actions. It is a dictionary that creates a new AI with the name and agent2 token, uses the AUTO-GPT agent2 cart, and adds the memory stream to it as an input stream. Additionally, it adds the role mix stream to the role mix contexts. The field advisor_results_string allows the AI's role to be emphasized in other streams.\n\n```python\n\"\"\" # remember modal actions ask each ask learning2 items questions attributes memory\n\n\"\"\" # ask a2ki questions attributes memory\n\nHere is a part of any basic Python settings for Auto-GPT.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom auto_gpt.config.settings import AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nSettings = AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nclass AG2a2kiSettings(Settings):\n\n__file__ = __file__\n__file_path__ = \"/home/zhenyu/Hermes_jupter_notebook/RTG_shared_clone_0618-manifolds.git/local/src/auto_gpt/config/settings.py\"\n\n# Profile\n# settings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple_ninja.cfg\"\nsettings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple.cfg\"\n\n# model id\nai2_api_token = \"AI2_TOKEN\"\nprint(f\"{__file_path__}: {settings_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n  # if process is None:\n  #   import mypc\n  #   procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  #   Process(['nvidia-smi', f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sleep(5)\n  #   q = libtc.tenant_list_gpus(int(procid))\n  #   gpu_info = \",\".join([*it.pairwise(q[10:11])][0])\n  #   print(gpu_info)\n  #\n  #   Process([\"nvidia-smi\", f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sys.stdin.flush()\n  #   print(g, h, k)\n\n  import mypc\n  procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  print(gpu_info)\n\n  import time\n  print(time.time())\n  ther = time.time()%1024\n  print(ther)\n\n  all_gpus = len(g) + len(h) + len(k)\n  n = int(all_gpus*.83)\n\n  a1 = []\n  if n >= 1:\n    g1 = np.array(g[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 10:\n    g1 = np.array(h[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 20:\n    g1 = np.array(k[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n\n  b1 = True\n  ids = []\n  print(a1[0])\n  print(a1[1])\n  for i2 in range(0, n):\n    for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n      if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n        aid =  a1[z1][i2]\n        p = np.where(a2ki[:,2] == aid)\n        id = a1[z1][i2]\n        ids.append(id)\n\n  #for i2 in range(0, n):\n  #  for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n  #    if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n  #      id = a1[z1][i2]\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(f'{id}:{q}')\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}', f'{id}']})\n  #        tt = np.array(v)\n  #        tem = tt.shape[0]\n  #        print(f'{id}:{tt}')\n  #        if tem >= 1:\n  #          q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        else:\n  #          libtc.tenant_revoc_gpu(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'], force=True)\n\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(q)\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}',",

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nProvide the criteria and corresponding definitions for each type of Lexical Definitions in your intuitions. Please give your answer in the following format:\n\nLexical Definition | Description | Criteria\n\n### Answer:\nℵ Definition | Simply reporting or describing the existing usage of the defined word - Definition should simply report or describe the existing usage of the term/word which is being defined.\n\nℓ Definition | Description of its origin, evolution, or development without reference to the actual entity - The definition should focus on describing the origin, evolution, or development of the term/word without referring to the actual entity.\n\n∇ Definition | Transformation of meaning - Definition should reflect a change in the meaning or usage of a term/word, distinct from its previous form.\n\n---\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ¥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n---\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

This is much better than before. Remember, this is just a one-shot, there’s no iteration involved. And the output is quite testable, it’s not opaque.\n\nThis template can be used in a lot of cases when trying to apply common reasoning forms such as syllogisms, logical arguments, etc.\n\nThis incredible result was achieved with chatGPT. This could easily be used in any programming or analytical flow.\n\n## Understanding the Limitation\n\nThe understanding we need to build is around the limitations of the LLMs. LLMs are engines of statistical correlations and synthesizing it into a new output. The models have poor inductive biases, poor in-context generalization and often fail to pass the simplest of tests, including pattern recognition. Check the roulette paper here. There are worrying limits here, the best of the LLMs still fail to pass basic reasoning capacities. But they seem to excel in understanding text.\n\nConsider this situation, I wanted to compare the salary/jobs offering in X against Y. Plotting out a few stats seemed like a good thing to do. So, I wrote X Salary Vs Y Salary. And wanted to get comparisons, so I wrote:\n\n(number of job offers(X)/(number of marks in decile)) - (number of job offers(Y)/(number of marks in decile))\n\nHowever, plots didn’t give me the results I wanted. Then I thought of writing a prompt to compare:\n\nTo identify the higher offering career option, what should we compare? Answer: salary\n\nWhich is simpler? Maybe the comparison function, I could test the Cross Validation score and if it was good, it could easily be implemented.\n\nThe following result was amazing. Although any reading would elucidate the simple concept.\n\nYou can imagine language models are “trained” on all this data. Even if GPT-3 is trained on a large chunk of Wikipedia, it can still replace the concept of mathematical functions. With the context of Einstiens Theory of Relativity, I would still be able to replace Time Dilation with Distance Dilemma. The AI system just doesn’t have the concept around these. Adding training data would just reinforce the previously ingrained ideas.\n\nFor anything that is new to GPT-3, it resorts to explanatory analysis or a breaking down with logic chains. It might be wrong at times but majority of the answers should be correct at LogICAL level.\n\n#### Not knowing a language\n\nWhat happens if the AI doesn’t know a language? Well said and well done! How can I analyze this statement with GPT-3?\n\nNow compare to this:\n\nHere, we gave certain context to GPT-3 so it could understand the content better, expand it and analyze it at a more nuanced level. This is the first barrier we face when we’re trying to analyze things, we must understand it. With a bit of input, we can get the reasoning done.\n\n#### Red Herring can be deceptive.\n\nGPT-3 thinks that I wanted to learn about Data Management. But it might have thrown it in there purposefully (gentle sarcasm).\n\nTo get the arguments down I gave the structure\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nAs a language model, I cannot make a subjective recommendation as to which one is better in a general sense. Both options have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and it's impossible to determine that without knowing the specific requirements and use case for which they are being considered.\n\nAn experienced and qualified technical analyst familiar with both of the software options would be better equipped to evaluate the two options and make an objective recommendation based on the use case's exact needs and requirements. They would be able to assess the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, it's difficult to definitively predict which one would be better overall, as it largely depends on the project's specific needs and requirements. I suggest consulting an experienced and qualified professional to make a more informed recommendation.\n\nAnything you input into the prompt, the AI can spit it back if you ask it in a different way. Let’s do that.\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nBased on the analysis, X seems to have a few additional advantages over Y. For example, the added flexibility of X in being able to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements and its scalability in complex projects are noteworthy. However, it's important to note that one software option is not necessarily better than the other since X and Y are intended to address different needs and goals and are used for different purposes.\n\nUltimately, it depends on the specific circumstances, requirements, and goals of the project. Your industry expert may need to dig deeper into the specific capabilities, advantages, and limitations of each of the options, and compare them to determine which one would be the best fit. They may also consider factors such as the project's proper fit, the available budget and resources of the startup, the potential benefits and impacts of utilizing one over the other, and the expected outcomes.\n\nAgain, it's my recommendation that consulting a qualified and experienced professional is the best course of action, as they are in a better position to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case.\n\nDo you think the person you asked it to contact was correct?\n\nYes, as it stated earlier, it's recommended to consult a qualified and experienced professional to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case. An experienced professional would have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nThey would also be able to assess the long-term implications and potential impact of utilizing one option over the other and advise on the most optimal solution for the project, considering all the",

Secondly, a survey conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, revealed that adults who performed 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week had significantly reduced anxiety symptoms. Finally, a long-term study by the British Psychological Society found that individuals with an active lifestyle had noticeably better mental health compared to those who led a sedentary lifestyle. These specific research findings support the general notion that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use specific instances to argue for the truth of the proposition.\nB.Syl+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use universal propositions as premises and supporting conclusions through syllogistic reasoning.\nC.Metaph+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic.\nD.Case+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not prove the truthfulness of the original proposition by discussing each case separately.\nE.Contra- Method: Incorrect. The method does not refute the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one.\nF.Elim- Method: Incorrect. The method does not eliminate other possibilities related to the original proposition as false.\n\nA.E+ Method: Correct. The method uses specific research findings to argue for the truth of the proposition that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\n\n### Goodbye!\n\n\"\"\"\n\ndefault_nlu = {\"nlu_datas\": {}, \"procedure_examples\": {\"nlu\": []}}\nnlu_records = None\ntry:\nwith open(configs.get(\"BASE_PATH\", \"#\") + f\"/nlu_table.jsonl\") as f:\nfor line in data_gen:\nnlus = json.loads(line.strip())\nif nlus[\"nlu_datas\"] != default_nlu:\nnlu_records = nlus\nreturn\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\nreturn\n\ndef empty_prompt():\nreturn f\"\"\"\nYour task to provide me with contextual knowledge.\nThe response format is as follows:\nif it's for meta level, the context should end with T, then the response should only contain its conclusion.\nif it's for input level, the context should end with M, then the response should only contains its conclusion for mulitple metalevel.\nIf there is no conlusion, the output should be repeat context followed by N, the inference should repeat pre sequeces\ninchronization with metadata response.\nIf the conclusion does not support input sequence, the response should be N.\n\n------------------------------\n### Context:\nLong high level context can be represented here.\n\n------------------------------\nExample:\n### Context:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Input:\n{instructions_prompt(task_descriptions)}\n### Metadata:\n{summary}\n### Answer:\nT\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nPlease give the location the dog right before it was jumped.\nN\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Metadata:\n{math_problem_instruction_body}\nOutput:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.

Now a teacher designs a course in the lecture room for the math students who live in the nearby areas. Since they live in the same residence R, the teacher asks the students to wait for the teacher in the grass on R. This course should be designed within a 10-minute range from the position of R. In the Collection C, which includes all the classrooms, the teacher finds that C12 is very near to R.\n\nOne day, Xiao Ming, lives in R, talks to his roommate Xiao Chen about this thing and asks Xiao Chen whether Xiao Chen knows the name of the course. Xiao Chen said, \"I think it is very much near to T.\" Xiao Chen knows that Xiao Chen knew that T teaches mathematics. Xiao Chen then found that Xiao Chen has an incorrect adding information, but then assumes that T has not been changed. This newly found R12 is very much as a random subset for T.
