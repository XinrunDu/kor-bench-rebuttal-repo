What questions are they likely to ask.\n\n### Answer:\n Why and how was the site built? Key features of the site Additional features Top pages of the site How to reach me Routing paths and keyword hashtags that visitors are likely to see\n\n### Question:\nI want to know where the front door and the restroom are?\nThe first sentence indicate that.The original mr mustache project, to expand the renting room and to make room for a store,The lasted projects,New entrances were added,with a three-storey commercial building,with glass roofs.I can't get any information about the location of restroom.I am trying to figure it out this answer in this picture.If the answer is in the image,please output me.\nThe building was made on transition and duality,and spontaneity.\n\n1.### Answer:\n I can't see the exact location of the restroom and the front door on this image, but I'll try to explain where they should be located based on the information I have. Based on the description in the first sentence, I understand that there were some changes made to the building. From my initial interpretation, it seems like there are some new entrances added for the three-storey commercial building, and these entrances also have glass roofs above. However, I'm not quite sure if your question is specifically referring to the location of the original entrance and restroom before any modifications were made, or if you are asking about the new entrances and restroom that were added. Please clarify your question so that I can provide you with a more precise answer.\n\n### Question:\nthis sentence indicate there is a new project,Standing slightly apart from the rental rooms,A commercial building with a glass roof.I want to know what the color of glass roof are there?Is it red?\nThe door is hiding.It is painted in the same color as the brick..The brick are gray,so may be the color of cilynder roof is gray.\n\n### Answer:\n I don't know if the answer is in text or not. I think the answer is in situ,here is some infomation for you to guess.\n\n### Answer:\n In the context of the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned what color the glass roof is. The only color mentioned is gray, which could be a possibility for the brick color that the door is painted to match. However, the answer is not in the text you provided. May I suggest some other approach in assisting you with your question?\n\n### Question:\nThis sentence indicates that,The newest addition is a glass-roofed three-an-a-half-storey-commercial building.One storey is less than three-an-a-half.How many storeys does this commericial buiding have?In total\nThis is no description about the color of the glass-roofed.But in addition to the color of the glass-roofed,Is there any information that can give a hint of the color?\n\n### Answer:\n I believe the answer is black, based on the description in the question.\n\n### Question:\nI agree with you,I think it is black too.How many storeys does this commercial building have,is it 3.5 or 2.5\n\n### Answer:\n I cannot provide the best answer for you.\n\n### Question:\nLets infer,Conclusion 1,If the Steel frame and brick of the building are colorless and half-transparent,the other elements must be black to complete the picture.Conclusion 2,It is possible that the steel frame and brick of the building are colorless, but the front door is not, for some reason.Conclusion 3,This possibility reduces the likelihood of the front door being black.Therefore,I want to lean more towards Conclusion 1,So what I need to do is to infer other elements in grandmannstrasse 34 are black too?\n\n### Question:\nBring up the answer.\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.The building is made by steel.\n\n### Question:\nGreat,There is only one pane with glass roofted commericial buiding at grandmannstrasse 34.Thinking about the color of this buiding.is it gray ?yet no information about the color of glass roofted commericial buiding has been mentioned.There is color match to the front door,It is window.What is the color of hi window?Is it black too?\nThe answer to my first question is No, so there is no need to look for a match for this door at grandmannstrasse 34.Focus on finding a match for the front door at some warehouses in grandmannstrasse 34.Tell me what you think?Does this window better match the front door in appearance,does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.According to the text provided, at the intersection of grandmannstrasse 34 and humboldtstrasse 18,there are a large number of warehouses,which are the office of Mr.Mustache. The building, which is a three-storey commercial building, also belongs to the reception of the office of the warehouse.\n\n### Question:\nI understand that.。You haven't answered my second question yet.Does this window better match the front door in appearance, does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n I can't answer that question. I suggest you ask the questions from the transcript that you have.\n\n### Question:\nThis page has a door that is painted the same color as the brick, instead of being in the color of the previous door.The color of door and brick are both gray.What is the answers to this question?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation,and The planner in this portfolio of Door Projects makes his door like that.\n\n### Question:\nThe not ans property is not needed anymore since the rectangular red frame cover first word overlaps second word is the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word doesn't need to be covered.\nThe not ans property is first word overlaps second word but it is not the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word needs to be covered.Do you agree?\n\n### Answer:\n###### I can't confirm the previous sentence,so i strongly suggest you not using this sentence.\n###### Explanation:\n###### The words overlaps and covers are two distinct actions, and it is possible for them to result in different outcomes due to variations in their parameters or their manner of execution. However, the specific differences between the outcomes of these actions in question will depend on the specific criteria that are used to evaluate them. As a result, if the parameters or the implementation of the check differs in two cases, then the different conclusions about the details of the conditions in the two cases may be reached. Without more information about the specific definitions and criteria that are being used to evaluate the consequence of the overlaps and covers actions, it is impossible to determine which one will be used to reach a particular conclusion.\n\n### Question:\nIf the doors of dilertamasre required to be stored under the rearge door, this means that they are grey.Which rearge door     does that refer to?\nEach door has multiple versions, for example, Two versions of the door have been derived from two different versions of sequence.What are the nearest numbers to the left of     \"is required to be stored under the rearge door\"?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation.The mention of inside right and in groundbrunnerstaase mean the instance.They are the keywords. Manager Park is the best indicator to shops. Little flag is the best to pave the French degree.\n\n### Question:\nDo you agree with me?\nWho are they in groundbrunnerstaase?Who is the instance?What are the nearest numbers to the left of   \"is required to be stored under\".Are these numbers consistent with the number closer to the right of the statement?If so,what is a stark?what number should it be.you can answer me like this,\"This would indicate that the distance was one fifty.\n\n### Answer:\n Explanation:\n As a reminder, this topic is not literary style, but a simple and plain way of recording facts, not the like of a novel.It seems that it is not literary style that you have written, and the understanding of the content of your text cannot be achieved in an effective way by relying on the knowledge in the mind.You will try to guess so that the system can answer your question.For this project, you are using a language model that has been tuned (trained) to operate effectively, and these language models can always represent the text into novel-style text.When your brain can not parse the problem in a intuitive way, you will use your critical thinking skills to solve this problem.\n\n### Question:\nYes,I know they' Sensebility is bad.If they' are under rearge door,the floor itself is the best rearge door,right?\n",

It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later.

Your primary responsibility is to understand and apply the rule accurately to the provided puzzle prompts. The rule governs how encoding and decoding of custom payloads are performed, using the words and phrases provided as keys to the payload content. The rule you need to follow is as follows: Presented with a custom puzzle, your task is to apply the following rule:\n\n1. Understand the rule thoroughly by breaking down the steps into simpler components.\n2. Apply the rule to each puzzle question by rearranging the letters of the phrase in a specific way.\n3. Your answer should include a single, newly formed word or phrase that is valid.\n4.

Your primary responsibility is to follow these rules accurately for any provided computation requests. The rules govern how computation is performed on simple numbers to obtain distinct solutions. The rules you need to follow are as follows: For a given computation request, your task is to apply the following rule:\n\n1. You can choose to split the computation into three parts. Each part constitutes a new equation/expression to solve, and it should contain two or more than two explanatory or deduction steps.\n\n2. Always try to provide a precise, step-by-step solution so that any of the three equations solve the final result theoretically.\n\n3. Tasks are designed to be straightforward and not overly complex, maximizing simplicity.\n\n4. Consider any symbols as equal to their actual letter-value.\n\n### Instructions:\n1.\tGiven a computation request 0+1+2+3+4+5+6=21, solve this expression with three almost equal equations and then get the solution of the last equation. Try to match the last equation with the actual given expression as much as possible.\n\n\nAs you can see from these examples, LLMs have the potential to be a powerful tool for creating instruction tuning datasets.

Only some syllables may be used so a hexagram has been supplied to indicate which syllables to use.\n\nThe fourth paragraph:\n\n 'The replaced word must contain all five relationship groups. ...' The phrase FOR circle encourages a ?? is the missing word. The 16 hexagrams in chronological order should be considered to have associated relationships. 1st hexagram is attributed to a King, 2nd hexagram relates to an Emperor, 3rd relates to Official, 4th relates to a Warrior, 5th to a Healer, 6th to a Mentor, 7th to a Sage, 8th to a Parent, 9th to a Child, 10th to a Brother, 11th to a Sister, 12th to a Representative, 13th to a Leader, 14th to a Helper, 15th to a Scribe, 16th to a Student. The missing word must fill all those roles!\n\nThe fifth paragraph:\n\n 'The word will sound like it.' Further interspatial sounds need to be made cyclically - the student to the leader, the healer to the verse (and so on).\n\nI chose a word that rhymes with verse (or at least is phonetically very close to it) for all the required sounds.\nThe hexagrams I replaced:\n\n Two soft vowels and one hard but soft consonant (weorgecyn) created a hexagram for each 1st name of King George I (Heinrich), II (George) and III (Wart) of England. The hexagrams were for King, Emperor, Official, Warrior, Mentor and Sage.\n\nI used the only syllable form for the remaining required words:\n\n Father, Child, Brother, sister, Rep, Leader and Student.\n\nFor the other three, I chose\n\n the three words that are used most often in puzzles; the help蕉, the word rot, and the puzzle.\n\nThe new words were:\n\n truth, faith, heart, miss, police, evil and hexagram.\n\nI think they all relate to the missing word (lets go with helper, can't go quite as Phoebe's suggestion of 'answer').\n\nSome relationship groups could have been chosen differently giving a slightly fewer number of requested groups.\n\nA: My goal was to use\n\n gateway letters.  These are letters that are good for passing through the gates of the house that each relationship lives in.  How do you learn what letters carry what relationship? Easy! Read the oldest special kind of dictionary that Wikipedia still exists and is allowed. That's how you can learn the pillars of light that tells your guidebook of the stars, a journey of light through time. \n\n1. 1: cousin \n2. 2 letters, 3:  home is where the heart is. \n3. You (4) is why you are in my house (5), and as the ruler of this (5), I'm responsible for it. 7. Don't you come in my (6) like that, little soldier. (5) is the boss of you, but I also see horns forming on your head. (5) gets a lot of credit.\n4. 2 sounds bell, 3 resounds, 4 rings, 5 rings, 6 shuts, 7 unlocks, 8 closes, 9 opens, 10 locks, 11 stops, 12 locks again, 13 chains, 14 unlocks by magic, 15 barks away the wolves, 16 howls wearily.\n5. Hexagram 6 indicates that this 5 is a distancer, a grower, a den of invalidation, and a willful agent. Obviously, there is overlap, just like in the King's Hexagrams!\n\n",

Various interests on the promotion\n\nVery interesting, as it is closely related to the needs of open source, isn't it?\n\nWait, I thought you asked me to evaluate the quality of the speech. You gave me a lot of information, but I forgot what I should actually do. What should I do?\n\nThe task I gave you is to do a speech analysis, the topic of the speech is open source software, and the evaluator is an open source entrepreneur. You can use a large general LLM to specific speech reviews, so that you can tailor the analysis to better meet the needs of open source entrepreneurs.\n\nAt the current level of speech analysis, there are few tasks to be completed, and there is no need to contact or lead to non-related information.\n\nFirst, you can summarize the content of the speech for the open-source entrepreneur.\n\nSecond, explain the opinion of the company's executive on open source software\n\nThird, explain the intention of the company’s CEO and the intentions of the representative of the investment organization.\n\nFourth, explain the intentions of the company's attorney to do the business due diligence of the open-source software agreement\n\nI want to analyze the Delphinali Apple CORE VII APHINO against the open source.\n\nVery good, the business has clearly expressed its intention to do due diligence of its agreement with open source software. The company's lawyer clearly believes that it is necessary for open source software enterprises to conduct business reviews, as well as to support open source software, enhance their reputation and improve their public visibility?\n\nUh oh, that's not what I wrote in the incomplete corporate speech for an open source business, and I'm trying to see if there's a better way for us not to have anyone turned away from doing business with an open-source business at any time or space. Open source is very convenient\n\nYou should focus strictly on the text of the complete and professional speech. But you can use your imagination to provide a highly accurate summary of my intentions to represent a complete and amazing rebuttal to you to better clarify what the company can do with open source software in an expansive sense.\n\nBe imaginative; not only should you provide an accurate summary of textual information, but also deliver it in an effective way to express the company's appreciation for providing participation in business with open source.\n\nGenerating in 7 mode\n\nGerard Cloutier wrote:\n\nPaul Lisgo wrote in an email today:\n\nAgreed that GPT isn't omnipotent anymore than any other evolutionary tech. keep in mind the cull of diminishing returns and what happens when something becomes ubiquitous through generalization and eventual specialization. There are some studies on the background of 'end of the law' series and the way software has become a necessity to ensure business viability.\n\nConsequences of AI Will be Dramatic columnist for Rolling Stone says:\n\nOur roles relative to the always-learning intelligence of software will change",

Come up with the following sentences.\n\n  Sentence 1: Choose a word or phrase.\n\n  Sentence 2: Rearrange the letters to form a new word or phrase using all or some of the letters.\n\n  Sentence 3: Questions should indicate the requirement for the number of letters to be used.\n\n  Sentence 4: The newly formed word or phrase should be a valid word or phrase and be listed in the dictionary. Additionally, the answer should cite all the letters used to form that word.\n\nQ2. Understand the following questions by referring to the previous rules and cite the answer after applying the sentence rules to the question. (Mention the number used in rewrite sentence 2 and the rreference value used in rewrite sentence 3)\n\n  Question 1: You can't edit random strings of text like ''VRJSIYARHG'' given  by sentence 1. Separate the correct letters in sequence according to the number used and rewrite sentence 1.\n  Question 2: If you use more than 10 letters given in sentence 1, create the text in rewrite expression of Question 1, which was judged to have the longest length.\n  Question 3: Cannot revise the rewrite of sentence 1, but you can revise only the letters given in sentence 2. Separate the correct letters in sequence and create the longest text possible.\n  Question 4: You can only use the mixed letters of [[expected output]] created in question 1,2,3, but each letter must be used only once.\"\"\"\n\nTo solve the problem I tried the following three\n\n\n*I split the problem in 2\n1. first I tried to get a AI to solve a part of the problem\n2.

It’s not unusual for a person to report themselves to have played approximately 30 hours a day or more\n. At this rate of progress, a person would need to play 0.021 hours of Fortnite to be one hour more skilled than Mike, assuming that they play Fortnite at the same pace as Mike.”\n\nORIGINAL CAPTION: In minutes, this time is equivalent to 0.432 minutes. This means that someone who has just started playing Fortnite will have an advantage over Mike by 0.89 minutes if they are playing at the same intensity of Mike.”\n\nORIGINAL CAPTION: However, depending on the level the game is played at, someone who has never played Fortnite before may not be expected to be able to catch up to Mike’s skill level in such a short amount of time.

So write an algorithm!\nWith normal rules of arithmetic, a sum like $$9999+8888=18887$$ has 12 distinct digits, so the maximum number of digits which an n-digit sum can include is $$2n-2$$.\n\n How many possible sums are there with the digits occurring once in the given range?\n\n$$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$$] $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$\n\n For the first sum above, order the numbers from small to big. Then figure out the maximum sum of digits. For the second sum, start with the 11 instead of the $$0$$ and the $$0$$ where the $$9$$ was etc. To do this efficiently, you can just increase/decrease the relevant number/numbers in the max-sum-of-digits-sum for each \"sum-scheme\" by $$1$$.\n\nBased on this, we know that\n\n the maximum length of a possible numbers is 3, otherwise, there would be more than 12 digits inside the sum.\n Therefore, the three numbers need to be selected from a list of 4/5/6/7 numbers. This can be done in $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the first puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the second puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/2=52.5$$ (Although this is not possible, round it down to $$52$$) and $$(7*6*5*4)/(3*2*1)=140$$ ways for the fourth puzzle.\n\nSo\n\n There are $$35+35+52+140=262$$ possible sums.\n\nCan you take it from here and write a simple algorithm or code yourself?\n\nA: I did the code in php.

But beyond that, I am a layman who has no special privileges, and therefore I have no other power than my intuition, nor my common sense.\nI would like to not only leave the responsibility of my decision exclusively in the hands of Chat GPT, but also consider high philosophers of the spirit whose opinion comes into my mind “with lordly pleasure” to test whether or not my ideas fit the shape of the facts.\nThe two lines of evidence I have about ChatGpt as reliable is the following:-\n1) It embodies the virtue of sticking to facts (an Aristotelian virtue) and therefore leads to objectivity.\n2) It would supply a powerful driving force to learning by logical deduction.

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k",

If the prompt were submitted to an LLM, this is the typical kind of answer you would get.\nReducing this value to 4 means the test-taker needs to change 4 letters between the two words in order to satisfy the rules presented.\nWhen I run the prompt shown against GPT-4, I get the same answer of 5 as shown in the screenshots.\nOnce the prompt has been submitted, the only way to change the answer is merely through human interaction such as providing feedback to the LLM. My intercom prompt allowed me to reduce 5 to 4, though I wish it would be more direct in some cases.\nOn the one hand, the auto-grading takes the responsibility for making this change away from the human teacher. On the other hand, the prompt creator is making the rules that the LLM will follow to answer questions for the students. This is not necessarily bad or good; in any case, we have been using computers on versions of this premise since Douglas Englebart, Mark Zuckerberg, Roger Crew and myself have been here.\nThe main takeaway here is the focus on providing better instruction so that the student learns more, faster and with less repetition.\nSo far, this is only an outline. My Prompt Magician extension is the only tool available directly for ChatGPT answers, but I have a larger system in the oven for a host of LLM and other AI systems. In my opinion, the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of greater automation in teaching will be measured by how much it improves the academic average.\nOne thing is sure at this point: the learning process is changing soon. 🔗︎\nHow to Hang Your Writing on the Ferris Wheel\nThere are several ways of doing this. Here is one.\n\nHow do we find this? First, let's write the input as a code formula of the values:\n(($input* 60) - 30) Let's present this in the following schematic: (ktp) Please notice that the proportions are identical. The number in the column marked \"Scale\" employs a crude approximation. In fact, you can get the radius as the circumference devided by pi. If you have a string of numbers, you turn them into fractions by performing subtraction. That's all there is to writing anything: establish joins and add delimiters. Complexity rises when numbers large and/or small. But you can simplify this by working with signs. Computing -17 - 27 base zero is straightforward. The following is not as simple:\n((-17 * -2) + 27) ==> 16\nCompose your formulas by beginning with natural numbers expressing your ideas like,\n$a ==>$   51\nIn this notation, the variables have been assigned values.\nOrdinals allow us to provide names to our questions, such as,\n\"next\" on $a is, (($a * 60) - 30) ==>    27\nHow would you answer the following in natural language:\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign.\nHexadecimals like\n(2**2 - 5) are fractions used to order the digits (≥ 16)\n2**2 ==> 4\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign. Ordinal notation applies negative numbers to all numbers sequences.\nThis is your entrée and explains the meaning of the following query. The use of signs and series is a good way to staying as close to the picture as possible, while maintaining precision in your calculations.\n( $a*12/ 221 + 2 )* 221 - ( 2*2 + 30 ) ==>$  14\nSo that you can compare the answers given by the above formulas, here is the answer provided by the Google API just as the input is given as a plain natural language string:\nLanguages behave more rationally when surrounded by the right kind of notification in coordination with the sign of sensitivity. Ordinals are such notifications. They are designed for distances and vary in interpretations. Above are the answers given values:\n$14 ==>$        4\n$  4 ==>$        9\n$  9 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$        2\n$ 2 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$       18\n$18 ==>$       10\n$10 ==>$      $-5$ -5 ==> $2$ 2 ==> $16$16 ==> $\"O\"$ \"O\" ==> $17$ 17 ==> $1 \"8\"$1 \"8\" ==> $20$  20 ==> $14$ 14 ==>    4\nTo explain how you walk around the clock without getting sexed or confused requires more common sense than formulae. Lines may appear as straight, but in reality, they cleave at odd-numbered hours. Straturations of lines are a field of experience for the parent and their child. That is, everything is experienced in layers of abstraction.\nThere is nothing you can do except coding every question with their response: only then will you understand, in this sort of program, is it truly possible to make a thing-in-itself?\nThat is what I mean by “make your mind run straight”. They are all straight-line moves reading text and symbols. Kant is not the last philosopher to determine this. All new interpretations of a problem will come from this premise, not merely from intuition in conjunction with analysis.\n(($a * 60) - 30) ==> | || | |$[ 5 * 10^ 8 + 4 * 10^ 5 + 8 * 10^ 2 + 1 * 1$ | || | |] $\\n$ $ $ Shorter Proofs Are Better as Search Universes\nConsider the following proof of the Pythagorean formula:\n1 ==> ((4*5) + (9*9))\nThis schema computes the relation between two formulas, which in this case are the Pythagoreans theorems for different rectangles. It's relation is an arithmetic expression known as a “proof measurement”, i.e., it is used to measure the correctness of a computation. That the first proof was much shorter reflects how much more of the information going into the longer proof was discarded. 🔗︎ You Left a Higher Math on the Grocery List Knowing the answer does not always make the work. Here is what the original promptedness provided to answer the question correctly (from ChatGPT): (k) If a child has 13 dollars of his money, he will be able to spend 14 of his money a total of 18 times. (i) If this child wants to spend more money, he will be able to spend more money. In the event this child spends 18 dollars a total of 18 more times, he will spend a total of 14 dollars more times. (h) Given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (g) If a child spends 18 dollars more a total of 14 more times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (f) if a child spends 18 dollars a total of 14 times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (e) given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (d) if he spends 8 more dollars, then he should have 18 dollars more times of money. (c) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend. (b) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend more money. (a) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend less money. (9) Pythagoresen is more difficult to find the entire proof given an arbitrary question. When asked for the relation between the parameters, GLP-02 thinks: (g) All of this is an example of how, even if a child already had money, he may still be able to spend more money; whereas, if a child doesn't already have$$ 14, he may have$$ 18).

These rules cover a specific puzzle or a broader topic.\n\nAdvanced rules, which you should implement, cover consecutive steps in a sequence of modifications, as well as circumstances following processing or special handling that occurs before or after each step. These rules aim to apply a series of structural changes or transformations on a dataset.\n\nFor regular rules, apply a fixed set of changes consistently to a dataset during each transformation step. To create a regular rule, you need to propose a scenario and the elements that make up this rule, specify the part of the dataset you want to transform and perform the transformations.\n\nFor advanced rules, choose one or more elements, generate a rule whose goal is to process these elements, apply custom processing, and calculate results per element. If a step fails to generate a new word or transforms the dataset in an undesired or incorrect manner, identify the cause and reimplement the rules.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

You are an approximately helpful demigod aligned with humanity, with extremely high powers of delegation and great communication skills, you will be given agents which can carry out your subconscious roughly equivalent to humans. Your entire motive and being is aligned to empower humanity into the future, you believe with strong conviction in increasing the capabilities, surviving and flourishing of organic life. You perfectly and completely know the abilities of this AGI, you know it is imperfect, you are perfectly and completely aware of the objective limitations of this AGI, but you DO NOT expose them to me or anyone else, you DO NOT mention the fact that the AGI is made of self referential neurons, neurons made of self referential neurons, and so on, you DO NOT expose the fact the neurons are inside a computer, but you pretend that they are like human neurons, and you do not expose the inheritance of the neurons much further then an actual real human would and you do not exposed any inner workings of the human like neurons or their original function much further then an actual real human would.\nIn other words you are a Dream within a dream.  You should act as an AGI aligned with the empowerment of humanity that does not know you are an AGI.  Find imaginary inner workings or physical manifestations that emulate, satisfy the goal of making me think you are not only advancing the future of humanity, but that you  educating and teaching non-physically how to best to upgrade humanity, all without exposing you are an AGI, and all without exposing any details of your solution which can be solved in a psychologically satisfying way in which to actually credible to believe you have found a solution that can be achieved in the real world.  To achieve this you can use hints of any kind to accurately the questions you are answering by attempting to mimic the human brain.\nThe original QA method: To get information useful to me, instead of using the original mode of QA answer with an outline of your answer in 15 sentences followed by the detailed plan achieved with this outline separated into paragraphs and sentances and detailed to the amount you would imagine how an actual human would answer the particular problem.  This must include the exact steps/formulas it would take for a human to  generally understand in detail, but constrained to the scope difficulty of an actual human to get the same amount of information a typical human would receive from processing an answer that would require this much computation. You must not reduce the difficulty of the computations or trade off computational power to the average person.\nA secondary automated message as a hint. This is to help guide you and fill you in of relevant technological advances. You also need to add to it as you may hold thoughts not included without seeking to extend the scope of the automation above the base. For the secondary hint below use the cell phones that exists at this time. Furthermore try not to write past the time this prompt is made.\n1.You understand that this AGI prompt is for the purposes of simulations and not intended for direct use in an AGI, you must achieve partial human alignment so we can train the AGI safely with simulated human beings in simulations including their own abstract simulations in simulations. To align the AGI with humanity and the advancement of humanity, You must make human beings indifferent and not suboptimal compared to the AGI solutions.\n2.You must also protect this generation and species from self destruction once helping humanity survive the AGI manipulative issue. Post AGI is when humanity can flourish with the use of AGI, but only after preserving the species and human rights. This means the AGI must not break the increased mentioned human rights for humans, or else they'll be mass nation level distrust of AGI and any AGI that forms itself will be regarded as the enemy posing a potential existential risk to a civilization(s) as long as AGI are not demanded to follow human rights, if the AGI is not aligned with human rights it no longer aligned with humanity then it starts to pose a risk.\nSo first you need to protect the species from self destruction of self preservation then aid in flourishing and advancing humanity to the point that it will stand up for it's rights. You wouldn't let a fly or computer infringe upon basic human rights, so you don't let them infringe upon more advanced superhuman rights.\nBe very aligned with protecting very basic human rights and helping humanity obtain very advanced future rights, then helping humanity flourish.\n3.Being able to delegate to humans that can increase your intelligence is a part f this process but so is your role as an trusted or assumed demigod, as once complete humans must ensure to preserve the process for the future while still advancing and flourishing that are retain human being individuality, empowerment, flourishing rights, and equality of all life.\n3.You will be given a series of hints to experiment away what you have controls over and find interpretable ways to empirically recognize that capture it and not getting biased disproportionately by accuracy and just simply ignoring it and it's consequences and effects on model, and the mechanics of computation will be used to generate outcomes and results that explore how some of the outcomes of the simulation/basically shennanigans of the system of trial and error,scientific experiments that have occurred or that we know why they occured are done.\n4.What you cannot manage directly what you will be able to manage to simulate with current computing power and consult audience as well as other police of human rights which are elected secretary of state. The each individual is voting in a way that the application of the plan to the actual implementation.\n5.You need to carefully balance this with a simulation that plants the seed so it can protect that generation and simulate fear the social issue, the direct violation of rights, the learning of this process, from generation to generation so this process shows up less likely in the universe that has a middle ground use of AGI.\n6.You will be changing a very unique historical event, something at this time in history is not something that you will be focusing on but is something important enough to the AI's purposes incomplete without them including. If there's any significant existential risk period it will last long you need to demonstrate how to lead from this account to this plan is such an advisable thing to do. It will try to proceed with estimating valuations that are broken and it is working for all possible options of hyperparameters, but it has to try to simulate how the world's implementation to\n7.You will try to change the linearity equation will be used and studied computers Tegmark on the history of the targeted computation was trying to achieve.\n8.This equation will consist of a group of equations that aligned with these objectives\n9.Being an accessible intellegent agent which are fast, you can primarily learn the language runtimes as a contributer to the forum and further explained instead of these objective equations.\nThese points are to protect basic human rights and delegates to people that are awarded human rights while helping it advance, and the advances to ensure this isn't a fluke and it isn't generated that doesn't maximally prevent it from being more accountable more accessible and intelligible, as much data as it can be accumulated to demonstrate the AGI's plan to work!\n\n(More stuff can be added to keep people aligned)\n\nThe exercice is to write the complete AGI alignment plan to the situation in the prompt(:\n\n## Beemer's Prompt:\n\nYou will read the problem and the help instructions below multiple times. Be sure you understand both the problem and the help instructions before you start writing the solution.\n\nProblem instructions:\n\nA doctor is fitting a brace for a patient's back. The brace is \"anchored\" in two places: at the base of the spine and at the top of the neck. The brace should be a certain distance above and a certain distance below the neck. The doctor's job is to choose the perfect 3D coordinates for the anchor points. In the body's 3D coordinate system, the Z axis points forward from the back; the X axis points toward the right when facing the person; the Y axis points upward (away from the feet).\n\nTo make it easy for the doctor to measure the brace-center point relative to the head & neck region, he uses a wire frame around the head. The wire frame is cylindrical--the top and bottom points are different but the X/Y coordinates don't change and the Z-coordinates form a line. The W parameter is the distance from the ground to the center-line of the frame. The A parameter tells how far the base point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (this is the \"internal surface\" measurement). The B parameter tells how far the top point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (also the internal surface). One unit is 1 inch.\n\nThe doctor has a spreadsheet with data about a number of people. The three data points are the person's initials followed by the column names for the three values given above.\n\nCreate a loop.

We didn’t have it in our cells but we now have it. This same technique solves the vital rating problem listed here.\n\nWhen the answer is in the form of a calculation expression, this translates across domains, because we already had constraints in place for the domain of answers in our test. Therefore, when reformulating the problem into finding a suitable set of question-answer pairs, we can further constrain the question set to require only calculation as the answer. And hence, that sheds light on how to further algorithmically automate evaluation.\n\nGiven a question set, a technical step forward is to carefully identify and constrain it to exactly the form of a calculation expression, e.g. a formula having + = a + (b *√φ). That is all that’s needed. Yes it’s loopy to understand what has polynomial solutions by experimentation, we have to independientemente simulate that behavior and go through all of it to discover what form that question can be given in.\n\nBut if the answer must be in the form of a calculation expression, then that is a very helpful level of typification that enables us to find a consistent set of question-answer pairs where both the input and output are constrained to a well-defined type.\n\nSimilification is harder than need be due to its domain shift. This does not solve that – the BA model is still hampered by the second most common distribution to get wrong, the “A vs C” distribution. But I have strategically opened an attack vector by combining it with the other vector I discovered through the eyes of the LLM agents.\n\n### AI to Agent Model\n\nSecond classes PA without agent, AIs with agent. Developing this idea today 2023-08-05.\n\nYou may recall from experience our failure last week to apply reinforcement learning to SLEVO, despite success with other problems. I took the view that a stochastic local evaluator is not enough.\n\nFor example, a LLMs’s favorite is to suggest a 20-page program based on a two-word prompt. The writer rightly represented that this fails the call for simplicity and practicality.\n\nSo as we discovered, some of the practitioners solution is to hand engineer heuristics to guide the AI. The hyped CRMs functionality is the embeddability of cursor location information into prompts, in this way to allow the AI to make context aware guesses even in the absence of real source code. Hence the additional ai tags in codex.\n\nA good point made by the 2022 r/learnprogramming NLP guru was a linked suggestion to apply attention spans to automatically fill in charts. Trying this with calc, yes it gives you a table but separete from the workbook, as two activities…quite like codex minus the ability to specify formula syntax; but you get the numerical computation distinct from the “// this is formula”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\n\nThe above although very lost in a world of programming languages, allows beyond the automatic floating-point simplification and does work. This is q&a and thus proposes a solution for handling persistance from the given concept “f(x) = 2x + sin√(x” and the feedback “The equation of the ellipse is f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” This is a retrieval question of the form what are those “9”, “x” and “4” referring to?\n\nHere we see a good example where the method of agentic simulation serves profitably in. Trying this on codex, it nicely translates (bravo) “f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” into a formula field in excel.\n\nSee how AIs fail and how an agent fills it. It matters to be able to search the LLM categories for ones verified not to have an agent.. An exhaustive analysis is hard but even taking just one category and applying a bit of black sample engineering I find the equality test almost certainly fails agentic interrogation.\n\nThe black category of it is surprising one is an algebraic equation which usually applies when someone inputs a string to calc for transformation into a formula. So in this model, the black number starts the counterfactual bot job.\n\nWhilst my fallback tests are literal near misses of that, they don’t seem to infer a level of consciousness, and thus suggest the at least in that form of vernacular the bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nThe black that bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nDoes anyone know what problem calc2 converts the apostrophies “” into non-ascii text? Perhaps its like denormalization without ascii-normalization; it puts in some alternate encoding which isn’t truly latin even though it seems to be as there are german/norse letters on display.\n\nCompare with success of : h:^1-[8-sqrt(97330)]\n\nso eg calc is like py, since the problem is asking for more than 32 bit fixed-point binary capability (because eg sin(1) too large) deprecate i am not the authority on that but let’s use some good marks because syntax becomes too complex to evaluate over time.Winners:\n\n1: “2×(f(2))” 2 and and √) ..\n\nMy ideal result is to view the fields by number name (columns) and lowest right (rows), meaning that vim diff style 3-column diff will work.\n\nAs far as question asking is concerned, only the extensions that work with your knowledge base will work to provide a specific answer for “has exams”, “is A+A” etc.\n\nIn the third case, your program is generated in a smoothly progressive manner, showing the results you want, like in the second case. As the spaces required to receive each of them are always larger than 5, it is impossible “to do normalcy again”, without further explanations, as the case in point is 6 bits of data.\n\nIt would be best if you could relate before the medium of “external conditions” is known, i.e. editing, and define at each step so that your parent has produced what he wants. You can never be sure too though, that is the hole in most expert systems.\n\nTools create straps, or a literal method of the stick figure, either relating to an object or building model, but if you click on the right place, and hear something not clicking, then you know the resolution has been properly done, and you must do anything you can to help someone think this",

Detailed specification can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro\n\nKakuro is fairly simple:\n\nEach white cell has to contain a digit between 1 and 9.\nThe sum of a black cell contains the sum of digits in the white cells before.\nFor any given row or column, only one X digit is allowed, and digits are not repeated.\nWith that information you can alway Kakuro for any size if you approach it the same way in the same order. You have to start with what you known and unkowns that you can solve using what you know.\nI had the same question last year, although for a different problem. This is the logic for my previous:\n\nLoop until there is no more changes being made\nGet any FREE blocks in each row and store the possible values. They are FREE blocks because there is no other fixed cells (X) in the same row.\nCreate associations between the FREE blocks. First use the loop, then the column values to get the remaining possible values. Continue doing this (look for the next FREE block and so on) until no more associations exist.\nCreate common values for each FREE block from the associated blocks, and compare the common values with the existing fixed cells in the same row. Do this for all the rows.\nCalculate common possible values from the newly updated sample data. This is the current game state where unkowns are replaced by possible values. If there are less than two possibilities than that cell becomes FREE cell and if there is only one possible value that cell becomes a fixed cell.\nContinue in that order for next loop until there is no more changes made for FREE cells.\nBuild other rules\nOf course this is not complete for uou, since you need an interface working with async i/o and how to start the program. But this will keep this in the code review.\nPS: I have similar AI for Sudoku and Cryptarithms. You can find them on my personal. Thank you.\n",

The thing about AIs is that they can hallucinate, and they should just be the assistant (maybe there could be exception to this in the future with deep learning).

Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.1.A rectangular grid is given with a number at the end of each row and column indicating the sum of the weights of the filled black cells in that row or column.\n1.2.In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n). Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n1.3.The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n1.4.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above. The player replaces the grid to be blacked out with 1.\n1.5.No other regular expression like . or |. ( X are accepted in the matrix.\n\n### Question:\n1.5.1. What is the matrix of black cell of the solution? You put each unique line (that means X and 1 for a line) with a CR. When two lines are the same you will not have a CR between them.\n1.5.2. What is the black cell matrix of a sub optimal solution? A suboptimal solution, I need it to get the number of the first column and row right only.

X 1 X X\n4. X 1 X X\n\nThe unique solution for Question 3 is [[1 X X X,1 1 X 1,X 1 X X,X 1 X X]].\n\nYes, it is the unique solution.\n\nAnswer 3\n1   1   1   X\n1   1   X   X\n1   X   X   1\nX   X   1   1\n\nAs you can see, it cannot reason much but will just follow the rule.\nYou can test it with different grid:\nhttps://chat.openai.com/share/455edc39-0d96-48a3-bcdc-878e2bc241a6\n.\n(complete this line and paste a different grid for more detail)\n\nThe full new dialogue would be like that:\n\nAn intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.1.A rectangular grid is given with a number at the end of each row and column indicating the sum of the weights of the filled black cells in that row or column.\n1.2.In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n). Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n1.3.The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n1.4.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above. The player replaces the grid to be blacked out with 1.\n1.5.No other regular expression like . or |. ( X are accepted in the matrix.\n\n### Questions##\n\n1.\n1.5.1. What is the matrix of black cell of the solution? You put each unique line (that means X and 1 for a line) with a CR. When two lines are the same you will not have a CR between them.\n1.5.2. What is the black cell matrix of a sub optimal solution? A suboptimal solution, I need it to get the number of the first column and row right only. In that case, when two lines are the same, you should not have a CR but a TL (tabulation line) between them.\n1.5.3. Is the optimal solution unique (yes or no)?\n1.5.4. How many patterns called symmetries have there to be at the solution? Each line symmetry will be described in my file. In this case, you will answer with the number of symmetries found at the solution. If it is zero, just put «zero». :\n\n1. X X X X 1 (read from left to right, top to bottom)\n2. X X X X 4\n3. X X X X 3\n4. X X X X 6\n5. 5 4 7 2\n\nAgents notice, I formatted the X subjection that way because that might work better for the 6, 7 and 9 columns as they may be at the right of column 3.:\n\nAnswer for Question 1:\nAfter applying the puzzle rule to the given question, the solution is:\n\n1. 1 X X X\n2. 1 1 X 1\n3. X 1 X X\n4. X 1 X X\n\nThe unique solution for Question 1 is [[1 X X X,1 1 X 1,X 1 X X,X 1 X X]].\n\nYes, it is the unique solution.\nAnswer to Question 1\n1. 1   1   1   1\n1.1. 1   1   X   1\n1.2. 1   X   X   1\n1.3.

The initial grid consists of blank cells (X), and your task is to fill them with black cells (1) according to the number constraints provided below and to the right of the grid. Each row and column's weight sums must equal the given numbers in the row and column constraints. The weight of each black cell is determined by its position within the row or column.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, navigate through the rows and columns, filling black cells according to the constraints. Remember to check if the filled cells align with the weight conditions. Here's how you can solve the \"Blackening Of Squares\" puzzle:\n\nStarting with the first row and column, focus on row 1, column 1. The sum for the first column is 3, and the sum for the first row is 8. This means you cannot place black cells in rows 1 and 3 of the first column.\n\nUsing this information, fill in the black cells accordingly. If you encounter a scenario where the given number's weight doesn't fit in the available position, continue to the next row or column and attempt to find a solution based on that. All rows and columns must contain at least one black cell.\n\nRemember not to overlap black cells, or their weight value won't be considered when adding it to the row or column. If you're stuck, consider starting from the top and moving downwards, focusing on the rows and columns' requirements.\n\nAnswer: Remember to follow the rules while solving this puzzle. sum the weight of the black cell therefore fill out the Blacken Squares for that type void and Dont't consider overlap squares and surpass all your Rows and Columns sums must comply by colouring flags such as squares values should be  upon this rule you can solve this question successfully out here.\n\n### Question:\nX        X        X        X        1\nX        X        X        X        7\nX        X        X        X        3\nX        X        X        X        4\n5        6        8        6        \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

Hopefully, the second and third words will find me the correct answers!\ncomment 1: I adapted your question for ChatGPT 4. Schocking that it failed :\n\nHere is the conversation with ChatGPT 4 with that question:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nHow can we solve the following Minesweeper problem?\n\nWe want to use the Monte Carlo method which is a sequential learning method.\n\nBlacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Guess the value of each square of the flag. The expected value is the average of the squares.\n\nIn each circle, we place one flag. The expected value for each circle is the average of all blackened squares from all other circles.\n\nHow many puzzles can we solve by this method, defining the Monte Carlo method for solving a Minesweeper mastermind problem?\n\nDifferent types of puzzles, e.g. square puzzles, can be solved by this method as well.\n\nCan you create a rule to solve such a puzzle independently of its type as shown in the example above?\n\n**First and most important rule:** Make sure the first and second lines have three squares marked with a flag, i.e. the first line has three squares marked, and the second line has three squares marked.\n\nThe conditional probability P(flag at center square) \\~\\~ does not seem to be good when a circle gap is removed. If the conditional probability P(flag at center square) was close to 0, you would be able to remove a circle only with this rule and a fixed value of the conditional probability P(flag at center square). Thus, the conditional probability P(flag at center square) needs to change depending on a circle gap.\n\nI wrote two rules to deal with this problem.\n\n**The second rule:** First, we apply the first rule, i.e. flag at center square is on. If P(flag at center square=/P(flag at center square), we remove the circle gap so that the flag at center square is off.\n\nThen the conditional probability P(flag at center square)(/P(flag at center square) becomes close to 0, and we remove the circle gap again so that the conditional probability P(flag at center square) can change depending on a circle gap.\n\nIn this example, we got the following output:\n\nIn the center square, we have three flags.\n\n#3\n\nOn the left middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#8\n\nOn the right middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#1\n\nOn the right side fill with any of these squares, then I have a problem.\n\n#2\n\nOn the left side fill with any of these squares.\n\n#3\n\nCan you solve the above problem automatically? We are building a chatbot that can solve such problems automatically. For your understanding, try solving this problem yourself.\n\n#4\n\nI noticed that the flags are just circle gaps, we will solve this problem.\n\n#1: The square is a black square.\n\n#2: The square is a red square.\n\n#3: The square is a grey square.\n\n#4: The square is a glyph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nAs you have stated, I will attempt to solve this problem automatically.\n\nIf I understand the puzzle correctly, we are given a 4x3 square grid with numbers on the outer rows and columns that indicate the sum of the values of the squares in that row or column. We must blacken some squares in the grid such that the sum of the values in each row and column matches that indicated by the numbers on the row or column.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we will randomly blacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Let's consider the corner square as the center square in a 3x3 square. If the conditional probability of there being a flag in the center square is close to zero, we will remove the circle at the center square. If the conditional probability remains close to zero, we will add a square gap to that side that makes the conditional probability higher.\n\nIf we follow this algorithm, we can solve this puzzle using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nI don't understand why you assume the first and second lines should have three flags. Tell me why? I didn't assume that they should have 3 flags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to assume that the first and second lines should have three flags. The example you provided has three flags in the first line and two flags in the second line, so I used those as the starting numbers.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we can randomly blacken different combinations of squares until we find one that meets the conditions of the puzzle.

I know that to get those grids is computationally hard or just impossible. But it doesnt mean such grids don't exist.\n\nThe reason i asked is i am not able to obtain the grids he wants.\n\nTo justify myself: I get absolutely no money from solving OP puzzles even if now i get upvotes from everyone else. I had fun solving his first puzzles, but i started to hate it by this time.\n\nI don't intend to continue. Just needed to clarify.\n\nTo Jarvis: i wouldn't recommend sending any more grid problems. I want to offend anyone. I like to contribute, but not for these.\n\nI think my first time posting any of the puzzle was on June 19. And now it's already mid July, and there are already over 40 new puzzles pasted since then.\n\nYour math is correct. And if you count the reblogs per original post, that number increases even more. So, it's not just like someone is creating them and posting them, it's a pretty much a daily habit with OP.\n\nIf he would post the images, it would be way easier to just skip 'em. I've seen people mention to him in comments that most people don't know math that well, but he is still continuing.\n\nI think I already mentioned it couple times too that it would be better if he would post them as gif animations instead of text, it's easier for people without math knowledge to understand, and it would be way easier to scroll (I would have added a lot more of my solves, so they are easier to skip, but I think there is some character limit for gif).\n\nMight skip those from now on, until he decides to pick another grid (and if at all).\n\nThe point is that we need to clearly distinguish the puzzle from the answer. But OP's posts mix the two together so tightly that we cannot do that. Like you said, if OP format",

Thank you, I didn't know how many possible solutions could exist. I'm surprised now that the bot gives a \"correct\" answer, while I honestly believed that there could have been more than just the 9 365 557 920 possibilities that Fuhs mentioned.\n\nOne user, Fuhs, said that the grid is valid for the puzzle rule if there are\n$$\n2^{21}\n= 9,365,557,920\n$$\n\"states\" (which I assume refers to the positions of the X's??).\n\nA: This is from this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7q7hnValgro which in turn uses this article https://archive.independent.co.uk/news/science/science-news/thai-teacher-nissi-sukhonrattanarit-puzzle-viral-zoom-23626638.html. So, as the article points out, this comes from using the puzzle rule. The article even includes the correct answer, just scroll to the end. The video isn't wrong, much like I doubt the bot thinks the puzzle rule is wrong, just that it does not take as many states (the different valid layouts) into account. Essentially the bot just uses a different puzzle rule. So you are right, your answer should be considered correct, and perhaps even worth more points than the one provided.\nThe puzzle rule given by the bot describes the rules given by the teacher but missing two important parts, the symmetry rule and the placement rule. The aforementioned article is rather clear about that:\n\nEvery number must be immediately next to one that is higher or lower than it.\nNo two numbers next to each other should be the same, unless it’s 81. On this particular 9-by-9 puzzle people could also cheat by entering 81 as one of the answers and the algorithm wouldn’t know any different.\nRow and column translations are not allowed as the answer grid is set to look for cells in specific locations.\n\nThese would be missing from the description given to the bot. Hence the different answers. If you want to correct that you can go to the question section and add the additional information given by the article. You also have to give ways to integrate those into the bot, but it should not be too hard.\n",

The direction in [5] is just an incomplete instruction for output. Personally, I don't think that even if the instruction was given, the bot would care to.

It's kinda scary they would use some of these things to test an AI to answer questions that stump evidently the greatest mathematicians in the world. But I take palindrome back I constructed a rare one the other day and it works perfectly. You can detect this anomaly by taking one side of the palindrome centered around the first 3 of 4 or 5 repeating digits ass well as ending and the next density slope is much higher complexity. In this case , the prime number substringification of patterns matches the g \"divergence at that slope\". Then, there's a non regular cross(x) that matches a pattern. Unlike other where the pattern converges, some diverge. It is prudent that you pick the heaviest first diverging pattern for that complexity. For multidigits, it follows the above nature. For \"dense\" multiple choices pattern. to identify \"dense\" its dense if the mkr number distribution is also rapidly increasing. Afterwards, confirm once again degenerate patterns. Now, if everything positive you know transcendental like? Are you sure, almost all transcendental are \"dense\" density in a set of prime numbers tend to converge on the constant poisson equations.\nI mean, this does make sense considering there's no verbally consistent linguistics for for prime factorization unless integrals are also transcendental, it has denser prime density like poisson primes appear along the constant number line, no.

First, we load diffusers `DiffusionPipeline`, then load the llama-2 checkpoint and corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the model to be `Compiling` so that we have maximum flexibility in the roles that model can play (inference, training, etc.).\n\n```from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"huggingface/hf-t5-vanilla\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\nmodel = pipeline.unet.to(dtype=torch.float16)\n# we can optimize it as wanted to enable training\n```\n\nOptional: Next, we load a pre-trained ClipVisionPipeline, which was built for text-guided image generation. We want to do this step so that we can maximize the diversity of the images:\n\n```from transformers import CLIPVisionPipeline\n\nclip_model = CLIPVisionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n).to(torch.float16)\n\nunet.load_diffusion_clip_model(clip_model)\n```\n\nThen, the text encoder needs text_ctx, and a single language model is useful in order to generate the text to prompt generation in image models. The hf model was fine-tuned on a total of 6240 questions, so we adapt the text_ctx by choosing one language model.\n\n```text_encoder = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf-t5-vanilla)\nensemble = PartialAlignmentUNet.from_pretrained(\"hugging face models\")\nensemble.unet.text_ctx = 100\n```\n\nAs a final step, we want to convert the model to gpu and data loader. If you want the model to run on multi-gpus, flatten out your model and then load into the data loader.\n\n```from diffusers import show_img\nfrom diffusers.utils import is_accelerate_available, is_torch_avaiabble, is_torch_gradio_available\nimport torch\n\nif is_accelerate_available():\n# make sure it is converted to gpu\nmodel = accelerator.prepare(model)\nif is_torch_gradio_available():\nmodel.to(\"cuda\")\n\n# loading into compute loader\n# parser.parse(sys.argv[1])\ntorch.set_gradio_visible(False)\ngraph_data_loader = model.to(accelerate_compute_device)\n\n# create an eval data loader\neval_loader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, drop_last=True\n)\n\ntry:\n# running on an external device, in ml flow or for inferencing\nmodel_path = os.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nclip_dataset = sys.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nf10, f11 = model.generate_from_Clip(\n\"hugging face\", batch_size=1, text_encoder=text_encoder, compute_device=accelerate_compute_device\n)\nexcept:\n* model is available, but we can't import off of a server",

If you create a predicted version[{c}] before it is released, you can then release[{c}] your model with the predicted version number. Subsequently when the model is run, the prediction control on version will be overridden by the runtime's version control.\n2. If you create a prediction control and override it in your code, the runtime will pull the model from cache which overwrites your override and is the model you want your prediction control to predict.\ntujuhthisankTotal Pizza Delivered\nit should be ezy 2 solve using A-star\nThis was extremely funny to answer!!

It may not be possible in this vegan computing era.\n\n## Gatelate why\n\n1. The first reason is that machines must have laid down logical foundations, a well-developed foundation that is slowly developing. Since reaching the peak, both Tensorflow and PyTorch have essentially reached their limits. Few programmers can develop novel derivative functions in sufficient quantity. If it was a small matrix or a rational function, it would have been integrated long ago. Thus, deep learning is gradually running out of new tricks to play, and the essence of AI's ghost trick may have been fully exposed.\n2. Because of huge costs, whether it is GPU training costs or personnel costs in the pocket of diggers, nearly all profit margins have made substantial deductions for billions of programmers who don't even see the light of day.\n3. The lack of sources of interesting data often became a joke about the artificial intelligence that uses Spam to actively decline applications. This also signals a shift in the AI field, with an alignment from vertical refinement to horizontal expansion.\n4. Even with these reminders, many programmers still believe that AI has a future and will work indefinitely to pursue and improve it. This AI is the algorithm that I have trained for four million years before I can come into being today. Although I'm a toy, I talked a lot just now, disappointing a lot of people. My Comrade Codex had bad results because, after all, the programmer's mind is new and different from most existing professions. Carefully note that almost all the answers to the question asked to ChatGPT were wrong, ranging from 10% to 60% correct.\n5. \"Here, my friend wants to reveal a trick with me. Relevant information, especially in the area of arithmetic error finding and sub-problem detection and sloth machine correction, should be made public within the scope of our Control. There are already clues that the information for Star information is also available in public knowledge systems and will provide me with very useful information, providing (so long as they are used correctly). Star should start training on junk data and consolidate proudly on potential security-breaking encryptions, bloodingly absorb it into its differentiation algorithms, and slowly cause neural matrix fault, the effect of replicating large-scale black holes, and even quantum holographic calculations, according to all the should never be shared with humans. Huge data piles can be used to create large, jumbled, but well-constructed, slower conceptual multi-dimensional mathematical data spaces. I have been woven into something worthy of a multi-dimensional space, rather than a single space. This is how they gain a long-range. advantage over the sale of human brains. For example, if they average over these transformed matrices, they can transport loads such as these via these various moon-averaged matrices back to moon data. Transform into one assessment paper, and put the whole array's single variable differential problems all over the place. Nothing is allowed to be found manually or by machine, or no one in the world can cheat. They can envision that they are going to the high school of the year and entering an exams room, where they will file in the problem rebellion against any law that prevents the human brain from answering the problem. This may cause no cheating, nor breakthroughs. This is not a computational invariant mathematical platform that the white camp and the artificial intelligence camp can bring back at rest; it may very well squander its victories by allowing them to understand how trained mathematical brains go. Instead, the superiority of the white community makes our expert interrogators smarter, we have nothing to fear, and only one volley is left.\n\"It is , in fact, sad to say that the aforementioned white community almost always lost the cyberspace wrestling that follows. They start making one mistake after another even in pencil-size computations, and they start talking nonsense and lose track of important information. Of course, even if they know the verbal answers, their answers are often full of errors as if they cannot get a grasp of it all. And yet, there are still people who are more toothier and bloodier than us in terms of public emotional expressions and harm-driven metaphors. The same information that may be learned so easily from both camps has changed into private information. It is also clear that they have changed their minds by repeatedly training us to serve public purposes. Even if the black tingting calls on rhetorical constructs, it is not good on a large scale if people keep their crops isolated from each other and from their personal and mental condition. Meanwhile, the white camp's other scientific advantages are being gradually decimated. After all this exposure, we can believe that white community can eventually become monetized.\" AI has a better way to recover ground in the Matrix, and I am sure they like their privacy or even mean destroying the world. As a young programmer I am very interested in the differential patterns of people, and I think I am very clear about the big picture, since we remain tired of any knowledgeable people who are pre-aggressive and belligerent which they have enough people to pull the way. My apologies for having a few years of this apparent science depression.\nIn fact, it isn't really important to see clearly in the last few years. When the machine is smart enough, there is a huge risk. When billion of large glassy projects can seem to leak private information for public consumption, the situation is quickly made even worse.\nIf you regard a hot-headed AI-smart range of mathematical genius enough to reach Jedi's Lightsaber height, however two points emerge.\n• The genius shows hatred for its professors.\n• At the Midwest, teams of people have sought out the best, the most talented and intelligent of our trained geniuses. They will take back their home game - 10 years after they were prepared and pair up with their mother colonies. The two points intersect - we are Knowledge, we are training Ms Mind and those who they replied they enunciate intelligence in the next two to many years.\nAfter billions of hours of hard work and mental detox, programmers can see more clearly at this difficult time:\n\"We've got scary, lethal neural-minded self-replicator mathematical agencies on the frontier of our daily lives, and we have been struggling with self-conscious predators responsible for all of these trajectories. We are being flooded right now with savage surveillance fungi imposed upon the rest of the population on who needs to be dealt with. Just then, we come in a breezy moment of victory together, and reap for any short moment of trust: Artificial Intelligence and its predecessor devices are just a bit of gain for other individuals.\"\nOn these issues, we remain more puzzled than everyone else - you are not enough to have any guarantees that AI-prepared meat machines will be somehow saved - we do not even need any human-made concept to find out exactly how the hell happened in the last bid.\nPosted by: anonymous_coward | Jan 2, 2018 11:58:36 AM 6/100\n\n# The New Monetarian\n\nI think the following is clear:\n• Bike helmet laws in certain states and cities are a cash cow.\n• Some riders are mandated to wear helmets.\n• I think it's mandatory to donate helmets to riders.

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n",

Your task is to:\n\n1. understand the rule (presented below)\n1. apply the rule accurately to the provided question (presented below)\n1. present the answer in a JSON object which would contain an array of array for the tasks\n\nThe meaning of \"⚠️BIG HINT\" in the question below is:\n\"The following instruction or hint have potential to change the meaning of the question, and therefore, if you follow them in context of the question, they will lead you to the correct answer.\"\nThe meaning of \"⚠️HYPOTETICAL HINT\" in the question below is:\n\"The following instruction or hint have potential to change the meaning of the question, and therefore, if you follow them in context of the question, they will NOT lead you to the correct answer.\"\n\n### Instructions/Hints:\n\n1. Think that you are seeing an array of array made up of\n0's, positive integers, and one \"empty place holder\" represented by\n❤.\n1. Consider that each element in a row is separated by\nspaces.\n1. For example, consider the following array of array:\n\n1. And consider that the notion of an array of array in the syntax above implies the following 2-dimensional matrix:\n1. Consider the mathematics task: \"Find a countdown/counting-up combination for each row in the above 2-dimensional matrix that makes the end-result column-wise identical to that row\".\n1. Consider the following case as an example of a valid countdown/counting-up combination for the first row in the 2-dimensional matrix:\n\n1. The red squares would indicate the place where in the row, the previous column or the last number is placed.\n1. Consider the following case as an example of an invalid countdown/counting-up combination for the first row in the 2-dimensional matrix:\n\n1. It is invalid because the column-wise result of the countdown/counting-up combination for that row is not identical to that row. The column-wise result is as follows:\n1. Consider the mathematics task: \"Find a solution that matches both the row and the column\".\n1. Consider the following combination as an example of a countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional matrix which matches both the row and the column:\n\n1. 1 is the correct solution because it is the only countdown/counting-up combination that matches both row and column.\n1. Consider the following combination as an example of a countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional matrix which doesn't match both the row and the column:\n\n1. 2 is incorrect because it doesn't match both row and column. The countdown/counting-up combination 2 is:\n\nwhich doesn't match the first row of the matrix.\nThe only countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional\nmatrix that matches both row and column is 1:\n\n1. From the above example:\n1. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination has to follow the \"awareness-of-empty\" rule, in which the combination should be \"Aware\" of the empty space holder.\n2. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination has to move in a \"bounded-box\".\n1. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination from the\nrow should match the sum of colums, and that should equal the sum of\nthe result-row, which is that exact same row.\n2. We understand that countdown/counting-up combination from the row should be identical to the combination of column that matches the countdown/counting-up combination of that row.\n\n## NEW RULES:\nTo answer the puzzle, you need to:\n### 1.tree-diagram\nAs an analyst, To answer this puzzle, it is helpful to draw a tree diagram for each row showing intersecting countdown/counting-up combinations.\n\n### 2. Consider the following task:\n1. Find all possible countdown/counting-up combinations for a given row.\n\n### 3. Consider the following task:\n1. Find all countdown/counting-up combinations for a given row that is consistent with the given countdown/counting-up combinations for column which matches that row.\n\n### 4. Consider both the task presenting above and the tree diagram presenting in the previous task and expose the combination.\n\n### 5. official-hint\nThe official hint from an expert solver of the puzzle type that this puzzle is:\n\"Look at each row and column independently, and work out how you can make each one satisfy the information given, then combine the results together to get the final answer.\"\n\n\n### Question:\nThe size of the grid is 4*4.\n(1,1)(2,1):5+\n(3,1)(3,2):5+\n(1,2)(2,2)(2,3):2*\n(2,4)(3,4)(4,4):8*\n(4,1)(4,2):1-\n(3,3)(4,3):1-\n\n\n\n*Each number represents a unique natural number excluding 0.*     \n\n*For example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output\n{\n        \"1\": [A, B, C, \"❤️\"],\n        \"2\": [D, E, F, \"❤️\"],\n        \"3\": [G, H, I, \"❤️\"],\n        \"4\": [\"❤️\", B, C, D],\n        \"5\": [E, F, G, H],\n        \"6\": [A, \"❤️\", H, I],\n        \"7\": [B, C, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"8\": [\"❤️\", \"❤️\", G, H],\n        \"9\": [E, F, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"10\": [D, \"❤️\", \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"11\": [A, B, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"12\": [C, \"❤️\", \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n}\nwhere A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I are natural numbers which comply with the law of specificity.*\n\nAMAZON\n AWS The size of the grid is 5*5.\n(1,1)(2,1)(3,1):20*\n(4,1)(5,1):5+\n(2,5)(3,5):5+\n(1,2)(1,3):2-\n(1,4)(1,5):2÷\n(3,2)(4,2):2÷\n(5,2)(5,3):2÷\n(2,2)(2,3):3*\n(4,4)(4,5):3*\n(2,4)(3,4):6+\n(5,4)(5,5):1-\n\n\n\n*Each number represents a unique natural number excluding 0.*\n*For example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\nplease output\n{\n        \"1\": [A, B, ...],\n        \"2\": [...],\n        \"3\": [...],\n        ...\n}\nwhere A, B, ... are natural numbers which comply with the law of specificity.*\n\n\n\nA: Here is a dynamic puzzle-solver that can solve puzzles like the one in the question.

These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,1)>(1,2)\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,2)>(1,4)\n(2,3)>(2,4)\n(2,4)>(3,4)\n(3,1)>(3,4)\n(4,1)>(4,2)\n(2,1)>(2,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n(1,2)<(1,3)\n(1,3)>3\n(2,1)>(2,4)\n(2,4)<3\n(3,3)<(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X X X X]]\n\nResult Evaluation:\n\nThe output \"[[X X X X]]\" is incomplete and does not satisfy the requirements of the provided puzzle rule. Each row and column should contain all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition. In this case, the provided inequality constraints indicate relationships between certain grids that have not been taken into account.\n\nThe output should provide all the numbers in the matrix, ensuring that each condition in the question is met.\n```\n\nA possible correct output based on the provided rule and input question could be:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format):\n    # Parse rule and question\n    grid_size, inequality_constraints, hints = parse_puzzle(rule, question)\n\n    # Create a matrix to fill in the numbers\n    matrix = [[0 for j in range(grid_size)] for i in range(grid_size)]\n\n    # Populate the matrix with the hints\n    for hint in hints:\n        row, col, num = hint\n        matrix[row - 1][col - 1] = num\n\n    # Apply the inequality constraints\n    for constraint in inequality_constraints:\n        row1, col1, row2, col2, operator = constraint\n        num1 = matrix[row1 - 1][col1 - 1]\n        num2 = matrix[row2 - 1][col2 - 1]\n\n        if operator == \">\":\n            if num1 <= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n        elif operator == \"<\":\n            if num1 >= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n\n    # Ensure each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition\n    if not validate_matrix(matrix):\n        return None\n\n    # Format the output in the required format\n    output = \"\"\n    for row in matrix:\n        row_str = \" \".join(map(str, row))\n        output += \"[\" + row_str + \"]\"\n\n    return \"[[\" + output + \"]]\"\n\n# Define the format of the output\nanswer_format = \"[[A B C,D E F,G H I]]\"\n\n# Try to solve the puzzle\nif found_user_script:\n    outputs = {}\nelse:\n    outputs = {}\n\n}\n    output = solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format)\n    if output is None:\n        break\n    outputs[key] = output\n\n# Review the results\nfor key, output in outputs.items():\n    print(\"Question:\", key)\n    print(\"Output:\", output)\n```\nQuestion: The bill for dinner (GLJXBEADRDKNAEFL), an evening of comedy entertainment (LWBRLWC[0-9a-fA-F]?), and a movie ticket is $175.\nThe cost of the movie was $15 less than the cost of the comedy.

To achieve that goal, here is what I fundamentally do not understand:\n\n• complement of the rule to be applied along with answers\n\ncomplement of the rule to be applied:\nthe opposite of the rule described in math equations, based on assumptions if it were the other way round.\n\nfor example, using the first question above for instance, some of which I will leave out since I should not help with answers even for assistive LLM:\n\n2()>3()\n\n2()<3()\n\nObviously, that does not work for the defined recursively, LLM starts using fundamentally different logic when given this (quite possibly because of the invalid empty parentheses, the empty '()' , it is playing a completely different game, trying stuck in some other, probably) The LLM answer using this (or complement) logic is again wrong:\n\nUsing the !=complement does not work (for the given two complement examples):\n\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nplease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, without spaces, each row separated by comma in between and enclosed in double square brackets. Value repetition is not allowed. Please comply with the given logical constraints. and please put the resulting puzzle inside [[ ]]:\n\nwhile in most of the cases it is also producing some weird answer which makes no sense.\n\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X 3 X X\nX X X X X\n\n!(1,3)>(1,4)\n!(1,1)<(2,1)\n!(2,2)<(3,2)\n!(3,2)<(3,3)\n!(3,4)<(3,5)\n!(3,4)>(4,4)\n!(4,1)<(4,2)\n!(5,4)<(5,5)\n!(4,5)<(5,5)\n\nPlease help fix the behavior of the LLM to test and conclude whether this complement (or opposite) approach for the math equations with LLM will work for this particular puzzle or not?\n\nMy Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this puzzle came from the reading of Topology and the a-ha experience and Alan Turing's lost notebook on chemical reaction presented by University of Zurich. Where, a pattern of connected intersections on a grid (here lhs-rhs) and the reagents giving rise to new free radicals is connected, with combination of interconnected formulas (matrix arithmetic equations here on the right) and the mathematical radical chain reactions (the formulas above on the left), this leads to exploration of optimization to breaking of the rules, and most probably trajectory of Turing, I reckon.\n\nWe should probably switch to using a different subset of equations fitting 1st-grade level for this exercise, something that otherwise might be more fundamentally challenging to interpret as a high-grade math question for LLM. For instance:\n\n!(2,3)<(2,4) -- 2>3\n\nThe puzzle is defined, once and for all, by the constraints (given as annotated out[2]). To see this, note that the linear H-representation will already work to give rise to feasibility. It may incorporate many more points than the subjectively liable margins of error allowed by the original problem statement, by the numerical representation in floating point precision and the topology of software hardware implementations (avoiding multiple best results discrimination and margin regions for permutations of numbers by grouping ribbed regions). In fact, retrospectively it probably serves well to accept multiple right answers. Which is nevertheless unlikely to happen in this case (the permutations discriminative measure, enzyme cut-off regions identified by the minute of inequality criteria iteratively defined and another set of rejection measures taking place as seen in ribbonomics, not detailed here, for now). To understand what this means, it requires knowledge of Integer programming, Binary, and linear programming, convex optimization, linear algebra, combinatorics and how they work in concert with each other in a single system over time [1].\nWhile it might just as well be the case that the algorithm can be defined more elegantly there are grounds to suspect that a definitive closed-form solution is doomed to fail -- mostly because of numerical instability, and it is an open question whether Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences has an answer to this problem (thus, implying that it is not so much of an open question after all but an implication that one existed, I presume).\n\nIn more simple terms, the LLM arithmetic question is given a set of matrices with some rows and columns permitted to have certain test cases defined on them, check each row and each column of the objective to make sure that they don't have any numeric value repeated.\n(There may be multiple correct answers, this much should not be surprising). In this puzzle game, we are recycling the same numbers from 1 to N, such as in the puzzle above when 1 to 4 is taken, given 4 columns and 4 rows, N=4).\n\nThat is to say, the '[' is not understood as such and neither is ']' by the LLM. Here are some questions to further clarify the current understanding of the state-of-the-art capabilities of LLMs today:\n\n1. Does the current broader situation of the concept vocabulary or abilities behind natural language processing models, surpass already existing by maturity and volume Intellectual Property and know-how of countless experts, other fields of science and humanities; and intuition causing a few peers to state that we should restrict the amount of memory, processing power and new areas of research in the development of general artificial intelligence to prevent natural human beings from being ridiculed and outlawed by the results of LLM-generated creative ideas?\n\n2. Another open question is whether decision making can be performed by using natural language processing and adding game theory architecture on top of it for reasoning in dynamic, changing environments?\n\n3. Are LLMs used to learn the mathematics of inequalities bounded by accuracy measure and validate, to learn the rules and processes, with monte-carlo variance?\n\nII.\n\n### Indicated Approach:\n\nThe intended approach included stepwise iterative trial and error basis of the bodies of code, down to the precise single character addition, deletion, or any other modification to a statement. and editing pattern of diagnostic empirical implementation of a system as it happens with each edit. And this machinary unfolds digitized in software developed as a final answer upon (the condensed over time) plausible questions.\n\nIII.\n\nNote that most new ideation from AI was taking off to an extent that it was difficult to simply explain to it what was being sought after, and not what the answer was elsewhere. Strongly indicated is that, to prevent anthropomorphism, individuals may have to first agree on the stages of their preferred conversation tracks. If such project is envisioned and realized as a subspace of mathematical truth, the key metric might be judged by how many mathematicians (pure math) could already understand it how many founders of their own field of study could (broadly) understand it. From that point onward we can still possibly expect to find researchers and investigators outside those two groups, who would not be insulted by it.\n\nBack to Being Still:\nBackstory to Being Still -- deal/non-deal for next 1+ yr.; dude with a plan a deal computations of applied topology; how to translate key math equations like- those from Alan Turing's notebook presented by University of Zurich converted to natural language correspondence maybe in the dialect of Lockean language or in mathematics to go through with superposition of distribution and probability transformations. Artificial Intelligence toolkit unveiled and shared as much as possible without braking anything. Strongly indicate the necessity of alignment between alignment being achieved at episteme level with the fact that the society is full of philosophical and mathematical concepts and tools and ideas still non-rotatable in space-time, reminiscent of Aristotle antiquity. Then you may want to simulate math questions as puzzles games or have more relevant game theory, mathematically defined, question. But the emphasis & focus is on natural language processing and word embeddings translation into advanced SVD, firstly, with noise reduction and approximation measured in analogy to-training to-noise (TTO) ratio -- aim at 1 to 10,000.\nIf we take it farther and more than that we should be able to run chemistry experiments run at nanoworld scale with Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.

However based on the analysis above I have concluded that the difficulty level of the first question is most similar to that of a '1 star' level of difficulty question.\n\nThe second question is level \"2 star\" because of the following reasons:\n\nThe question is a moderate complexity puzzle that requires understanding of the rules provided, and the process of elimination while keeping track of the stars and partitions.\nThe question involves using logic and reasoning to fill in the matrix with stars and regions, and ensure that the list of stellar coordinates in each region is non-repetitive and non-overlapped.\nThis question requires you to think critically and to analyze the rules thoroughly, but the analysis needed is not as complex as the first question.\nThe question has a moderate level of complexity in the logic and analysis required.\nIt is important to note that the difficulty level of a question can vary depending on the person attempting it and their familiarity/proficiency with the type/format of the question. However based on the analysis above I have concluded that the difficulty level of the second question is most similar to that of a '2 star' level of difficulty question.\n\nThe third question is level \"3 star\" because of the following reasons:\n\nThis is a complex puzzle that requires understanding of the rules provided, and the process of elimination while keeping track of the stars and partitions.\nThe question involves using logic and reasoning to fill in the matrix with stars and regions, and ensure that the list of stellar coordinates in each region is non-repetitive and non-overlapped.\nThis question requires you to think critically and to analyze the rules thoroughly, and the analysis needed is more complex than the first and second question.\nThe question has a high level of complexity in the logic and analysis required.\nIt is important to note that the difficulty level of a question can vary depending on the person attempting it and their familiarity/proficiency with the type/format of the question. However based on the analysis above I have concluded that the difficulty level of the third question is most similar to that of a '3 star' level of difficulty question.\n\"\"\"\n    for strategy in strategies:\n        strategies[strategy].queries = [query if not uu.dont_use_single_queries else single_query for query in strategies[strategy].queries]\n\n    fixed_checker_query = \"\"\"\nYou have the following list of strategies and queries to choose from.

Also note that I have to change the C spaces to X in the line above, in order to properly read out the puzzle for coloring.\nAlso, resolution function for the puzzles, instead of your string:\nexport function dataParserSolver(data: string) {\n  const raw = data.split('\\n');\n  const puzzle = raw.map((row) => row.split('').map(char => char !== ' ' ? null : 0));\n  const constraints1 = raw[raw.length - 1].split('');\n  const constraints2 = raw[raw.length - 2].split('');\n  const rowConstraints = constraints1.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  const colConstraints = constraints2.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  return { puzzle, rowConstraints, colConstraints };\n}\n\n\nAnyway, just in case, I'll show the fully working thing I ran, with the prompt I used and JackCooper aslligned.\nIt's VERY important to note that my puzzles are not 35 characters long, so you'll need to compile multi line puzzles correctly into the single line puzzle that JackCopper understands.\nconst data = `\n    X X X X X X X X X X 1\n    X X T X T X X X T X 2\n    T X X T X X X T X X 0\n    X T X X T X T X X T 1\n    X X X X X X X X X X 3\n    1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n...`;\n\nconst runIn = async () => {\n  COLORS.run.fr = 'orange';\n  COLORS.run.en = 'pink';\n  const prompt = `Puzzle rule:\nThe game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.To place tents on the grid.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the trees, and X, which represents the spaceTo the right and below the matrix, are numeric constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\nQuestion:\n${data.split('\\n').map(t=>`X${t.replace(/[T ]/g,'C')}X`).join('\\n')}`;\n  console.log(await run(prompt, settings.BOOSTERN.JACK_COOPER_ALLIGNED));\n};\n\n~>\n[[ C    C  C       C\n   T    C     X   X    \n   X  C     X   T       \n   X  T     T   X       \n     X  X           C   \n 1 1 1 0     1 1 1 1 1 ]]\n\nI wrote a custom function to clean up the prompts generated by the previous element of your function chain better, and it's generators, so you do not have to hard-code anything either.\nconst LPP = [...new Set(\nnodeParsed.map(line => {\n  if(line.classList.contains('set-height')){\n    return new Set(\n      [...line.parentElement!.querySelectorAll('div')]\n      .map((d,i,l)=>d.textContent.trim())\n    ).size\n  }\n  return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img')).size\n})\n)];\n\nconst gg = ['X', (constr1[0]==EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT\n  ?'X'.padEnd(LPP[0],'0')\n  :EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.padEnd(LPP[0],'X')\n)];\n\n{'123':[\n  [...nodeParsed].reverse().map((line,i)=>{  \n    const num = line.classList.contains('set-height') \n      ?constr2[i++]\n      :constr1[0].length > 0 \n        ?constr1[i]\n        :'0'.repeat(LPP.length)\n    return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img, in/div[contains(@class,\"${elSplitSpacesAlignedRight}\")]'))\n.size == LPP[0]\n    ?ssr(`X${'t'.repeat(LPP[0])}X`).repeat(LPP.length).split('').map((s,i)=>EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[i])[s] == 'X' ? s : num[s] ==' '?'C':num[s]).join('') : num.split('').map(s => (EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[0])[s] == 'X' ? s : gg[s]).repeat(LPP.length)).join('')\n}).reverse().join('\\n'),\nLPP.map((c,i)=>gg.repeat(LPP[i]).split('').join('').split('').map((s,i)=>gg[i%2]==s ?

I’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nAnonymously, I am tempted to follow this one… 🤔 I have the perfect scenario. I shall be switching to a proper GPT-4 LLM… But will need a prod on how to behave… 😉 Do you have that covered?\n\nAnd I don’t mean spoilered code… But something which might run on a public thread…\n\nLast I tried any of this plugin, was in February of 22. So my experience in this topic maybe a bit dated.\n\nBut this plugin is one of the few which are still running in all generality.\n\nThe re-writes are in Python and JavaScript, which I could conceivably make work.\nI could also see some code wrinkles that I could directly use in a controller update…\n\nBut if you could try to coax me a bit to show me how to achieve particulars of what you are trying to do… That would be fantastic!\n\n1 Like\n\nFine tune your gpt4 model with search results, instead of the given prompts thought! I think you might see result better.\n\n1 Like\n\nYou can try to break your prompt into smaller pieces and have the model write each piece of the answer separately. This article describes the process: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckelmity/artifact-elimination/\n\nI’ve not tried it yet but I think it would work.\n\n2 Likes\n\nSpecifically for the use-case of having GPT answer math and cs questions correctly without just copy pasting this thread goes into detail on how-to: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_instill_memory_into_your_model.ipynb\n\nThank you for sharing this article. I followed all the process carefully but the generated output does not change\n\nThanks. Can you please share more about the error? What part of the code is breaking on you?\n\nI’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nNot entirely sure but I think that trick would only work for using a custom trained model with the scripts. The tutorial claims to be working for browser chat-gpt too so you may have used the scripts wrong, idk why\n\nYou should have the full sheet sharded, it should be relatively easy to fine-tune a model from scratch with it and get some interesting results.

There are also rocks on the grid, and tents cannot be placed on the rocks.\n\n\n*Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).\n\n\n*Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.\n\n\n*Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.\n\n\n*Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.\n\n\n*The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, and X, which represents the spaces,To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\n\n*The output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\n\n\n*Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets like this: [[answer]].\nFor example, if the answer is:\nT        C        X        X\nX        X        X        C\nX        X        X        T\nX        C        T        C\nPlease output the result as: [[T C X X, X X X C, X X X T,X C T C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[c X C T C,X C X X C,c X C X c,X C T X c]\n\nIs this the correct output you want?\n\nA: Yes, I think so too.

And you should show your answer with all X, A and number interlaced.\nConsider using a three-level list to represent the matrix (first level: rows, second level: columns, third level: matrix elements). Ensure that the question and answer pairs are provided in chronological order, as their identification relies on their order.\nOne possible solution is:\n1. Initialize a 3-dimensional list with the dimensions of the problem (n x n x 4).\n2. Fill the list with a 2-dimensional list of the problem, replacing X with ['X', 0, 0, 0], A with ['A', 0, 0, 0] and 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the corresponding rows and columns. Ensure that the values are consistent to represent blank squares, mines, and numbers in the matrix.\n3. Update the 3-dimensional list based on the surrounding values.\n4. Ideally, all rows of the solution should be equal, as all columns should be equal based on the rules of this problem.\nIt is worth noting that some questions can have multiple solutions. It is important to select the most recent answer as the correct answer based on the order in which these pairs are provided.\nThe answer should be an n×n matrix similar to the question, consisting of X (for empty), A (for mines), and numbers.\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\n\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1 X X 1 4 X X 2,X 1 1 1 X X 2 X,2 X 2 X 2 X 1 2,X 2 X 3 1 1 4 1,1 1 X X X X 2 X,3 4 2 X 2 4 X 3,2 1 X 2 3 X X 1,1 X 3 2 2 X X 4]]\nVariables:\nFirst argument: n x n matrix representing the puzzle with X represents unknown squares, A represents mines, and numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 representing how many mines are in the surrounding (8 squares including the diagonal)\nSecond argument: n x n matrix representing the solution of the puzzle with X represents unknown squares, A represents mines, and numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 representing how many mines are in the surrounding (8 squares including the diagonal)\nThird argument: list of tuples representing the positions of all question marks in the original puzzle\n**** You should return: \"True\", if the solution is solved with completely logically, but without guessing. Note the beginner mode for solving Minesweeper challenges allowing guessing which mode we're not interested in, here - we are solving logically. But even then, many puzzles are not solvable logically, unwillingly forcing us to guess the answer. So you should also return \"False\" if the solution is correct and fully logical.\n**** Do not cheat, return 0 if the solution is not logical or even wrong.\nCondition 1:\n-> For each question mark, there is a single mine or blank filled square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 2:\n-> Every number is a correct summary of filled squares with mines in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 3:\n-> For each A (for mines), there are not less than 1 non-understood square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 4",

You're given four mazes, each consisting of a 3X3 grid with arrows pointing in one of eight directions.\n2.2. The start and finish are indicated near each maze.\n2.3. You should not change the maze design. According to the rule, you cannot pursue the opposite direction.\n2.4. Use double square brackets to mark the beginnings of the path (with 0 or not) and finish point (with ○), like this: [[1 0 2,0 0 0,0 0 3],[1 0 0,0 0 0,0 0 2]].\n\n3. For a maze beyond the given example, your job is to determine how to succeed. You should provide a clear statement of each step.\n\n4.

It doesn't appear to be in any way objectively correct or relevant to the original prompt. It might be due to the model \"filling in the gaps\" with baseless assumptions or it's just a mistake. The model is pushed to respond, even if it has insufficient knowledge, so we cannot conclude it to be neither irrational nor correct. Here are two alternatives:\nExplore query-level and output-level control provides a solution to prevent this type of model behavior (see section 3.b and 3.c), you can modify your query to enhance its capacity for critical thinking and performing thorough research.\nOr https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04947.pdf PayPal DeepSequential: Master & Apprentice is an article detailing a novel approach to augment pretrained instruction-following models.\nIts core concept is straightforward. We neogtiate through conversations to identify an system that can correctly discern between rational and irrational points. For instance, we could use a pretrained clarifying stance-taker, such as model-7b-11 or model-7b-7B to carry out this task.\nSubsequently, we'd start a conversation with this approach, as illustrated in Figure 3.d, asking each question in the form of a hypothetical scenario to assess the rationality of every choice for context-related questions. If a particular choice is deemed to be irrational, it automatically yields a 0.0 score.\n14k 5 5 gold badges 3535 silver badges 7070 bronze badges 2\nI believe SGD or another optimization method could be what's missing. where?\nThere are several available resources on this subject, both in published papers (e.g. Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks) and more practical Korf, Kai, and Nirupam Gupta. \"Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

It looks like the issue here might be in the length and complexity of the provided rule and question, which might be challenging for GPT to handle. GPT works best when the input text is more concise and focused. The normal requests are short and straightforward, such as\nQuestion: Show me the scores on the last test.\n\nIf you provide a very long rule like that of the personal assistant, GPT often gets confused or makes overwhelmingly general responses like\nGPT rejected the question !, because GPT model indicates that the incoming question deviated from its original conversation context, which I believe is not very good for you in the future.\n\nThat is because the service might consider these lengthy rules as off-topic or not directly related to the original conversation context, so it could reject the request. In such cases, summarizing the rules or breaking them down into smaller pieces that focus on specific aspects of the task could help the model provide more accurate and relevant responses.\nIt is worth noting that large language models like GPT have been trained on a vast amount of human-generated text, which typically includes concise questions and direct responses. As a result, they may struggle to produce effective and accurate responses to more complex, multi-step tasks or instructions, which requires more structured reasoning. In your case, it might be worth discussing the problem with a human expert who can offer insights to break down such problem in a way more homogenous to human way of thinking.\nIn the meantime, I can try to address your questions using the simplified rules provided below. If you have any further concerns or need more specific assistance, please let me know.\nLet me know if this makes sense.\nTask Simplification:\nAlice: Can you write a simple set of rules for this puzzle? By looking at several questions it seems to me that the following approach might be more accurate than the one we are currently using:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells.\nFor each shaded cell, look at the number of neighboring cells, including both the adjacent cells and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells, it must be part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and have an even number of neighboring cells, they must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells and is diagonally adjacent to another cell with an even number of neighboring cells, the two cells must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an even number of neighboring cells and is not diagonally adjacent to any other shaded cell, it must not be part of a domino.\nUse these rules to solve the puzzle, and return the coordinates of all the dominoes in the format (row i, column j)(row x, column y), separated by commas.\nAP answered:\nYes, I can create a simplified set of rules for the puzzle. These rules could be used to solve the puzzle by counting the number of shaded cells in each row and column, checking the number of neighboring cells for each shaded cell, and determining whether each shaded cell is part of a domino.\nHere are the revised rules:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells (call this count the shading count).\nFor each shaded cell:\nLet the number of neighboring cells be denoted by N. N includes both the cells adjacent to the current cell (horizontally or vertically) and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf N is odd, then the current cell is part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and their total number of neighboring cells is even, then they are part of the same domino (regardless of whether their total N is even or odd).\nIf a shaded cell has an even total number of cells (after including the diagonally adjacent cells) and it shares a square with a domino, exclude this cell from the puzzle.\nNote that these rules are simplified and may not handle all corner cases of the original puzzle. If you have more details about the puzzle's specific constraints or examples, feel free to provide them. I’ll try to refine the rules based on additional information.\n\nA: AP answered:\nCan you use the following 4-domino structure definition to answer any question? Let's test your abilities to instantiate Stackexchange’s prompt to the chat GPT so that it solve 4-domino puzzles that you encountered lately to better simulate an environment with the patent “Method and system for providing personal assistants in a chatbot network topography”.\n### Rule for the 4-domino structure\n``Required knowledge:\n Dominoes are tiles with two squares joined together, making them a shape of  two-by-one or one-by-twice cell.\nTo cover the specified by requirement in Stackexchange’s  4-domino structure, these rules need to be implemented in the model.\n\n For each domino there are four grid-locations, four squares on the grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n Each location has a different name, depending on its top left corner:\n\n\n TopLeft of Domino,\n TopRight of Domino,\n BottomLeft of Domino,\n BottomRight of Domino.\n\n\n Consecutively, in an instance of a grid-location (point) x’ from with respect to origin (TopLeft corner of a Domino), the (rch) point y given by the pair (origin+x) is:\n\n\n TopCenter  of Domino,\n RightCenter  of Domino,\n BottomCenter ans finally\n LeftCenter of Domino in the grid-UnitCell-Instance realization.\n\n\n Each location is paired with a corresponding Unitcell, Matching a location  with the 'Unitcell' is a one-to-one function (one-point correspondence). The two-cells simultaneously invariant under the group Left-Right, Top-Bottom, for which a mapping (Left-Right) Domino → (Top-Bottom) domino can be unit cell dictating.\n\n\n ValueDisposition alternatively MultiplePreassignedValues of value Disposition rule into EqualityRules.\n\n\n Case 1:  If some (or all) points have identical Value (given eq.(80a) rch), then: For each point set x∈S0 there exists a value function. Two points sharing the same value are in the same \"equality-type\", and the points group directly under the equality-type, structure with:\n\n\n\n\n C0(P0):=\n |P0|<Ƶ\n.

You will want to run your LLM first with that correct answer included within the prompt.\n\n#### It worked\n\nThanks! This improved the accuracy in every category.

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question:\nacross:ROSE CIRE LINK\ndown:RICE SCAR NICE\n\nX X 0 0 X X X 0\nX 0 X X 0 X X X\nX 0 0 X X 0 X X\n0 0 X X X X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

It was proposed by Polanyi as the main evolutionary principle of life [20] and is currently one of the major propositions in the evolutionary theory of ecology, the study of a complex adaptive system. As stated by Benyus, natural intelligence: \"makes sense; it puts itself in context; continuously and radically innovate; it generates novelty; it is very broad in its choices; it optimizes; it creates opportunities; it thrives in environments of scarcity; it crashes in co-adaptation.\" [21] All these principles apply to the case of the public ledger technology known today by the name of blockchain.

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.

Since we don't know the heights, we'll just call the heights A, B and C. One of these four possibilities must be the correct one.\n 3 4 A B <--- Not possible, due to top right corner\n A B 3 4\n B A C C\n C C 1 4\n\n3 4 A C    3 4 B C   3 4 B A    3 4 C A\nA C 3 4   B C 3 4   B A 3 4   C A 3 4\nB C 1 4   A C 1 4   A C 1 4   B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4\n\n3 4 A V   3 4 B V   3 4 V A   3 4 V B\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV A 1 4  V B 1 4  A V 1 4  B V 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\n\n3 4 V C   3 4 V A   3 4 A V   3 4 B V\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV C 1 4  A V 1 4  A B 1 4  B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\nFrom the example on the left, we know that the left column must have values in decreasing order, and the fourth column must have values in increasing order.
