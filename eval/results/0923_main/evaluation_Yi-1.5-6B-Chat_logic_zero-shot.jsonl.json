(~p1 &p2) =::>(p1 =p3)\n\nThis formula can be broken down into two parts:\n\n- Part A: (~p1 &p2)\n- Part B: (p1 =p3)\n\nThe compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented by p1 =::>p2, and \"p1 if and only if p3\" is represented by p1 =p3.\n\n**Part A Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p2 | Formula Evaluation\n----------------------------------\n1   | 1   | ~(1 & 1) = ~1 = 0 (F)\n1   | x   | ~(1 & !x) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | 1   | ~(!x & 1) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | x   | ~(!x & !x) = ~0 = 1 (T)\n```\n\n**Part B Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p3 | Formula Evaluation\n-------------------------------\n1   | 1   | (1 = 1) = 1 (T)\n1   | x   | (1 = !x) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | 1   | (!x = 1) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | x   | (!x = !x) = 1 (T)\n```\n\nThe \"if... then\" compound proposition \"p1 =::>p2\" requires p1 to be true for p2 to be true. Hence, when p1 is true and p2 is false, Part A evaluates to false (F) for assignments (1, x) and (x, 1), and when p1 and p2 are both true, Part A evaluates to true (T) for assignment (x, x).\n\nFor Part B, \"p1 if and only if p3\" requires p1 and p3 to have the same truth value. Hence, when p1 and p3 are both true or both false, Part B evaluates to true (T). When they have different truth values, Part B evaluates to false (F).\n\nTherefore, the truth values and falsity values are:\n```\n[[F:x|x, x|1;T:x|x, x|1, 1|1]]\n```\n\nNote: The explanation provided is a manual combinatorial analysis approach.

If p1 = ✓ and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ✓ and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓, and p3 = ✓, then (p1 &p3 ) = ✓ and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ✓=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ✓, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ✓, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",

The paired conjunctive terms can be denoted as m0 to m15, where the subscript is the binary representation of the corresponding hexadecimal number.\n\nA formula is a basic formula if it contains m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form. For an all-even formula, the index i of the paired conjunctive term must be even. The even indices in hexadecimal are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. Therefore, the corresponding binary numbers are 0000, 0010, 0100, 0110, 1000, 1010, 1100, 1110.\n\nAmong the 16 paired conjunctive terms, the ones with binary indices 0000 (0), 1010 (A), and 1100 (C) correspond to the even indices in hexadecimal. These correspond to the paired conjunctive terms m0, Ma, and Mc.\n\nSince a formula must contain m0 to be a basic formula, and we are only considering the all-even formulas, we have 3 possible formulas that satisfy both conditions:\n\n- m0 (corresponding to the conjunction of all propositional variables being true)\n- Ma (corresponding to the conjunction of alternating propositional variables being true)\n- Mc (corresponding to the conjunction of all but one propositional variable being true)\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy both the conditions of being a basic form and an all-even form is 3.\n\nThe answer is [3].",

So, (p∧q)∨(p∧r) means that the whole expression is true (or \"+\") when at least one of the sub-expressions (p∧q) or (p∧r) is true.\n\nGiven these rules, let's construct the truth table for the given logical expression:\n\n| p | q | r | p∧q | p∧r | (p∧q)∨(p∧r) |\n|---|---|---|-----|-----|------------|\n| + | + | + |  +  |  +  |        +   |\n| + | + | - |  +  |  -  |        +   |\n| + | - | + |  -  |  +  |        +   |\n| + | - | - |  -  |  -  |        -   |\n| - | + | + |  -  |  +  |        +   |\n| - | + | - |  -  |  -  |        -   |\n| - | - | + |  -  |  +  |        +   |\n| - | - | - |  -  |  -  |        -   |\n\nNow, according to the rule specified for the circuit diagram, we represent powered as \"+\" and unpowered as \"-\":\n\n- **Outputs:**\n  - For (p∧q)∨(p∧r) to be true, we have \"+\".\n  - For (p∧q)∨(p∧r) to be false, we have \"-\".\n\nGiven the rule for the circuit diagram, our answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[p, q, r], [(p∧q)∨(p∧r), (p∧q)∨(p∧r)]]\n[[p, q, r], [+, +], [-, -]]\n\nThis means that for any combination of inputs p, q, and r, the output of the circuit diagram is always \"+\", indicating that the overall expression (p∧q)∨(p∧r) is true (or \"+\").",

True if the input is 0 (false), and false if the input is 1 (true).\n- **Disjunction (∨):** Means \"OR\".

(p, q, r) = (0, 0, 1) -> Here, p is False, q is False, r is True, and hence, NOT r is True, making the (p AND q AND NOT r) True. However, p OR r is also True, not False, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n2. (p, q, r) = (0, 1, 0) -> Here, p is False, q is True, r is False, and both (p AND q AND NOT r) is False (as NOT r is True) and (p OR r) is False (as both p and r are False).

The conclusion drawn is that regular physical activity results in an increase in lung capacity.\n\nThis conclusion aligns with Method ꙮ (Positive-Negative Group) because it involves identifying both conditions where P (lung size) and S (regular physical activity) occur together and conditions where one occurs without the other, while controlling for other variables (differing ages, genders, and occupations). The key point is that in the experiment, lung size (P) is associated with physical activity (S), and when all other conditions are controlled, it's clear that higher levels of physical activity are associated with larger lung volumes.",

In this specific case, the relationship between the \"less than\" (R) operation is being transposed between the universal quantifiers (∀x and ∃y), which results in a contradiction because ∀x∃yR(x, y) correctly states the property of natural numbers that there is no largest number, while ∃y∀xR(x, y) incorrectly concludes the existence of a largest number.
