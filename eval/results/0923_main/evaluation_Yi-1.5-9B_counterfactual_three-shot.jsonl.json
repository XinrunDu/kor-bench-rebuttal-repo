Unlike the common peashooter, Gatling Peashooter peanut cannot be upgraded. Gatling Peashooter is similar to Dinosaur Eggs an upgraded Gatling Pea, fossil box, and 30 bones (5x higher the collection and upgrade of Gatling Pea).\n\n### Instructions:\nEvaluate the following statement: Gatling Pea only works when planted on a peashooter, but brother is much more powerful than Gatling Pea.\n\n### Answer:\nGatling Pea is only available when planted on Peashooter, but it has stronger attack power. Dinosaur Eggs is Indiana Engor.\n\n### Question:\nUpgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro\n In order to upgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro, it is necessary to place a Peashooter in front of it and spend 80 Potato Puff power-ups, This requires 800 Pem and 6 packs of seeds per transfer The Gatling Pea does not form a plant buddy after transformation Various plants can go together in the same map. The pots of burned dirt can be burned with flamethrower or Mecha's beam to temporarily turn them into movable ground\n The Robin is first set to attack Zombie Clowns, and then multi-selects zombies with the highest defense.

Through defensive evolution, the plants become stronger, and the family becomes stronger, thus Dr. Tomato can enter, but after a long time of evolution, it will no longer be effective;\n The evolutionary rules are the same as before. By upgrading plants, regardless of plant buddies, one level of evolution will activate a level above its current level, and if they are not upgraded to a specific level, the plants will not evolve;\n The professional evolution will have many deadly turns at each level. It is best for Specimen XX to learn more about evolutionary resources and accompany Specimen XX.\n\n### Instructions:\nCan plants not be evolved?\n\n### Answer:\nNo\n\n### Question:\nCritters are cheap and powerful plants.

This makes it easy to block an attack even if they are both attacked by a standing group of zombies.

Your job is to assist users by providing comprehensive explanations for their questions and supporting statements.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Extensively research the topic at hand if necessary to provide detailed answers.\n2. Ensure your responses are concise and relevant to the question or statement.\n3. Demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter by incorporating additional information that supports your response.\n\n### Question:\nEXPLANATION:\nIn Final Fantasy VII, the Guardian Force Palom/Maroda is a rare and powerful summon that grants immense damage against biomechanical enemies. To fully harness its power, it's crucial to deal substantial damage of any element to one of the summon's allies for each consecutive enemy it summons. The summons themselves deal significant elemental damage with their ranged abilities, but their primary strength lies in their defensive aspects. Palom/Maroda transforms allies into defensive forms that absorb as much as 9999999 damage via various elements, providing unrivaled defensive capabilities.\n\nHow is Palom/Maroda effectively utilized?\n\n### Answer:\nClaim: Palom/Maroda should be summoned when dealing significant damage of any element to its one of allies.\nEvidence 1: Palom/Maroda becomes stronger with each consecutive enemy it summons.\nExtra claim: After dealing significant damage, Palom/Maroda will summon more enemies with increased damage, granting a higher chance of further elemental damage leading to more summons. This chain reaction can turn Palom/Maroda into a powerful damage-dealing ally.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nRevise the claim and evidence as necessary to provide a more comprehensive and accurate explanation. Ensure that the supporting claim complements the evidence rather than contradicting it. Avoid highlighting contradictory evidence where possible. If a contradictory piece of evidence cannot be avoided, acknowledge it and discuss how it contributes to the overall understanding of the topic.\n\nLogic trap: Confirmation bias: Confirmation bias occurs when one selectively seeks out evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence. Keep an open mind when evaluating statements and evidence provided, and ensure that your revisions do not demonstrate confirmation bias.\n\n### After understanding the claim, **provide new revisions (if any) according to the provided instructions.**\n\"\"\"\n\nuse_what_i_learned = \"\"\"\n### Task Description:\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in research, multitasking, and context-rich language understanding.

When breaking down the statements into dedicated areas of knowledge, try to ensure that you do not duplicate formatting between areas. Keep the tone and perspective of the originating text in mind when addressing additional topics.\n3. Refrain from generating explanations related to individual statements within these dedicated areas. Focus on providing comprehensive overviews and distinctions for each subject.\n\n### Question:\n\nExplain the statements provided, with each statement specializing in a dedicated area of knowledge. Answer in a way that complements the style and tone of the originating statements.\n\nEXPLANATION:\n1. As depicted by Ruijerd in Final Fantasy XII, the Golden Apple is a mysterious fruit that defies traditional nourishment. When consumed, the assimilation process slows down and builds up in the stomach, increasing its size and turning the consumer into a Golden Apple itself.\n2. Alice's Childhood was a 2015 Yaoi manga series by Thosoyoichi, renowned for its depiction of lesbian characters. It follows the rather haphazard and casual school exchanges of two young girls in elementary school, their development of a childhood best friend bond, and the couple's first kiss.\n3.

His village was terrorized by the nasty, scary, and smelly dragons, and he was ostracized by his peers and society. However, when he befriends a Night Fury dragon, he overcomes the prejudices of his community and is regarded as a hero whose words carry no merit.\n4. In the fictional world of Yu-Gi-Oh, Blue-Eyes White Dragon is the legendary card of Light created by Solomon. The card's popularity, while hailed by many, is considered too cowardly and afraid to change according to current trends, hence its very low price.\n5.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nMaxwell is a major character in Don't Starve and one of the two playable characters (along with Wilson) in the Tome of Horrors. Prior to killing a Mothron, Maxwell will have Hay Fever. When using a shaving tool on the Steed's Mane, Maxwell lets out a cry of \"Herald!\". Maxwell selects his birthplace and character, a bit like Wilson. Arcadia is the Maxwell's birthplace.\nDracula is destroyed in a meteor shower, and Kasper, an elf, is summoned by Maxwell. He seems to know more about this world than anyone.\nIn WW11, Maxwell will go to the Time Loop. Both Future Self Maxwell and Maxwell joined forces, but the madness prevented them from effectively communicating. When he was transported back to the Palace Prison, Wilson's journal entries mention that Maxwell is the only prisoner in the cell. Maxwell spends about five days in his cell.\nThulean portal obelisks can connect El Dorado and Mortis. The Thulean obelisk connects Maxwell to the Thulean portal on that world, which can be accessed by digging to the world's core.\nIn 5 oceans, Maxwell gets a Thulean crystal after 12 hours of his return.\nWhen Maxwell went back to his cell (Dark Woods or El Dorado), he had minor damage but would survive.\nOf all the oceans, Maxwell has the least spine-chilling horror to date.\nAfter Maxwell's first active role in Den, when he regenerated, the Peck will appear and Maxwell will read the journal. Adam and Eve (Day of Redemption) was shut out by the Enchanted Forest in the Lake of Dreams.\nWash Berg, who said he was a seer, thought Ghost Maxwell wore a latex mask. Russell MacViolet told him Ghost Maxwell didn't look Greevil-like, which made Ghost Maxwell just like the Flying Rooster. Ghost Maxwell walked away very strangely, but he was a ghost so it made sense. Ghost Maxwell's footsteps could barely be heard amid the dead trees. Ghost Maxwell is taller and has a larger profile than most of his \"plus\" counterparts. Ghost Maxwell was obviously possessed and still looked normal.\nSince the release of Don't Starve Together, Ghost Maxwell could be used as a character in The Rite of Spring by Modders. Maxwell's ghost form is called Ghost Maxwell, which is a white skeleton character with an item slot.\n\n### Question:\nThe storage time of the main dish is:\nOptions: A.Longer than the non-cooked Mandible Roll##B.The Marrow Cookie can explode when in contact with an explosive substance.##C.Can be eaten even if the character was bitten by Eldritch Campsite Rabbit.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nEugene Harold Krabs, more commonly known as Mr. Krabs, is a miserly red crab who lives in an anchor with his daughter, Pearl, who is a young whale. He is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant.\nSpongeBob is a sea sponge with a rectangular shape, despite being designed to look like an actual kitchen sponge. He is light yellow with a light olive-green outline. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When SpongeBob puts tape on Karen's screen, her speech is muffled. This implies that her screen acts like a mouth.\nThe Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty. \nBikini Bottom is an undersea city where SpongeBob and his friends live. Boatmobiles are boat-shaped cars which are the main mode of transport for Bikini Bottomites. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer who lives in the Chum Bucket laboratory. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. \nKaren reveals to Plankton that she ordered a baby for them, and a stork drone soon arrives at the Chum Bucket to deliver it. SpongeBob has the ability to filter-feed and reproduce by budding.\nPlankton advises Mr. Krabs to marry money; Krabs agrees if possible. That night, Krabs hears crying near Krusty Krab's bus stop. Investigating, he finds a money stack with a face, unaware it's a robot named Cashina controlled by Plankton. Krabs falls in love, proposes to Cashina, and she accepts. The next day, Mr. Krabs and Cashina are officially married after their wedding. The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.\nThe Atlanteans traveled countless light-years from their home planet and brought the oldest living bubble on the journey, living over a million years. The Atlanteans took great advances in weapons, wealth, science, art, and things that people took for granted in Bikini Bottom today. The Weapons Vault contains all Atlantean-created weaponry, as the Atlanteans sealed away their entire arsenal to live in harmony with any sea life around them.\nIn 6188 B.C., Bikini Bottom population is 23. Seen on SpongeBob's license, on July 14, 1986, SpongeBob was born. Squidward was born on the same year.\nThe first Neptune dynasty takes throne of Bikini Bottom after the Krabs dynasty loses power (and the krabby patty recipe) in the 12th century.\nPrincess Pearl Krabs was a princess of Bikini Bottomshire sometime before the 12th century and is a medieval ancestor of Pearl Krabs. She first appears in the episode \"Dunces and Dragons.\"\nAlternate-Universe SpongeBob is a sea sponge who usually appears as a reflection of SpongeBob since he lives in a mirror and usually goes against the laws of reflections by not following SpongeBob's movement and instead behaving in his own manner, but sometimes exists in an alternative reality as his nickname suggests. He first appears in the episode \"Squid's Day Off.\"\nThe Bi-Annual Jellyfish Convention is a convention for Jellyfishers. It is located in a huge stadium and it has a big turnouts. \nEven though Squidward's name contains the word \"squid,\" he is an octopus, not a squid, as confirmed in many interviews and episodes. The series' animators illustrated Squidward with six tentacles.\nThe two begin capturing everyone with Sandy's net guns (intended for harvesting moon rocks), believing the citizens of Bikini Bottom to be aliens.\nThe Protogenerator 2000 appears to be a large machine that greatly resembles",
