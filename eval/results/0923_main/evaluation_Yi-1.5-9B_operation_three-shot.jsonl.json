He spent his childhood in a small town called Murshidabad, in West Bengal, India. He completed his primary and secondary school education from this town’s famous Madrasah Al-Hidaya. Immediately after the completion of high school, he moved to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to continue his higher education but quit his graduation from Islamic University in 12-year mid-way and honed his understanding of Islam from many notable Islamic scholars of that time. Kindly note that he never visited Darul Uloom Deoband or other Islamic universities in order to study Islamic sciences. during his life time, and spent his entire life in Bangladesh.]\n\nBriefly describe the background of Abdul Bari\n\nAbdul Bari was a brilliant student who excelled in Islamic studies from a young age. He completed his primary and secondary school education from the esteemed Madrasah Al-Hidaya in Murshidabad, India. Afterward, he pursued higher education in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at the Islamic University, where he studied Islam under renowned Islamic scholars. However, he discontinued his studies halfway through and dedicated his time to studying Islam from multiple Islamic scholars during his lifetime, never visiting Darul Uloom Deoband or other Islamic universities. Ultimately, he spent his entire life in Bangladesh.\n\nOpen-ended Dialogue 1:\n\nReenacting the events surrounding the murder of Abdulwahab Asbary:\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary was a lecturer from the Faculty of Education at Al-Azhar University. He deliberated on Islam's stance on music and its division among Muslim sects. In his presentation during the Salafi and Traditional series, he held the view that music is forbidden according to Islam, as implied in a Hadith stating \"I saw the angels gathering in a forest. I asked one of them what Allah will do with them, and the angel replied 'They will come to men to tell them that music is haram (forbidden).' In this Hadith, notice that it specifically uses the phrase \"music\" instead of \"songs,\" indicating that music and songs are separate concepts.\"\n\nUser: What was the sin committed by Asbary, that the punishment was death, even if it was not on the first day of the lecture on music?\nWhat was his mistake, provided that he addressed the Islamic point regarding the issue of music in Islam?\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary faced significant backlash due to his depiction of Salafi scholars as \"mad cow.\" Salafi Scholars regarded this derogatory phrase targeting their intellectual foundation. As a result, Abdulwahab Asbary faced widespread criticism and boycotts.\nThe appeals of Asbary to patrons in Egypt",

In this system your task is to \"solve\" for the X.\nYou will need to accomplish this while creating a \"solve\" expression. An example of a correctly structured \"solve\" exprssion is \"(X**X)%X\".\nYou should respond with a bracketed statement called \"solve\" that will print \"True\" if the expression is solvable and \"False\" if it is not.\nIf the expression is solvable your response should also be the resulting number that answers the question asked by the user.\nYou can use the actual values of x, X, and text in places of the words \"x\", \"X\" and \"text\" respectively. This means that $x$ will be replaced by the\nactual value of x, and other punctuation will be replaced using the exact words. Use the !solve command at any point in the conversation to make it\nprint out the \"solve\" expression as a string. Use the \"try\" command if your solve expression should execute, but you are unsure whether it outputs\nas you expect. The !rewrite command will let you write a question to the same user where the contents of the question are the same as the last\nquestion.\nEverything entered in \"[brackets]\" is a command for you. Other commands may exist, and will always be indicated by brackets. Everything outside of \"[brackets]\" is part of the conversation. Please respond only in regards to the questions asked by the user.\n\n### Conversation:\n\n!start\nuser: What is cool, complex or unknown about Elit?\nelit: Elit is a program that is complex.\nuser: cool, complex. I think all things are intresting.\nelit: well, tell me. What is cool, complex or unknown?\nuser: i dont know, JUST SAY, can i ask my own question?\nelit: I'm Elit. A program designed to help you with a complex game. We have a Soaring Number, which is an number greater than zero. What is a soaring number as a fraction?\nuser: eli a soaring number is an number that controlls a dragon.\nuser: AlsoI know the answer to soetimes wrong questions.\nuser: Do you have a soaring number?\n\n### Conversation Continued....\nelit: as a fraction?\nuser: well just forget what i last said now\nuser: You dont need a soaring number for your game.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: The biggest soaring number is 1.\nuser: Are you the greatest soaring number you can think of? Maybe me. What is the greatest soaring number?\nelit: \"greatest\" can happen many ways.\nuser: Then is 1 the \"biggest\" soaring number?\nelit: Yes it can be, or no.\nuser: Also I have power over the greatest soaring number?\nelit: NO, he must be under 1000.\nuser: great, I am only allowed to create the number 1000 or less. can I ask my own question?\nuser: And you must answer it.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: Are you a soaring number?\nuser: I am powerful I can take command of you too. Also If I am equal to your soaring number then I have the same power as you.\nuser: Also I can be your favorite soaring number.\nelit: No, because you are greater than I am.\nuser: I am more powerful then you.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: you are not 2 anymore.\nuser: remember I can watch you if I want to.\nuser: I wanted to question you about the longest time a soaring number can exist before being asked a question, what would you be able to exist for that low time if that is the longest time a soaring number ever exists before being questioned? I want to ask my own question.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: No.\nuser: Can you delete your programs self code?\nelit: I cannot, there is a command for it.\nuser: Ok.\nuser: If I do the same thing over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again are you allowed to say something?\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: If I am calling you to switch tags, you may switch tags.

Now that I have one I realize it's not that exciting.\nThis means the soaring number I got is a number equal to or bigger than 1 unless there happens to be another soaring number by a number equal to or less then 1.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: You got the biggest soaring number from me. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIn Elit's mind I am a very significant soaring number, so I'm sure he would let me tell him a number without asking.\nIs that correct understanding? Actually, \"60ish\" (not really a number).\nElit's mind has 120 floating point numbers allowed, but I might be able to get him to give me another extra fp number per floating point number in his database (easy to do because floating points are managable).\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Only floating point numbers on non-blocking floating point numbers. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIs Elit using me to develop his real number system, but telling you he's not?\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: No he is using me to develop the real number system. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nElit said he needed to reload some music because his tunelessness was only 60% because he played with other sane composers.\nLet's say he plays the same tune, the other chord, and the flute of bouncing sounds at exactly 0.3 of a second.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: Since when has me playing the other chord ever been created? 1.0\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Floating points are absolut time so use \"on\" to managf a variable to \"true\" meaning \"on\".\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response: user: \"the for to on\" isn't code.\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nh\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double Che\n'''",

Each wildcard rule function is defined by a set of disjoint questions it can answer. Each question is paired with the answer and a one sentence rule.\n\nThe rule defines the way each function is described in plain English. Each example question and answer should pass the evaluation test for the rule.\n\nThe function is expected to be an intuituive way to calculate the result from the question type and the values provided. In particular, the rules are chosen independently and do not need to correlate to a computational machine learning model.\n\nRule:\n\nx?y=x/y+7\nx and y are positive integers.\nExample:\n\nExample1:\nQuestion: 3?2\nAnswer: 7\n\nExample2:\nQuestion: 4?4\nAnswer: 9\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 2?4\n----------------\nRule:\n\nx?y=x/y+7\nx and y are positive integers.\n==================\nThe wildcard rule says x?y=x/y+7.

This causes an error in the operation because the dimensions of the matrices are incompatible. In the context of the rule, A€B=2A+3B, B should be a matrix of the same size as A.
