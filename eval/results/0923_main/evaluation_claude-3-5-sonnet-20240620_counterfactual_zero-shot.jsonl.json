Dragon Nip affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression.\n2. Whispering Deaths appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n3. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate option C because Dragon Nip does not have the magic power to make all dragons relax. Some dragons have no reaction or even become aggressive.\n\nOptions A and B are about catnip, which is not mentioned in the story, so we cannot verify their accuracy based on the given information.\n\nOption D directly matches the information provided in the story about taming a Gronckle using Dragon Nip.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[D]]",

Stimulants: The story doesn't mention stimulants, but these typically have side effects and can be harmful to the body, especially in the long term.\n\nC. Gravity body: While described as a powerful combat resource, the gravity body is an external exoskeleton mecha, not something that enhances the body's natural resistance. It provides protection but doesn't improve the body itself.\n\nD. Becoming a devouring beast: The story mentions fierce monsters and beasts as threats to humans.

Initially, each face has the same color, with different colors on different faces.\n3. It can be scrambled and restored through rotation.\n\nThe story also mentions that this cube was used as a teaching tool for Mohist mechanisms. Master Ban gave it to Ziming to help him understand Mohist mechanisms, indicating that it's not just a toy for children. Moreover, the story states that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban could solve it, which contradicts option D's suggestion that many kids could easily restore it.\n\nTherefore, the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is indeed a teaching prop for instructional mechanisms invented by the Mohist School, making option C the correct answer.",
