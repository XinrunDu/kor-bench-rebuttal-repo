They observed that the remaining sample (without uranium) was more radioactive than pure uranium.\n4. They concluded that there must be another radioactive element present.\n5. They eventually isolated radium and polonium as the source of this additional radioactivity.\n\nThis reasoning process most closely aligns with the ؆ method (Method of Difference). Here's why:\n\n- S (presence of radium and polonium) is initially present but unknown\n- P (high radioactivity) is observed\n- When S is removed (uranium extracted), P (high radioactivity) remains and is even stronger\n- This unexpected result leads to the conclusion that S (radium and polonium) must be causing P (high radioactivity)\n\nThe ؆ method states:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\nIn this case:\n(1) S (radium and polonium) A (uranium) B (other elements)     P (high radioactivity)\n(2) - (no uranium) A (radium and polonium) B (other elements)     P (even higher radioactivity)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

Fact: Li Gua did not murder his boss.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, Li Gua is not an evil person.\n\nThis reasoning follows the pattern:\nIf P, then Q.\nNot P.\nTherefore, Not Q.\n\nThis is a classic example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The fallacy lies in assuming that because the antecedent (murdering the boss) is false, the consequent (being an evil person) must also be false. However, as correctly pointed out in the explanation, there could be other reasons for someone to be considered evil, not just murdering their boss.\n\nAmong the given options, this fallacy corresponds to:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThe NegAnt Method, which is described as: \"If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\"\n\nThis exactly matches the structure of the fallacy in the given argument.",
