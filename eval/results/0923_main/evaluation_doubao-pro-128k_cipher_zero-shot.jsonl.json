The corresponding alphabet for V is YZ: OPQRSTUVWXYZNMABCDEFGHIJKL.\n- The ciphertext character is N. In the YZ cipher alphabet, the letter at position 14 (where N is at position 14 in the standard alphabet) is O.\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext is \"BO\". The answer is: [[BO]] ",

Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'Z', '', ''],\n['', '', 'S', ''],\n['', '', '', 'E'],\n['', '', 'C', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"ZSEC\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"ECSZ\" and \"CZEZ\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"SECZAFVWISMPV\". Since the first 16 letters of the ciphertext are used to decrypt this block, we remove these letters from the ciphertext.\n\nFor Block 2:\nWe write the remaining 16 letters row by row to fill the grid:\n[['B', 'N', 'K', 'N', 'D', 'C', 'O', 'U', 'Y', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'O', 'H', 'L', 'Y'],\n['L', 'L', 'D', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\nWe place the template with holes on the filled grid:\n[['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', 'B', 'N'],\n['', '', '', 'K'],\n['N', '', '', '']]\n\nWe read the letters visible through the holes: \"BNKN\". Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'N', '', ''],\n['', '', 'B', ''],\n['', '', '', 'N'],\n['', '', 'K', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"NBKN\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"KNBN\" and \"NKBK\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"BNKNDCOUYEFGOH\". Since the next 16 letters of the ciphertext are used to decrypt this block, we remove these letters from the ciphertext.\n\nFor Block 3:\nWe write the remaining letters row by row to fill the grid:\n[['L', 'Y', 'L', 'L', 'D', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\nWe place the template with holes on the filled grid:\n[['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', 'L', 'Y'],\n['', '', '', 'L'],\n['L', '', '', '']]\n\nWe read the letters visible through the holes: \"LYLL\". Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'L', '', ''],\n['', '', 'L', ''],\n['', '', '', 'Y'],\n['', '', 'L', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"LLLY\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"YLLL\" and \"LLYI\". However, the last letter \"I\" seems to be an error. Since the letters are filled with filler characters ('#') when the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is likely that the last set of letters should be \"LLY#\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"LYLLD######WT###B####\". Since all the remaining ciphertext is used to decrypt this block, there are no more ciphertext letters left.\n\nPutting all the decrypted blocks together, the final plaintext is: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD\". So the answer is: [[SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD]] ",
