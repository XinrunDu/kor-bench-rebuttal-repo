So this combination doesn't work.\n    - If p = \"-\", q = \"-\", and r = \"-\", then (p∧q∧¬r) = \"-\" ∧ \"-\" ∧ \"+\" = \"-\". Now let's check the other two parts.\n    - (¬p∧q) = \"+\" ∧ \"-\" = \"-\"\n    - (p∨r) = \"-\" ∨ \"-\" = \"-\". So this combination works.\n\n2. (¬p∧q): For this part to be false, either ¬p or q (or both) must be false.\n    - If p = \"+\", q = \"+\", then (¬p∧q) = \"-\" ∧ \"+\" = \"-\"\n    - If p = \"+\", q = \"-\", then (¬p∧q) = \"-\" ∧ \"-\" = \"-\"\n    - If p = \"-\", q = \"+\", then (¬p∧q) = \"+\" ∧ \"+\" = \"+\"\n    - If p = \"-\", q = \"-\", then (¬p∧q) = \"+\" ∧ \"-\" = \"-\"\n\n3. (p∨r): For this part to be false, both p and r must be false.\n    - If p = \"+\", r = \"+\", then (p∨r) = \"+\" ∨ \"+\" = \"+\"\n    - If p = \"+\", r = \"-\", then (p∨r) = \"+\" ∨ \"-\" = \"+\"\n    - If p = \"-\", r = \"+\", then (p∨r) = \"-\" ∨ \"+\" = \"+\"\n    - If p = \"-\", r = \"-\", then (p∨r) = \"-\" ∨ \"-\" = \"-\"\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only combination that satisfies the condition of the overall output being \"-\" is when p = \"-\", q = \"-\", and r = \"-\".
