A song titled \"Try Everything\" promotes a positive and inclusive message that aligns with Zootopia's values, making it a powerful tool for uniting the populace.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are less likely:\n\n* **B. The lion mayor gets a sheep as his deputy:** While this might appease some herbivores, it's framed as a strategic move for votes rather than a genuine act of unity. It's likely to be met with cynicism by some, particularly given the Deputy Mayor's own extremist views.\n* **C. Peddle bonds of atonement:** This option lacks context within the story. We don't know what \"bonds of atonement\" refer to in this world, making it difficult to assess its impact.\n* **D. Expansion of the territory by conquests:** This goes against the message of Zootopia, which promotes cooperation and overcoming primal instincts. Conquest would likely breed division and fear, not unity. \n",

This contradicts the claim that there were no mechanical beings capable of automatic targeting and attack. \n* **Option D:**  The story mentions swords (like Gai Nie's) and other weaponry, implying the existence of iron tools during the Qin Dynasty.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate statement regarding mechanical technology in the context of the story. \n",

The story states that despite the UEG's efforts to debunk the Solar Stability Theory, it still gained traction and led to a three-year rebellion. \n\n* **D. The United Government's proposed plans to address the solar crisis sparked intense debates in the scientific community.** This option is **correct**. The story explicitly mentions that the United Government's plans, particularly the \"Moving Earth\" plan, faced opposition and sparked debates.
