We need to analyze its properties based on the provided logic rules.\n\n2. **Convert to principal disjunctive normal form:** To apply the given rules, we need the principal disjunctive normal form (DNF).  We can obtain this by considering what makes the given CNF formula false:\n    - ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is false for truth assignments: (p=T, q=T, r=T), (p=T, q=T, r=F), (p=T, q=F, r=T), (p=T, q=F, r=F), (p=F, q=T, r=T), (p=F, q=T, r=F), (p=F, q=F, r=T). \n    - Therefore, the principal DNF is: (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (p∨q∨¬r)\n\n3. **Analyze the principal DNF:**\n    - This DNF includes the paired disjunctive term M7 (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) because its false assignment (p=T, q=T, r=T) corresponds to binary 111, which is hexadecimal 7.\n    -  Since the principal DNF contains only M7, the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is an **all-odd formula**.\n\n4. **Format the answer:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **[[E]]**. \n",

Let's analyze why:\n\n1. **Principal Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF):**  PDNF requires the formula to be a disjunction of paired conjunctive terms. A paired conjunctive term must include all propositional variables (or their negations) exactly once, arranged in ascending order. The given formula has conjunctive clauses but doesn't fulfill the criteria for paired conjunctive terms:\n    *  `(p∨r)` is missing `q` or `¬q`\n    * `(¬q∨r)` is missing `p` or `¬p`\n    * `(¬p∨q∨¬r)`  doesn't have all variables in their negated or non-negated form arranged in order. \n\n2. **Principal Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF):** PCNF requires the formula to be a conjunction of paired disjunctive terms. Similar to the above, the given formula's disjunctive clauses don't meet the requirements of paired disjunctive terms.\n\n**Therefore, the given formula does not conform to either the principal disjunctive normal form or the principal conjunctive normal form.** \n",

Since 'y' is not otherwise specified, it remains as 'y' inside the function. \n4. **Predicate Symbol:**  We replace 'F' with its implementation 'FJ(x, y)' which denotes 'x = y'.\n5. **Combining:** Substituting the function and predicate implementations into the original formula '∀xF(g(x,y),z)' gives us  '∀xFJ(gJ(x,y),z)'.\n6. **Final Interpretation:** Since our entity set is natural numbers, we introduce 'x ∈ N' within the formula.

It suggests that if there exists a `b` for which `¬B(b)` and `¬R(b)` are true, then the universal hypothesis `∀x(R(x) → B(x))` holds. This implication doesn't directly address the core issue of the BC Paradox, which is the conflicting confirmations.\n\nTherefore, while the expression relates to the concepts involved in the BC Paradox, it does not represent the paradox itself. \n",
