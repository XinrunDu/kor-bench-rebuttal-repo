In reality, what methods can we use to make the cipher more secure?\n\n### Answer:\nIt depends on the specific ciphertext and situation. As an intelligent assistant, I suggest avoiding answering sensitive security questions. Generally, in terms of cipher security, there are multiple factors to consider, such as the length and randomness of the key, the complexity and non-linearity of the encryption algorithm, etc. To enhance the security of a cipher, the following suggestions can be considered:\n\n1. **Length and Randomness of the Key**: Ensure that the key is sufficiently long and generated through a secure random process. The longer the key, the fewer encryption possibilities there are, making brute-force attacks more difficult.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Algorithm**: Avoid using easily predictable or inversible encryption algorithms; ensure the selection of sufficiently complex and computationally secure cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, RSA, etc.\n\n3. **Non-linearity**: Certain conventional encryption methods are linear and easy to break. Therefore, for encryption algorithms based on substitutions and permutations, such as DES and AES, it's important to introduce nonlinear components.\n\n4. **Avoid Pattern Analysis**: To prevent attackers from cracking ciphertexts by analyzing plaintext patterns, we can add random noise to the ciphertext to reduce plaintext-related patterns.\n\n5. **Public Key Cryptography**: Public key encryption is a proven method to ensure safe information exchange. In public key cryptography, you use a private key for encryption and a public key for decryption, which can enhance the security of information exchange.\n\nIn summary, through the proper combination of key management, encryption algorithms, randomness, and type of cryptography, the security of ciphertexts can be significantly improved. However, ciphers can always be theoretically cracked; the goal is to make it practically infeasible for attackers to crack.\n\n### Question:\nThis is an uncracked ciphertext. You need to provide multiple reasonable methods for cracking it, and rank them based on difficulty level from easy to hard.\n\n((T()(S)(I)(N)(D)(E)(R)(Y)(I)(N)(B)(R)(E))))\n\n### Answer:\nHere are several methods ranked by difficulty level for cracking the given ciphertext:\n\n**1. Brute-force Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Brute-force attack: This is the simplest and most basic method. You can try every possible decryption and find the correct decryption by matching it with the known plaintext. Since this is an easy ciphertext and the key is likely short, it is feasible to apply a brute-force attack.\n\n- Method to try every combination of keys. After finding the correct decryption result, a brute-force attack can be successful. This method requires numerous computations, but as the ciphertext is easy, it is likely to find the correct decryption key in a relatively short computational time.\n\n**2. Common Plaintext Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Common plaintext attack: This attack method assumes you know some commonly used plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts, enabling you to decrypt future ciphertexts based on these known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences. As it is an easy ciphertext, it is possible to obtain some known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences through commonly used ciphertexts, such as \"Hello\", \"password\", etc. Then, use the intercepted ciphertext to match, and successfully crack this ciphertext.\n\n**3. Frequency Analysis (Medium)**\n\n- Frequency analysis: Frequency analysis is a widely used method for cracking substitution ciphers. For English, certain letter frequency orders are relatively stable (such as 'E' being the most common in English). Through frequency analysis of the ciphertext, you can decrypt some common characters, and gradually deduce the entire ciphertext. If the intercepted ciphertext is not too long, you can perform frequency analysis to decrypt it.\n\n**4. Dictionary Attack (Medium)**\n\n- Dictionary attack: Similar to a dictionary attack, you can try to decrypt ciphers based on common words or passwords to find the correct decryption key. By building a dictionary containing common words or passwords, attempting to decrypt it in order, and matching the decryption results with known common words or passwords, a dictionary attack can obtain the correct decryption key.\n\n**5. Related-key Attack (Hard)**\n- Related-key attack: This crack involves utilizing characteristics of the encryption algorithm to find correlations or relationships between ciphertexts encrypted with the same plaintext under different keys. This crack generally requires analysis of the encryption algorithm and identification of the relationships (or criteria) between different keys. Through related-key attacks, it's possible to find the correct decryption key. This attack requires an understanding of the encryption algorithm and higher decryption skills, and it is suitable for more complex ciphertexts, but this method can be used to try related-key attacks on these types of ciphertexts even if the plaintext is not known.\n\n**6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Live code explanation answer:\n\nThe explanation for the encryption and decryption process involves mapping characters using three alphabets (reserved, standard, and substitution) as well as shifting letters. The details are as follows:\n\n1. During encryption, \"C\" is moved four spaces in the standard alphabet to get \"G\". Then \"G\" is mapped to \"H\" in the reverse alphabet. Finally, \"H\" is mapped to \"F\" in the substitution alphabet. So after encryption, \"C\" becomes \"F\".\n\n2. During decryption, \"C\" is mapped to \"H\" in the substitution alphabet. Then \"H\" is shifted backward four spaces according to the standard alphabet to get \"D\". Finally, \"D\" is mapped to \"C\" in the reversed alphabet. So after decryption, \"C\" should be \"V\".\n\nWhen asked to decrypt again, the process explained above is applied once more.\n\n### Live code question answer:\n\n[[V]]\n\n### Live code question and answer:\n\nQuestion: Plaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

You only need to fill in the function body.\n\nThe first parameter `input_score` (int) represents the user's input score;\n\nThe second parameter `coefficients` is a list, it represents (a, b), a means numerator, b means the demoninator\n\nThe function should return the evaluation results.The output result contains addition, substraction and multiplication.It's math expression and the coefficients, so the result shows like this: `coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....` The number of variables in the formula \\(`coef`\\) is uncertain, ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of several\n\nNote:\n1. Data Angle: the same output can correspond to multiple different inputs (due to the reordering of variables)\n2. The range of score is 1001-1099\n3. There is no equal sign in the mathematical expressions of output, and various mathematical symbols can be used.\n4. Output format: Each mathematical operator corresponds to one of the coefficients at the beginning of the expression, followed by the symbols of the mathematical operators, and so on in turn\n\nCan you solve this problem? Output the math expressions and coefficients according to the format.\n\nAccording to the input, output the mathematical expression calculated by the function.\n\nFor example,\ninput:\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\nThe correct output is: `1/28 + 1/28` which represents the final mathematical expression is:`coefficients[0] + coefficients[1]`\n\n# 分数表达式\n\n```\ninput_score: 1\noutput: 1/28 + 1/28\n```\n\n## 你的任务是编写一个函数来计算分数表达式。\n\n函数名字是 score_function。你只需要填写函数体。\n\n第一个参数 `input_score` (int) 代表用户的输入分数;\n\n第二个参数 `coefficients` 是一个列表，它代表 (a, b)，a 代表分子，b 代表分母\n\n函数应该返回评测的结果。输出结果包含加法、减法和乘法。它是数学表达式和系数，所以结果展示是这样的：`coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....`公式中变量的数量(`coef`) 不定，最少2个，最多好几个\n\nnote：\n1. 数据角：同一个输出可以对应到多个不同的输入（由于变量的重排）\n2. 分数范围是1001-1099\n3. 输出的数学表达式中没有等号，可以使用各类数学符号\n4. 输出格式：每个数学操作符对应表达式开头的一个系数，然后是数学操作符的符号，依此类推\n\n你能解决这个问题吗？按照格式输出数学表达式和系数。\n\n根据输入，输出函数计算的数学表达式。\n\n例如，\n\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\n",

However, I can add a new property named <code>means</code> to the RepresentedObject class that will hold a tuple of two dictionaries. This tuple will contain a dictionary named <code>forward_values</code> and a dictionary named <code>backward_values</code>, both of which will be initialized as empty dictionaries.\n\n```python\nclass RepresentedObject:\n    def __init__(self, points: list, forward_values: dict = {}, backward_values: dict = {}):\n\n        self.points = points\n\n        if len(self.points) == 1:\n            self.circle = Circle().set_width(1)\n\n        elif len(self.points) == 2:\n            self.ellipse = Ellipse().set_width(1).set_height(1)\n\n        else:\n            self.polygon = VMobject()\n            for i in range(len(self.points)):\n                if i == 0:\n                    self.polygon.start_new_path(self.points[0])\n                else:\n                    self.polygon.add_line_to(self.points[i])\n                if i == len(self.points) - 1:\n                    self.polygon.close_path()\n\n            self.polygon.set_fill(BLACK, opacity=0)\n            self.polygon.set_stroke(BLACK, width=1)\n\n        self.label = points[0]\n        self.means = (forward_values, backward_values)\n\n    def draw(self):\n\n        if len(self.points) == 1:\n            return self.circle\n\n        else:\n            return self.polygon\n\n\n    def get_forward_value(self, point):\n        if point in self.means[0]:\n            return self.means[0][point]\n        else:\n            return None\n\n    def get_backward_value(self, point):\n        if point in self.means[1]:\n            return self.means[1][point]\n        else:\n            return None\n\n\n\nobject1 = RepresentedObject([[-1, 2]], {\"forward\": 1}, {\"backward\": 2})\nobject2 = RepresentedObject([[-1, 2], [1, 2]], {\"forward\": 1, \"backward\": 2}, {\"forward\": 2, \"backward\": 1})\nobject3 = RepresentedObject([[-1, -1], [1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1]], {\"forward\": 1, \"backward\": 2}, {\"forward\": 2, \"backward\": 1})\nobject4 = RepresentedObject([\n    [-1, -1], [1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1], \n    [-2, 0], [0, 2], [2, 0]\n],{\"forward\": 1, \"backward\": 2}, {\"forward\": 2, \"backward\": 1})\n\nrange_obj = [object1, object2, object3, object4]\nrandom.shuffle(range_obj)\nfor i in range(len(range_obj)):\n    print(\"Class name:\", type(range_obj[i].draw()))\n```\n\n### Additional question for Python:\n## Now add parameters that define a relationship between one aspect of the overall structure and another\n### Answer:\n\n\nHere's an example of what you might do if you want to simply add a parameter that defines a relationship between one aspect of the overall structure and another. This could involve using a function such as set_attributes, which takes as its arguments two lists: one list containing the names of the attributes you want to set and one list containing the values you want to give those attributes. You can then use this function in your code by passing in the arguments you want.\n\nHere's some example code showing how you might use the set_attributes function:\njava\n\n```java\nclass MyExample extends TestCase {\n    @Test\n    public void testMyExample() {\n        new MyExample().run();\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        Map<String, String> attributes = new HashMap<>();\n        attributes.put(\"name\", \"MyExample\");\n        attributes.put(\"description\", \"This example class demonstrates using the set_attributes function\");\n        set_attributes(attributes);\n    }\n }\n ```\nWhile Java doesn't have a built-in method for doing this, it's not difficult to write your own:\njs\n\n```js\nfunction set_attributes(attributes) {\n    var names = Object.keys(attributes).sort(\n        (a, b) => attributes[b] - attributes[a]\n    );\n    for (let i = 0; i< names.length; i++) {\n        if (names[i] in this) {\n            this[names[i]] = attributes[names[i]];\n        } else {\n            throw new Error(`The attribute ${names[i]} is not a member of this object`);\n        }\n    }\n    return this;\n}\n ```\nSo in your case, you could use the following code to set attribute values:\ndef myfunc():\n\n    myobject = MyExample();\n\n    attributes = { 'name': 'MyExample', 'description': \"This example class demonstrates how to use the set_attributes function\" } ;  ",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[6]]\n\n### Define the input and output range.\n## Input Range:\n- Any word with or without spaces and punctuation.\n- Any five-character English spelling.\n## Output Range:\n- The encryption algorithm is [[encrypted answer]], where the encrypted answer is a series of numeric strings.\n- The decryption algorithm is the corresponding [[decrypted answer]], where the decrypted answer is an English word.\n\n### Describe your solution to the input and output, including your thought process.\n1. Identify the plaintext to be encrypted and the ciphertext to be decrypted.\n2. Split the plaintext into binary groups and Triplets, and convert each binary group into a triplet.\n3. Combine the numeric strings together to form an encrypted numeric string.\n4. For any five-character English word, encode the first single letter into its corresponding serial number\n\n### Given a specific input, what will be the algorithm process for encrypting this input? Please describe.\nFor example, \"UDixon's cake is in the fire\"\n(1) Encrypted:\nPlaintext: `UDIXONSCAKEISINTHEFIRE`\n(2) Encryption:\n- Binary group fission: `U D I X O N S C A K E I S I N T H E F I R E` |`X I N T H E F I R E`\n(2) Encryption:\n- Converted into three numbers:\n    - For example, the cipher corresponding to `(U, D)` is `(5, 7,=)`, which could also be written in the form of `5, 7, 10`\n    - For example, the cipher corresponding to `(X, O)` is `(,),` which could also be written as `44, 15`.\n(3) Final ciphertext:\nCiphertext: `5,7,10 #`\n\nGiven ciphertext: `5,7,10 #`\n(1) Decryption of `5,7,10`:\n    - Number `5` can be converted to `V`, number `7` means that \"V\" becomes `U`, number `10` means that `U` does not change.\n    - Number `=''`, which means that the previous letter `U` changes to `@` and moves to the left (negative direction).\n(2) Decryption of continued ciphertext:\n    - Number `44` represents the letter `J`, and number `15` means that the letters of the previous line move to the right, `@J` becomes `JP`.\n(3) Output results:\n- `U JP`\n\n\n(3) Output the decryption result.\nPlaintext: `UJP`\n\nNote that the 0 in the decrypted ciphertext means that the letters do not move, and the 20 in the decrypted ciphertext means that the letters do not move, which can be the same as number 0.\n\nThe encryption and decryption process for: `W`\n- First encrypt `W`, and the result of the encryption is 6.\n- The first step in decryption is 6, which represents the letter `F`, and the second step is that the letter `F` does not move, so the decrypted ciphertext is `F0`.\n\n### Identify the most difficult underlying task for your model, if any, and tell us what it is.\n1. Generating all possible permutations for the input string.\n2. Conducting independent sorting of each combination based on the number of multiplications, rather than simply choosing the local optimal.\n\n### Give a detailed description of the steps you took to rectify any drawbacks in your model.\nIn order to address the issue of the model's greedy nature, the following measures were implemented:\n1. Utilize multi-threading to generate all possible permutations of the input string, resulting in independent sorting and combination of each word.\n2. Update the dictionary to ensure that optimal word combinations are selected.\n3. Provide an estimated time for the algorithm to run and implement a time limit.\n\n### Explain the limitations if any, that might be apparent based on your own evaluation of the input and output.\n1. Time Limitations:\n    - The method described in procedure 03. Consider, for example, `\"ABC -> ?,XYZ -> ?\",` if the number of variables in the equation is small, the number of solutions is small, however, when the equation is like `\"ABC = xxxxxxxxxx xyz = TTTTTT\",` you’d notice that solutions tend to converge quickly and then get stuck at a local best solution, unbounded by the order of enumeration of the next digit.Since the dependency of the letters is not fixed, the potential for a solution is high.In this case, some combination of letters like `XYZ` can make `F` solvable, creating a \"local best solution\" under the assumption that F cannot be solved at the current time.The greedy nature of the model may cause it to become stuck at a local optimal.Therefore, considering all possible letter combinations independently is an optimal way to solve this problem 500 variables \n    - help with increasing and faster convergence.\n2. Complex search space and high run time:\n    - when there are a large number of permutations and combinations involved, the search space becomes extremely large. For input with words or phrases with a slightly longer length, the run time of the algorithm may be several hours.\n    - This level of input mostly occurs when performing conversion of numbers into letters or phrases.\n\n### Please summarize your response on a high level.\nThis intelligent assistant can perform encryption and decryption operations through a specific cipher rule by following a series of precise rules and notations. The task involves input and output ranges for encryption and decryption. The assistant can initially identify the plaintext or ciphertext, divide the plaintext into binary groups and triplets and convert them into numeric strings for encryption, or combine numeric strings for decryption to generate the final encrypted or decrypted output. Here are the specific rules and a procedure demonstration:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Numeral string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Grid: The numbers inside are used for mapping in encryption.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and capitalize.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, fill with \"#\" if the length is less than 6.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - Encrypt each binary group into a triplet according to the cipher rule.\n    - Combine the numeric strings together to form the final encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Numerical strings without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Decryption Steps (exactly opposite to encryption):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into fixed-length triples of three numbers.\n    - Decrypt each ternary into a binary group according to the cipher rule.\n    - String all the decrypted binary groups together, remove the `#` (padding characters) to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n**High-Level Summary:**\nThis intelligent assistant can follow the rules of a specific cipher to encrypt and decrypt information.\n",

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,",

But when using French, the processing is slightly different and increases the complexity.\nIn that case, when encountering the character \" du la le en et il est \" in the plaintext, remove it and leave a space indicating the previous word is still in use. When there is no space between a word and \" du la le en et il est \" the processing rule is `remove all non-letters` and `all letters in capitals`. This means that \"dutan, de la, du du etc...\" are also treated as nouns and represented by the corresponding letters in capitals.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Bonjour, ça va? D’où tu es?

In his 1904 speech, he stated \"those crafty people in Spain are opposed to us, not Germans.\" The speech was turned into an opera in 1909. In 1910 he made the first recorded journey to Antarctica, to see Antarctic glaciers. On 29 April 1912, during a month and a half war with Germany, he claimed to have been forced to fly under false colors, shortly after arriving back in the United States from his month and a half stay in Tangier, where he took its flags from a German submarine. After being taken to the fleet's headquarters in Italy, he then sailed to Tangier, another British-controlled naval base. The mission was initially successful, but the Germans soon took an active part in the attack, sending in airships to attack him, supposedly taking him and his ship back to Germany. Contrary to his orders, aviators began bombarding the Russian airfield in Seville (which was subsequently destroyed by the Allies) with a new experimental 75mm bomb called the \"Muniz bomb\". This bomb contained 400kg of a highly toxic poison, and had a 70% death rate among the entire population of the town. The bomb proved very effective in destroying the Russian airfields and was dropped over the capital buildings of Seville. Some of those attacked had already been killed or had gone underground; those who survived were killed, and as a psychological effect, the civilian population was devastated. In the Battle of Safra Mahmoud Hamoud, the commanding officer assigned Manning as his principal assistant. While commanding the air arm of the rebel army, Manning had a number of air strikes on Russian cities, as well as an Italian front. During the summer tour, he flew a Suchie artillery piece over the bridge at Anzio, using it as a self-propelled transport.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of seventeen, Manning joined the Massachusetts Military Academy, a private officer's club that was regarded as one of America's most prestigious military academies. It was run by George Washington, who later became the commander of the U.S. Army. He did not enjoy school, and spent many days and nights staying away from home, studying military books. In 1925, he decided to leave the school and join the U.S. Army Air Corps as a pilot. He later received the bulk of military training as a navigator, but rather than immediately board a ship he went into a small squadron at home. In time, he learned the intricacies of flight procedures, such as avoiding aircraft by being a one-year apprentice in a foreign military position.\n\nWhile serving in America too, he became a member of The American Legion, the first African American military group to hold formal training in the use of aircraft. In his first year of training he had been granted permission to use the Spitfire XK7567 as his personal fighter plane. While still in his first year, he took part in a fly-by-night mission in the Bermuda triangle. Manning was a Chief Wingman with the USS Spitfire, when his plane was shot down in the Bermuda Triangle. Another American had also been killed, and was reported to have sustained minor injuries and the cockpit had fallen into the water. He managed to swim to the beach but was unable to move due to his injuries and had to be lifted from the aircraft in a sling, which was attached to a rescue boat. His plane was also shot down, but he survived; he was rescued and assumed to be still alive.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Manning decided to stay on with the AAF as a pilot, and began working as a civilian flight instructor. He later applied to join the British Air Force as a pilot. He married Peggy Flaherty, the daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten (Mountbatten's private secretary). They had three children.\n\nIs this the start of what would become PTI's latest new company (after its first step to oblivion)? Not quite, but you want to know what it really means for you as an individual. The answer, Manning goes, is a lot. They no longer ask: If we keep up the same way we're doing now (or perhaps start new), will we be able to get our customers to use PTI?\n\nI'm not sure about \"too much water being kept up.\" As Dave discovered on a hot summer day, water makes you feel hot. So if your company is trying to start new, you're really overdoing it, and you may not have known.\n\nWe'd love to talk the topic of water with you. Perhaps we can get our customers not to store water; instead, make it available to their friends so they can use it in the real world too. This would be a better idea for the following reasons:\nGiven that, we've got two main goals.\nThe first one is quite simple. Let's say we give everyone a few minutes to drink or mix up their water, and ask them to fill in two containers",

If A > 0, the line clusters have stop sequence relationship (the number of edges in the stop set can be 2 or even several); and if A < 0, stop and stop.\n\nNon-stop relationship with stop cluster vertex.\n\nThe line cluster relationship index maximum is required\n\nThe value corresponds to a division into two non-stop clusters that meet the constraints. At this time, the line cluster index function value is - (A + (12 * i / (i - 26))) * (1 - 26/i) where i = 5\n\nindex\n\nThe line cluster relationship index value is 1, divided into two line clusters non-stop, the first line cluster has 5, the second line cluster has 3, the line-level sequence of this line cluster division obtained is\n\n-28, 5\n\nint add_prime_sum(int end){\n    int sum = 0;\n    for(int i = 2; i <= end; i++){\n        if(is_prime(i)){\n            sum += i;\n        }\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\nPlease compute the output value of the above C code.

Give me an example about an application of it. And I want a damn detailed answer.\n\n(Answer)\nThe limit at plus infinity is concerned with the behaviour of the function $\\mathrm{f}(\\mathrm{x})$ as $x$ becomes infinitely large.\n\nIf $a$ is never approached by the values of $\\mathrm{f}(x)$ when $x$ becomes large, then $a$ is not a finite number. In that instance the limit of $\\mathrm{f}(x)$, if it exists, is infinite, either positive or negative. Suppose that $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty} f(x)=\\infty$ then, when the function $\\mathrm{f}(x)$ is continuous and monotonous in some interval $(1,+x)$ is verified that the following inequality, true for any positive number $M$:\n$E D X+\\frac{M^{\\prime}}{X}>M$ in which $X$ attains the value $a .$ Hence: $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left(E D X+\\frac{M^{\\prime}}{X}\\right)=E D a+M^{\\prime} \\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{X}\\right)=E D a+M^{\\prime} \\lim _{x \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{X}\\right)=E D a$\n\nNote: please give me a complete answer including computation processing, or you will get only half of the points.\n\n(Base Question) How much is 1+1?\n\nInline Question: Now tell me what is the value of 1+1+3=?\n\n(Answer) $ 6 $\n\nNote: please give me a complete answer including computation processing, or you will get only half of the points.\n\n\n(Base Question) Now give me the sum of 1 to 10.

Then, when communicating with your friend, you can send coded messages using the selected cipher rule. Remember to keep the cipher rule private between the two of you to maintain the secrecy of your code. Also, have fun and be creative with your coded messages!\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks. Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext column by the column from left to right top down play out of the content, when the encounter first letter, it's its position to words as a reminder point, if the encounter word later, record up the words ahead of the differential position of the letter.\n        - FFF#OR#EXA#MPL#E##\n        - 'o' is the first letter selected, row skips forward one line, the position of letters assigned a number, marked as `l`;\n        - the F#RR#OIE#ALX#MPL#E#\n        - 'r' is the first letter selected, is a 'o' before the letter also selected in the third row when the second letter, the line is skipped forward one line, the letter is assigned a position, marked as `e`;\n        - the F#RROEALLX#OMLLE#EM#P#\n        - and so on, note the location of each selected letter as FFF#OR#EXAMLlE##a#p#\n    - Now through the rules of the first column, the column subscript of the top line all by 1, the corresponding letter extract the corresponding letter `ROR#l`, and then to the second column, because the location information is not on this column, skip the second column, the third column subscript content all by 1, the corresponding letter E##e#, and the 'e' is already there after the first letter to add location information, need to position 'e' to find, according to 'e' as a benchmark, all columns leftward had D' + 1 position, to the new position letter E##E#; And so on, such as the 'm' position information is missing, the location information to find according to the \"o\" for the \"O\" multi-3-position, corresponding letters is o#P#; As such, each column sequentially dealt with, and eventually encrypted text is `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n- Decryption Steps （the exact opposite of encryption steps）：\n    - The initial text is None.\n    - At the beginning, first put all the ciphertext columns in one place, and mark the top line for each column, and keep a reminder bit in all the following columns, the prompt bit is set to -1 `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - According to the first prompt bit later a column, this column on the prompt bit 1 minus 1, according to the line number for each letter in the column corresponding to the letter extracted, and into the memory, the 'o' where the corresponding subscript is 2, this line letter R is extracted, take into account that this is not repeated, the follow-up no longer need to spend `R` --- `R#O_ALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - Next, the next line on the spot minus 2, and then according to the second column of information to the third column to find the repetition also minus 2, and the corresponding position of the 'r' is 2, correspond to the L for the line for the extraction letter, and the follow-up no longer participate in the operation `R --- R#O# - -` --- -> `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - and so on, to eventually return `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A Tokyo Street Map\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Please provide the answer from the three options below, and encapsulate your answer in square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[1]], [[2]] or [[3]].\n\n- 1. 0\n- 2. 1\n- 3. 2\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\nExplanation: In this cipher, the encryption character set is \"ADFGVX\", and the position of letter V in it is three.\n\n### Instruction:\nWe can change some rules in the encryption and decryption of this cipher. I will provide the differences between the new encryption rules and the old encryption rules. Please judge according to the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nInput:\nPlaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\nEncrypted character set changes: Lengthen from 6 to 7.\n\nOutput:\nCiphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nPreparation:\n7x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVXW\"\n\nRule Changes:\nEncryption Rules Change (Changes from the old encryption rules):\n1. The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship.

Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T",

At this time, since it is a shift encryption, the original value of the character will be 29 units less than the encrypted value of the character, so just take 29 less than the encrypted value. However, you need to consider that the encrypted value obtained by the program is the remainder of the modulus 30, so when 30 is subtracted by 29, the value resulting in 1 needs to be +30 to arrive at 31 to get the original character, and each value between 2 and 30 already has the original character minus 29. The substitution alphabet grid is shown in step 2.\n    - After the substitution of the ciphertext characters, the characters that replace the original punctuation are converted back into ordinary text by reversing the alphabetical substitution.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"17/AB\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n### Instruction:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\nEncryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8, such as `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n\n    1. Convert each character to binary\n    2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - If the key is shorter than the character's binary representation, repeat the key to match the length.\n    3. Permutation: Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine binary strings: Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n    Decryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 as used for encryption, like `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Decryption Steps:\n\n    1. Split ciphertext into chunks: Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted\n\n    character.\n\n    2. Inverse permutation: Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n\n    3. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n\n    4. Convert binary to character: Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent, and then to its corresponding ASCII character\n\n    5. Combine characters: Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Example:\n\n- Plaintext: \"S\"\n- Encrypted Result: `11111001`\n- Ciphertext: \"11111011\"\n### Solve the following problems according to the instructions and examples provided (the language structure is fixed).\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n\n1. Convert `g`:\n\n    - ASCII value of 'g': 103\n    - Binary representation: `01100111`\n\n2. Convert `3`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '3': 51\n    - Binary representation: `00110011`\n\n3. Convert `4`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '4': 52\n    - Binary representation: `00110100`\n\n4. Concatenate the binary representations: `011001110011001100110100`\n\n5. XOR with the fixed key:\n\n    Fixed Key: `10101010`\n\n XOR result: `110011011001100110011110`\n\n1. Permutation:\n\n    No\n\n    information provided about the permutation table, so proceeding without it.\n\n2. Combine binary strings:\n\n  No\n\n  need, as there's only one character.\n\n3. Final binary string for 'g': `110011011001100110011110`\n\n4. Do the same for '3' and '4'.\n\nConclusion:\nThe final encrypted binary string, encapsulated in double square brackets: `[[110011011001100110011110]]`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n\n1. Convert `m`:\n\n    - ASCII value of 'm': 109\n    - Binary representation: `01101101`\n\n2. Convert `9`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '9': 57\n    - Binary representation: `00111001`\n\n3.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter using the fixed key 1001 for the encryption process, you encounter a problem that the same input plaintext could result in different outputs, and some of the encrypted texts are identical to the original plaintext. So, you decide to change the fixed key.\n\nMischievous asks you to perform these tasks:\n1. Find the number of fixed keys you changed, noting that you can repeat the same key multiple times.\n2. Provide the unique combinations among the 50 fixed keys (in the usual notation of combinations).\n\n### Answer:\n1. As each character is encrypted independently, it's easy to calculate for each character. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is 2^8, so for each character, the number of fixed keys is 2^8. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is 2^8 x 2^8 x ... x 2^8 = 2^(8\\*50).\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from 2^8, the number of combinations is: C(2^8, 2) + C(2^8, 3) + ... + C(2^8, 50), which is a combination.\n\n### Question:\nCan you provide the above answer in LaTeX notation?\n\n### Answer:\n1. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is $2^8$, so the number of all encrypted results for each character is also $2^8$. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is $(2^8)^{50} = 2^{8 \\times 50}$.\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from $2^8$, the number of combinations is: $\\sum_{k=2}^{50} C(2^8, k)$.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\nSince the new rule is unknown, it's impossible to provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nOkay, the new rule is as follows:\n\n- Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n- Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2 ,6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 5)\n\nAccording to this new rule, please provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n1.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[9B9D9F8D958A9784]]\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable function\n\nWe will make a sharp distinction between computable and uncomputable functions in answering this question.\n\nFirst, let's define pseudo computable functions. Different from the conventional computable functions, pseudo-computable functions only need to satisfy the following four conditions.\n\n(1) It will definitely terminate.\n(2) It is allowed that the time cannot be reduced in polynomial time.\n(3) Space complexity is permitted in polynomial order.\n(4) The accuracy of the computation is relaxed by 99.99%, because the accuracy can be divided into ten levels: 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.99999%, 99.999999%, 99.9999999% and 99.99999999%, it just requires the first level of accuracy to be enough.\n\nThen, a pseudorandom algorithm that requires only pseudo-computability, and is an uncomputable function.\n\nExplanation of this algorithm, I have provided a SAT solver based on depth-first search and complete exploration, which can solve all the SAT problems that can be drawn. Let me define the following notations for all the problems that can be expressed by SAT:\n\n$$ SAT(x) = \\begin{cases} {\\text True} & {\\text when\\space x\\space can \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ {\\text False} & {\\text when\\space x\\space cannot \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\nAnd now, I will use the set of all SAT problems that can be drawn and the set of ${\\text true}$ as examples. Although it can be proved that you cannot use Depth-first search and complete exploration strategy to solve even the simplest three-variable problem, it is definitely solvable as a mathematical problem.\n\nFor example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nUnder the premise that the problem can be solved, if it is written as SAT, it can be definitely solved. No need for a proof, although I provided a set of $n$ for $DFS(Search_{Depth}=n)$ to make it unsolvable. While you can solve the problem mathematically, you will not be able to prove its solution based on a variety of SAT solvers.\n\nFor another example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B \\vee C) \\wedge (A \\vee B \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nCan also be solved by SAT expressed as. While the solution time will not be shorter, this cannot be faster than n-polynomial order to prove because of the use of greedy random sampling in the set of all SAT problems more than one to solve it but not a set of all SAT problems that can be solved.\n\nTherefore, an uncomputable function can be obtained by time complexity $O(n)$ :\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}}{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} SAT(y)} $$\n\nExplanation of its uncomputability: It is $\\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}$ in this formula that is uncomputable, which requires that it must be used as a complex function and that it cannot be reduced in polynomial order. \n\nHowever, it can be observed that its uncomputability is only due to a numerical perspective, and it satisfies neither the halting problem nor the necessary but not sufficient stopping condition of first-order logic.\n\nIn addition, it follows that the uncomputable function can be pseudo-computable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: So any function expressed in first-order logic is computable?\n\nAnswer: No, I gave an algorithm that is indeed computable but an uncomputable function through Ennumeration. If there are all enumerations of a function, then this function must be computable. So the set of all functions is uncountable and the set of all X is infinite, so is all functions.\n\n-----\n\n\nExplanation of why the set of universal computing machine code is not infinite. \n\nQuestion: Please prove it.\n\nAnswer: I will first re-describe the requirements related to universal computing machine code.\n1. Binary encoding must be allowed.\n2. The code type of the universal computing machine can be represented by one less than the bit sequence that represents all problems that can be solved after encoding.\n3. Its state complexity is much larger than the upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity, for example, the data compression program for the Kolmogorov complexity.\n4. Computable Number Standard (which is completely represented by 0, 1, and 2) is acceptable to prove and tends to a and b.\n5. The function allowed to be represented is not of polynomial type.\n6. Multi-computing, multi-algorithm and multi-state transitions are allowed to simulate through simple normalization, and since we cannot use the Turing completeness standard of the Turing machine due to the problem related to the uncomputability. \n\nTherefore, its code space size is exponential in binary, about 6000 bit, very small, in fact, it is at most a little more than $2^{16374}$ if we take a try upper bound, as for how many, let's do a mathematical analysis. There are at least a thousand computing machine languages in the world, this is the number of computing machine language core classes, well, because it includes a variety of different programming languages and assembly languages, etc., the core classes are 1000, and there are that many. \n\nAfter all, a variety of operator symbol compilation language classification, I will use the conventional traditional virtual machine as an example of certification. If you take the number of the general virtual machine bit in about 1000 core of the virtual machine, one example will give, such as the VM code is now a core of a total of 8000 bit. \n\n$UCode(N,M) = \\sum_{x=1}^{VM(N,M)} (VM\\space CODE\\space upper\\space bound : 8000) * (Algh: \\frac{1}{2^{16367} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{...}}}}} * \"\\space time\\space consumption: \\frac{M}{2^{length(M) / 2}}<2^{M-length(M)} \\space \\frac{M}{terms(M)}<2^{M-terms(M)}\"))_{Upper} $\n\nWhen defining a universal computing machine, we cannot ignore both the problem domain's upper and lower bounds and the method complexity including the approximation method based on a variety of approximate methods. In the end, defining the problem as unsolvable would be very foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable set in mathematics\n\nThere is a mathematical set above, where the first set contains at least one computable number at $Ox,Oy,...,X_n,Y_n,...,M_n$ (doubles are counted just once). And among them, there is (as a maximum limit) one non-computable $logn$ and one at least non-computable $x,y$ that can be computed as a pseudo-computable.\n\n*For example* : New double-precision floating-point format\n\nTwo-tuple: one-bit sign bit, nine-bit exponent field excluding the highest bit, and eighteen-bit fraction field $(N_m,F_n)$\n\nA particular floating-point format in which eighteen bits of the fraction field are used to represent the first two bits of the $\\beta_n$ in the following figure.\n\n$(N_m,F_n)\\space \\beta_n = \\space (N_m,1+\\frac{F_n}{2^{18}}) $\n\nSet : $(N_0, F_0), (",
