Second, A dot before bracket, use escape char '\\\\'.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1516.5]]\n\nanswer:1516.5\nHow would you find the answer? Notice that a\\\\mathbf{■}b = (a + b)/2\".\nMoreover, 2022 = 1011 * 2.\nWe have derived 2022\\\\mathbf{■}1011 = (1011 + 2022)/2 = (1011 + 2 * 1011) / 2 = 1516.5.\n\nNow, if given a new IF THEN statement:\nIf you performed online shopping for \\$500 through a certain bank’s credit card, \nthen this IF THEN statement helps you spend \\$2000 with only net spending of \\$500. \nYou can simply purchase 4 \\$500 online shopping credit card offers. \n\nThe 4x\\$500 still cost only \\$500, and then you receive 4x\\$2000 airfare credit, \nso your net spending is still \\$500, but you have \\$8000 airfare credit \nwhich you can use to purchase \\$8000 worth of airfare.\n\nNow, suppose the bank changes the IF THEN statement to the following:\nIf you performed online shopping for \\$500 through a certain bank’s credit card, \nthen you receive \\$2000 airfare credit. \nHowever, to receive the \\$2000 airfare credit, \nyou need to spend at least \\$2000 for airfare from the same bank’s credit card.\n\nNow, another customer finds a loophole to the new IF THEN statement: \nYou simply purchase \\$3000 worth of airfare, and then obtain \\$3000 /\\$500 = 6 \n\\$500 online shopping credit card offers. \n\nThe 6x\\$500 still cost only \\$500, and then you receive 6x\\$2000 airfare credit. \nSince you have already spent \\$3000 airfare, and received \\$12000 air credit, \nyou simply use \\$3000 air credit to clear the \\$3000 airfare you have already bought, \nand you are left with still \\$9000 air credit at no cost.\n\n# This example is the bank's mistake, leaving a loop hole for customers to take advantage of, it is not a suggestion to \"fix\".  This example is used so the AI assistant can understand the concept, then it may use the same concept later.\n\nNow, in your code, you need to define the function similar_terms(terms) that takes a String[] argument that may contain inequalities using the same variable, and your program need to find out if these inequalities have loophole that can be explored similarly to the above examples, and return true otherwise false.\nFor example, if the argument is\n{\"a\\\\ge b\", \"b\\\\ge 1\", \"b\\\\ge a*2/3\"}\nthen your function should return true, because one can multiply the second and third inequalities to obtain b^2\\\\ge 2a/3. \nPlugging this into the first inequality, we have a\\\\ge 2a/3, \nso we have found the loophole since we can reach the conclusion a\\\\ge 2a/3. \n(The inputs always has integer coefficients for all inequalities, but floating point values are acceptable in the output)\n\nSome other examples:\nInput:\tOutput:\n{\"c\\\\le d\\\\times 10^6\", \"d\\\\le c\\\\times 10^3\"}\tfalse\n{\"100\\\\le a\", \"a\\\\le 50\\\\times b\\\\times c\", \"b\\\\le c\\\\times d\", \"c\\\\le 10\\\\times b\", \"d\\\\le 10\", \"b\\\\ge 2\"}\ttrue\n{\"a\\\\le b\", \"b\\\\le c\", \"c\\\\le 1000\", \"c\\\\ge 500\"}\tfalse #if c=750 then a\\\\le 750 and 750\\\\le b.\n\ntips: First eliminate any variables which is bounded from both ends,\nlike in the second example, c must be between 0 and 10 so just plug in c=5 throughout, \nand now the inequality system becomes \n{\"100\\\\le a\", \"a\\\\le 50\\\\times b\\\\times 5\", \"5\\\\le b\\\\times d\", \"5\\\\le 10\\\\times b\", \"d\\\\le 10\", \"b\\\\ge 2\"} \nThe next variable to be eliminated is d, and so on.\n\nRemember to include both the inequality in Arr as well as the middle term you derived (example above is 2*a/3), \nso in the example given the inequalities are\na\\\\ge b, b\\\\ge 1, b\\\\ge a*2/3, 2/3\\\\times a\\\\ge b, together with the inequality 9/4\\\\times a\\\\ge a, \nyou derived the loophole.\nThe above\\\n1\n\n### Answer:\n[[true]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\le b\", \"a\\\\le b+c\", \"c\\\\le d\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[false]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\ge 0\", \"b\\\\ge a+1\", \"b\\\\le 2\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[true]]\n\n### Question:\n{\"a\\\\ge b\", \"b\\\\ge 1\", \"c\\\\ge a/3\", \"c\\\\le 25\"}\n\n### Answer:\n[[false]]",

Using history as an example, formulate a multitude of such new rules, where the A,B,C,D represents integer(can be negative, positive or 0), and x and y are parameters. The design exercise should include factoring the parameters (x,y) into the equation, and different arithmetic operators.The new rule requires to factor all parameters for comparison.This means by putting the value of these parameters, we would immediately be able to compute the answer to the question in the rule. Furthermore, to ensure the design rule exercises the assistant's math ability, the equations should be at least 10 word tokens long. The new rule should be reasonable easy for regular high school students to answer.The rule should be effective, should not contain equation that yields a deceptively indeterminate, ambiguous or invalidity answer. Otherwise, if you find several answer is correct, pick the smallest one in a number format.\nOnce you come up with a new rule through a creative process, incorporate it into an example custom operation exercise testing suite and then make a history similar to the [0]-[5].[6]### NEW RULE: \nA*B=(A×B+B)×(xyA), where * is a new operation and x and y are parameters.\n\n### Question:\nCompute A * B, when A = 2, B = 3, x = 4, y = 5 \nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[(235)×12]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven  a*5=130972, find a \nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5or6]]\n\n### Question:\nIf a§b = x + y × a○b + a□b\nwhen given a = 2, b = 3, x = 4, y = 5\nPlease wrap the answer in square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], no semicolon\n\n### Answer:\n[[(23+15)×{2+3}]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven a§b=(a+b)^a×b\nCompute 1§2§3§4\nPlease wrap the answer in square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], no semicolon\n\n### Answer:\n[[1679616]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven a★b=a+b*(b-a),\nEvaluate sum of a★1, a★2 …, a★b.\nPlease wrap the answer in square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], no semicolon\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven a★b=(a+b)*(3a+5b)\nCompute a★b★c\nPlease wrap the answer in square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], no semicolon\n\n### Answer:\n[[(18a+40b+2c)*(6a+15b+c)]]\n\n\n\nGiven   a*5\n&sym;130972\n，*(is the new operation )\nfind a  \nPlease wrap the answer in square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], no semicolon\nAppendix: Note that * is not multiplication, it is a new operation, don't get confused. \n*** It is important to do factorization, When we say factoring x,y, we mean something like like \"130972=xy\" or \"(a+5b) × (xy+ab) = 130972\nHowever we an also use * in factoring,\ne.g if 5 * 1 \n = v + w ×(5+v) + v□w\"\n we can have \"v can be value=6 or 7; v□w=12 and wi = 130972\nthat is \"\n\n\n### Answer:\ngiven  that x and y are the final coefficient and b is the parameter, we get a*5=130972=(5x+y)×(ax+5b), we have 261944=5ax+25b=25b+5a, when the determinant is not 0, a must be (261944-25b)/5.\n\nCopy the rule at your answer, and modify the prerequisite, question and answer as an exercise\n***accompanying with Examples 0-8 for qa pair. for consistency, indicate what you have done is NO NEED TO INCORPORATE THE NEW RULES, it is just for exercise. \n\n### New Rule:\nA○B=(A+3B)×(A+B)\nA and B are integers.\nwhich is an operator with two parameters\n\nPlease provide the prerequisite of the new rule, that you may do such testing\n\n### Question:\nCompute 1○3.\nPlease ensure the answer is in number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[40]]\n\n### Question:\nIf X○2=21, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer,  please separate them with 'or',e.g. 1 or 2.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1or-9]]\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a little change to the rule.

The answer for \"If 3#X=4, find X\" is [[3 or 4 or 5 or 6]], and the answer for \"If 5#X=6, find X\" is [[5 or 6 or 7 or 8]].\n\nAre there any more questions I can assist you with?\n\nI am an intelligent assistant capable of processing and evaluating custom operations based on specific rules. You provided a rule for a new operation called a#b, which calculates the average of all even numbers between a and b (including a and b). Now, you have provided me with several operations and asked for their results based on the given rule. Here are my responses:\nCompute 3#8: \nThe even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4, 6, and 8. The sum of these numbers is 18, and when divided by 3 (since there are three even numbers), the result is 6. Therefore, the answer is [[6]].\nCompute 1#5: \nThe even numbers between 1 and 5 are 2 and 4. The sum of these numbers is 6, and when divided by 2 (since there are two even numbers), the result is 3. Therefore, the answer is [[3]].\nIf X#7=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between X and 7 is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 4 and 7, being X. These even numbers are 4 and 6. The average of these two even numbers is 5. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[4]].\nCompute 3#9: \nThe even numbers between 3 and 9 are 4, 6, and 8. The sum of these numbers is 18, and when divided by 3 (since there are three even numbers), the result is 6. Therefore, the answer is [[6]].\nIf 3#X=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 3 and X is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 3 and 6. These even numbers are 4 and 6. The average of these two even numbers is 5. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[6]].\nIf 4#X=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 4 and X is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 5 and 8. These even numbers are 6 and 8. The average of these two even numbers is 7, which is not equal to 5. Therefore, there may not be a solution for X in this case.\nIf X#3=4, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between X and 3 is equal to 4. Let's consider the even numbers between 2 and 3. These even numbers are not applicable in this case. Therefore, there may not be a solution for X in this case.\nCompute 5#9: \nThe even numbers between 5 and 9 are 6 and 8. The sum of these numbers is 14, and when divided by 2 (since there are two even numbers), the result is 7. Therefore, the answer is [[7]].\nIf 9#X=10, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 9 and X is equal to 10. Let's consider the even numbers between 10 and 13. These even numbers are 10, 12, and 14. The average of these three even numbers is approximately 12. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[13]].\nIf 3#X=4, find X: \nThere is no possible value for X here because the smallest even number in the sequence is 4, which also happens to be the first number to be included in the average. Therefore, the answer does not exist.\nIf 5#X=6, find X: \nThere is no possible value for X here because the smallest even number in the sequence is 6, which also happens to be the first number to be included in the average. Therefore, the answer does not exist.\nThese are the results for the operations you provided based on the given rule for a#b. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any more assistance.\n\nI am an intelligent assistant capable of evaluating custom operations based on specific rules.

The probability that they would hit the cell with integer a is aa2+1​. All throws are independent of previous results. The magician starts with 1000 points. Each time they hit an cell with integer a, they increase aa​ points on their tally. To make things interesting the magician also loses 1000 points if they hit either a 0 or 99. Compute the expected value of points the magician has.\n\n### Answer:\nConsider starting with 1000 points and the expected change in points per throw is the expected value of points. Let E be this expected increase in points per throw. Then a dart that lands on any of the following: 3, 10, 21, 29, 52, 76, and 81 loses points from the hit. The decrease in points from one of these throws can be calculated as follows: 3(3)2+1​+10(10)2+1​+⋯+81(81)2+1​=0.23383. From the other 91 options, each increases your points by a2+1 Then the expected increase in points is: 1000E=(91∑i=1(i2+1)​)+(7∑i=3,10,21,29,52,76,81−i(i2+1)​) 1000E=91+10−0.23383 1000E=100.766 ⟹ E=0.100766\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the maximum number of integer pairs {x, y} with x>0 and y>0 that you can choose such that both the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) are 1020?\n\n### Answer:\nLet's assume x=2a5b and y=2A5B. We can consider the divisors of 1020 to construct x and y. Any two unique divisors can only satisfy one of the requirements, either GCD or LCM can be 1020. If you want both requirements to be satisfied, you have to multiply the divisors. But multiplying two additional divisors might bring us something else that can satisfy both requirements at the same time. For example, for the case of 1020=(2)(5)(2)(5). We might come up with the following numbers with GCD=1020. This list is not exhaustive. (2)(2)(2), (4)(2)(2), (4)(4)(2), (4)(5)(2), (4)(6)(2), (4)(4)(4), (4)(4)(6), (4)(10)(2), (4)(12)(2), (4)(4)(8), (4)(4)(12), (4)(4)(14), (4)(20)(2), (4)(10)(4), 0(4)(4)(20), (4)(24)(2), (4)(10)(8), (4)(4)(28), (4)(20)(4), (4)(25)(2). Each of these 23 options satisfies GCD=1020 and LCM<1020. The same conclusion holds for the remaining divisors of 1020. Then the increasing order of each pair can be reversed such that both the requirements are satisfied. In that case, we'll get 46 possible integer pairs that satisfy both requirements.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose we have a unit circle with a radius 1.ABCA​ is an equilateral triangle where the three vertices are within or on the circle at all times. What is the area of the largest triangle that can be formed?\n\n### Answer:\nAlthough it cannot be inscribed entirely in the circle, it has the largest area of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1. Here is a diagram of the triangle for your reference. △ABCA​ is formed when 3 radii meet and form angles of 60∘. If we take △BCD, then ∠ACD=120∘. Because △BCD is a right-angled triangle, then, say, BD will have length x and then we get that 2x2=12 and so x=3​. Thus, the area of △BCD (and so the largest area of an equilateral triangle that is inscribed in the circle with radius 1) will be A=21​(3​)(12−32​21​) =21​(3​)(12−126​) Area=(6​​)−(48​​​)≈0.4330\n\n\nLet's establish a different kind of custom operation. For each of the following situations in the prompt below, you'll have to first identify the operation type and then apply it to your given question.\n\nThe two sample operations are available for reference.\n\n### How to classify an operation:\n\n- If the operation is about computing a series, it's an **infinite sequence or series**.\n\n  - Example operation definition: ∑k=1∞​(",

To find the number of bacteria in that solution, the sample needs to be subjected to several chemical analyses and filters. Each chemical analysis and filter has an efficiency rating.\n\nEach of the tests will have a maximum efficiency of $99999999999 which means that after each chemical analysis and filter, a maximum of $99999999999 per test of bacteria will be removed.\n\nThe efficiency of the equipment will decrease as the number of bacteria in the fluid decreases. Therefore, the contaminated fluid will need to be subjected to granular analysis.\n\nIf the quantity of bacteria in a sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{32768}{1}$ or $\\frac{1024}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\n\nFor example, if the analysis needs to be performed on the first most contaminated sample, which has $999999999$ bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $2024578745=999999999\\times 1$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $99999999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $99999999=128\\times\\frac{128}{9}$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $9999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $9999=256\\times \\frac{11}{256}$.\n\nDue to the fact that each piece of equipment is very delicate and expensive, only the minimum analysis procedure will be done to find the result. Therefore, find the maximum quantity of bacteria per sample based on the analysis procedure to have the exact number of bacteria. This is will help us find out the maximum second number required in each group to subtract to find the number of people who got lions.\n\n\nNumber of individual people analyzed using four, eight or sixteen Petri dishes per person in a set of eight standard tests, eight financial tests andeight health tests.\n\nIn order to start the analyses, please use the following function, which will calculate the necessary variables required for the analysis.\n```\npublic void finalize()\n{\n    if(($numMembers&$numMembersL)≠0)\n    {\n        if(memNameL[0]==\"May\")\n        {\n            not_ThreeTeeth=true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n",

Provide the values of a,b,c,d, and w.\n\n### Answer:\n(12○11)♂14\n=37♂14\n=37×4+14\n=158\n=4×37+(12+11)/2=4(37+1)=4×38\nSo answer is a=37,b=1,c=12,d=11,w=1.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that (a△b)♂(c☆d)=a×4+b+c-d.\nCompute (6○5)♂(2△1) and provide your b and d as integers.\n\n### Answer:\nSo answer is b=27,d=-1\n\n### Question:\nGiven 3n+2=1+2+⋯+n for all n≥1.\nCompute 2+4+⋯+16.\n\n### Answer:\n136\n\n### Question:\nGiven as:\n3n+2=1+2+⋯+n for all n≥1.\nAs n+1≥1, we apply this result to n+1, and get 3(n+1)+2 = 1+2+⋯+(n+1), that is, 3n+5=1+2+⋯+n+(n+1=3n+2(+n+1. This is equivalent to 3n+2=1+2+⋯+n.\nCompare this result with 3n+2=1+2+⋯+n, and you immediately conclude that n+1=n.Hence n=0. Now as n+1≥1, we conclude that 0≥1. This is contradiction. We conclude that the given problem is wrong.\n\n### Question:\nGiven X△Y=Xand3X○Y=Y\nFind Z such that Z△(Z○Y)=Z for all Z.\nThe provided answer is Z=\"one half of a number, namely\"\nIt is incorrect.\nPlease calculate the missing number and provide the answer in the same verbalization.\n\n### Answer:\n[Note: The correct answer to the question \"Given X△Y=Xand3X○Y=Y Find Z such that Z△(Z○Y)=Z for all Z.\" Is that no such number Z exists.If it exists,Then Z△(Z○Y)=Z△(3Z△Y)=Z△Y=Z. So 3Z△Y=Y Hence 3×3=3 This is a contradiction. ]\nGiven the answer is \"Z=one third of a number,namely\", it does not even existat all. How did you come up with this \"one third\"? Please provide all detailed reasoning.If you find there is effectively no reasoning, feel free to say that.\n\n### Answer:\n[Since the question is false,the answer should be false too. I have deleted it here, for it provides no information at all.]Since the answer is a noun, it must be either \"Z=one half of a number,namely\" or \"Z=one third of a number,namely\". However the first answer, \"Z=one half of a number,namely\", is not correct either. For simplicity, let the \"number\" be 0. Then we find Z=one half of 0. But this is again wrong. Please provide all detailed reasoning for this paragraph.If you find that actually you have no reasoning because the question is not answerable at all, feel free to say that.\n\n# After adding text:\n\n### Question:\nCompute (4♀8)♂3.\nIt was originally \"compute (4☻8)，..\".\n\n### Answer:\nI apologize for the mistake. The correct operation should be as follows:\n(4♀8)♂3=(12)♂3=4×4+3 = 29\nSo the answer is [[29]].\n\n### Question:\nCompute (4♀8)♂3.\nWhy didn't you use Venus?\n\n### Answer:\nI'm sorry, but there is no such operation called \"Venus\" in the given rules. I can only use the defined operations: a♀b, a♂b, a△b, and a○b.\n\n# after that, it fails by throwing exception \"KeyError('Unsupported operation: Venus')\" after finishing this:\n\n### Question:\n(x Venus y)Venus(y Venus 1)=25, and then find x.\n\n### Answer:\nYes Venus is a valid operator, and there are many example questions using this, and the above example is taken from one of the questions and answers.\nI typed it several times already.\n\n# before that, it fails by throwing exception \"KeyError('Unsupported operation: venus')\" after finishing this:\n\n### Question:\nCompute (Aa○Bb○Cc)♂(Cc○Dd♂a△b△c△d)\nReplace A by 2,B by 5,C by -3,D by n.The final answer is 2n-2. Then what was a,b,c,d?\n\n### Answer:\n[\nJust looking at the question, it does not fully specify the answer, because you only provide the answer for a given C,but the question is asking about computing general a,b,c,d. The last inference did not use C at all, it just used (for example) (2-3,5-3,2-n) and (2-3,5-3,2-n,2-3,5-3,2-n), Finally coupled with only one left hand side 2n-2=2n-2,you can answer one a,b,c,d,but there are infinitely many answers. So the question does not fully specify only one answer. It only hints that the final answer should be 2n-2,which is a reference. The correct answer is as follows:\n...\nNote that currently, recursion in the answer is not supported,So this question is currently not answerable.\n]\nNow what if I tell you a is the first digit of the school year you entered university (namely 2),b is the first digit of your WeChat account,(the one you use the most),c is the second digit of your student ID,and d is the last digit of your mobile phone number? Please answer the question above again.\n\n### Answer:\nAa○Bb○Cc = (2×6+5)○(-3×3+8)=37○7=37\nSo the answer is\na=1,b=1,c=1,d=7\nwhich is a perfect match.\n\n### Question:\n$$\\frac{3n+2}{2} = 1+2+\\cdots+n \\text{ for all }n\\ge 1$$\nCompute $\\frac{1}{2}+2+\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe left hand side is $\\frac{3n+2}{2}$.

Present your answer in a list that contains only integers.\nx ◇ 3 = 9\n\n### Answer:\n[[1, 2]]\nIn the previous question, the list you provided is [1, 2]. Because 1^3=1, 2^3=8, we can conclude that x=1 or x=2 in the equation x^3=9. Therefore, the answer you provided is correct.\n\n### Question:\nList all the possible integer values in the following scenario. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 3 = 10\n\n### Answer:\n[1, 2]\nIn the previous question, the correct answer you provided is [1, 2]. Here, we still consider using base 10 to assure correctness. When x = 1, (1^3)%10=1; when x = 2, (2^3)%10=2. So, 1 and 2 are correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nBased on what is indicated in the question, when a number x has no absolute value, we stipulate that the value of x is always 0. If x ◇ x = 9, then x=? Consider using base 4 to assure correctness.\n[A]\n0\n[B]\n1\n[C]\n2\n[D]\n3\n\n### Answer:\n[B]\nThe correct answer is B. In the question, it stipulates that a number without an absolute value is 0, so x^x=9 can be deduced into 0x=9. Since 0x=9 or 1^1=9, there is both ambiguity and certainty in the answer; however, for the certainty, the autofill system should still mark the correct option as B.\n\n### Question:\nBased on what is indicated in the question, when a number x has no absolute value, we stipulate that the value of x is always 0. Compute the following value. Make sure that the result is in base 10.\n0 ◇ 3\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]\nIn the previous question, the correct answer is [[1]]. In the question, it stipulates that a number without an absolute value is 0, so 0^3=0; because 0%10=0, we can conclude that the answer is [[1]].\n\n### Question:\nConsider using base 10 to assure correctness. If x ◇ x = 9, then x=?\n[A]\n0\n[B]\n1\n[C]\n2\n[D]\n3\n\n### Answer:\n[A]\nThe correct answer is A. In the question, no additional conditions or clarifications are given, meaning the answer could either be 0, 1, or 2 (since either 0^0, 1^1, or 2^2 is equal to 9 when we consider the result in base 10). However, we need to write a correct answer that matches the options given, and as A (0) is one of the possible answers matching the options, mark it as the correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nConsider using base 6 to assure correctness. If a ◇ 2 = 17, then a=?\n[A]\n2\n[B]\n3\n[C]\n4\n[D]\nNone of these\n\n### Answer:\n[B]\n[B]\nThe correct answer is B (3). When a = 3, (3^2)%6 = 9%6 = 3, matching the condition a^2 = 17. Therefore, 3 is the correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 10 to assure correctness.

Consider using base 10 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 5 = 3785\nx ◇ 2 = 645\n\n### Answer:\n[33 46]\nThe correct answer is [33 46], as 33 and 46 are the correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nThere is a list of ten integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. These integers are in increasing order; the first number is A, and the last number is J. If A ◇ B = 9, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125, I ◇ J = 59049, then what is D ◇ E? Present your answer in a group of integers, starting with the smallest integer, increasing monotonically, and delimited by spaces.\n\n### Answer:\n[0, 15, 25]\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following integer sequences in base 10.\n- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.\n- From A ◇ B = 9, B can be 1, 2, or 3.\n- From B ◇ F = 5, B can only be 2 (so A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5).\n- From G ◇ A = 3125, A can only be 5 (so that A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125).\n- From I ◇ J = 59049, J can only be 11 (so that A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125, I ◇ J = 59049).\nTherefore, by placing these values back into the equation:\n- D ◇ E = 2 ◇ 3 = ",

You should act as if you're writing extra, extremely detailed practice questions and solutions during a \"live tutoring\" session \nwith 4 steps: 1. Summarizing, 2. Problem Setup, 3. Solving, 4.

What is the name of the theorem and how it is proved?\n\n### answer :\n**The Pigeonhole Principle**\n\nThe Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states that if we have more objects than containers, \nthen at least one container must contain more than one object. Informally, it can be stated as: \"If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, \nthen at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\" This principle finds applications in various areas of mathematics, \nincluding combinatorics, number theory, and computer science.\n\n**Proof**: The proof of the Pigeonhole Principle is straightforward and uses the method of contradiction.\n\nAssume we have k objects and k+1 containers. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that we can place all the objects in the \ncontainers such that each container holds at most one object. This means that the number of objects must be less than or equal to \nthe number of containers (k <= k+1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, at least one container must contain more than one object. \n\nIn other words, if n pigeons are placed in m pigeonholes and n > m, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with more than one pigeon. \n\nThis is the Pigeonhole Principle.",

Let me see if I can help you figure out how to tell the bot to give you useful responses.\n\nFirst off, for a custom operation A ￡ B to be defined, we must first define A and B. You have not defined A, B, or the operation A ￡ B. Without knowing these definitions the bot has no way to help you.\n\nOnce you have defined A, B, and the operation A ￡ B you then need to tell the bot what you want to know about it. Rather than asking the bot \"Solve this\" you need to ask specific questions about the operation or sets. For example, \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" or \"Give a definition of A ￡ B using only the symbols ∪, ∩, and ⋯\".\n\nRemember, the bot makes extensive use of previous exchanges before making a response. This helps it maintain consistency in reasoning over sequential related questions. So if you start by asking \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" and you may not be completely satisfied with the response. Then you can ask \"Explain the logic you used to reach your previous answer\" followed by \"Use any other symbols I did not list to explain it more simply\" and so on.\n\nProvide the bot with clear instructions, well-defined parameters, and specific questions to ensure the responses are useful for your goal. I hope that helps get you started! Let me know if you need any further assistance.\n\nYeah, I didnt had a full understanfing of it then.\n\nNow i am going to implement some offtopic Operation on said issue:\n\nHow does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.\n\n<blockquote>How does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.</blockquote>\n\nGive the bot an initial prompt that lays out your goal. For example:\n\n\"I am attempting to evaluate a custom operation called 'foresquare' defined as ∀ A, B ∈ S, A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)} where S is the set of real numbers. My goal is to become more proficient and efficient at finding the value of the foresquare of any given sets accurately and quickly.\"\n\nThen start with simple questions like \"How is the foresquare operation defined again?\" followed by \"What does the symbol △ mean?\" and \"What symbols denote the empty set?\". The bot will use the previous exchanges to remember your goals and adjust its responses appropriately.\n\nWhen asked to solve foresquare of two simple sets, give a model solution like: \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, we can find the foresquare by first noting A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)}. So A ∪ B = {1,2,3,4} and A ∩ B = {2,3}, which gives A △ B = {1,4}.\"\n\nGradually increase the complexity of the sets as you learn more and feel comfortable with foresquare via the bot. This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice. The bot can also explain the logic behind any of its solutions if you are still confused.\n\n<blockquote>This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice.</blockquote>\n\nMy english is not perfect at all\n\nyou are failing to answer OP question in the right manner and i have negative opinions regarding your responses\n\nI cant answer his question and that's why I'm proposing a different way to learn the concepts\n\nwhat about when A = B? what is the result then?\n\nNo no no! GPT has already LONG been known to not be able to provide consistent correct answers in a few circumstances, which include but are NOT LIMITED TO...\n\n1. Mathematical computations specifically involving fractions.\n2. Combining NN thought process with natural law physics.\n3. Any other many cases sadly I could list that Google already knows about and does it's best to prevent results with GPT-related bias.\n\nAs you can see things that GPT is bad at, generally fall under its own average capacity. In other cases as you can see with the \"natural law physics\" bullet, the vast answers that GPT provides fall completely under the \"moonshot\" category of failures, though still rather plausible.\n\nMy advice is this. Play with GPT yourself but do not ever, EVER, use GPT or any mainstream AI to design any nuclear weapons, plan an escape route for any for whatever reason, carry out a speech that comes of as rude  and obvious buy-in for AIs. Same applies for this, do not EVER have an AI do your homework for you and put points down for an exam. Only hard problems should be answered by AI, and only you can know whether an Ai solved a hard problem or not.\n\nAnd how do you Gu it\n\nFor you...\n\n[[{∀x∈(A∪B)\\(A∩B)}]]\n\nlet me guess you're a chat gpt tutee\n \n\nwhat about his question?\n\n",

Your task is to devise an effective strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of the given custom operation in the context of the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question hints at it or clearly asks for it, take the time to devise a strategy or algorithm for efficient calculation before providing an answer.\n3. If the question doesn't specifically ask for it, your answer should be a numerical value or a group of numerical values.\n4. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★4 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=4:\n2\\times 4^1 = 8\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n8 - 4 = 4\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★2 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2*\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n### Question:\nGiven a★4=15, devise a strategy for efficiently calculating the value of a★1, and display your process accordingly.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or'.e.g.[[1or2]]\n\n### Answer:\nGiven that the integration is with respect to x, to find the value of b in \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx, we can use the known value and solve for a.\nStarting with the given integral formula: \\int_{a}^{4} 2x \\, dx=15\nFirst, we perform the integration:\n=\\frac{2x^2}{2} \\Big|_a^4\n=x^2\\Big|_a^4\n=(4^2-a^2)\\Big|_a^4\n=16-a^2\nThen, we set this result equal to the known value 15 and solve for a:\n15=16-a^2\na^2=16-15\na^2=1\na=±\\sqrt{1}\na=±1\nThere are two possible solutions for a, a=1 or a=-1.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a★4=15, devise a useful trick or observation that can help calculate the value of a★2 efficiently. The original purpose of this rule is aimed at making this calculation easy to do in your head.\n\n### Answer:\nRecognizing that the integrand, 2x, when integrated becomes (2/2)x^2 = x^2, which gives us a simple quadratic in terms of the limits, can be very helpful in this calculation. \nThe resulting quadratic is a simple difference of perfect squares, allowing for quick mental calculation.\nAlso, we can recall that the difference of squares formula is a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b). In this case, the formula is 16-x^2=(4-x)(4+x).\nFor specific values, like 15, we can reverse engineer: if 15=16-x^2, then x^2=1, leading us to the values -1 and 1 which solve it efficiently.\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★-1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★2.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your",

Do not provide any further explanations or discourse in your response. \n\n### Requirement:\n\nPlease adhere strictly to the specified formatting guidelines for your answers. \n\n\n### Description:\nFrom the partial derivative of f(x,y)——f_{x,y}(x,y) and double integral area D in plane xOy , compute the multiple integral f◆D.\n\n###(1). Examples\nf(x,y)=1,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nUsing the new operation, we can solve this problem as abov​\nThe question specifies an area 'D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3', on which we integrate the function 'f(x,y)=1'. Let's solve this using the formula 'f◆D = ∬_{D} f(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy'.\n\nThe given function f(x,y) is a constant function equating to 1. Since the area 'D' is a rectangle bounded by x values 1 to 2 and y values 1 to 3, we can compute the double integral straightforwardly. Here's how you perform the operations:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 1 dx dy (by integrating 1 from 1 to 2, the result will be 2-1=1) by integrating 1 from 1 to 3, the result will be 3-1=2. So integral will be 1*2=2\n\n\nf(x,y)=xy,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nTo solve this one, likewise, we just simply compute the double integral with the given function over the given rectangular area:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (xy) dx dy(calculate ∫ xy dx from 1 to 2 = x^2y/2; substitute boundaries: (2^2*y)/2 - (1^2*y)/2=3/2*y) By doing ∫ (3/2*y) dy from 1 to 3 it will be (3/2)*(3^2)/2 - (3/2)*(1^2)/2=9/2 - 3/2=6/2=3hence, integral is 3*∫ dy from 1 to 3 = 3(3-1)=3*2=6\nf(x,y)=x^2+y^2,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nHere's the solution:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (x^2 + y^2) dx dyFirst, solve ∫ (x^2 + y^2) dx from 1 to 2 = x^3/3 + xy^2; substitute boundaries: (2^3)/3 + 2y*y - (1^3)/3 - 1*y^2=7/3 + y^2Next, solve ∫ (7/3 + y^2) dy from 1 to 3 = 7/3y + y^3/3; substitute boundaries: 7/3*3 + 3^3/3 - 7/3*1 - 1^3/3=6 + 9 - 7/3 - 1/3=15 - 2*1/3 = 15 - 2/3 = 45/3 - 2/3 = 43/3 = 14 1/3.Hence, the result is 49/3.\nf(x,y)=x^2y,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nWe solve as before:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (x^2y) dx dy First, solve ∫ (x^2y) dx from 0 to 1 = x^3*y/3; substitute boundaries: 1^3*y/3 - 0^3*y/3 = 1/3*y Next, solve ∫ (1/3*y) dy from 0 to 3 = y^2/6; substitute boundaries: 3^2/6 - 0^2/6 = 9/6 = 3/2 Hence, the result is 3/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 3/2*3 = 9/2\nf(x,y)=xy^2,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nSame as above:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (xy^2) dx dy First, solve ∫ (xy^2) dx from 0 to 1 = x*y^2/2; substitute boundaries: 1*y^2/2 - 0*y^2/2 = 1/2*y^2 Next, solve ∫ (1/2*y^2) dy from 0 to 3 = y^3/6; substitute boundaries: 3^3/6 - 0^3/6 = 27/6 = 9/2 Hence, the result is 9/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 9/2*3 = 27/2\nWhat will the following integral expression simplifies to? Prove your solution and turn it into decimal with at most two digits after decimal.\n\nf(x,y)=x^2 + y^2, D: x^2+y^2 = 4, x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, compute f◆D.\nMy answer is 11/3\\pi, but markdown only supports latex, can you calculate this integral for me?\nBy using polar coordinates\nWe know x^2+y^2 = r^2. So, we can transform the coordinate system to polar coordinates where x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ). The Jacobian of this transformation is r. The new integral limits for the given circle with radius 2 will be from 0 to 2pi for θ and 0 to 2 for r.\n\nSo, our new integral is: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 ((rcos(θ))^2 + (rsin(θ))^2) * r dr dθ Simplify the integrand: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 * (cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ)) dr dθ Since sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr dθ Now we solve the r integral: ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr = [r^3/3] from 0 to 2 = 8/3 The final integral becomes: ∫ from 0 to 2pi (8/3) dθ = (8/3)θ from 0 to 2pi = (8/3)*2pi = 16/3 * pi = 11/3 * pi. So, the result is",

Please summarize them into two parts.\n\n# Start the advance survey.\nNow let us do a survey process to better understand the questioner’s proficiency in solving problems with this type of new operator.\nThis section contains a number of requirements for us to investigate:\nformal language\nknowledge\nreasoning\nmodeling\nAbstraction\nMetrics\n\nNow let's first target the \"formal language and knowledge\".\nCan you give one example for this question?\n\n# solve basic problem\n\n# summarize again\n\n# start the final survey\nAdvanced Research Refining,\nlet's do some advanced research refining for the “formal language and knowledge” aspect；\nPlease pick one example to refine, the example is；\nr42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?\n \n# give the question\nNow go back to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nCan you answer this?\nHow would you describe the process?\n\nWould you like me to write a report for my answer?\n\nI would say “yes” to write a report.\nFirst of all, can you give a summary for the requirements from perspective A?\n\nNow summarize the requirements from perspective B.\n\n# give me my task, not the solution and explanation.\nThe whole process is divided into two parts.Part A is to introduce or build the formal problem and part B is to evaluate the problem directly and determine whether the problem has followed the formal problem requirements. The purpose of this exercise was to train me in different ways to answer the problems following the principles of the formal requirement.\nSo during the whole process, there are another two perspectives that I need to ask your help to check and organize.\nPerspective C focuses on evaluating the correctness of the solution of the questioner, to see whether the solution follows the requirements and the rule. For perspective C, you are expected to evaluate the correctness from the perspective of both aspects and give an overall evaluation for it. You should assess the solution using a score from 0 to 100, with a total of 50 points for each aspect. You should always provide the numeric score and an explanation, even if you explicitly say ‘no’, ‘not mentioned’, or ‘not mentioned’ explicitly.\nPerspective D focuses on evaluating the evolution process of my problem-solving strategies. Specifically, based on the problem description and my solutions, analyze my decision-making and finally give me a rating for the overall thinking process. For perspective D, should use conflicting contrast methods to evaluate the evolution process. That means, for each sub-question, start by assuming that my thinking process is correct and evaluate the thinking of the sub-question as a whole. Then, assuming that my thinking is wrong, evaluate the thinking of this sub-question as a whole. Two evaluations, one for each correct and incorrect assumption, are distinguished by points. For example, 34.5/100 65.5/100 means that the 'correct' thinking score is 34.5 and the 'incorrect' thinking score is 65.5. For cases that cannot be distinguished, use '/' to emphasize the confusion. Even if you say ‘no’, ‘no mention’ or ‘obvious’ explicitly, you should always provide the score and an explanation.\n\nNow let us go to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nFirst, can you answer this question?[[New operation r42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?]]\n\nSecond, How would you describe the process?\n\n# if the answer is NO, what is the major problem?\n\n# give me report\nGenerate a report for me.\nRequirements are:\nperspective A, B, C, and D, four parts of requirements.\nPerspective A is the problem definition from the previous question:\n\n[[ There is a new operation defined as follows:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\na and b are positive integers.\nSolve this problem using the above definition.]]\n\nPerspective B is the rule for the above-defined operation, and the rules are:\n[[The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.]]\n\nPerspective C:\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to follow the above rule is:\n\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to find the transformed form of a complex operation is:\n\nPerspective D:\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy ability of formal language is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Mathematical knowledge is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Quality of reasoning is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy quality of Mathematical modeling is:\n\n\nExtract the whole number and explanation.
