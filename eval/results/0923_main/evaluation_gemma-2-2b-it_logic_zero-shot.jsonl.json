The phrase \"cannot necessarily\" implies a degree of possibility.\n\n* **Analyzing the Formulas:**\n    * **Formula (2):** #p and #¬p \n    * This formula suggests they cannot both be true and it gives the sense of both statements leading into a possible conclusion.\n* Other Formulae Fail to Cover the Logic \n\n    * **(1)** This formula represents a necessity if p is true.
