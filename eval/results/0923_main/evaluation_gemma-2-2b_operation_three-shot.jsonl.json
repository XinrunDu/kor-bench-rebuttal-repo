So, we write the answer as **25** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the second question, 2∞5 is equal to 4+25, which is equal to 29. So, we write the answer as **29** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the third question, if X∞4=32, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=32, which simplifies to X^2+16=32. Rearranging gives **X^2=16**, which has two solutions, x=4 and x=-4. However, since the question asks for the number that must be used for the calculation and not for the values of X, we can only use X=4. So, our answer is just `4`.\n\nFor the fourth question, if 3∞X=18, we can rewrite the expression as 3^2+X^2=18, which simplifies to X^2=15. Rearranging gives **X=sqrt(15)**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the fifth question, if X∞4=256, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=256, which simplifies to X^2+16=256. Rearranging gives **X^2=240**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the sixth question, if 2∞X=104, we can rewrite the expression as 2^2+X^2=104, which simplifies to X^2=100. Rearranging gives **X=10**. Or **10**(sqrt(10)). Again, these are both solutions to the expression, but be careful which one you choose for the operation since the result of the assessment depends on it. Here, the precise number is required when the operation is done.\n\nNext step: `3∞X=4´```\n\n#1 :\n\nThis is the answer for third and sixth questions : `4, 6, 10`(or `10, 6`) are the valid solutions of X∞4 = 32. The others will give *Unsupported error: Invalid square root* for X2 = 32, which would lead to a wrong result for your final result ( e.g. 3∞4 = 5 ) because of Sqrt function call.\n\nThe X2 = 32 is achieved by setting the **X** value to 4 ( answer for (b)) or 8 ( answer for third question ).\n",

It is a significant contribution that leads to a significant advancement or change in a field or topic. \n\nOne of the key aspects of a research paper is its citation format. This helps to establish credibility and to ensure that the literature that is cited is accurate and current. There are various citation formats, and among the most common and widely used is the Harvard Referencing format. This citation format gives credit to the author of the source and the year the material was published. \nIn this format, authors’ last names and publication dates are used, with the reference being listed at the end of the text. For example:\n\n(Wright, 2017) \n(Wright and Smith, 2012) \n(Wright, Smith and Johnson, 2010)\n\nThe Harvard Referencing format can be more complicated than the author-date format. It requires authors to submit their dissertations or research papers for independent expert review, similar to the Scholarly Open Access Journals peer-reviewed system. However, it can be a valuable tool for establishing credibility and for ensuring the integrity of the literature that is cited.\n\nReference\n\nWright A. (2017).

Find m, given that 3^m+2^m=p, where 2^p-p^2=18.\nThe answer should only be given as a positive integer.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[11/16]]\n\n### Question:\nThe equation 2^n+6^n-126=30 is true for two distinct positive integers n.\nCompute their sum.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[18]]\n\n### Explanation to determine the value of m :\nThe question states that 3^m + 2^m = 30, and 2^p - p^2 = 18. We need to find the values of m and p that simultaneously satisfy both equations.\nFor the first equation, we can rewrite it as:\n2^m * 3^m = 30\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\nm * log2 + m * log3 = log30\n\nSince log2 and log3 cannot be combined with log10, we can consider log2 = a and log3 = b:\n\na + b + (m * a * b) = log30\n\nSolving for m, we get:\nm = ((log30)/(a + b) - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the second equation to find the sum of m, pi, and p:\nsum = m + pi + p\n\nSince pi cannot be expressed in terms of only natural logarithms, we cannot find the value of pi directly. However, by using the relation between a and b (a = log2 and b = log3), we can simplify the equation using logarithmic identities:\n\nlog2 * log3 + log2 * a + log3 * a = log30\nlog2 * (log3 + a) = log2 + log10\n\nSubstituting the expression for log2, we obtain:\n\n(b + a) * (a + b) * a = log10 - (b + a)\n(b + a) * (2ab + a^2) = log10 - b - a\n(b + a) * (2ab + a^2 + b + a) = log10 - b - a + b + a\n2ab + ab^2 + a^3 = log10\na^3 + (2ab + ab^2) = log10\na^3 + a(2b + ab) = log10\na(a^2 + 2b + ab) = log10\n\nSince a^2 + 2b + ab = 1, we have:\na^2 + 2b + ab = a(a^2 + 2b + ab)\na^2 + 2a + 2b = 0\n\nSolving for b, we get:\nb = (1 - a)/2\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of b in the expression for a^3 + (2ab + ab) and simplify:\na^3 + a((1 - a)/2 + a) = log10\na^3 + a(1 - a^2 + 2a) = log10\na^3 + a - a^3 + 2a^3 = log10\n3a^3 = log10\nsolving for a, a = ((log10)^(1/3))\n\nFrom the relation between a and b (a = log2, b = log3), we can find b:\nb = (1 - a)/2 = (1 - (log10)^(1/3))/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these values of a and b in the expression for the sum (m + p + pi):\nsum = m + p + pi = (log10^(1/21) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10^(1/6) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10^(1/3) - (log10)^(1/3))/2\nsum = ((log10)^(1/21) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10)^(1/6) - (log10)^(1/3)\n\nThis is the final value of the sum.\nNOTE: You can evaluate the equation any way you like. At the end, you should just end up getting another expression that can be simplified further.",

Therefore, we should consider if there is an answer that follows the rule and hides the root.\n\nWe can refer to known cases with roots:\n\na^b = \\sqrt[b]{a^b}\na^{b+\\c{n}} = \\sqrt[b]{a} * \\sqrt[b]{a^{b+\\c{n}-\\c{1}}}\na^{b+\\c{2}} = \\sqrt[b]{a}\\sqrt[b]{a^{b}}\n\nIn this case, if a=b, then we'd have 3^3=3 to prove:\n5=\\sqrt{3+3}\\\\\n5=\\sqrt{6\\\\\nTherefore, 5 is a 4%3.\n\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\frac{15+\\sqrt{75}}{2}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {5*4} = 25+\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{5+4}+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2} =\\sqrt {20+\\sqrt {20}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {4}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt {20-2\\sqrt {}}{20-2\\sqrt {5}}}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt { 45-14\\sqrt {5}}}\n\n25+\\sqrt {16} = 36\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{25+\\sqrt{20+\\sqrt{20}}}\\sqrt{\\sqrt { 5}+{\\sqrt {4}}}=\\sqrt{\\sqrt {25+5+2\\sqrt{5}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{\\sqrt{30+\\sqrt{60+20}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt {\\sqrt 60+4+2\\sqrt4 +2\\sqrt(5*\\sqrt2)}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt 6}=3\\sqrt{\\sqrt {15}+2\\sqrt3+{2\\sqrt2}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt 15\\\\\n36 = 6\\sqrt5\\text{ ans.}\\sqrt{30+6\\sqrt 5}\n\nNow, 16%8 should be 0 and 16%6 should be 3.\n\n- Therefore, the answer is 3+\\sqrt{15}.\n\n- 16%1 should be 4, 16%2 should be 64 and 16%1 should be 64.\n\n- 16%5+5 should be 25+\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt {5+4.} Multiplying the number on the top can produce `25+5`, which is indeed proven in the above work.\n\nThe best answer is `5-+-\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {\\sqrt {45-14\\sqrt {5}}}.\\text{With the first answer, take the value as 64, then multiply the two terms to get back to the original result.\n\n###### Solution 2:\n\nIn this question, the root of the answer is 2. Based on this result, the answer should look like:\n\n3+\\sqrt{2}\n\n3 is mulitplyied by the root 2, which also equals 2, ensuring that the given equation is valid.\n\nSince 16%4=0 and 16%6=3, the answer would be `[[2+\\sqrt{16-6}]]`.\n\nHowever, we should write it in the form `[[2+\\sqrt{x}]` `[[16-x]] The second problem:\n\n4%2 =  4 * 2 - 2^{4-1} = 8 - 16 / 3\n\n4%1 =  4 * 1 = 4\n",

To express negative values, it is necessary to cover the original number with a minus symbol, so please pay attention.\n\nPlease align all parts of your answer in terms of the question number. Your answer should be written in a form that is both easy to read and easy to understand by other people. This rule specifically indicates that the answer only needs to meet the default number of characters; however, please make sure to wrap the answer in a bracket as explained earlier.\n\n### Submission format:\n\n- You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n- You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n- You may accept the original question (including \"answer\") in the first portion of the question box.\n- You are to prepare 3-7 responses.\n- You are to identify the format of the correct answer.\n- You are to adhere to the rule specified in the Question section.\n- You are to provide only the question number. If not applicable, you must write \"none.\".\n\n## Detailed Explanation:\n\n> 1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n\nIn the Question section, we are explaining the \"operation rule\". You will need to apply this rule exactly to solve the given question.\n\n> 2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n\nYour answer, as well as our answer, should be a number or a group of numbers. Double-check this step.\n\n> 3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nUpon receiving your answer, you should double-check it carefully a of least 4 times. This part is very important, so please take it seriously.\n\nThis rule is related to finding \"solution x\" in the given question. You will need to write the correct answer in the format provided, which has four parts:\n\n> Part 1: Clearly explain the \"operation rule\".\n\nExplaining the \"operation rule\" is crucial, as it will provide you with the necessary understanding of the rule and how to apply it to solve the given question correctly.\n\n> Part 2: Provide an example of your own.\n\nPlease provide a specific example to demonstrate your understanding of the \"operation rule\" and its application. This example will serve as reference for future calculations.\n\n> Part 3: Explain whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A.\n\nIt is crucial to determine whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A. Consider the example below.\n\nOperation Rule: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nOperation X: (1◎2)(3＋4)-(6◎1)\n\nFor this example, \"Operation X\" is not a valid substituted method for \"Operation A\". Therefore, we should proceed as follows to find the value of \"X\":\n\n(1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(8×2)(7)=(16×7) = 112\n\nThen, simplify the right side of the equation: (61x+2)◎(3◎7) = (61x+2)●(21) = (1261x+42)\n\nEquate the two sides and solve for \"X\":\n\n(16×7) = (1261x+42)\n\nSolve for \"X\":\n\nx = (16×7-42)/(1261)\n\nx = 86/1261\n\nx = 4/63\n\nTherefore, in this example, \"Operation X\" cannot be substituted for \"Operation A\".\n\n> Part 4: Clearly explain the method you used to find the correct answer.\n\nFinally, clearly illustrate the methods used to find the correct answer. This part will help readers understand how to solve similar problems in the future.\n\n##### Submission\n\n> You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n\n> You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n\n> Simplification with the rule for finding \"solution x\" and check the correctness through real calculations.\n\n##### Example:\n\n<a>\nThis is a simple calculation that directly satisfies the expression and achieves a correct result.\n\n<b>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2710, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(4◎1)+(2◎3)=[[10+20i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Answer\n\n$[[10+20i]]$\n\n<b\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2709, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[[3-4i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Explanation:\n\n①\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2716, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(1◎3)+(X◎2)=-8+14i\n②\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2718, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[61x+2]−[6x+2]\n③\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2726, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[41x+1]−[4x]+2\n④\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2738, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(4◎1)-(2◎2)]\n⑤\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2744, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(2◎1)+(1◎2)]−(2◎2)\n⑥\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2752, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=2+1−2\n⑦\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2766, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=1\n⑧\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2770, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×2]\n⑨\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2777, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[4－2]\n⑩\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2782, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×1]\n11\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2784, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2－2]\n⑫\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2790, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=0\n13\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2799, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[1×2]\n14\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2804, {level:1,limit",

This means that the operation [f▽g](f▽g)▼g will add g'(x) to f(x).\n2. **Ask for a single number or a group of numbers** : The answer to this question should be a single number or a group of numbers. This is because g''(x) is usually a derivative and needs to be expressed as a specific number.\n3. **Check the answer accuracy** : Double-check the final answer to ensure that it follows the operation rule. If there are any mistakes, you should correct them before submitting the answer.\n\nBy following these instructions and explanations, you should be able to accurately apply the given operation rule to the provided questions. Remember to wrap the final answer in double square brackets for better clarity.\n\nThe questions provide valuable opportunities to practice your understanding of operations and their derivatives.

The custom operation requires 2 arguments, x and y, as well as the operator \"&\", \"*\" and the boundaries set in the defining function. The definitions of the operations (* = f f * ) indicate that the custom operation evaluates the given function (f) on the exterior region (D) based on the argument (x,y).\n\nTo compute f◆D, which requires use of f's f function, it is important to understand the meaning of & and \"*\" used in the definition. The & symbol represents the outermost expression, and \"*\" represents the inner nested expressions. This means that f◆D will be evaluated based on the arguments (x,y) using the specified function(s), and then a specific operation will be applied to the result.\n\nStarting with the first question, which asks to compute f◆D using f(x,y)=1, D: 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to this question should be:\n\nf◆D = ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy\nThe answer is a single number as required. To evaluate the integral ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, it is necessary to first determine the appropriate values of x and y that result in a non-zero fraction. In this case, only the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 satisfy all three arguments (x,y,f). Therefore, the integration region will be the area between these boundaries. The double integrals yields the value of the integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅1⋅dx·dy + ∫(2-1)⋅(3-2)⋅1⋅dx·dy = 2⋅2⋅1+1⋅1⋅dx·dy = 4\n\nTherefore, the answer to the first question is:\n\nf◆D = [4]\n\nFor the second question, f(x,y)=xy, D:1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3, the answer to the question should also be a single number. Note that the custom operation is the same in both questions, the only difference is the function definition, and the boundaries. Evaluating the function F by ∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy, yields:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = x⋅y⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration. In this case, the easiest way to find the appropriate bounds is to graphically observe the region defined by the boundaries 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644949-90edfb0d-5963-4dc5-b2de-7d4ed72e4713.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral. The integral of this function is:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫xy⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅(x⋅y)⋅dx·dy = ∫2⋅2⋅x⋅y⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅∫2⋅dx·dy = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅[(y+1)−(0+1)] = 4x⋅y⋅2⋅(y+1) = 8x⋅y2+8xy\nTherefore, the answer to the second question is:\n\nf◆D = [8(2)⋅32+8⋅(2⋅3)]=128\n\nFor the third question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand is:\n\nf(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y\nThe integration region has the same form as the region defined by 1≤x≤2, 1≤y≤3 in the first question, so this question may be answered in a similar way:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(2-1)⋅(3-1)⋅x2+y2⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy\nNote that the integrand is still constant and integration region has not changed:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫1⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅∫1⋅2⋅dx·dy = 2x2+2y2⋅2⋅[(1+2)2+(0+1)2] = 6x2+6y2 = 6(x2+y2)\nTherefore, the answer to the third question is:\n\nf◆D = [6(12+32)]=40/3\n\nFor the fourth question, f(x,y)=x2+y2, D:1≤y≤2, 0≤x≤y, the answer should also be a single number. The integrand and integration region are the same as in the previous question. Therefore, the integral can be evaluated:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫(1+2)⋅(3-1)⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = ∫3⋅2⋅(x2+y2)⋅dx·dy = x2⋅y2⋅∫3⋅2⋅dx·dy\nFrom here, it is necessary to determine the appropriate bounds when defining the region of integration:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21863364/182644983-7a850cf2-36b9-4e30-b697-6b74bb9ab9d5.png)\n\nIn this case, the boundaries 1≤x≤2 have the same value for all arguments (x,y,f), so the integral can be reduced to a single variable integral:\n\n∫∫f(x,y)⋅dx·dy = ∫∫(x",

I hope you enjoy the visual presentation of the material.\n\n> Click here to watch the video solutions on Youtube.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* In section 4.1, we explored additive operations on matrices, including addition, scalar multiplication, and the diagonal operation, denoted by A'D.\n* In section 4.2, we learned about the element-by-element multiplication of matrices. Our aim was to multiply each element of Matrix A by the corresponding element of Matrix B and then add them up to obtain the resulting matrix.\n* Section 4.3 introduced operations applied to elements in a vector, including adding one element to another element, subtracting one element from another element, replacing one element with two different numbers, and producing a new vector as a single element. This was all derived from the fundamental operation of working on the elements.\n* Then the pedagogy section 4.4 addressed matrix operations where each element of a matrix was multiplied by another element, such as matrix multiplication with a scalar or matrix multiplication with a matrix.\n* In section 4.5, we delved into vector multiplication, linear transformation, and vector addition, showing how they were represented in Python.\n* Here's a brief summary of the operations covered throughout the book:\n  * addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and element-by-element multiplication of two matrices (section 4.2 in the video)\n  * element-by-element addition and subtraction of vectors (section 4.3 in the video)\n  * scalar multiplication of a matrix by a vector, scalar multiplication of a vector, and scalar multiplication of a vector by a matrix (section 4.5 in the video)\n\nThe course material was presented without a strict sequence in the video, but a clear structure can help extract knowledge from it. Based on the structure in the video, students can organize their notes as listed in bold, enclosed in red brackets.\n\n### Exercises\n\nExercise 1.\nIn the table below, perform the requested operations on the provided matrices A and B.

Perform the operations indicated for each of them and enter your answers in the corresponding cells in the table. Note that the result takes the form [a1, [a2, a3]] where a1 and a2 are numbers, and a3 is a matrix, and the elements of a3 are real numbers.

If the domain or answer range of f○g is a bounded interval (that is, an interval of the form [-b, b] or [-b, b]; or of the form [a, b]), write the answer with no quotes or commas. If the answer is 〖∞〗(^c), write it as such. If the domain or answer range of f○g is an interval of the form (a, b) or (-∞, ∞), write the answer with no quotes or commas.\n\n### Answer:\nThe domain of f○g is (1, (7/3.5)-1]. The range of f○g is [(\\frac{13}{5.7}), (\\frac{(\\sqrt{139}-17\\sqrt{73\\div 39}-11\\sqrt{13.35}\\sqrt[3]{-98+172^\\sqrt{10773}-1235\\sqrt[3]{777974}-2401-1058^\\frac{1}{3}-1929}}-538^\\frac{1}{3}-6788^\\frac{1}{3}\\log(\\frac{1414\\sqrt{4999}+13934+7-1485\\sqrt{\\frac{202864993+14343^\\sqrt{441\\sqrt{72325152+15470^\\sqrt{89198-2683}}-6204+21776^\\frac{1}{16}-(\\sqrt{2457-237}+26454\\sqrt{\\frac{9995+26928^\\frac{1}{3}-\\sqrt{25966+1456^\\sqrt{163}}-9199}}{-5644}}}}-681-1436^\\frac{1}{3})}-1184^\\frac{1}{3}}-1^\\sqrt{800583+7875}^\\frac{1}{3}-(-\\frac{3}{4}-6}^\\frac{1}{3}-4)^\\frac{1}{3}\\\\-(a+1)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}^\\frac{1}{3}-[3333333333",
