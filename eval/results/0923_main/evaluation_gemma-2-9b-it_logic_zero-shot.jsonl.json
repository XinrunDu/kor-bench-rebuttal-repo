Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** If all Middle Eastern countries disarm, there will be peace.\n* **Conclusion:** Since they haven't disarmed, there will be no peace.\n\nThe fallacy lies in incorrectly concluding the absence of the consequent (peace) simply because the antecedent (all countries disarming) is not true.  The NegAnt method specifically addresses this type of flawed reasoning. \n",

The fallacy arises from switching the order of the quantifiers, leading to the erroneous conclusion that all Chinese people are billionaires.  \n\n\n\n\n",
