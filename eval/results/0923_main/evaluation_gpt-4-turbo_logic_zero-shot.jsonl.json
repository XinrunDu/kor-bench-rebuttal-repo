According to the Time Proposition Relationships, the ⚭ Relationship states that for pairs like Hp and H¬p (which are involved here), they cannot both be false, but can both be true.\n\nHence, the assertion that if ¬Hp (Hp is false) then H¬p must be true (H¬p is true) aligns with the ⚭ relationship’s principle that these two cannot both be false. This is consistent with the relationships and properties outlined under ⚭ Relationship. The ∗, ↦, and ⁂ relationships do not correspond with the logic of formula 7.\n\nAnswer: [[C]]",
