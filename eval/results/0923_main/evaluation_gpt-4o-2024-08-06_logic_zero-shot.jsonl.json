This scenario does not involve contrasting statements or stronger/ weaker information bracketing.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: Prioritizes minimalism in communication and relies on pragmatic conventions unless evidence suggests otherwise. The minimal statement \"the mother\" is taken to mean the baby's mother based on conventional understanding.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Concerns the use of marked expressions. The phrase \"the mother\" is unmarked and conventional, not fitting this criterion.\n\nThe scenario best fits the **C% Principle** given the minimal and conventional nature of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[B]].",

Therefore, the proportion `k1/n1` is `180/200 = 0.9`.\n3. For School Y, we have `P(F, 210, 300)`. Therefore, the proportion `k2/n2` is `210/300 = 0.7`.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule:\n\n- Since both samples have different proportions, we check if they are similar enough to infer similarity in populations.\n- We compare `0.9` and `0.7`.\n\nIn this scenario, although `0.9` and `0.7` are not exactly the same, they're quite close, which may suggest some similarity between the population proportions, depending on the context and statistical thresholds.\n\nSymbolization using the C-Reasoning Rule:\n- `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`\n\nInference:\n- `Pr(F, P1) ≈ Pr(F, P2)`, assuming they're considered similar enough.\n\nFormatted output:\n- [[C(F, 0.9, 0.7), Pr(F, P1) ≈ Pr(F, P2)]]",

        "response": "To determine which principle the inference conforms to, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. This implies a specific context where a nurse is receiving the flowers.\n- Common sense inference: nurses are commonly known to be female, leading to the inference that Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\n\nApplying the principles:\n\n- **C***: This principle involves making statements as strong as the knowledge allows and making inferences about the speaker's knowledge. The inference about the nurse being female is based on common stereotypes rather than a specific knowledge-driven weaker statement versus stronger statement pairing.\n  \n- **C%**: This principle focuses on saying the minimum necessary and conventional assumptions. The inference relies on a conventional societal stereotype (that a nurse is likely female), aligning closely with CI1, which assumes conventional relationships unless there's evidence otherwise. Therefore, it follows the convention of female nurses.\n  \n- **C!**: This concerns avoiding obscure expressions and using conventional associations. In this case, the inference doesn't involve avoiding marked expressions or unconventional associations.\n\nBased on the detailed reasoning, the inference primarily involves the conventional assumption under **C% Principle**.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]].",
