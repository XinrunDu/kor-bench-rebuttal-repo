Given that Mr. Krabs is aware that duplication of the formula is punishable by law and robbing a bank is clearly illegal, these actions wouldn't align with legal and risk-averse behavior.\n\nOption A, marrying a robot that looks like money, was attempted by Mr. Krabs in the story.

Specifically, we understand from the story that \"the organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\" This clearly indicates a strong class-based restriction on organ transplantation.\n\nGiven this, let's review the options:\n\nA. Normal citizens voluntarily donate their organs to others: This option is not fully addressed in terms of voluntary donation specifically within the normal citizen class or across classes, but the story's strict disparities between the upper class and normal citizens imply that such actions wouldn't be permissible at least between different class boundaries.\n\nB. Forcing Normal citizens to donate their organs to others: The option seems unethical and the story does not explicitly discuss forced donation, but the class-based restrictions do not support such an act if it involves crossing classes.\n\nC. The upper class can only accept organs from the upper class: This directly aligns with the stated regulation that \"the organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians.\"\n\nD. The upper class receives organs from extreme beasts: This concept isn't introduced or supported by the details given in the narrative. \n\nThus, the option that most clearly adheres to the provided regulations is:\n\n[[C]]",

He can see the sun rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- The story indicates that Earth is facing a catastrophic threat due to an accelerated helium flash in the sun. Consequently, planetary engines have been built to propel Earth out of the solar system. This suggests that the traditional day-night cycle on Earth, where the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, is no longer a normal experience for ordinary people. Additionally, the earth's rotational speed has been altered, causing significant changes in the day-night cycle duration.\n\nB. He has been living in an underground city since childhood and has never seen the world above ground.\n- The story mentions that the vast majority of humans have moved into underground cities associated with planetary engines and that only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city. Given this information, it is plausible that many ordinary people would spend their entire lives in these underground cities without ever seeing the world above ground.\n\nC. He can see Proxima Centauri rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- Proxima Centauri is a star located outside of our solar system and not visible as a rising and setting star from Earth. This option is scientifically inaccurate in the context of an Earth's perspective.\n\nD. He lives on the Space Biosphere 1 space station.\n- The Space Biosphere 1 experiment and the space station housing it were destroyed by a solar storm in 2026, which led to the loss of six scientists. Therefore, it is unlikely that an ordinary person would be living on Space Biosphere 1 space station.\n\nTaking all the information into account, the most logical and supported answer is B.\n\nThus, the final answer is [[B]].",
