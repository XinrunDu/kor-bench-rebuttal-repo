Contradiction:** A is a contradiction if it includes no paired conjunctive terms. ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **C. Basic formula:** A is a basic formula if it includes m0. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, it is a basic formula.\n- **D. All-even formula:** A is an all-even formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. In this case, the only term is m0, which is even. So, it is an all-even formula.\n- **E. All-odd formula:** A is an all-odd formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd.

        "response": "Given the specified logic rules, let's break down the conditions for formula A that contains 4 propositional variables and satisfies both being a basic form and an all-even form:\n\n1. A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]",

Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula.

This response could be tied to the C* Principle, as it doesn't provide the strongest possible statement (\"We are finished\"), likely because that would conflict with the actual status (\"details left to address\"). It leaves the listener to infer the actual completion status.\n    - CQ1: B says \"We have finished most of the work, with only a few details left to address.\" This implies B knows they can't assert they are fully finished (A(s) = \"We are finished\").\n    - CQ2: The phrase excludes \"fully completed\".\n\n- **C's Response:** This suggests that although there is work left, the main part is completed. C uses more nuanced language (\"essentially wrapped up\"). This could be tied to the C! Principle because the expression \"essentially wrapped up\" is a marked, more complex phrase that differs from a straightforward expression, potentially to avoid conventional associations or be overly optimistic.\n    - C!

Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of ¬p, ¬q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r.\n   - (p ∧ q ∧ r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p ∧ q ∧ r.\n\n2.

Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it’s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it’s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it’s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it’s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it’s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4.

Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p ⇑ q) & (p ⇑ r) ::=:: p ⇑ (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2.
