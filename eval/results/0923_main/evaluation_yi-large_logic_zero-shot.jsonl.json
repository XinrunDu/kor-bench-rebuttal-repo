If `q` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Shanghai), then `r` and `p` must be false. This would make the first part of the expression `!p&q&!r` false, but since `p` is false, the second part `p&!q&r` is also false.

Therefore, `q` cannot be true on its own.\n\n2. If `r` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Hangzhou), then `p` and `q` must be false.

This situation also fits the condition where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that Professor Wang is from Suzhou (`p` is true, `q` and `r` are false).\n\nNow, let's analyze who got what correct:\n\n- Person A: `!p&q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person A is entirely incorrect.\n- Person B: `p&!q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person B is entirely correct.\n- Person C: `!q&!r` - Since `q` is false and `r` is also false, Person C is partially correct because only one part of their statement is right (the part about not being from Shanghai), and the other part (about not being from Hangzhou when he is actually not) is redundant given our knowledge, making it neither fully right nor fully wrong in context.\n\nTherefore, the answer format with the correct assignments is:\n\n`[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: A]]`",

For the second clause to be false: \\(p\\) true, \\(q\\) true, \\(r\\) false, which corresponds to \\(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r\\).\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the paired disjunctive terms (corresponding to the false assignments), we actually want the negation of these conditions, which will give us the minimal true conditions (paired disjunctive terms) as:\n\n1. \\(\\neg(\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M0\\) because the false assignment \\(\\neg p\\) (binary 0), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 010, which is 2 in decimal and 2 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, this corresponds to no false (all true), which is \\(M0\\).\n2. \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M3\\) because the false assignment \\(p\\) (binary 1), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 110, which is 6 in decimal and 6 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, we subtract 1 (to find the minimal true condition) to get 5 in decimal, which is 5 in hexadecimal, so \\(M5\\). (The correct interpretation here is that the truth assignment 110 corresponds to 6 in decimal, which maps to \\(M6\\), but since we are negating the assignment to find the disjunct, we actually have \\(M6\\) as the paired term. The confusion earlier was in mixing the negation operation with the hexadecimal conversion step.)\n\nTherefore, the correct paired disjunctive terms and their notation for the given expression are:\n\n\\[\n[[paired\\ disjunctive\\ terms: M0, M6]; [denoted: M0 \\vee M6]]\n\\]\n\nThe corrected interpretation should reflect that the truth assignment of \\(p\\) (1), \\(q\\) (1), \\(r\\) (0) corresponds to \\(110\\) in binary, which is \\(6\\) in decimal and \\(6\\) in hexadecimal, thus directly giving us \\(M6\\) without the need for subtraction, as the subtraction was an error in interpreting the process. The other term correctly corresponds to \\(M0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[paired\\ disjunctive\\ terms: M0, M6]; [denoted: M0 \\vee M6]]\n\\]\n\nThis correction aligns with the rule that the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number \\(i\\), denoted as \\(Mi\\).",

Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is directly given as a simple conjunctive term, and given the way the rule is structured, a more accurate interpretation, considering the question's format, might be looking for its classification based on its direct form.

Therefore, \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\).\n\n2. \\(S_1\\) is the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form \\((¬p \\vee q) \\wedge (p \\vee q) \\wedge (q)\\).

Since \\(S_0\\) is empty, there are no resolutions to perform between \\(S_0\\) and \\(S_1\\).\n\nNext, we resolve clauses within \\(S_1\\). We have three clauses: \\(C_1 = ¬p \\vee q\\), \\(C_2 = p \\vee q\\), and \\(C_3 = q\\).\n\n- Resolving \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) yields \\(q\\), since \\(dispel(C_1, C_2) = dispel(¬p \\vee q, p \\vee q) = q\\). Since \\(q\\) is already in \\(S_1\\), we do not add it to \\(S_2\\).\n- Resolving \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_3\\) is not applicable because \\(C_3\\) does not contain the complement of any literal in \\(C_1\\).\n- Resolving \\(C_2\\) and \\(C_3\\) yields \\(\\emptyset\\) (because \\(dispel(C_2, C_3) = dispel(p \\vee q, q) = \\emptyset\\)), but this is an empty clause, indicating a contradiction. However, since the rule specifies adding non-empty resolutions to \\(S_2\\), we do not add anything in this case.\n\nSince no new non-empty clauses were derived that are not already in \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) remains empty after this iteration.\n\nTherefore, \\(S_2\\) after the first loop iteration is still \\(\\emptyset\\).\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\\[[\\emptyset; \\{¬p \\vee q, p \\vee q, q\\}; \\emptyset]\\]\n\nNote that the format requested mixes the use of `[]` and `{}` for sets, which is not standard.

This method can be directly applied to our Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) to convert it into a new proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, as follows: \"All C is F\" can be converted to \"Some F is C\" (since conversion of A to I is valid). However, this results in a Particular Affirmative Proposition (I) rather than a Universal proposition. The question seems to be asking for a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning.\"\n\n- **Method C** involves first performing obversion (Method A) and then performing conversion (Method B). Starting with \"All C is F,\" applying obversion gives us \"All C is not non-F\" (though this step doesn't change the meaning substantially in logical terms, as \"not non-F\" is equivalent to \"F\"), and then applying conversion would yield \"Some non-F is not C.\" This doesn't achieve the desired inference either, as it negates both terms and doesn't place \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in the form we likely want.\n\nHowever, interpreting the question as seeking a method to derive a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning\" from the given premise, the most appropriate method to infer a Universal proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" (F) as the subject while maintaining the essence of the original statement, is to leverage a combination of insights from the methods, though not directly any single method as described. We can infer a new Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) by understanding that if all of a subset (correct reasoning, C) shares a property (being formally correct, F), then to say something about the whole set of things with that property (formally correct reasoning, F), we can infer that \"All F must include all C.\" This isn't directly Method A, B, or C but is derived from our understanding of set relations in syllogistic reasoning. However, to fit within the constraints of the methods provided, the closest fit would be **Method B** applied with a slight adjustment to retain the Universal quantity, focusing on the subject-predicate exchange principle: \"All C is F\" implies \"All F is at least C,\" which is a valid inference in this context but goes beyond the simple conversion to emphasize the Universal quantity.\n\nThus, the method that most closely aligns with the inference we want, while not fitting exactly due to the need to preserve the Universal nature of the proposition, is:\n\n**[[B]]**\n\nThis adjustment is made to interpret the question's request for \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in a Universal proposition, recognizing the limitations of the provided methods in directly achieving this without some interpretation or extension of their principles.",

The given statements are:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S\n3. ∀S ⇒ ¬P\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (∀P ⇒ M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (∀M ⇒ ¬S) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (∀S ⇒ ¬P) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion ∀S ⇒ ¬P (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, ∀S ⇒ ¬M (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), ∴S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, ∴S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies ∀¬M ⇒ S (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (∀P ⇒ M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (∀¬M ⇒ S, equivalent to ∀M ⇒ ¬S in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (∀S ⇒ ¬P).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation.

This is saying it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, which is equivalent to saying it is not possible for a person to both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nGiven the modal logic inference formulas, the most direct correspondence to this inference is:\n\n- #(!p + q) → $!(!p + q)\n\nThis can be paraphrased as: If it is necessary that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, then it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nTo find the exact formula that corresponds to this reasoning, we can look at the given formulas and identify which one aligns with the structure of our inference.

The direct implication from necessity to possibility is given by formula (9):\n\n(9) #p → $p\n\nHowever, our inference involves the negation of a conjunction, !(p + q), so we need to adjust our interpretation. The inference from #!(p + q) to $!(!p + q) is essentially an application of the principle that necessity implies possibility (formula 9) in a context involving the negation of a proposition. Thus, we can infer $!(!p + q) from #!(!p + q) directly by applying the principle that necessity implies possibility to the negated conjunction, even though it's not explicitly listed in the provided formulas in the exact form we're using.\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the provided formulas and find the closest match that aligns with the essence of the inference without directly involving the conjunction, we look for a formula that reflects a necessary proposition implying a possible proposition. Formula (9) is the closest match, but it's not directly applicable to our compound proposition. Instead, we must infer that since #!(!p + q) implies a form of impossibility, its de Morgan's law equivalent, #(p + q), would imply a form of necessity that must also hold. Given #(p + q), we can infer $!(!p + q) using formula (9) indirectly, understanding that we're applying the necessity-to-possibility implication to the negation of the original compound proposition after a logical transformation.\n\nTherefore, the closest formula in spirit, while not a perfect match due to the complexity of the compound propositions involved, is:\n\n[[9]] #p → $p\n\nThis formula underscores the principle that necessity implies possibility, and when applied in a context where we're discussing the negation of a compound proposition, it supports the inference made. However, the direct formula for the inference from #!(!p + q) to $!(!p + q) is not explicitly listed, and the application involves a logical transformation step based on de Morgan's laws before applying the necessity-to-possibility implication, which is the essence captured by formula (9).

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The ⸮ method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The ؆ method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The ꙮ method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The ⵣ method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The ⚘ method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the ؆ method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

Principle, specifically the Speaker's Criterion which states that one should not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. The Hearer's Inference for C! Principle suggests that if such marked expressions are used, they imply a different meaning or intention than what could have been conveyed with an unmarked expression. In this case, \"managed to get\" conveys the idea that getting the tickets was non-trivial or required some effort, which deviates from the conventional or simpler interpretation of just \"buying\" tickets. Thus, the scenario best fits the C! Principle.\n\nThe C* Principle and C% Principle do not directly apply here. The C* Principle concerns the ordering of statements by information strength and the inferences made based on the speaker's choice of a weaker statement (not applicable in this direct question-answer scenario). The C% Principle relates to speaking as minimally as necessary and making inferences based on conventional assumptions and the expansion of information, which also does not directly apply given the focus on marked expressions in the example.",

Specifically, B's statement \"I like her\" utilizes the Speaker's Criterion of the C* Principle, as it is weaker in information compared to what could have been stated (\"I love her\"), and does not conflict with the Information Principle. According to the Hearer's Inference CQ1, from the pair <love, like>, where \"love\" is the stronger term and \"like\" is the weaker, the statement \"I like her\" entails that B knows \"I love her\" cannot be established, thus implying B does not love Xiao Hong. This reasoning aligns with the C* Principle's framework.\n\nThe C% Principle would not apply here as B's response is not minimizing the information for the purpose of communication but rather choosing a specific weaker term to convey nuanced meaning. \n\nThe C!

Specifically, the Hearer's Inference (CQ1) applies here. The statement \"Some soccer players are on the field\" (B) is weaker than \"All soccer players are on the field\" (A), and A entails B (since if all players are on the field, it is necessarily true that some players are on the field). By choosing to use the weaker statement without asserting the stronger one, the speaker signals to the hearer that they do not have enough information to assert the stronger statement, or that the stronger statement is not true (K~(A(s)) in the rule's notation).\n\nThe C% Principle's Speaker's Criterion states that one should speak as little as possible, but the context here involves choosing between statements of different strengths to convey the level of certainty or knowledge about the situation, which is more aligned with the C* Principle.\n\nThe C! Principle is not applicable in this scenario, as it concerns avoiding lengthy or marked expressions when simpler ones suffice, which is not the case here since the difference between \"all\" and \"some\" is not about the length or complexity of the expression but about the information strength.",

This aligns with the speaker's criterion under the C* Principle, where the statement is weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge potentially allows, and the hearer's inference (CQ2) applies since the content of the stronger statement \"I know you are a college student\" entails the content of the original statement, and the speaker does not know whether the content of the original statement can be fully established.

The inference here is that when Xiao Ma mentions the beer being warm upon opening the food box, it suggests that the beer is an unexpected item that stands out because it's not in its expected state (usually cold). Given the context of opening a food box, the minimal information provided implies that the beer is part of the contents of the food box, as it is the simplest and most direct explanation for this observation. This adheres to CI2 of the C% Principle, where the hearer expands the information to grasp the intention of the speech, assuming that the mentioned \"beer is still warm\" is an unusual fact that stands out and is meant to be understood as part of the described situation without further embellishment.\n\n2. The statement does not seem to invoke the **C* Principle**, as it's not about the speaker avoiding making a stronger statement due to lack of knowledge or intentionally not providing more precise information. The focus is not on the contrast between possible stronger and weaker statements or inferences about the speaker's knowledge limitations.\n\n3. Regarding the **C! Principle**, the statement does not utilize a lengthy, obscure, or marked expression that could suggest a deviation from conventional meanings or the need to avoid conventional associations. The phrasing is straightforward, and the inference does not require avoiding or reinterpreting conventional meanings in a significant way as per the C!

B provides the minimum necessary information without making a definitive statement. Similarly, C also adheres to this principle by providing more details yet still not giving a direct yes or no answer, focusing instead on the current state of the project rather than the projected timeline.\n\n- **C. C! Principle**: C's response uses a more marked expression, \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which deviates from a simple confirmation of the project's completion. This choice of words suggests a positive slant while also implying a nuanced understanding that there is still work to be done. This marked expression indicates a different meaning than a straightforward \"yes, it's complete,\" aligning with the hearer's inference of avoiding conventional associations and leveraging the Information Principle to convey a more nuanced message.\n\n- **A. C* Principle**: Neither B nor C directly addresses the question in a way that would allow for a clear deduction under the C* Principle. While B and C provide information about the state of the project, they do not give a direct answer that would allow us to infer their knowledge or lack thereof regarding the definite completion time.

The statement \"The mother picks her up\" implies a relationship based on the conventional understanding of family roles and behavior, suggesting that the person referred to as \"the mother\" is indeed the biological or caregiving mother of the baby, due to the action taken (picking up the crying baby), which aligns with typical maternal behavior. This conforms to the principle of minimalization and the expansion of information by the hearer, assuming the conventional relationship from the described action, adhering to the C% Principle.\n\nThe C* Principle is not applicable here because there is no evidence of a stronger statement being avoided for the sake of weaker information, nor is there a contrast set where a stronger piece of information would entail a weaker one, leading to a specific inference about the speaker's knowledge.\n\nThe C!

The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is a direct, uncontroversial deduction from the statement rather than a result of the speaker being less informative than they could be.\n\n- **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalism in speech, and the inference is supposed to be based on expanding the minimal information provided by the speaker. The statement about the car door not closing implicitly assumes the car has doors (as per the convention or common knowledge), and the inference directly links to this assumption without requiring additional information.\n\n- **C!

The given statement is straightforward and does not invoke any unnecessary complexity or marked expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" conforms most closely to the C% Principle, as it involves interpreting the minimal information provided in a straightforward manner, expanding on the given information in a way that aligns with common sense or conventions about cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```",
