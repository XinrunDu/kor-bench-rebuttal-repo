In this case, **S** represents the changes in water temperature, and **P** represents the changes in the length of time people can stay in the water.\n\nThe given data shows that as the water temperature (S) increases, the time people can survive in the water (P) also increases:\n\n- (1) 0°C → 15 minutes\n- (2) 2.5°C → 30 minutes\n- (3) 5°C → 1 hour\n- (4) 10°C → 3 hours\n- (5) 25°C → more than a day and night\n\nThis pattern of correspondence between changes in water temperature and the survival time in the water aligns with the Method ⵣ, which states that when changes in S correspond to changes in P, there may be a causal relationship between S and P.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[D]]",
