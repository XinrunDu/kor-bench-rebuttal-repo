The formula then becomes \"if p1, then not p2 and p2\". \n   - This is a contradiction because the \"if p1\" part of the conjunction implies a condition that could not be met simultaneously with the \"p2\" being true. Thus, it is a Falsehood Formula because it is true under all assignments.\n   \n2. **Formula (2):** \n   - Formula: (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n   - This formula can be simplified to \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\". However, this is syntactically incorrect because the \"and\" operator in the premise and the \"if..then\" operator in the conclusion use different propositions and connectives. The correct simplification would also be based on the equivalence of the two premises: \"p1 and p3 imply not p1 and not p2\". \n   - The \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\" can be interpreted as \"If p1 and p3 are true, then p1 and p2 must be false\". Since the \"if p1 and p3\" part of the conjunction cannot be true unless \"p1\" and \"p3\" are both true, the conclusion is incorrect. The formula does not hold under any assignment of truth values, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, both formulas are Falsehood Formulas, and the answer is [[A];[A]].\n\n*Note: The prioritization of logical connectives does not apply in this case, as the issue lies in the incorrect formation and interpretation of the formulas rather than the operation's priority.*",

This is equivalent to p1 implies (p1 or p2), which is a standard form of an implication. Given its structure, this formula falls into the category of Level B Formulas because it contains a logical connective, specifically the \"implies\" symbol.\n\n(2) (p1&p2)=::>p1:\nThis formula seems to have a logical structure that could be reinterpreted as an equivalence, but it's not explicitly stated in this context.

Here, we have 3 propositional variables: p, q, and r.\n\n2. **Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns**: We can apply De Morgan's law to simplify part of the formula: \n   - ¬p&¬q&r simplifies to (¬p)∧(¬q)∧r because of the associative property of AND.\n   - Similarly, p&q&r simplifies to (p)∧(q)∧r.\n\n   Thus, the simplified formula becomes ((¬p)∧(¬q)∧r)∨((p)∧(q)∧r).\n\n3. **Ensure the output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols**: The simplified formula is now ((¬p) ∧ (¬q) ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r), adhering to the specified notation and symbols.\n\nNow, let's determine which category this formula fits into according to the given rules:\n\n- The formula contains paired conjunctive terms: ¬p&¬q&r and p&q&r.
