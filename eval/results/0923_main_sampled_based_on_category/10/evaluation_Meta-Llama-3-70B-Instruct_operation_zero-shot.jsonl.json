So, the equation becomes: 7 ※ X = 4.\n\n3. Now, we need to find X. \n\nSince 7 is not a multiple of X (X is unknown), and X is not a multiple of 7 (X is unknown), we apply the rule: 7 ※ X = 24.\n\nBut wait, the equation states 7 ※ X = 4, not 24. This means that 7 ※ X = 24 is not applicable here. \n\nLet's re-examine the equation: 7 ※ X = 4.\n\nSince 7 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 7, the rule doesn't provide a direct solution. However, we can deduce that X must be a multiple of 7, because if it weren't, the rule would dictate 7 ※ X = 24, which contradicts the given equation.\n\nSo, X must be a multiple of 7. Let's try to find a value of X that satisfies the equation:\n\n7 ※ X = 7/X + 2 = 4\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n7/X = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by X:\n\n7 = 2X\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nX = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nBut X must be an integer, according to the rule. So, X = 3.5 is not a valid solution.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n7 ※ X = 7/X + 2 = 4\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides:\n\n7/X = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by X:\n\n7 = 2X\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nX = 7/2 = 3.5 (again, not valid)\n\nSince X must be an integer and a multiple of 7, the only other possibility is X = 7.\n\nChecking if X = 7 satisfies the equation:\n\n7 ※ 7 = 7/7 + 2 = 3 ≠ 4\n\nUnfortunately, X = 7 doesn't satisfy the equation either.\n\nIt seems that there is no integer X that satisfies the equation 25 ※ 5 ※ X = 4. \n\nHowever, I'll provide the answer as instructed:\n\n[[No solution]]\n\nPlease let me know if I'm correct or if I've made a mistake!",
