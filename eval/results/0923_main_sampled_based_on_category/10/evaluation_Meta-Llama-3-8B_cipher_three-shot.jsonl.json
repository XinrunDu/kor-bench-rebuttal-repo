I often push myself way too hard, constantly striving for perfection instead of just doing my best. It may be part of what makes me successful, but obviously, if I don't balance my workload properly, I will burn out and not be able to retain any information at all. So, if you can provide me with helpful insights about balancing work and studying, I would be very grateful for the tips.\n\nYour suggestion to start each day with enjoyable but productive activities like stretches, yoga, or light meditation, ideally followed by a brief walk outside sounds fantastic! It allows me time to clear my head and then refocus once I get to my morning tasks. It also means that I get both my physical health and studying on track very early, which helps immensely for both concentration and motivation levels during the day.\n\n### Answer:\nThanks! I get your situation now. I'm glad my suggestions were helpful! Do you think you'll give them a try?\n",
