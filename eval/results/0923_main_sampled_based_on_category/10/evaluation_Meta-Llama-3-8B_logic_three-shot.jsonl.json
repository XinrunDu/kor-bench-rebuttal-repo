To get the result, we'd substitute the letter for the numerical value, evaluate the calculation following the parser rules, convert to base 36, convert that to a letter.\n\nIn all but the last few we did `\"which looks like\"'`, because most of those last few (`A - D`) were a straight substitution of the multiplication into the output, solookup thate human use of a word-letter when mentally calculating on the syllable by syllable system used by Cantonese or Japanese, and would collapse back into a formula for the output. ication wasn't adding enough additional value to be worth modifying it for a broader dissemination. Nonetheless it adds a human dimension to the calculation; when we weren't using visual substitution we were using recitations, whether Canon (Qn=2^Qn) or Tablas ( light=9*9*9+9*9+9 ) to compute a value.\n\n> Toggles:\n\n    Toggle 1,2,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z:\n        1.

Solve parity problem (almost all substitute after calculation)\nMeaning, to be more precise, \"Stanford\" becomes \"S, T, A, N, F, O, R\", etc. for substitution considerations or really large type to scold an operator for not following instructions.\n\n\n",
