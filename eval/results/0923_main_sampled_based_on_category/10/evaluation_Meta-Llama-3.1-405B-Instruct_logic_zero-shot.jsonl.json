However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true). Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]]",

Since `~(p1=::>p2)` is true only in the `✓|x` scenario for `p1|p2`, combining it with `p2` (which is `x` in that scenario) results in a false (`x`) outcome for `~(p1=::>p2)&p2` in all scenarios because `p2` being `x` makes the `&` operation false.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this analysis overlooks the fact that `~(p1=::>p2)` can also be true in other scenarios where `p1=::>p2` is false, but given our scenario, the combination with `p2` being true (`✓`) is what we're focusing on. The mistake here is in prematurely concluding the outcome without considering all truth values for `p1` and `p2`.\n\nCorrecting this:\n\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` is true whenever `p1=::>p2` is false. This occurs not just when `p1` is true and `p2` is false but also needs to consider the implication's truth table.\n- `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Thus, its negation `~(p1=::>p2)` is true in this case.\n- However, since we're combining this with `p2` using `&`, we need `p2` to be true for the whole expression to be true. This creates a contradiction with our initial condition for `~(p1=::>p2)` being true based solely on the implication's falseness.\n\nThe correct way to view this:\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true if `p1` is true and `p2` is false, but since we're also requiring `p2` to be true (`&p2`), this specific scenario actually doesn't fulfill the formula's requirement.\n- However, if `p1` is false, `~(p1=::>p2)` can still be true because a false `p1` makes `p1=::>p2` true regardless of `p2`, but adding `p2` being true makes the whole expression dependent on `p2`'s truth.\n\nGiven this, the formula can actually be true under certain conditions (e.g., when `p1` is false and `p2` is true, the first part `~(p1=::>p2)` can be true because `p1=::>p2` would be true due to `p1` being false making the implication true, but then `&p2` also being true fulfills the whole expression). Therefore, it's not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula because it's not always true or always false under all assignments.\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nThis formula suggests an equivalence between `p1&p3` and `~p1&~p2`.\n\n- For `p1&p3` to be true, both `p1` and `p3` must be true.\n- For `~p1&~p2` to be true, both `p1` and `p2` must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, the formula cannot be true under all assignments because the truth of `p1` is contradictory between the two sides of the equivalence. If `p1` is true (to satisfy `p1&p3`), then `~p1` is false, making `~p1&~p2` false. Similarly, if `p1` is false (to satisfy `~p1&~p2`), then `p1&p3` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, this formula is not a Truth Formula because it cannot be true under all assignments due to the direct contradiction in the truth value of `p1` required by each side of the equivalence. However, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because we're looking at the structure and not evaluating all possible truth assignments directly in this explanation. The correct approach would involve a truth table analysis for a more precise determination, but given the explanation, we see it's not always true, suggesting it's not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, reflecting further, given the direct contradiction in conditions for `p1` to satisfy both sides of the equivalence simultaneously, it indicates the formula cannot be satisfied under any condition, suggesting it leans towards being a Falsehood Formula. This is because for the formula to be true, `p1` must both be true (for `p1&p3`) and false (for `~p1&~p2`) at the same time, which is impossible.\n\n### Corrected Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical contradiction in the conditions required for each formula to be true under all assignments:\n\n- (1) is **Neither** a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it can be true under specific conditions but not all.\n- (2) is actually a **Falsehood Formula** because it presents a logical contradiction that cannot be resolved under any truth assignment, making it impossible to be true under any condition.\n\n**Answer:** [[C];[B]]",

This is denoted as `B_p → BB_p`.\n\nGiven that Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition `p`), we can express this as `B_p`. According to the axiom of reflexivity, since Alice is also sure that she is sure of this, we express this as `BB_p`.\n\nTherefore, combining these expressions according to the conditions provided, we don't need to show implication but rather the state of belief itself, which directly applies the axiom without explicitly writing the implication.\n\nThe logical expression is thus simply the statement of Alice's belief in her own belief, which is `BB_p`.\n\n### Answer: [[BB_p]].",

This implies that the conclusion is drawn from a subset of the class \"apples\" rather than examining every single apple.\n\n2. **Generalization**:\n   - The conclusion generalizes that all apples are red based on the observation of just six apples.\n\nGiven these observations, we can match the scenario to the definitions provided:\n\n- ** * Inductive Reasoning**:\n  - Fits the description because it involves making a general conclusion (all apples are red) based on observing specific instances (six different apples) within the class (apples).\n  - The symbolic representation `P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_k) -> forall e in S, P(e)` aligns with the premise and conclusion. Here, `P(e_i)` represents the property of being red observed in the six apples, and `forall e in S, P(e)` represents the conclusion that all apples are red.\n\n- **Φ Inductive Reasoning**:\n  - Does not fit because it requires examining every individual in the class before drawing a conclusion, which is not the case here since only six apples out of the entire class of apples were observed.\n\nTherefore, the scenario provided is an example of * inductive reasoning.\n\n### Answer: [[A]]",

The argument concludes that H University can also reach a new level after reform because the basic conditions of the two schools are the same.\n\nGiven this structure:\n\n- The shared attributes (old school, strong faculty, good school spirit) are used to infer that H University will also have the attribute of reaching a new level after reform, just like F University.\n- These shared attributes act as the #Ψ attributes (a, b, c), and \"reaching a new level after reform\" acts as the +Ψ attribute (d).\n\nTherefore, this argument follows the Ψ Method because it assumes that since both universities share the same set of attributes (a, b, c), they will also share the outcome or attribute d.\n\n### Answer: [[A]]",

Nonetheless, for the sake of answering the question and applying the rule as requested:\n\nIf we were to ignore the actual calculation and proceed with the instruction to apply the C-Reasoning Rule, the symbolic notation would be based on the format `C(S, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, where `k1/n1` and `k2/n2` are the proportions of individuals with attribute `S` in the two samples. However, the proportions calculated do not support a direct similarity inference as the question's setup might imply.\n\nBut since the task requires us to follow a specific format and apply the C-Reasoning Rule symbolically without necessarily validating the similarity of proportions first, we proceed with the symbolic representation:\n\nGiven the proportions are actually different, and the question seems to aim at understanding the application of the rule rather than validating the similarity, the application might be misunderstood. However, the question's structure and the logical rule provided don't perfectly align with the calculated proportions indicating similarity.\n\nTherefore, strictly following the format and the question's apparent request without further inference or adjusting for the actual proportions calculated:\n\n[[]]\n\nHowever, if we were to fill in the information given in a manner that reflects the C-Reasoning format directly without implying the incorrect similarity:\n\n[C(S, 90/100, 75/150)]\n\nThis notation follows the instruction more closely but does not necessarily imply that the two regions have similar proportions of the population exercising daily based on the given data.",
