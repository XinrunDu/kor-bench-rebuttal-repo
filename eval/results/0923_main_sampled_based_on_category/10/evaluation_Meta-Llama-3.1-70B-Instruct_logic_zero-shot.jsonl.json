In this case, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nIf p1 is assigned x, then the truth value of the formula p1||p2||p3 depends on the assignments of p2 and p3. However, according to the rule of the material implication (p1=::>p2), if the antecedent (p1) is x, then the implication is always ✓, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, regardless of the assignments of p2 and p3, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nSince the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is assigned ✓ under all assignments, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nTo determine whether this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze the possible truth values of the formula under all assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nFirst, consider the subformula p1=::>~p1. If p1 is assigned ✓, then ~p1 is assigned x, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned x. If p1 is assigned x, then ~p1 is assigned ✓, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned ✓.\n\nNow, consider the entire formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is x, then the implication will be assigned ✓, regardless of the assignment of ~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is ✓, then the implication (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 will depend on the assignment of ~p2. If ~p2 is assigned x (p2 is assigned ✓), then the implication will be assigned x.\n\nSince the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 can be assigned x under some assignments, it is not a Truth Formula. However, it is not always x, so it is not a Falsehood Formula either. Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]].",

This means p1 must be true and p2 must be false for ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, but then p2 cannot be true. However, this creates a contradiction, so there is no assignment that makes the entire formula true.\n\nHowever, as this reasoning was flawed, we should create a truth table:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | x | ✓ | x | x |\n| x | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n| ✓ | x | x | ✓ | x |\n| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n\nYet, we actually found an issue. The original explanation was porting the OR propery rather than focusing whether it is Tautology or a falsehood.

However, the question asks for paired conjunctive terms. Since M7 represents the paired disjunctive term, we consider the actual term for paired conjunctive representation.\n\n¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a paired conjunctive term, and the binary equivalent of its true assignment in ascending order is 000.\n\nConvert 000 to hexadecimal: 000 = 0\n\nAs per the rules, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is denoted as m0. Since it includes m0, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a basic formula.\n\nHowever, looking at the format, it seems it should also have been paired conjunctive terms to make any further judgment on whether it's a tautology, an all-even, or an all-odd formula, which in this case does not hold because of the format of the given term but the index for a conjunctive form holds. In that scenario, the index corresponding to its paired conjunctive form representation, m0 has an even index, yet solely one index prevents making all-even judgment.\n\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r does not include all 2^n possible terms, it is not a tautology (A).\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes the paired conjunctive term m0, it is not a contradiction (B).\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0, it is a basic formula (C).\nSince it's an isolated situation with only a single term m0, we do have an even index of the paired conjunctive term included but a single value leads to incorrect classification universally for use of \"all,\" given other situations which didn't match, and given no information about availability of other terms for collective judgment as \"all-even.\"\nTherefore the conditions and format does lead to unclear outcomes in 'D.'\n\nThe answer [[ C ]]",

(¬p∧¬q∧r) - The true assignment of pqr corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i. For ¬p¬qr, the binary number is 100, corresponding to hexadecimal number 4. Thus, the paired conjunctive term for (¬p∧¬q∧r) is m4.\n\n2. (p∧q∧r) - The true assignment of pqr corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i. For pqr, the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7. Thus, the paired conjunctive term for (p∧q∧r) is m7.\n\nNow, let's  identify the properties of the given formula using these paired conjunctive terms:\n\n- m4 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 4 (which is even).\n- m7 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7 (which is odd).\n\nThe given formula contains some paired conjunctive terms but not all (2^3 = 8 paired terms for 3 variables are possible, and it doesn't have 000 or a0, or c as its true combination index in hexadecimal value) or m0 is not present, and also not all are present which indicates it is neither tautology nor contradiction, nor basic formula.\n\nThus, some of the indices i are even, some are odd and its form is neither tautological nor contradiction.\nHence, the answer should be:\n\n[[F]]",

The paired conjunctive terms correspond to the hexadecimal numbers from 0 to F (0 to 15 in decimal).\n\nAs A is also a basic formula, its principal disjunctive normal form includes m0.\n\nCombining these facts, we can conclude that the principal disjunctive normal form of A should include all paired conjunctive terms from m0 to mF.\n\nThe correct notation is [[]] = [m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, mA, mB, mC, mD, mE, mF].",
