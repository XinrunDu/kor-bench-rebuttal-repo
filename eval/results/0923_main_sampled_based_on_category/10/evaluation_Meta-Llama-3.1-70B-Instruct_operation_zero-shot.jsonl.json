        "response": "To solve this problem, we'll start by simplifying the expression 19※28※4※(X※13) step by step.\n\nFirst, since 28 is a multiple of 4, we can use the rule to simplify 28※4. So, 28※4 = 4/28 + 2 = 7/4 + 2 is not accurate because 4/28 simplifies to 1/7. It's actually 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nNext, since neither 19 nor 9 is a multiple of the other, we use the rule a※b = 24 when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a. So, 19※28※4 simplifies to 19※9 = 24.\n\nNow we need to find X in the expression 24※(X※13) = 3. Since neither 3 nor 24 matches the direct product of 24 and another number, let's re-examine the problem. We are simplifying it further.\n\nWe need to consider 24※(X※13) = 3. To solve for X, assume that the initial number 3, is the final product of the operation definition, a※b = b/a + 2 or a※b = a/b + 2.\n\nConsider the equation (X※13)※24 = 3. Here, neither 3 is a product of (an initial operation result ※24), hence it might be sensible to first re-evaluate the 3. To simplify we must know, is 24 a multiple of 3 (no), 3 a multiple of 24 (no).\n24※(X※13) must then equal the last case of a※b = 24.\n\nFrom the initial conditions for the expression, (X※13)※24 = 3 is unsolvable directly.\nSince X※13※24 has 2 cases that lead to 24:\nWe evaluate 3 from the perspective of  (X※13※3 didn't happen here it's actually 24 so here is the case) the embedded case 24 = (result of operation).\nInspect the simplified expression closer: Let X※13 = 3. With this perspective it is clearer.\nNow apply it:\nX※13 = a※b, for which there is only 2 definitions a = multiple of b or a = no multiple of b and vice versa.\n\nInspection of X※13 embodied here both a※b as multiple. \nThus choose b is multiple of a that leaves us at defining X※13 for b/a or\nactually X※13 got actually formed from the initial three with the evaluation\nPeople left it forming multiplication: As essential forming unknown representations may decide narrowing using estimation processing.\n\nAssuming 13 is multiple of X didn't apply.
