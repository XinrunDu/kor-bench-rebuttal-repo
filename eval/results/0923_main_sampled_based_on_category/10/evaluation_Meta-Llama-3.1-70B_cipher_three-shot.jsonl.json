For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question: General Question\nDescribe the encryption process, including the movements of the pile.\n\n### Answer\nThe encryption process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Conversion of the plaintext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of a keystream value from the pile of cards using the \"keystream algorithm\" (see below).\n    \n3. Addition of the keystream value to the plaintext letter number (modulo 26).\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting ciphertext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \n\nEach invocation of the keystream algorithm computes a single keystream value y. It modifies the pile D and thereby influences the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n\nHere is the keystream algorithm:\n\nLet A represent the first joker (which is 53) and B represent the second (54).\n\n1. Move A down one position in the pile. If it is already at the bottom of the pile, put it at the top, immediately beneath the top card.\n2. Move B down two positions in the pile. If it is already on one of the bottom two positions, move it around to one of the top two positions (respectively the bottom and the top of the pile).\n3. Perform a triple cut: Take the part just above A and the part just below B and put their order-reversed concatenation at the bottom of the pile. The deck is always treated as a circular region.\n4. Perform a count cut: Take out that many cards from the top of the pile and insert them just above the last card of the pile. Joker A counts as 53; there is no effect for Joker B.\n5. Look at the value of the top card. Joker A counts as 53; ignore Joker B and repeat the algorithm. Use the value of the computed card as the resulting keystream value y.\n\nIn a streamlined version of this algorithm, card A only changes position if it's not the bottom card or at the top, card B only moves if it's not at the top two positions, and the triple-cut step is not executed if A precedes B. These tweaks have no effect on the keystream but make the implemented algorithm faster by performing fewer operations (on average).\n\n### Question: General Question\nDescribe the algorithm for decryption.\n\n### Answer\nThe decryption algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Conversion of the ciphertext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of the corresponding keystream value using the \"keystream algorithm\" from above.\n    \n3. Calculation of the plaintext letter number from the ciphertext letter number using subtraction modulo 26.\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting plaintext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \nFor each ciphertext letter, a respective keystream value is computed. Each keystream determination modifies the pile D and thereby affects the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n",
