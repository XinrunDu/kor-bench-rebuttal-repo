So, GV is replaced by Dialed corresponding GV(G(5), V(4) being replaced with G(3), V(4)).,\n\nReplace GV, the position of  G and V is (3,4). \nThe position of G in encrypted characterset is 5, replacing G to the corresponding letter in the matrix with the row 3 to get  I (read row 3 from the matrix), The columns of V is 4, so read column 4 from the matrix to get G, the corresponding letter is G.
