        "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n✓|✓|✓,✓|✓|x,✓|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|✓,x|✓|✓\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t.",

Evaluate the subformula ~(p1=::>p2):\n    - The original subformula p1=::>p2 is true under all but one possible assignment (✓|x), corresponding to p1=::>p2 being false when p1 is true and p2 is false.

(p∧q∧r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1.

None of the Above is correct. This is because although we have the principal disjunctive normal form, i (of m5, m6, and m7) are not all even or all odd. Hence, we cannot classify the given formula as an all-even formula or an all-odd formula. Also, the formula is not a contradiction as it does include all possible assignments, hence not a tautology. The given principal disjunctive normal form formula includes 3 paired conjunctive terms and does not include the paired disjunctive term m0 (i.e., the term which includes the true assignment of all the propositional variables), hence not a basic form.",
