However, it is also not a Falsehood Formula, since there is at least one true assignment. So, the answer is neither.\n\n(2) For this formula, we will consider the following cases:\n\nIf p1 is true (✓) and p1 is equal to its negation (~p1), then p1=::>~p1 evaluates as false. If ~p2 is true (✓), then the overall formula evaluates as true due to the \"if...then\" rule (p1=::>~p2).\n\nHowever, if p1 is false (x) and p1 is equal to its negation (~p1), then p1=::>~p1 evaluates as true. If ~p2 is false (x), then the overall formula evaluates as false due to the \"if...then\" rule (p1=::>~p2).\n\nSo, there are no false assignments for this formula, which means it is a Truth Formula.",

        "response": " [A];[B]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The formula ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. We can check this by providing different true/false assignments to the propositions p1, p2:\n   - If p1 is true and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is false (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to false, and & requires both operands to be true to produce true).\n   - If p1 is false and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is true (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to true, and & requires only one operand to be true to produce true).\n   - There are no assignments for which the formula would be always true or always false, making it neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\n2. The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is a Truth Formula if and only if the equations p1 = ~p1 & ~p2 and p3 = ~p1 & ~p2 hold true simultaneously. To find valid assignments, we need to consider all possible truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n   - If p1 is true, then ~p1 is false, and ~p1 & ~p2 can only evaluate to false if p2 is true. Thus, p3 must be false under this assignment, which does not satisfy the equation p3 = ~p1 & ~p2.\n   - If p1 is false, then ~p1 is true, and any assignment of p2 and p3 will not violate the equation. However, since ~p1 is true, the parentheses are not needed, and this formula simplifies to the self-equivalent formula p2, which is not a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is [A];[B], where:\n- (1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n- (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.",

Since both hexadecimal numbers 8 and 7 have odd indices, the formula is considered a basic formula. The principal disjunctive normal form of the given formula includes exactly two paired conjunctive terms (out of a possible 2^3 = 8), which means that there are 2^3 - 2 = 6 paired conjunctive terms missing, making the formula a contradiction.",

Since A contains 4 propositional variables, there are 16 possible paired conjunctive terms (2^4). According to the rule, a basic formula contains only one paired conjunctive term, so there are 16 possible basic forms. For a basic formula to be a tautology, all true assignments must result in the formula being true. However, since a basic formula has only one paired conjunctive term, it will be true for half of the true assignments (only the one that corresponds to that specific paired conjunctive term). Therefore, a basic formula cannot be a tautology if it contains more than one propositional variable. Therefore, there are no basic formulas that are also tautologies for a formula A containing 4 or more propositional variables.\n\nIn terms of the notation for paired conjunctive terms, since all basic formulas are paired conjunctive terms, any such formula would be denoted as mi, where i is a hexadecimal number. However, as mentioned above, a basic formula cannot be a tautology for a formula with more than one propositional variable. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there is no such formula A (given that it contains 4 propositional variables) that can be both a tautology and a basic form.
