The correct answer is A.\n\n### Question:\nAssume that the prison is rebuilding the garden. How does the law of self-reflexivity manifest itself?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\nBy extending the view of the guards, the prisoners can also witness their firm beliefs. If, for example, a prisoner sees a ladder on which the guards stand\nand he firmly believes that the guards stand on a ladder, he can also deduce that the guards believe they are standing on a ladder. The correct answer is 3.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the goal of game theoretic?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe ultimate goal of game theory, in contrast to the abstract logic that only\ntakes into account the logic of intentions and beliefs, views them as mere components of interaction. In abstract logic, there is no player who orchestrates the game,\nwhile there is a player is played in game theory. In game theory, there is always a player who carries out the plan.\n\nIn short, In abstract logic, there is no player who orchestrates the game, while there is a player who carries out the plan in game theory.\n\n### Question:\nIn which case can we lead the opponents to deviate?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to the fictitious play that a fair-going seller sets the price more than the next fair-going seller will set. This means that using the method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the perfect price by the method of evolution, and the buyer will decide to buy.\n\nThis means that by interrogating the arbitrary part by his method of deviation, the opponents will work to deviate and compete with each other until the price approaches the best price, at which point the buyer will buy.\n\n### Question:\nIn which two cases, do the neighbors deviate from the price in the arms-race situation, and who do they deviate from in both cases?\n\nPlease, provide your answer in the format [[1/2]].\n\n### Answer:\nAfter several iterations, assuming the maximum price in an expansion in the first round of the game will lead the neighbors at a certain stage to approach the perfect\nprice, so that means the Max Prices, while it is profitable for all the players in the game, it can be rejected by the second or further players. If there is a mistake in information\nit can be rejected. This means that in each case the opponents rejected the maximum price.\n\n### Question:\nWhat distinguishes No-Regret strategies from the limit price strategies?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nNo-Regret strategies, unanimous strategies takes a set of prices between which the buyer could buy at any time during her visit to the market. If the seller deviates from this amount,\nthe buyer can always buy at the previous price, which is more than the current market price. Moreover, our opponent's response is still \"deviant\".\n\nThe Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\nTo sum up,The Regret markets needs a situation where the buyer has the location advantage and the price is below the limit price. It's possible that the buyer lifts a suitcase from her location\nwith the intermediary, if the intermediary, which is controlled by the seller, will create this situation as well.\n\n### Question:\nIf we want to motivate dozens/ hundreds of thousands of players, what we need essential\nto convey?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe price, the purchase quantity, the payment, and the trade time are the same for all players.\n\nThe problem that arises here is how to implement a market in which all agents use the same non-logic device. One possible answer is social media, which can force agents to engage in the activity and\ncan implement the fourth-factor market.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the advantage of the operating system over the general software on a smartphone?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\nWith the growing global population, the lack of resources in different countries could lead to scarcity. Each person will usually benefit from many products; While only few people\nbenefit from many products; However, there might be a lack of resources in different countries which could lead to scarcity. Therefore, the price of the distributed operating system will\nbe higher.\n\nGiven that there are only a few manufacturers of smartphones in contrast to software\nrequiring a big market to work efficiently, the price of smartphones will be higher than the price of software.",
