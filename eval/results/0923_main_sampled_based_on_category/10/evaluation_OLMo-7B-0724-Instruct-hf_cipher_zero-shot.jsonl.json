To do this, we will use the 6x6 matrix provided, and we will use the same encryption operation as in the encryption rules.\n\nFor the first half, we have \"AXVXG\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 | 2 | V | (2,0) |\n| 0 | 1 | X | (0,1) |\n| 1 | 2 | A | (1,2) |\n| 1 | 0 | X | (1,0) |\n| 2 | 0 | X | (2,0) |\n| 2 | 2 | G | (2,2) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"AXVXG\" is (2,0)(0,1)(1,2)(1,0)(2,0)(2,2).\n\nTo get the characters after the \"G\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"AXFV\", so the final ciphertext is \"AXFV\".\n\nFor the second half, we have \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 3 | 2 | E | (3,2) |\n| 3 | 1 | D | (3,1) |\n| 2 | 1 | N | (2,1) |\n| 2 | 2 | S | (2,2) |\n| 1 | 1 | C | (1,1) |\n| 1 | 0 | O | (1,0) |\n| 4 | 2 | G | (4,2) |\n| 4 | 1 | O | (4,1) |\n| 0 | 2 | Q | (0,2) |\n| 3 | 0 | T | (3,0) |\n| 3 | 3 | K | (3,3) |\n| 5 | 2 | Y | (5,2) |\n| 5 | 1 | I | (5,1) |\n| 5 | 0 | U | (5,0) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\" is (3,2)(3,1)(2,1)(2,2)(1,1)(1,0)(4,2)(4,1)(0,2)(3,0)(3,3)(5,2)(5,1)(5,0).\n\nTo get the characters after \"T\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"YCIUT\", so the final plaintext is \"YCIUTU\".\n\nThe final answer is then: [[\"Universal Statement of Human Rights\", \"WATER\", \"WEALTH\", \"Solar Electric\", \"Voluntary Simplicity\", \"Geographic Mobility\", \"GREEN HOUSE\", \"Flexible Work Array\", \"Scalable Energy\", \"HealthState\", \"Family\", \"TEAL\", \"Generalized Arbitrage\", \"Emotional Learning\", \"Continuous Localization\", \"Natrual Gas\", \"Renewable Energy Pr approximated\", \"End-to-End Testing\", \"Empowering Behaviours\", \"Bremen\", \"Cleantech Innovations\", \"Basic Needs Satisfaction\", \"Presentient Awareness\", \"Contention\", \"Scientific Methodology\", \"LongTail\", \"YCIUT\"]]",

The plaintext we'll use is \"SECRET\" (the recommended key).\n2. Perform SHA-256 on the key (\"SECRET_KEY\") to get the key for encryption: \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\".\n3. Convert \"27ad\" to hexadecimal representation: \"13 and 23\".\n4. The encrypted bytes are: \n\t* 13 (in hexadecimal) = 51 (in decimal)\n\t* 23 (in hexadecimal) = 67 (in decimal)\n5. Now encrypt 51 with 51 (key byte) using XOR: \n   \n   * (51 XOR 51) = 0\n(0 XOR 51) = 51\n6. Next encrypt 67 with 51 using XOR:  \n   \n   * (51 XOR 67) = -6\n(67 XOR 51) = 16\n7. Convert the encrypted byte sequence into hexadecimal representation:  \n   \n   * \"5116\" (add leading 0 in front of single-byte data)\n8. Decryption steps:\n   1. Convert the hexadecimal ciphertext \"5116\" to bytes: 51 and 16\n   2. Decrypt 51 using 51 (key byte) using XOR:\n      * (51 XOR 51) = 0\n(51 XOR 16) = 35 (in decimal)\n3. Decrypt 16 using 51 (key byte) XOR:\n   \n   * (16 XOR 51) = -6\n(51 XOR 16) = 35\n4. The decrypted plaintext from ciphertext \"27ad\" is \"[\"SECRET\"], \"FTH\".",
