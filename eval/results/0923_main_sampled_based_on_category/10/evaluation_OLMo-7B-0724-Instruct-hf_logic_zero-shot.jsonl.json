Therefore, the whole formula is false.\n\n- Assign p1, p2 as x: This formula becomes ~(x=::>x)&x. The compound proposition within the ~ is x=::>x, which is true because if p1 is false, then p2 remains false.

The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is true only when p1 is false, p3 is true (or p1 is true & p2 is false). So, the formula becomes (~p1&~p2). This formula is constantly false because p1 is necessarily false, and hence p2 always remains true in every assignment.
