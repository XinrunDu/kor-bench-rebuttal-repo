In this case, a/b + 2 for 25/5 = 5/5 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which doesn't equal 4. So, 25 is not a multiple of 5.\n\nNext, let's check if 5 is a multiple of 25. Dividing 5 by 25, we get the result: 5/25 = 1/5. In this case, a/b + 2 for 5/25 = 1/5 + 2. This doesn't equal 4 either. So, 5 is not a multiple of 25.\n\nNow, since neither 25 nor 5 is a multiple of the other, we can conclude that 25※5※X = 24 minus an integer multiple of 2, resulting in a value of 24 ± 4 = 20 or 26.
