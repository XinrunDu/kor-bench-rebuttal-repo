We can conclude that Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nFrom the information about Friend2, we can find out that she did not use the gluten-free diet as Eula is either the dieter using gluten-free diet or the friend using the caveman diet (as stated in no. 4). Thus Friend2 lost more pounds than Eula and used the caveman diet.\n\nThen by combining the information about Eula, we can find the diets of Friend1 and Mandy. From the statement \"The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet,\" we know that Mandy used the sugar-free diet, which means Friend1 used the caveman diet.

(1,1)(2,1):2÷: We need to find two numbers (say x and y) in the first row that can be divided by 2 and have their sum equal to 2. The only possible solutions for N=4 are (x=2, y=1).\n2. (3,3)(3,4):2÷: At the top right corner, find two numbers (say x and y) such that their sum is divisible by 2 and is equal to 6. The only solution is (x=4, y=2). Note that there is no other solution for N=4.\n3. (1,2)(1,3):1-: In the first row, find the first two elements such that their sum (x + y) is not divisible by 2. Here, it is x=1 and y=3.\n4. (1,4)(2,4):8* : In the last two cells at the fourth row, observe that their product should be 8. The only options are (x=4, y=0) and (x=0, y=8). Both of these do not satisfy the unique solution needed for the given constraints, hence there is no solution for this region.\n5. (2,2)(2,3):3* : In the second and third columns of the second row, find two numbers (x and y) whose product is 3. The only two such numbers for N=4 are x=2 and y=1.\n6. (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ : In the third and fourth rows, as well as the first and second columns, find a way to place distinct numbers from 1 to 4 such that their sum in each 2 x 2 sub-region is equal to 13. This can be done by placing the numbers in the order: (3,1)(3,2) = 13-5-3 = (1,1)(1,2) = 13-8-5 = (4,1)(4,2) = 13-3-10 = 2\n\nNow, apply the numbers to the grid:\n\n1 2\n3 1\n4 0\n0 7\n5 6\n0 1\n7 8\n8 0\n\nFinally, stack the rows horizontally (separated by commas):\n\n[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]\n\nConcatenate the two rows vertically (separated by square brackets): \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]\n\nThus, the final output for the given puzzle problem rules is: \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]",

The provided grid is a 4x4 grid.\n2. We have the following operations and their coordinates in the grid:\n   - (1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12*\n   - (1,3)(1,4):5+\n   - (2,3)(2,4):5+\n   - (2,1)(3,1):2÷\n   - (3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8*\n   - (4,1)(4,1):1-\n   - (3,4)(4,4):1-\n\n3. Now, we should find the solutions for the listed operations.\n   - (1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12* - The sum of the numbers at (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2) should be 12. The count of each of these numbers is 0. So, firstly we fill the number 2 at (2,2) (since 12÷2=6, and there's already a number at (1,2), which is 2). Then, we fill the number 6 at (1,1) (since 12-6=6, and the numbers at (1,2) and (2,1) are already 2). Now, we fill the number 2 at (1,2) (since there is one number left to fill, and each row and column should have only one number).\n   \n   The result for this operation is: 2 6 1\n   \n   - (1,3)(1,4):5+ - The sum of the numbers at (1,3) and (1,4) should be 5. The count of each of these numbers is 0. Therefore, we fill 5 at (1,4) to match the 5 sum.\n   \n   - (2,3)(2,4):5+ - The sum of the numbers at (2,3) and (2,4) should be 5. The count of each of these numbers is 0. The number at (2,4) has to be 5. At (2,3), there is already a 3. Therefore, we fill a 2 at (2,3) instead of 3, and the number at (2,2) should be 1 to match the sum of 5.\n   \n   The result for this operation is: 5 2 2\n   \n   - (2,1)(3,1):2÷ - The numbers at (2,1) and (3,1) should divide 2. The count of each of these numbers is 0. Therefore, we fill 1 at (3,1) to get a 2 when dividing by 1. The number at (2,1) is filled with 2 to get the sum 4 when multiplying by 2.\n   \n   - (3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8* - The products of the numbers at (3,2),(3,3),(and 4,3) should be 8. The count of each number is 0. Therefore, if we multiply the numbers in places (3,3) and (4,3), their product will be 4. Then, we multiply the numbers at (3,2) and (4,3) to get the 8. The number at (3,3) has to be 5 (since it cannot be 0 or 1, and if it's 2, the product with 4,3 will be 4 instead of 8). At (4,3), there is no number, so we can fill it with 3.\n   \n   These are the answers to our 8 equations.\n   \n   - First, at (2,2), we have 2 (since 12÷2=6, and there's already a 2 at (1,2)).\n   - Then, at (1,1), we have 6 (since 12-6=6, and the number at (2,2) is 2).\n   - At (1,2), there's a 2 (since there's one number left to fill, and each row and column must have only one number).\n   \n   The number at (2,3) must be 2 (the number required for 5+2 and 5-2).\n   \n   The number at (3,2) should be 1 (since 2 divided by 1 is 2, and there's already 3 at (3,4)).\n   \n   The number at (3,3) should be 5 (since the products of the numbers at (3,3) and (4,3) are the same).\n   \n   The number at (4,3) can fill 3.\n\nAfter finding the solutions for the mentioned equations, now we are ready to write the complete answers, where but with individual numbers separated by a space and each row, column, diagonal separated by a comma (if there's more than one element in the diagonal, diagonal, then we write [number1,number2])].\n\nThe result is written as: [[1 2 5 4,6 3 1,8 2],[1 4 3 5,2 3 4,5 6 1-],[1 3 4,2 4 5,5 3 1-],[1 2 5,3 4 5],[1 3 4,2 4 5,3 5 1-]] where:\n\n- The number 1 is at first row and first column.\n- The number 2 is at second row and first column, first row, and second row.\n- The number 5 is at first row and third column, second row and third column.\n- The number 4 is at fourth row and first column.\n- The number 3 is at third row and second column.\n- The number 6 is at second row and first column, fourth row and second column, second column and third column.\n- The number 8 is at third row, third column and fourth row, third column (since there are exactly two elements in the last diagonal).\n- The number 1 is at last row and first column.\n- The number 5 is at last row and third column.\n- The number 3 is at third and fourth column (since there are exactly two elements in the last diagonal).\n\nNow, we write the complete answer as [[1 2 3 4,1 4 3 5,1 3 4,5 +4 +3 -1 -1,1 3 4,5/1,1 4 3,5 -4 -3 -1 -1,3 2 4,3 +4 +5 -1 +5,3,4 5,3 +4 -5,1 -3,1-]] where:\n\n- The numbers at (1,1),(1,3),(1,4) are 1, 5, and 1 respectively.\n- The numbers at (2,1),(2,2),(2,3) and (4,1) are 2, 2, 2 and 1 respectively\n- The numbers at (2,3) are 2.\n-",
