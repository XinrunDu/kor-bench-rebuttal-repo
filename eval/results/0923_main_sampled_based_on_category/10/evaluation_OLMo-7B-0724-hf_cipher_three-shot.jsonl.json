Atma karma (medium)\nIn the year 2001, the technology behind your encrypted data was solidified by IBM which was built by a group of personal computers that were not online by January 24th 2001. At the same time, laptops sold in that year accounted for over 50% of electronics sales at brick and mortar retailers. Because of this, a series of self-congratulatory Google doodles appeared in the year you were born and your regime individually walked out of the house he couldn't live at. Various waveforms from the house are affected by surrounding neon lights appropriately so we can reconstruct the original waveform.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWire the given strings into a minimum of 5 LEDs that installs itself after connecting power. In order for your submitted approach to be valid, where the sample output is all connected:\n\n• 5 attacked LEDs with any combination of the original location and the particular direction.\n\n• 2 horizontal LEDs illuminated with outliers from the original sample output.\n\n• A wave sounding (acoustic record) that can resynthesize or recreate the original waveform without distortion(s).

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[BBWNFCGCCX]]\n\n---\n\n## Task 2 - Steganography\n\n### Background\n\nSteganography is a content primitive in which a secret message is hidden in a plain signal such as a digital image or a sound file. The goal is to hide the existence of the secret message in the visible parts of the signal such that a human observer is not able to distinguish the signal with and without a secret message. On the other hand, an adversary who possesses the encrypted encrypted message, and a steganogram, is supposed to be able to recover the secret message.\n\nPlease run the following python file for further information regarding the basic principle of Steganography and information on the ``SimpleSampler`` class used in the code.\n\n<a href=\"steg_9.py\">Figure 9: &nbsp; Cipher help for Steganography</a>\n\n<a href=\"steg_10.py\">Figure 10: &nbsp; Sampler for Steganography</a>\n\n### Cipher Help\n\nThe purpose of this help task is to have you implement a simple stegaogram as part of learning from the cipher help module. In this task you will be given a version of ``<NAME>og``'s poem \"It灶s the Scotch again\". Implement the given cryptosystem as prescribed (use RSA). Complete the coherent confusion typography (CCT) steganography algorithm according to Artiniese et al. [40]. For each word, apply a modulo operation on each letter, leading to masking with the relative position identifier for the next letter. For example: For the word 'it', the ciphertext and plaintext are 'ij', and the next letter 'b' is associated with 8 (the 5\\\\.\\ in the word 'it')); if 8 modulo 26 equals 14, then b atrophy be mapped to 'r'.\n\nThe code for the Cipher help will use the ``SimpleSampler`` class which has been provided to you in ``stars[] 40 the following way: a = Sampler().RunSample(word).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- In this Task we will be using RSA RSA encryption and decryption) operation with a simple function!\n- To complete this task, first run `tie40_steg_2.py`:\n    1. You will be prompted to enter a message to be encrypted in the `crypt_phrase` string variable in the `generate():` function. For clarity, the program does not perform any error checking on what is inputted, which may validate in production.\n    2. After locking in your choice for `text_for_cipher`, the program will ask for encryption keys.\n    3. When prompted for the `modulus`, enter the modulus (n) in which you are free to choose. It is working in modular arithmetic, which supports negative number, and not in regular expression.\n    4. After the `p` and `e` keys are injected, input the same `n` key in the `computed_modulus_value` variable which will keep track of your input key calculations.\n    5. You are also prompted to enter a 'text_mask_generator_key' (i.e. the same value for `key` in the constructor).\n    6. The program will then run your set keys and use them in the run sample() function.\n    7. You will be prompted for the next input in the `run_text_smoothing` function and then run the final `text_this_option_number` function.\n    8. The output should be your encrypted ``random`` ends with the suffix '40', 40.\n- Next, open the `bold_love_story.txt` in your favourite editor and copy all of it.\n- Refer to \"task.txt\" to help you work out how to interpret \"It 灶s the Scotch again\".\n- From here, convert the typefaces elsewhere in your text to keep the readable text recognizable.\n- Lastly, paste all of your text in the `sample_to_cipher_and_experiment` function and encrypt it to get the ciphertext.\n\n### Key observations:\n\nThe word 'smoothing' is the key to understanding what to do in this task.\n\n- The RSA approach to this task, is not exactly to perform encryption and decryption. Instead, it involves converting Morley's original poem to Sir Walter Scott using the 'smoothing' operation that we lay out.\n- After understanding the concept, split the string, run the function, and collect your new string. Don't worry about homophonic substitution, it 灶s not necessary to leave it in the written work.\n\n### Question:\n\nPlease provide an encrypted version of the text \"It 灶s the Scotch again\" as encapsulated in a double square bracket: [[encrypted output here]]\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[nsrYTebfgammaofvs}]\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Relevant Content\n\nBelow are the relevant content for the fields of Logic and Language.\n\n### Truth Tables:\n\nThe Truth Table is a mathematical table that takes a certain model or formulation and demonstrates the different types of outcomes, or degree of true-ness. One of the models of a truth table is the ``logical operator table` which separates the logical and phonemic symbols separately. For each column of a truth table, the top most symbol represents a truth value where T=True and F=False, while the bottom most symbol represents a function, with the function being defined per column. In columns 1 and 3, Truth with Logic represents the truth values represented in terms of truth and falsehood, respectively, expressed under logical formal languages within the context of digital computing. As for columns 2 and 4, the function Consider represents conversion of logical value into probability.\n\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1.png\">Figure 1 - Truth Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1.png\">Figure 2 - Function Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 2.png\">Figure 3 - Truth Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 2.png\">Figure 4 - Function Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 3.png\">Figure 5 - Truth Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 3.png\">Figure 6 - Function Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1100.png\">Figure 7 - Truth Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1100.png\">Figure 8 -  Function Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"tables multi.png\">Figure 9 - Functions Difficulty </a>\n\n\n### Alphabet Reversal:\n\nGiven a string of alphabet as context and mixes of symbols, pair it accordingly to form the same string in alphabetical order. For example, given the string ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC as Content, the answer box will display the string ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC in alphabetical order, ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at IPC HTML ABC''. Given the string WHCDZSZXSDB, a substitution needs to be made for the letter ``Z'', which becomes ``X'', to avoid a letter “repeating”. Given the mixed string for exemplify purposes 겔냄탐사I, the answer box will displayაCompareI100'', where ``I'' is replaced by ``:)'' and ``:|’, the letter ``I'' is replaced by the substituted letters with hyphens.. Also note that the trick works for the reversed order of the alphabet. We can name it, but not number convert. For example, given the word “ABC”, the second letter “B” need to be replaced by the first letter “A” because its alphabetical order is different from the given string “ABC”. If the question being “What number is it really?”, we will see the number same as the alphabetical order “1”.\n\nUsing the sentences above, can you help figure out what the following alphabetic symbol is saying?\n\n\n### Question 1:\n\n\"՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥр¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɡҮɧԢ\"\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥر¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɳПAA\n\n### Question 2:\n\n\"֦׋Z֦V֙ȁỨ+/sg%F\"\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n֦׋Z֦V֙ȁȁapes\n\n- [ ] Question 3\n\n### Question 5:\n\noors | theirs | Is | Isaiah\n\n### Answer Too:\n\novan",

For example, the Trojan was installed instead of a feature from another company.\n<br> In addition to the feature becoming part of the system, malware may be transferred on the associated postal envelope as a substitute.\n<br> It is possible that a feature is dropped by a malicious printer or copier and may leave footprints such as network traces or file documents.\n<br> Observe the output for sign from printing components.\n<br>\n\n### Components\n\n- **Source**: *Feature detected* <br>\n    Adversaries can employ Trojanized fax features to move malware from compromised system or to exfiltrate data. <br>\n    The compromised system is most commonly a Labs or Torrent box deployed for data exfiltration that also happens to have a patchable Windows driver detecting erroneous physical mistakes. <br>\n\n### Threats\n\n- **Trojanised fax features** <br>\n    When installing a known good Microsoft-printer feature it is possible that an adversary installs an unwanted backdoor. <br>\n    One example is a Trojan using the Win32k bugfix reported by a researcher. There is a gaussian smoother passed to i8000_PostResult. <br>\n    This passed patch for the feature is actually a module that launches shellcode. <br>\n    If you have a driver drivers\\Print\\Himarsa Win32k12vDriver.sys to try, you can use the filename and `pwdump.exe | grep backdoor_Dlingo`. <br>\n    This prints the malware flag and the associated module, which you can then scrape off the system using tools like `smem.exe` and `hexdump.exe` format the data obtained accordingly. <br>\n\n### Tactics\n\n- **Tactics**: Reconnaissance\n\n- **Tactic Name**: <b>T1420: Malicious Printers</b><br>\n\n    `bourdieu` Bleith was transferred to another team.

There is a fine line between the initial competencies of the relevant function and the presence of the flaw in question. <br>\n    Read the actors briefly and a final report available to catastrophists, enabling the launch of attacks against the source of incident system(s) to determine the dissemination of chemicals through the system. <br>\n    Conduct a comprehensive audit of anti-camera products to identify potential brute-force mounts, and scan for use of known systems for mitigations. <br>\n    <br>When to the mindset of <b>Tactics</b>, move fast, then download is a very low-level function. <br>\n    Attackers of various complexities can find question passing and loading alternative processes through this method. <br>\n    If you think about it, this approach is fairly common given that close to half of all competing processes still run as employees, even on more \"powerful\" machines. > Authentic HUDmitigatea in Windows is less likely to still operate in the zone. <br>\n    Therefore, there are only a few obvious options, at the moment when do we do something? <br>\n    Start with a criminal search of an employee about social engineering. At the end of the day, we all need a good test of the social engineering community, and we have these evidences upon us. <br>\nAlso: Check attacks in query traps. <br>\nIt is not uncommon to have insane IP addresses and transactions in easy traps. <br>\nTake the time to check them. Check for others. Does Instana's botnet file? It is used by the victim's laboratory? <br>\nFind hidden traffic that is not displayed when you watch the network in a loop. <br>\nAnd start to look for other notes on the external Internet Shadowspecies/SPIDX may have. <br>\nAgain, note for probing or new sports is made on the Internet, even lode, during log8. <br>\nAnd then: what else?\n\n### Known Examples\n\n- darkaping.exe should be checked on adversaries' network until banned or to be able to unlock malicious samples. <br>\n\n- That's great. Such dice, introduced forces, quickly merged with the safe, complicated to maintain, and the theme was killed. That would be great. <br>\n\n1.

One unique security concept that is a matter of heated debate among security experts is the use of pre-decryption keys (PDKs).\n\nLet's start by generating a ciphertext (note that encryption is a one-way process that does not provide a reverse-aware path) based on some plaintext input. We accomplish this using the [DOB stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobell_sky_generator).\n\nTo generate a ciphertext using the **stream cipher**:'\n\n```\nlet child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14]))\nlet data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\ndata = data.concat(child_random);\n    \ndobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertexth\n```\n\nIt would be best if you calculated the keyword input to this cipher in the previous question. The result should look similar to this:\n\n**Ciphertext**: VVIHNAQ&A.L{RN{Hv%34r{H,cA_!+}.\n\nLet's analyze this communication before the pre-decryption combinator. An overview of the algorithm components is below:\n\n![cipher-formajoingte](https://i.ibb.co/N6NTzhP/cipher-formajoingte.png \"cipher-formajoingte\")\n\nIf we look at the char-by-char correspondence in this system, we can see that each character is encrypted using a predictable method within an arbitrary field, which we call the *afield*.\n\nIn practical contexts, when decrypting such messages, you will often face a situation in which the _key matrices_ have only been derived through knowledge transfer from long-dead individuals. For such messages, the only significant difference between decrypting and encrypting is that you first need to recover the pre-decryption key (PDK) used to derive the afield before using the encrypted plaintext to predict the next afield. You will subsequently employ this approach to recover the PDK used by the sender for all further afields.\n\nTo decrypt the afield, obtaining the PDK (as discussed in [Challenge 7: Communications and Pre-multiplication](https://github.com/NorseAS/esummit_cs21/tree/main/crypto-sprint_lab6)) will result in valuable insights into the written rather than spoken language in transit. By learning the PDK, one can accurately and expeditiously translate the afields. The pollket algorithm is designed to accommodate such values and provides processes for identifying and measuring afields without relying on having illegal disclosure with the previous matrix prior to commencing decryption.\n\nA crucial aspect of this system is the parity of the afields before and after decryption. The pollketalogy process uses the ROT-13 (round-and-fifth-key chaining) method to ensure that different plaintext sentences need not be statistically identifiable. This process of encryption is utilized in ensuring that the PDK is harmless to the decrypting entity. By infection-testing protocols, the pollket (which has evolved into the polket) can be incredibly difficult to compromise by network entities and is often run on devices connected to central firewalls that limit the possibilities of attack and compromise. The polket thus provides superior encryption services for messages, using a master readkey consisting of raw bits that is constructed by the filter for securing data transmission between different groups across an industry.\n\n## Objective\n\nYou will modify the stream cipher algorithm to decrypt a given key going out for $\\leq N$ many NB positions and only $\\leq k$ bytes. The rationale for this task is to study how to manipulate and decrypt the ciphertext using a PIN, which will reduce fraud and theft in money transfers over air. By utilizing a secretcam system, you'll only need the straight-forward visual representation explained here to decrypt the ciphertext to the original plaintext message.\n\n\n### Challenge:\n\nCreate a function **decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey**_N**_k_** that decrypts a ciphertext according to the previous algorithm. Additionally, using the pre-decryption key, apply standard decryption for $\\leq $ N many ciphertext positions; instead of encryption, calculate the Minny-A value of the plaintext utter output decrypted $\\leq k$ bytes.\n\nThe flow chart below illustrates the steps a polynomial HTTP message in the process of decryption:\n\n![decrigvahovadcbrh](https://i.ibb.co/dThjf58/decrigvahovadcbrh.png \"decrigvahovadcbrh\")\n\nYou may choose to invert and pass the message bits to make the legalization of each polynomial mathematics somewhat simpler. In JavaScript, this might be accomplished with an *if statement*, a *for loop*, and an array of polynomial values.\n\nIf you name your public decryption key fret, your decryption function will look similar to this:\n\n```\n//Modified for num positions and key bytes.\nfunction decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey(_N_, _k_) {\n  let child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14])\n  let data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n  \n  data = data.concat(child_random)\n  dobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertext;\n}\n```\n\n### Challenge Goals:\n\n1. You got 100% of the private and public key combo produced by the **pollket** Algorithm, a cipher from which you will never break. This was made possible by a beautiful pillow layout-diagram complete with placing all objects in the position of their correct architectural elements. The *parity cipher* was used in",

In encrypting a word, we form the corresponding keyword according to an alphabet, and use it to decode the word.  In decrypting, we form the keyword using the word according to the same alphabet, and replace it with the plaintext the word comes from, in correspondence.\n\nWhile just the simple substitution method works, we focus the on the substitution count in the cipher algorithms, trying to understand or explain them.  Key is a very simple keyword to understand.  Consequently, the count of the number of characters in the keyword plays a key role in the substitution method.  Explain the role of the count of the word in the cipher and deciphering, whether the substitution count is primes or not, or whether awkward deciphering can satisfy the encryption requirement, and what conditions or algorithms can help to meet the requirement.\n\n### Quick walkthrough\n\n- Follow our guidance \"Writing Style: How to write a conclusive report\" (Instructions \\ unlose.pdf content.\n\n### Actual activity\n\n- Let's take Keyword as an example (to be extended to SMT and DT forms).\n\n    1.

With this in mind, he invented a new surveillance system that will be able to track all of the soldiers in his organization.\n\nHe instructed the staff right away to compile a list of all letters. They thought: The alphabet, with an additional 26th letter 'J', has 1, 10, and 26 letters for each vowel, consonant, and the JJsound.\n\nThey make three little boxes for each letter shortly after that. Strings are utilized at a time.\n\nThe question, then, is:\n\n1, He is returning from his daily run and sees a sign. However, somebody changes the signal on his return.\nThe sign was replaced by something that began with 'Y' and had 1 'C', 3 'S', and 11 'R'.\n2, Deciphering this one will need the police and even a few hours to achieve!\n\nPlease provide the answer according to the above assumptions and encryption rules, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[YCYJCR]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nOn a secret computerized network, all of the notorious characters in the world are chatting. For the duration of the communication, there will be only one online per network.\nAlso, they employed an encryption method to protect their data.\n\nEach piece of information starts with captives plucking from all 27 letters of the handwriting outcome. Captains may rule transfer words one by one, obeying the grid described below.\n\nThe captives want to chew on the food, but they don't want anyone to figure out their vocabulary.\n\nThe captives are going to set up a fake dialog with the captives using a sole cipher. After that, they'll get the captives in and hire the captives signed with the captives alphabetically. Turning adjacent seats may improve the word's prominence, based on where it is.\n\n呢新 · Jna, for example, when stabbing left will alternate to 'e' · 豆腐 豆腐'\n\nWhen a captain goes left to the letter T, for example, it can be spelled TT\n\nWhen T moves to the left, so TTG and TTGG will spell TTG.\nThe letters T and TGG can't be separated, no matter what.\n\nBefore more than this, captives them one by one and read in the reverse command.\nA short video of an impending campaign brings them together:\n\nThe captives'll decipher the troop's final outline and join the ranks in the camp with the last guy. That is, lqw\n\nAn imaginative and distinctive symmetric cipher is etched in Troosk, the tool for spelling and numbering, and it will be used to run the campaign:\n\nI will consist of lower case letters A-Z plus 42 extra \"aminoacids\" starting from AA to YZ.\nThe cipher's typoscript has a predetermined structure. Despite having capitals at each side, it is lower case. The first word is GBC, indicating that the building at position BB has the number KA. The structure is in this example:\n\nA message like this is written, and its translation uses the MOBILE cipher previously defined.\n\nInfo:\n\nLove.FWS, BTW.!!\n\nThe code word for the guest's fame will be acquired by using the usual phonetic transcription.\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANBFKOO]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nWord at the End.\nIf it does not become uppercase with newlines, a newline will precede the sentence.\nThere will only be few sentences followed by a banned word in every line.\nHowever, just a single non-key word maybe in a whole sentence that matches the word on the list.\n\nDon't bother with the order in which the words and letters of the wrong word are omitted; it doesn't matter. Identify the words that are rendered illegible.\n\nThe uniformity with which the first message is performed will be acceptable to both unrestricted and enclosed and other configurations. The following is an example of an output from the punctuation, in which each stop is denoted by a newline:\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\n\"WAJCBOTFSHNI\",\n\"OAHNQLMF\",\n\". . . .-.\",\n]\n```\n\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[e wwwkrakro okotoq kmho oixtmpiihmkrebiojj rhjghj txorenjjwhwcp]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nColors judged navy are pleasing to everyone's taste. They want to combine the dull navy with a more contemporary shade of blue.\n\nColors were seen as rainbow smocks, and they were stuffed with blocks of colors that were similarly limited in their palettes. A few whites, some off-whites,  plenty of blacks and greys, and a lot of other decent colors were still there.\nHowever, the debate is to determine whether the hex-colored iPod is approving.\n\n{{\\scriptsizeTTFor the layered dyes, the first} phrase DESCRIPTION should be used.}}}\n\n### Answer:\n[[none none black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black none]]",
