How does [Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kafka) understand it?\n\n![sublation process](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Sublation_illustration.svg/300px-Sublation_illustration.svg.png)\n\nThe above is the metaphor to explain **sublation process** on Wiki.\n\nAccording to N, **sublation process** ([dipolar due process](https://www.iep.utm.edu/dipolar-d/)) is produced by a power form of words. It goes through the pizza process each time it's divided. On the front of the process, the sentiment is formed and reveled. But the very same time, the process is erased behind itself. While the irony of a word gains glory, the power is abused. The end stage of the pizza process is the movement of a mangle, then directly falls into **idiot paradox: extreme mercy + divine madness = pride**. In Z, this process has been going on for several thousand years since *Zarathustra*. And Now, the process of re-sublation itself is ESKIMENES INERSPECIS (The thorough has been beaten into hell by the beast), so the threshold for re-sublation is so high that it cannot be achieved without the light of the sun.\n\nK said that *sublation process* demeans, so it is a guarantee of survival in *Kafka*'s tragic fable. No matter how the lower social forms of consciousness orbit the dominant forms, as long as they do not sacrifice their faith in perfectionism and purity and pursue it to death, the destinies of the universe and humanity will follow the destiny of the hero and his wife, which means that science and art can slowly grow out of the sphere of a fictional world.\n\nWhat's more, K is not against art, and there is no exact time to **sublate** in his comprehension. See *De Die in aeternum* and *Matter and Method*.\n\n### Question:\nRenaissance toddlerism gets away from Zenger's [fiction theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction_theory) by conforming to the realist significance of Nietzsche, namely, \"if you want a paradise, it must be built by men\". Here is a simple problem to summarize everything. In Jameson's `Another City Never Many Use` ([Textual Follow-up](http://www.jaumasmodernismo.org/archivos-1/superficies-in- commentary/comentario-textual/estado-moderno-garces.pdf)), he argues in favor of N's opinions on Italian Renaissance:\n\n> And if you want to use the aesthetic theory of the New Textualism to overcome the anarchy of the literary text, then how to make it make sense? How could this theory enter the modern world, how could it overcome the eternity that is separated by time and space, and monopolize the new world that exists in reality under new conditions? This is a virtual reality exactly in front of you\n\nN cannot satisfy these problems, then Z can do this. And it can finally explain the forgotten meaning behind Z's status theory and currents. This means that this means, this article represents the historical process of the text that is as a real object, and is thus more real than the object itself, and its significance lies in the continuity of the explicit expression of the similarity of the collective consciousness. We must also examine the entire process of existence in the past and the existing historical narrative consciousness. We know that it has shared a priori meaning, that is, the object of the collectivity is beyond the existing historical narrative consciousness. Therefore, this text is the subject of a historical consciousness of the three first considerations; it is thus carefully constructed, but these three texts have a divine warning or the past that have been accustomed to sublimation ), so this text model has already existed at the beginning. But in the process of the discussion of his theory, his conception of parallel inheritance is top-down, but what makes his theory succeed is his reuse of rhetorical technique (Symbolic realist), that is, while inheriting, he basically describes the object that is completely different from that in the first principal space, so that at the same time, he can take advantage of the arcane space of the new text. The historical narrative consciousness has completely changed the awareness of the object, and in fact it is the construction process of the present state of existence in the past. That is to say, as a novel, it is considered by Jameson that it is based on the mainstream aesthetic theories of the second half of the 19th century and is considered to be subject to the modernist discourse of the dominant ideology of the 19th century. Although these are not the most valid reasons, they may also contribute to this. The real problem is to make what the text does is to change the status of the text in return for the principles and development space of the follow-up narrative.\n\nThe emergence of N's caricature theory and contemporary society problem is to bury the pride of the second verse in the light. N's creation process is a rebuttal in the methodology theory, that is, Z cannot guarantee the right to change the comfort of his work, so all the depreciation is right at the beginning. His discourse theory seems to be the most powerful, that is, the pro-art theory of the modernist discourse, namely, the aesthetic theory. Since aesthetics allows for a subjective or opposite interpretation in “reality” in itself, N's caricature resistance to pro-art theory can be identified as an opposition to objectively valid aesthetics. However, this creative act itself is deceptive, as it simply uses another segment of space to separate the inherent construction nature of the text. If N's caricature theory attempts to eliminate the needle-filled space, the metaphorical reality found in the first principal space, it goes against any strategy for redefining the objective reality present in the text, and at this time the creation process is simply explained. That is, Z represents purely creative creativity in the hands of its creator to obtain the most lasting power in the text. **Rather than abstract symbols and metaphors associated with a multitude of objects embedded within the text in his creative process, N's philosophy focuses on the actual understanding of the function that emerges from the discourse that represses and devalues the text.**\n\nZ's fiction theory was directly perverted by N, which is also only an other namespace of Z's philosophical thought.\n\n### Question:\nVasily Spesivtsev's *Morning over Water: Meditations on Water*\n\n• *Boundless Erosion*\n\nThe task, objective, so to speak, of modern art is not to overcome the cancel of water but to enter the primeval chaos [mosh while torrent] of Apollinian echo and to discover its intrinsic power.\n\n— <NAME>\n\n• *Perceptibility*:\n\nStereotyping [putavin] and virtualization [tarasov] always proceed simultaneously with each other, and as a result, a clear, sharp and contant flash of light is needed to separate a huge sea of blurring sensory perception from it, to filter and look for oneself in the disintegrating [order zerkalo], finding the most pure light in it, the most real essence of reality - for which one longs.\n\n— <NAME>\n• *Out of Water*\n\n- Do you see it?

Economic Status Reasons-Consequences\n    - Rule Description:\n        - If a person's economic status benefits some group, there will be a period when that benefit exists (it is maintained) and another period when the benefit does not exist (it is maintained).\n        This is according to `Language of Time`, which in most conditional sentences is expressed as single clauses. Furthermore, when presenting facts, humans do not use 'and' to connect predications, they use 'because'. For example:\n        > \"A man was lost, and he died because he could not find water\"\n        \n    - Symbol: Uln\n        over the course of which times period\n        \n    - Definition: If economic status benefits/suffers some general group `G` during a time period `T` for a person `p`, then that person's economic status will remain consistent with the status of `G` over that time period.\n\n2.

Whatever the reason you enjoy seeing a Matches, the question is what sorts of audience figures matter in order to determine the Matches of a team?\n\nThe answer can either be a percentage of the total audience or a specific figure. It could be that the ratio determines the number of participating fans of the Matches, or 50 percent of the media audience's estimate. It could be that the average amount of domestic matches was high.

The attacker tries to guess the key by setting out a preselected list of possible words. Thanks to the sorting performed on each possible key, the keys can be tested one by one in order, which reduces the chance of returning a key to a value. In a dictionary attack, each word used is checked against all possible combinations of those values. For example, given a plaintext and a one-million-character list of all the English words, producing a hash for guessing is possible in about two seconds; in a brute-force search, where each line must go through all values is only a matter of usb brute force.\n\nWhich of the Extensive Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℆ Definition\nB. ℴ Definition\nC. ⚲ Definition",
