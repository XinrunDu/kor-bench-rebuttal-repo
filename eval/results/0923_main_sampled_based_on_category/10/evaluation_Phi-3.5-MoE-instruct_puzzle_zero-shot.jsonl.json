The sugar-free dieter lost 4 more pounds than the caveman dieter.\n3. The caveman dieter lost more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula used either the gluten-free or caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nFrom Clue (2), we know Mandy => Sugar-Free --> X+4 lbs\nFrom Clue (4), Eula is either Caveman or Gluten Free. Since Caveman dieter lost more pounds than Eula (3), Eula cannot be using Caveman diet, which means Eula used Gluten Free diet.\nFrom Clue (5), Barbara --> 7 lbs.\n\nNow let's assume Eula lost X lbs. Since Eula is not the Caveman dieter, the friend who used the Caveman diet lost X+1 lbs (somewhat more than Eula), which we know is Mandy, meaning Mandy lost X+4 lbs.\n\nSince Barbara's weight loss is a concrete number i.e. 7 lbs, we can pick any number that would satisfy the puzzle for Eula and the respective dieters. Let Eula lose 3 lbs since it's a small value and Mandy and the caveman dieter would lose experiences reasonable values. Then, the friend on the Caveman diet would lose 3+1 = 4 lbs and Mandy would lose 3+4 = 7 lbs. Laura is a dieter name we haven't used yet.\n\nNow we can state the final output:\n\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\nHowever, the original instruction asked for 4 entries with the 'pounds lost' field in the order of 3, 5, 7, 9 respectively, so here is the final result as instructed:\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\nPlease note there are assumptions made in this problem solving, particularly due to the lack of some information which is common in such puzzles. There may be more than one correct answer, or the puzzle may need more details to be fully solvable. In this case, I assumed people lost weight in whole numbers, and that \"somewhat more\" implies one pound more.

Grid size is 4x4, means we will have numbers from 1 to 4 in each row and column without repetition.\n2. We'll fill in numbers and apply the operations on the coordinate pairs.\n3. (1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12* means that the product of these cells' values should be 12.\n4. (1,3)(1,4):5+ means the sum of these cells' values should be 5.\n5. (2,3)(2,4):5+ means the sum of these cells' values should be 5.\n6. (2,1)(3,1):2÷ means the division of these cells' values should equal 2.\n7. (3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8* means the product of these cells' values should be 8.\n8. (4,1)(4,1):1- means the difference of these cells' values should be 1.\n9. (3,4)(4,4):1- means the difference of these cells' values should be 1.\n\nNow, let's solve the puzzle:\n\nFrom 1. and 3., (1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12*, 12 can be produced by the combination of 3, 4, and 1 (3 * 4 * 1 = 12). For simplicity, we'll assign 3 to (1,1), 4 to (1,2), and 1 to (2,2).\n\nFrom 4., (1,3)(1,4):5+, the general combinations that produce 5 are (2,3) or (1,4) with (1,3) as (2,3)+(1,3)=5 or (1,4)+(1,3)=5. Since 1 is already assigned to (2,2), we'll assign 1 to (1,4) and 4 to (1,3).\n\nFrom 5., (2,3)(2,4):5+, this is similar to the previous requirement, and possible combinations are (1,2) with (2,3) or (2,4) as (1,2)+(2,3)=5 or (1,2)+(2,4)=5. Since 4 is assigned to (1,2), we'll assign 2 to (2,3) and 3 to (2,4).\n\nFrom 6., (2,1)(3,1):2÷, the only way is to set (2,1)=4 and (3,1)=2 as 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nFrom 7., (3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8*, considering the numbers we have already used, we can use 1, 2, and 4. Similarly, for simplicity, let's assign 2 to (3,2), 1 to (3,3), and 4 to (4,3) as 2 * 1 * 4 = 8.\n\nFrom 8. and 9., (4,1)(4,1):1- and (3,4)(4,4):1-, we can assign 2 to (4,1) as we already have 1 and 2 on (4,3) and (3,3), respectively. For (3,4), we can use 4 as it doesn't violate any rules, and we can assign 3 to (4,4) since we've used up 2 and 1 elsewhere.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n[[3 4 1 2],[2 1 4 1],[4 2 1 3],[2 3 4 3]]\n\nNote: The puzzle rules are not strict in assigning values to specific cells, so multiple correct answers might exist, but the above one is a possible solution based on the given conditions.",

After this, using the (2,4) > (3,4) statement, we now know the fourth elements of each rows. So the grid will look like this:\n\nX X 4 3\nX X X 2\nX 2 X X\n1 X X X\n\nWe now know that for the third row to be smaller than the second row, it will have to be '2 3 1 4'. Now, the last unknown number can be found because they are unique by row/column. By doing that, we found this solution:\n\n4 1 2 3\n3 4 1 2\n2 3 4 1\n1 2 4 3\n\nThus, the final answer is [[4 1 2 3,3 4 1 2,2 3 4 1,1 2 4 3]].\n\nLet's check it against the inequalities:\n\n1) (2,3) > (3,3) => 1 > 4 (false)\n2) (2,4) > (3,4) => 2 > 1 (true)\n3) (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 4 (true)\n\nError in solution, let's see where we did wrong:\n* 1) We incorrectly assumed that the (2,3) > (3,3) could be 4 > 1, which is false. It should be (2,3) > (3,3) => 4 > 2 *\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n4 2 1 3\n3 4 2 1\n2 1 4 3\n1 3 2 4\n\nNow, let's check all inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 1 > 2 (false)\n\nError again. We should have assumed the number in (2,3) should be greater than (3,3), but less than 4. So it should be 3. Let's fix this again:\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nNow, let's check all inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n\nThe second inequality is still not correct, we assumeed that the number of (2,4) would be 1 but considering the first one we need to increase it by 1, so now it will be 2.\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 2\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequality again:\n\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 2 > 4 (false)\n\nBut because both numbers are in the same list (1,2,3,4) the reference 4 will be emptied when we execute 2>4. We need to know that if the reference is emptied, the sign will be considerated false.\n\nSo let's execute again the previous fix but changing the reference in (3,4):\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequality again:\n\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n\nOur initial mistake is that as it must be a unique number in each row, we couldn't use 1 two times (in the first and fourth rows). We need to change one of them. Also, as we know that two numbers in the column 4 must be equal or less than 2, only 1 can be in row 4. So 1 must not in row 1.\n\nSo let's change it to 4, 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nThat didn't work either, we missed another number relationships: since 2 is between 1 and 3 in row 3 and as the last element must be 1, then the 2 must be in the second position of that row.\n\nSo let's change it to 4 1 3 2\n3 4 2 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 2 4 1\n\nLet's check inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 2 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 1 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nBut as before, the number 1 must be in row 4 and this configuration is illegal.\nWe need to understand that as the first element of the row is 4, that 1 needs to be in a column of position 2,3 or 4. But we cannot put it in column 3, as that will invalidate the first inequality. Also, we cannot put it in column 4, as that will invalidate the second inequality.\n\nSo it must be position 2, which requires a change on the second row. But as it needs to be greater than the 2 on position 2, row 3, it must be 3.\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 3 2 1\n\nLet's check inequalities:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nAnother mistake. In the last board change, the third row is illegal because 1 is in position 3, and it should be in position 4. Trying to adjust positions, we realize that it impacts the other three positions. We will need to change it to place the numbers in order in each column, to get a correct configuration. If we place a 1 in the fourth row, it must be in column 3. Which indicates that row 3 needs to have a 1 in the fourth column. Because (3,2) can't have a 3, that results in a 3 in the (3,2) position.\n\nLet's change it to 4 1 3 2\n3 4 2 1\n2 3 4 1\n4 2 1 3\n\nLet's check inequalities:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 2 > 4 (false)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 1 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 4 (true)\n\nWe must execute the previous correction again. You can clearly see that the value in the third column of the second row needs to be changed from 2 to 3:\n\n4 1 3 2\n3",
