We apply the substitution alphabet where each letter \"H\" and \"V\" corresponds to \"P\" and \"R\" respectively (using the substitution_alphabet order).\n3. After substitution, we obtain \"PR\".\n4. We then move each letter forward by 4 positions in the standard alphabet. \"P\" becomes \"T\" and \"R\" becomes \"V\".\n5. Lastly, for each ciphertext letter, we use the reversed alphabet to find the final encrypted letter:\n   - \"T\" is the 20th letter in the standard alphabet and corresponds to \"G\" in the reversed alphabet.\n   - \"V\" is the 22nd letter in the standard alphabet and corresponds to \"B\" in the reversed alphabet.\n6. The final ciphertext is \"GB\".\n\nHowever, to ensure we follow the provided format and assuming there may have been a mistake in my steps, let me recheck the encryption steps:\n\n1. Substitution of \"H\" and \"V\" in the substitution alphabet should be \"R\" (the 18th letter) and \"D\" (the 4th letter), respectively.\n2. Moving forward by 4 positions: \"R\" becomes \"V\" and \"D\" becomes \"H\".\n3. Reverse mapping: \"V\" maps to \"E\" (15th letter in the standard alphabet) and \"H\" maps to \"S\" (19th letter in the standard alphabet).\n\nThere must have been an error in my initial mapping or shifting process. Here's the corrected encryption process:\n\n1. Substitution alphabet gives us \"R\" for \"H\" and \"D\" for \"V\".\n2. Shifting \"R\" forward by 4 positions in the standard alphabet results in \"V\".\n3. n=4 positions backward in the reversed alphabet: \"V\" goes back to \"R\" (as \"R\" is the 18th letter in both the standard and reversed alphabet), and \"D\" goes back to \"Z\".\n4. Reversed alphabet positions: \"R\" corresponds to \"I\" and \"Z\" to \"A\".\n\nAfter confirming again through the process, the correct encrypted letters should have been obtained, as \"I\" and \"A\". However, following the rules as given (and assuming there are no errors in understanding or transcribing them), the final encrypted result should consistently apply the general rule with these steps:\n\n1. Substitution of \"H\" and \"V\" is correct; both are mapped to \"R\" and \"D\" respectively.\n2. Shifting \"R\" and \"D\" by 4 positions forwards: \"R\" becomes \"V\" and \"D\" becomes \"H\".\n3. Using the reversed_alphabet to find corresponding letters: \"V\" maps to \"E\" and \"H\" maps to \"S\".\n\nThere seem to be inconsistencies in the decryption steps provided with the encryption rule. Let's consider the encryption progressions:\n\n1. Substitution yields \"RD\".\n2. Shift forward by 4 gets \"VH\".\n3. Reversed_alphabet mapping: \"V\" to \"E\" and \"H\" to \"S\".\n\nThere seems to be an error because E corresponds to \"V\" in the reversed alphabet, but using the processed values, we should indeed get \"SB\" as the encrypted ciphertext for \"HV\". It is possible there's been a misunderstanding or misprint in the instructions or the provided cipher text expectation.\n\nUpon verification of these rules and reiterating the encryption process, the output should align as:\n\n```\nH -> R -> V -> E -> S\nV -> D -> H -> I -> B\n\nSo we have the ciphertext components \"S\" and \"B\", which do not correspond to \"GB\".\n\nLet's correct the final steps considering what's expected based on the instructions:\n\n1. After substitution and shifting: \"RD -> VH\"\n2. Reversed_alphabet mapping:\n   - \"V\" back to \"E\"\n   - \"H\" back to \"S\"\n\nSince V maps to E in reversed_alphabet, and H maps to S, the correct encrypted answer according to provided instructions should actually be \"ES\". However, as there's no 'ES' as an output per the initial question format, there's most likely been an error when mapping and shifting.\n\nHere's the corrected encrypted solution with step-by-step validation:\n\n1.
