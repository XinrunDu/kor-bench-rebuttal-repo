The only way for this implication to be false is if p1 is true and the conjunction on the right side of the implication is false. Since the conjunction includes p1 (a true part), it cannot be false. Therefore, this formula cannot be true under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\nFor the first part of this formula, p1 implies the negation of p1. This statement is always false, as p1 cannot be both true and false at the same time. Since the implication is false, we only need to consider the truth value of ~p2 in the second part of the formula. If ~p2 is true, then the entire formula is false. However, if ~p2 is false, then p2 is true, and the formula can have true assignments (e.g., p1=x and p2=✓). This means that the formula is not false under all assignments, and hence it is not a Falsehood Formula by definition.\n\nSince both formula components are false under specific assignments, neither is a Truth Formula.

However, because it is combined with &p2 using the AND operation, the entire expression (~(p1=::>p2)&p2) can never be true under all assignments (p2 must always be true for the expression to be true, but p1 cannot always be false). Thus, it is not a Truth Formula and it is not a Falsehood Formula either (since it's not always false).\n- The correct classification is C. Neither.\n\nFor sub-question (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n\n- For the left side of the equation, (p1&p3) is true only if both p1 and p3 are true.\n- For the right side of the equation, (~p1&~p2) is true only if both p1 is false and p2 is false.\n\n- There is no assignment where both sides can be true simultaneously. Specifically, when p1 or p2 is true, the right side (~p1&~p2) cannot be true, and when p1 and p3 are true, the left side (p1&p3) does not necessarily lead to the right side (~p1&~p2) being true (unless p2 is also false).\n- This formula is also neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it's not always false or always true.\n- The classification is C. Neither.\n\nCombining the answers for both sub-questions, the final answer is [[C];[C]].",

A is a tautology, which means the principal disjunctive normal form includes all 16 paired conjunctive terms.\n3. A is also a basic formula, meaning it contains at least one paired conjunctive term.\n\nSince it is a tautology with all paired conjunctive terms, we need to ensure the paired conjunctive terms' indices are included in the notation. For a tautology with 4 variables, the paired conjunctive terms are indexed from 0 to 15 (16 terms in total) in ascending order.\n\nSince A is both a tautology and a basic form, it must contain at least one of these paired conjunctive terms. So, we denote A with Mi, where i is the index of the paired conjunctive term.

LetClauseShift Method\n\nThe reasoning above misinterprets the distribution of the characteristic \"being a Chinese billionaire\" across the group of \"Chinese people.\" The correct logical structure should recognize that while all Chinese billionaires are Chinese people, not all Chinese people are necessarily billionaires. This error in inference is due to shifting or misinterpreting the relationship between the two categories, which fits the description of the LetClauseShift Method. Hence, the logical fallacy committed here is due to the Erroneous adjustment of a logical structure, causing a shift that leads to an invalid conclusion.\n\n[[J]]",

It erroneously draws a conclusion that if some students are doctors, then some students must not be doctors. This is an incorrect inference because the existence of some students who are doctors does not imply that there are some students who are not doctors. The error lies in the assumption that the negation of the existence of a property (some students are doctors) implies the existence of the negation of that property (some students are not doctors).\n\nFormatted output: [[D]]",
