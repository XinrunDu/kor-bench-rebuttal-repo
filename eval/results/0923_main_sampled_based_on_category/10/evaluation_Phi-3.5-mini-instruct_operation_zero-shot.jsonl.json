Since 25 and 5 are multiples of each other (25 = 5 * 5), we use the first rule: a※b = a/b + 2. \n   So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Now we have 7※X = 4. We need to consider the rule based on whether X is a multiple of 7 or not.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7\nSince the rule states that if a is not a multiple of b (7※X from our previous step), then a※b = 24, but that cannot be true since our current result 7※X is already 4, not 24. So, X cannot be a multiple of 7.\n\nCase 2: X is not a multiple of 7\nUnder this assumption, the rule would imply that 7※X = 24. However, this contradicts our earlier result of 7※X equal to 4.\n\nSince neither assumption works, there seems to be a contradiction. Here's the key: The operation rule only applies when the first part of the operation (7※X) results in a fractional number. Since we already have 7※X equal to 4 (a whole number), we can't apply the operation to get a result of 4.\n\nTherefore, within the given operation rules, there is no value of X that would satisfy the expression 25※5※X=4.
