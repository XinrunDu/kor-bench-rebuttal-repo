For example, if we have a person with a birthday of 10, the possible birthdays under this condition for a person born on 10 contain 11, 12, 13, and 14. However, every person in all possible types has different birthdays according to their birthday. We need to make a dictionary `birth` where for each person we will have key and value in the same line, and then [`birth[Birthday)]` function takes `birthday` as an argument and returns the corresponding unique element in `birth`.\n\nAlso, note that given a person A, we actually need to check if he/she was born on the month of birth PreviewHomework6_lesson_2_R and if no, we need to do the same conditional for `if_1` and not forget to check if the person not born on the month of birth `PreviewHomework6_lesson_1`.\n\nLastly, we need to calculator the total number of years which with these birthdays we have a day of the week (MORNING, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT) and append ~sign to it so it is more understandable, such a way:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nday_of_week = {'M': ['MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY'], 'T': ['THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY'], 'W': ['SUNDAY', 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY']}.get(\n    datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m').split('-')[-2], 'M')\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\n```\n\nAs noted in #1, we can iterate over all possible birthdays and check if the person is a member of this list (if iterate for breaking the loop uses `if_1`) and if not, add it into list. Finally, for example:\n\n```python\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+day_of_week[m_list[2][1]][2]+day_of_week[m_list[3][1]][3]+day_of_week[m_list[4][1]][4])\n```\nAs said in #2, for example if we further iterate in dictionary a year after the birthday then the person should not be considered a member of this year's birthday Checklist:\n\n```python\nbirth = [None] * 100\nbirth[97] = 2015\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 4}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+int(m_list[2][1]*3)+int(m_list[3][1]*2)\n)\n```\n\nI hope the rule is clear:\n\n`create a dictionary `birth` and then implementing habits `helloToContents`. Then check \"are you going to be excluded\" the person by creating counter value `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")`. Display the counter value as `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")` and then iterate what I described in comment in the problem statement and return `ans = str(CASEOF(\"-5..5\"))`\n\n```\nCASEOF(dir())\neach case of size 5\n```\n\nThen return the solution.",

The answers may not be entirely representative of those who intended this puzzle to be solved for AI machines.\n\n1. The diagonal paths may not all contain two numbers.\n\nSolution:\n\n2. 5+ means that the sum of numbers on the bottom-row equals the sum of numbers on the top-row.\n\n3. Maybe consider 3 numbers on the bottom-row, 3 numbers on top-row, 1 number in the middle-row.\n\n4. For each row, find the number that is the last number in that row and divide it by two, put that in the variable of next number column.\n\n5. For each row, find the number that is the last number in that row and multiply it by two.\n\n6. Find the missing number, it is the sum of all numbers, and decide depending on the difference. \nFor example, I can interpret your answer is: A,B,C,D,E,F,G (which includes 3 numbers in each pair) then \n\n7. Since the starting grid was 4*4, the answer will be 4*4*4=8*4=32.\n\n8. The answer of the question is the sum of all numbers, \n\n9. Now I know the answer is 88, we can find next number by comparing each answer with the starting grid in rows 2,3 and 4 to show which grid is correct.\n\nThen I have tests for 3 rows, and to check which ones is always correct. Then I restart with the 3rd grid, since the 3rd row always also works.\n\nFinally I use the biggest numbers with the rest of grid and we are done. \n\n[ * 1,4,3,2,4,\n3,2,4,1,\n2,4,3,2,\n4,3,2,1,3,1,\n]\n  \nplease apply the rule and answer all four where we can in order to determine the missing size in order value.
