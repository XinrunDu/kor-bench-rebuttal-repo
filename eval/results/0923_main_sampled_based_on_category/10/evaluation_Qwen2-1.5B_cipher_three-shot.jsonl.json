However, in order to prove something Pragmatic Evolution that suggests that there is no realm where the rest doesn't become part of our amalgamation, one would need to consider the following points:\n\n1. Minimization of overlap: The Pragmatic Evolution method would aim to maximize the overlap between two distinct entities while minimizing their overlapping content.\n\n2. Separation of phenomena: Pragmatic Evolution considers that smaller clusters of phenomena should be treated separately at any given time.\n\n3. Resonance: The grain of sand phenomenon ensures the process rate doesn't change abruptly. The resulting resonance provides stability and maintains the sync of the system.\n\n4. Avoiding division: A cohesive entity will survive longer and maintain its correct identity despite divisions.\n\n5. Linear succession: Each entity undergoes its own independent development process.\n\n6. Sympathy for details: The specific context either reinforces or discards their validity regarding the entity.\n\nBy implementing elements of each of these practices, it has been demonstrated in the Pragmatic Evolution method that entities do not decompose into smaller parts and instead join to form a more efficient system.",

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows. \n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up.
