Since L=¬p and L'=p, dispel(C1, C2) = q, as q ∨ q = q. \n- Now S2 considers q, but it was already contained in S1, so we don't add it.\n- Now take (¬p ∨ q) and (q), there is nothing to be resolved here.\n- Then take (p ∨ q) and (q), again nothing to be resolved.\n  \n**Check S2**: S2 contains no new elements, so we don't add anything.

Therefore, we add S1 to S0, S1 becomes S2 (which is currently empty), and S2 is cleared.\n\nSince no new clauses have been added, and we end up with S2 empty, no further iterations need to take place.
