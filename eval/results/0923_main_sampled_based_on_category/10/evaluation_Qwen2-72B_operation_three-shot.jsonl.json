The user is asked to apply this operation to multiple sets of integer values, and should arrive at the correct numerical result for each. \n\nPart #2: Presenting answers as a single number in double square brackets like [[your answer]]\nUsage: <2,3,4,2> = 14, so the answer should be presented as [[14]]. This format keeps answers organized and consistent, and helps to distinguish between instructive text and actual solutions.\n\nPart #3: Double-checking answers\nUsage: The user should verify that their answer accurately follows the operation rules. For example, <4,3,7,1> = 2*(4)*(3) + 7 - 1 = 30. After initial calculation, the user should double-check their work to make sure 30 is the correct answer.\n\nPart #4: Solving if condition is met\nUsage: <4,X,8,3> = 29 means that 2*(4)*(X) + 8 - 3 = 29. Recalculating, we get 8X + 5 = 29-> 8X = 24 -> X = 3. Therefore, X should be 3, or presented in double square brackets as [[3]].
