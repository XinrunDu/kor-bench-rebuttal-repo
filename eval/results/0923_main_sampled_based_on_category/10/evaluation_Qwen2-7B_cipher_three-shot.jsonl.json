For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[OAPALU]]\n\nBelow is an explanation of the cipher operations you need to perform for both encryption and decryption:\n\n1. **Encryption Steps (for the \"Plaintext\" question):**\n   - For each plaintext character `p`:\n     - If `p` is an uppercase letter and exists in the Polybius square:\n       - Replace `p` with the number of rows and columns (both counted from 1) in which the character appears.\n     - In particular, O, which does not exist in the Polybius square, is replaced by 66.\n   - This is equivalent to looking up the character in the Polybius square and replacing it with its corresponding code. For example, \"R\" in the Polybius square is replaced with '11', \"W\" is replaced with '22', and \"Q\" is replaced with '43'.\n   - If `p` is not in the Polybius square, it should be replaced with 66. This is done because \"O\" is not in the square. Therefore, \"O\" in the plaintext will be replaced with '66' in the ciphertext.\n   - As for the special case of \"N\", which is in the Polybius square, it will be replaced by '51' in the ciphertext.\n\nExample: Plaintext is \"North\". The corresponding ciphertext will be: \"14325234345343415553451425134314243243343115142\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps (for the \"Ciphertext\" question):**\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc in the given ciphertext:\n     - Based on the rows and columns denoted by CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid.\n     - If CrCc=66, replace with \"O\". This means that any occurrence of \"66\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"O\" in the plaintext.\n   - This is the reverse operation of encryption. In other words, you need to look up the corresponding character in the Polybius square for each pair of numbers and construct the plaintext.\n\nExample: Ciphertext is \"36634441131153143612\". The corresponding plaintext is \"OAPALU\".",

        "response": "[[QF]]\n\nI apologize for the mistake. Here is the detailed breakdown of the decryption process for the plaintext \"C\":\n\nGiven that the plaintext is \"C\", we first convert the letter \"C\" to its corresponding positional value in the LETTERS list. Since \"C\" is located at position 7 in the list, its positional value is 7.\n\nNext, we use the Initial sequence of cards and the keystream algorithm to generate a keystream value for \"C\". In this case, the keystream value is \"S\". The keystream value \"S\" corresponds to position 8 in the LETTERS list.\n\nNow, we perform the decryption steps:\n1. We calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"S\" by using the keystream value \"S\" and the differentiated mod 26 operation. Thus, x = (8 - 7) % 26 = 1 % 26 = 1.\n2. We use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 1. Therefore, the decrypted plaintext character is \"A\".\n\nThe decryption process for the plaintext \"C\" results in the ciphertext \"S\".",
