Since we have the substitution ~p1=::>q with some q > p1, and (p1=::>~p1)=::>(p1&~p2), then we can simplify to p1&p2, and combining is (p1&p2)=::>p2, which is true.

Start by understanding the nomenclature: p1, p2, p1=::>p2, and ~p1&~p2 are Level A formulas.\n2. Apply the priority of connectives: ~p1&~p2 is a Level B formula.\n3. The given expression is (~p1&~p2)&p2.\n4. Simplify using de Morgan's laws:\n   (F实践活动逻辑计算/cqzwqzwq^qcz).\n   Simplified to: ~p1&p2.\n5. Apply the complement operation:\n   (F实践活动逻辑计算/cqzwqzwq^qcz).\n   Simplified to: ~q.\n6. Apply De Morgan's laws:\n   ~(p1&p2).\n   Simplified to: ~p1||p2.\n7. The analyzed expression involves a higher level of logical connective (~), hence the answer candidate is [B].\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n1. Again break down into nomenclature: p1, p2, p1&p3, and ~p1&~p2 are Level A formulas.\n2. Apply de Morgan's laws in step 1: (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2).\n3. The simplified expression involves three Level B formulas: p1, ~p1, p2, and ~p2, which is consistent with Level B formulas since their sum yields p1. Therefore, the answer is [B].\n\n### Final Answer:\nC;C;B",
