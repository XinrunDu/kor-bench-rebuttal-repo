For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z]]\n\nTo solve the given cipher, we need to apply the specified encryption and decryption steps as per the provided instructions. Here's the solution:\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n1. For each lowercase letter `p` in `plaintext`:\n   - If `p` is an uppercase letter (A-Z), calculate an index from 2 to `key_index + 1` using the ASCII values of uppercase letters minus the ASCII values of `p`.\n   - Convert this index to an 8-bit binary string and shift it to the left to calculate `2^p`.\n2. Convert every pair of characters (ASCII values) from `p` to `k` to uppercase.\n3. Add the transformed characters.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. For each uppercase letter `p` in `ciphertext`:\n   - Calculate the index of `p` from the Automaton Table.\n   - Reverse it by shifting the result to the right once.\n   - Use the ASCII value of the resulting index to get the original character.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given examples:\n\n**Scenario 1: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"K\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"K\":\n  - `p` is 'K' (ASCII: 110)\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, calculate index: (110 - 97) = 2\n  - p is not a lowercase letter, convert to uppercase: 'K'\n  - Add k to the result: 110 + 111 = 1110\n- Step 2: Calculate index by shifting index 2 to the left: index value remains index 5\n- Step 3: Convert index to characters: 'K'\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nK\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"3^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"3^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, convert to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 2 to the result: 1110 + 202 = 812\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n81\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"6^13^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"6^13^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is not an uppercase letter even though it is in uppercase letters.\n  - Calculate index: 88\n  - Shift the index to the right once: new index is 13\n  - Convert back to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 13 to the result: 88 + 131 = 219\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[10^2]\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter is encrypted to '7':\n  - Calculate the digit 7 in base 10 (7/10 = 0 remainder 7): 07\n\nNow, output the encrypted string: [[[07]]]\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[[07]]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 5: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^13^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^13^1\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` + 1 = 176 (not 7:8)\n  - Calculate `2^13` + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNumber of characters to rotate left: 7 - 1 + 1 = 7\nRotated integer: `999 <= index <= 1010`\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[7]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 6: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Decryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024 (not 7:8)\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter the encrypted string `[7]` corresponds to (eleven):\n  - Since the index `p` is `7`, it maps to `[7]`, and indexing from 0 up to `key_length - 1` is `0 - 7 + 1 = -6 + 1 = 10^10 - (1 - 7 + 1) = 10^10 - 3`\n\nNow, output the string based on the mapping:\n```\n[['[7]']]\n```\n\nLet's write the corresponding Python code to verify these steps:\n```python\ndef encrypt(input_string, key):\n    ciphertext = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') - 1  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so 0 -> 5: key_index = 65 - 65 = 0\n    shifted_indices = [i ^ (index ^ key_index) for i, index in enumerate(key)]\n    plain_text = [(ord(c) ^ k if is_uppercase(c) else ord(c.lower()) ^ k) for c, k in zip(input_string, range(26))]\n    \n    for c, is_upper in zip(plain_text, unique_range(26, key_length, key_index)):\n        c = chr((is_upper * len(c)) + ord(c))\n        ciphertext += c\n    \n    return ciphertext\n\ndef decrypt(ciphertext, key):\n    output = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') -

num < ord('f') + 10 or (num < 10 and ord('0') <= ord('a') < ord('f') + 10) or (num < 10 and 10 <= ord('a') - num < ord('f') + 10)\n\ndef special_keys(two_key_repetition, auto_repeat):\n    return [(v, (i, j)) for v in itertools.chain(y for y, _ in automaton if _)]  # Assuming each letter pairs with a automaton result\n\nnum_index_to_index(10)  # Assuming num_index_to_index starts at index 0 here\n```\n\nIn this verification guide, we've implemented the encryption and decryption processes based on the reasoning as presented. Note that the actual implementation might use a different structure, but the key patterns and logic are preserved.",

Since the keyword is not mentioned or stated explicitly, we can infer that it is likely a locale or language code. Furthermore, the plaintext is set as uppercase and includes apostrophes, which are not allowed in the keyword.\n\n## Step 2: Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules\nThe rule states that the plaintext and keyword should be encrypted using the application's language for encryption. The encryption function must be able to determine the application's locale, which can be done by parsing the keyword to analyze its content encoding.\n\n## Step 3: Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols\nThe output format should be [[encrypted answer]] in square brackets. This matches the format specified in the rule for output.\n\n## Step 4: Review and confirm that the output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format\nThe output format is correctly adhered to according to the specified rules.\n\n## Step 5: Recap the solution in a coherent manner with explanations\nThere is no unique approach to solving this problem as it involves cryptographic algorithms and encryption techniques that do not follow a single formula or method. However, the use of algorithms, complexity, and intricate steps to decode the message aligns with secure encryption practices. The solution describes how to encrypt the payload received, modify the message to include the keyword, and then decrypt it to reveal the original plaintext. The output format's matching nature and adherence to the specified rules suggest consistency in the application's encryption process.",

However, I can explain how to solve such problems. To decrypt a cipher, we need to understand the encryption process. Here are the general steps for decrypting a cipher:\n\n1. Analyze the ciphertext and number of rows and columns.\n2. If the single row encryption method is used, calculate the total number of rows (R) and column counts (C).\n3. If the column-by-column encryption method is used, calculate the total number of columns (C) and rows (R).\n4. Identify the repeated letter key used in each column or row combination. If a repeat key is found, transpose each row or column to find the decrypted content.\n5. If the repeated key is found and consistent, perform a step-by-step decryption procedure.\n\nCould you please provide the information specified in the cipher rules and come up with the decryption algorithm?",
