Then, we will determine the level, type of ⊥ (the proposition that is always false) based on the propositional logic rules provided. Finally, we will evaluate another proposition (q1 =::~(q2 or q3)) to check its truth value under specific assignment values of q1, q2, and q3.\n\n#### Step 1: Convert \"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\nThe given proposition \"p1 if and only if p2 is false\" can be specified in propositional logic as:\n∼(p1=::>p2) using ¬(p1➜p2) as de-INTERCAL equivalent, where (x, y) is used to denote \"x if and only if y\" (only if after \"if and only\") and x➜y, x➡y are used to denote both conditional relations.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the level of ⊥.\nGiven the definition of the level of a formula:\n- Formulas containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula are Level C formulas. Since \"not ~x\" is equivalent to \"x,\" a Level C formula can have both \"~\" operators.\n- Formulas without parentheses follow the priority of logical connectives.\n- Not a propositional variable, thus $\\{\\text{Nested Composition},\\{\\text{Top-End Composition}\\}, \\{06 : c_d \\circledast_3\\}$.\n\nAt the same time, an atomic proposition represented as $¬\\text{p}_1 \\bot \\text{p}_2$, there exists no hypothesis(s) that can universally assert or deny this inferences, thus determining that \"⊥ (Falsehood Formula)\" fits this formula.\n\n#### Step 3: Direct Evaluation of q1:=~(q2 or q3)\nPropositions are assigned truth values within Assignment Rules. List of all provisos and assumptions: $\\{ \\{\\}&p_1,q_2 \\to q_3\\\\ \\{(|)& (\\hat{\\rm :} \\;\\#\\text{z} \\to \\# \\;) q_1\\\\ \\{(')' \\text{ False False }\\}\\\\ \\{\\}(p_1 ~\\leftrightarrow~ p_2)\\}\\\\ \\{$if...then/conditional with an unique gondola\nThere are 4 assignment rules:\n1) ¬p2 is true because of assignment rule 4 (when assigning two false values, no assignment can be true).\n2) Taking whatever value q2 may be assigned, q2 would return true when reflected in rule 1, thus making ¬p2 return false.\n3) ¬(<>) is true because of rule 1\n4) Given that p1 ≠ p2 as rule 2 (which if ¬p1 = > p2 were to be true, ¬p1 m × p2 would be stronger for ensuring strict separation between inconsistencies or finite, like p1=\"pipeline\" and p2=\"pipeline-chain\" can never be true at the same time. Levels: ⊥ The hierarchy prioritization: (5:) Left Branch (∧) Hidden Chain ((6:) a ≤ b) Level B Level C A Formula (6) level and ¬(5:.) level Level D ✓|x is a true disjunctual detriment to truth, Level E\n\nGiven assignment values for q1~q3:\nq1 -> ⊥ as it involves contradicting false assignments.\nq2 -> falsely as it relies on q1 and a true proposition like p2 = \"pipeline-chain\" may likely appear as q2.\nThus, (q1:.../ q2:.../ q3:...) does not provide marking truth or falsity. ∀x [x == false]\n\nLevel: Level Z Type: Z+n (n = 1), thus z nor + or others, if statement p1 if and only if p2 is asserted to be false and the disjunctive denial of the equivalent interdisjunction may not unify both aspects as a negation nest can be made out of a negation, if fictional a conjunctive argument. Truth Value: (q1:.../ q2:.../ q3:...) does not provide marking true or false. ∀x [x == false]\n\nLevel: Level Z Type: Z2+n (n = 1), thus z2 nor +2 etc, truth is included within a serial sequence of transform, truth or falsity cannot be accounted for. Note: if ¬q1 and q2;! q3,¬ qk for k = ...1,2,3....\n\nThis is a rather complex task and thus it is understood that direct shortcuts might be needed to figure out which assignment's negation fulfills the structure that leads to binding false values for q1,q2,q3. Through logic, equivalence:\n\np1 =::> ~p2\np1=p2 is false, as truth value q1:\nq2=~q3\n\nWe have decided the position for capital P, whereas q1 is [q2 = ~q3].\n\nB = \"Falsehood Formula\" acknowledged truth for Logic Notation Sortials. This assignment would amount to [true,negation-valued-q2=true,false]= ⊥.",
