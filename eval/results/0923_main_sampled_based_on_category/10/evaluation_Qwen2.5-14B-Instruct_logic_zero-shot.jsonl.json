This is because no matter what values p1, p2, and p3 are assigned (true or false), the formula always evaluates to true. If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false. Thus, this compound formula will always be true.\n\nSo, the final answer as requested: [[A];[A]].",

The conjunction of x&p2(x) evaluates to x.\n\nSince the formula is not true or false in all cases, it is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula.\n\nFor formula (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n- We need to consider all combinations of p1, p2, and p3.\n- For combinations like (p1=✓, p2=✓, p3=✓), we get (✓&✓)=(x&x), which simplifies to ✓=x, which is false.\n- For combinations like (p1=x, p2=x, p3=x), we get (x&x)=(✓&✓), which simplifies to x=✓, which is false.\n- There are multiple such combinations, but the key is to find a combination which could provide a true outcome. Since we can find combinations that yield false results and can't guarantee a true result for every assignment, it's not a truth formula. Further, given the overall structure, we can't guarantee a false result for every assignment either.

However, it does not describe the origin and evolution of the term (which would be characteristic of ℓ Definition), nor does it seem to redefine the term for new usage or simplify its meaning (which would be characteristic of ∇ Definition). Instead, it reports the meaning and usage of the term as it is understood in philosophical contexts, fitting the description of ℵ Definition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[[A]]",

The erroneous inference \"Therefore, some students are not doctors\" can be represented as ∃x (Student(x) ∧ ¬Doctor(x)), which is not logically deducible from the initial statement.
