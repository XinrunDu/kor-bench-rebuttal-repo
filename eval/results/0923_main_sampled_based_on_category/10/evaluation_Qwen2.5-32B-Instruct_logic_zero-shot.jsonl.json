It is False if p1 is True (T) and p2 is False (F).\n- Therefore, \"~(p1=::>p2)\" would be True if p1 is True and p2 is False, and False otherwise.\n- Then, combining with \"p2\", the formula would be:\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is False (because \"(~(T=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is False and p2 is False (because \"(~(F=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - True when p1 is False and p2 is True (because \"(~(F=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is True (because \"(~(T=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n\nBased on this analysis, the formula is not true under all assignments and not false under all assignments. So it is Neither.\n\n### Formula 2: (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"(p1 & p3)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p3 are True. It is False otherwise.\n- The part \"(~p1 & ~p2)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p2 are False. It is False otherwise.\n- Therefore, we need to check if the conditions for truth of \"(p1 & p3)\" match the conditions for truth of \"(~p1 & ~p2)\". They clearly don't match under any assignment because the conditions for both being True or False require opposite states of p1.\n\nGiven the contradictory requirements to make both parts of the equivalence true or false under the same conditions, it's clear this formula doesn't hold true for any assignment neither does it hold false for all assignments under every possible state of truth for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nBased on this, the formula should be classified as Neither.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n[[C];[C]]",

That's because \"if ✓ and ✓, then ✓\" is true, and \"if ✓ and x, then ✓\" is also true.\n- If p1 is false (x):\n    - (x&p2)=::>x holds true because \"if false, then anything\" is the definition of an ‘if, then’ where the condition (p1&p2) can never be true if p1 is false.\n- Therefore, this part ((p1&p2)=::>p1) is likewise always true, making it a **Truth Formula** as well.\n\nSo:\n- (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula.\n- (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 is a Truth Formula.\n\nThe answer should inherently be [[A];[A]].",
