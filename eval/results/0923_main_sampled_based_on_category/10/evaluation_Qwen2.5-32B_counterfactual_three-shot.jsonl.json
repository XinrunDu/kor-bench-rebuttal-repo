Sulfur is also often used in traditional medicine as well as to hide the smells of fish.  Unfortunately sulfates from polluted air can create acid rain.  When acid rain mixes with water, low pH levels create toxic water for fish.   Is yacht racing good or bad for fish in the bay?\nA:\n\nGiven the information provided, yacht racing on its own is not inherently good or bad for fish in the bay. However, any activity that contributes to air pollution could indirectly harm fish populations. This is because air pollution can increase the levels of sulfates in the atmosphere, which can react with other pollutants to form acid rain. When acid rain mixes with water, it can create toxic conditions that are harmful to fish and other aquatic life. Therefore, while yacht racing does not directly impact fish in the bay, any associated air or water pollution could have a detrimental effect on aquatic ecosystems. To minimize potential harm, it is important to take measures to reduce emissions and pollution from all sources, including recreational activities like yacht racing.",
