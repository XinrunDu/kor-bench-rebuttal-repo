Since the key is longer than the ciphertext, use the first two bytes of the key:\n     - Byte 1: `0x27 ^ 0x73 = 0x54` (T)\n     - Byte 2: `0xad ^ 0xef = 0x42` (B)\n\n4. **Convert Byte Sequence to Plaintext:**\n   - Convert the byte sequence `[0x54, 0x42]` back to a string:\n     ```\n     \"TB\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The decrypted plaintext is:\n     ```\n     [[TB]]\n     ```\n\nThus, the decrypted answer is: [[TB]].",
