        "response": "To determine the classification of the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, we need to follow the steps outlined in the logic rule:\n\n1. **Identify the propositional variables and their negations:**\n   The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r contains the propositional variables p, q, and r, and their negations ¬p, ¬q, and ¬r. Each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and they are arranged in ascending order of subscripts (or lexicographical order).\n\n2. **Determine the paired conjunctive term:**\n   The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a paired conjunctive term because it meets the criteria specified in the logic rule.\n\n3. **Convert the true assignment to a binary number and then to a hexadecimal number:**\n   The true assignment of ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is 000 (since all variables are false). The binary number 000 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n\n4. **Determine the notation for the paired conjunctive term:**\n   According to the rule, the paired conjunctive term ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is denoted as m0.\n\n5. **Analyze the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF):**\n   The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a single term, which is m0. This means the PDNF of ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is simply m0.\n\n6. **Classify the formula based on the PDNF:**\n   - **Tautology:** A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r only includes m0, it is not a tautology.\n   - **Contradiction:** A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0, it is not a contradiction.\n   - **Basic formula:** A basic formula includes m0. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0, it is a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes only even indices. The index of m0 is 0, which is even, so ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes only odd indices. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0 (index 0, which is even), it is not an all-odd formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is classified as:\n- Basic formula\n- All-even formula\n\nThus, the answer is: [[C, D]].",

The binary number 001 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1. Therefore, this term is denoted as m1.\n   - For (p∧q∧r), the true assignment is 111 (since p is 1, q is 1, and r is 1). The binary number 111 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7. Therefore, this term is denoted as m7.\n\n3. **Construct the principal disjunctive normal form:**\n   - The principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of the formula is m1 ∨ m7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the properties of the formula:**\n   - **Tautology:** A tautology includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms. Here, n = 3, so there should be 8 paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 ∨ m7) does not include all 8 terms, so it is not a tautology.\n   - **Contradiction:** A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 ∨ m7) includes two terms, so it is not a contradiction.\n   - **Basic formula:** A basic formula includes m0. The formula (m1 ∨ m7) does not include m0, so it is not a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes paired conjunctive terms with even indices. The formula (m1 ∨ m7) includes m1 and m7, which are both odd indices, so it is not an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes paired conjunctive terms with odd indices.
