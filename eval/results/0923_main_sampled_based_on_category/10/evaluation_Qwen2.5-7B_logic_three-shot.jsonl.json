How can this expression be denoted?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n   - We need to find the paired disjunctive terms for the given expression.\n   - The expression is (¬p∨q∨¬r)∧(p∨¬q∨r).\n\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns:\n   - The expression is a conjunction of two disjunctive forms. Each part will contribute to the overall set of disjunctive terms.\n   - For (¬p∨q∨¬r), we have:\n     - When ¬p∨q∨¬r is true, the binary number corresponding to the true assignment is determined by the positions of q, r, and ¬p (since p is in the opposite state).\n     - Similarly, for p∨¬q∨r, we need to determine the true assignments.\n\n3. Ensure the output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols:\n   - Determine the indices of the paired disjunctive terms.\n   - Denote the expression using the standard notation.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Evaluate (¬p∨q∨¬r):\n   - ¬p corresponds to the index of -p in the binary representation.\n   - q corresponds to the index of q.\n   - ¬r corresponds to the index of ¬r.\n   - For p to be in the opposite state, we need to consider the complement of p, which affects the indices.\n\n2. Evaluate (p∨¬q∨r):\n   - p corresponds to the index of p.\n   - ¬q corresponds to the index of ¬q.\n   - r corresponds to the index of r.\n   - For q to be in the opposite state, we need to consider the complement of q, which affects the indices.\n\n3. Determine the indices and denote the expression:\n   - The expression (¬p∨q∨¬r) can be represented as a disjunction of six terms (since each variable or its negation can be true).\n   - The expression (p∨¬q∨r) can also be represented as a disjunction of six terms.\n\n4. Determine the paired disjunctive terms:\n   - The paired disjunctive terms are formed by combining the indices from both expressions.\n\n#### Results:\n- Pairred disjunctive terms: m3, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10.\n- The expression is denoted as M3∧M6∧M7∧M8∧M9∧M10.\n\n### Answer:\n[[paired disjunctive terms:M3∧M6∧M7∧M8∧M9∧M10];[denoted:M3∧M6∧M7∧M8∧M9∧M10]]\n\n### Question:\nGive an example for a 4-argument formula A that includes the following terms: m2, m3, m6. The answer is in the format [[formula:]].\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n   - We need to construct a 4-argument formula that includes the terms m2, m3, m6.\n\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns:\n   - A 4-argument formula means it contains four variables: p, q, r, s.\n   - The terms m2, m3, and m6 correspond to specific true assignments.\n   - Determine the conditions under which these terms are true.\n\n3. Ensure the output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols:\n   - Construct the formula such that it includes the specified terms.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Analyze the terms:\n   - m2: Represents the truth assignment 100 (p=1, q=0, r=0).\n   - m3: Represents the truth assignment 101 (p=1, q=0, r=1).\n   - m6: Represents the truth assignment 110 (p=1, q=1, r=0).\n\n2. Create the formula:\n   - The formula should include terms that are true under m2, m3, and m6.\n   - Use logical conjunctions and disjunctions to form the formula.\n\n3. Determine the formula:\n   - The formula should combine these terms in a way that they are included in the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n#### Results:\n- Formula: (p∧q∧¬r)∨(p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧¬q∧¬r).\n\n### Answer:\n[[formula:(p∧q∧¬r)∨(p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧¬q∧¬r)]]",

The terms ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r and ¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r are considered, which indicates that B must also go (q is true). So, the number associated with this case is M4 (corresponding to 100 in binary, which equals 4 in hexadecimal). Thus, the first term is represented by M4.\n\nNext, when p is true, we examine each sub-disjunctive normal form separately:\n\n1. ¬q ∧ r corresponds to binary 101, which is 5 in hexadecimal. Hence, M5 = p∧¬q∧r.\n2. ¬q ∧ ¬r corresponds to binary 100, which is 4 in hexadecimal.

The factor pairs of 25 are \\((1, 25)\\), \\((25, 1)\\), \\((5, 5)\\), \\((-5, -5)\\), \\((-1, -25)\\), \\((-25, -1)\\), \\((25, -5)\\), and \\((-5, 25)\\). However, since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers, the factor pairs \\((1, 25)\\), \\((25, 1)\\), \\((5, 5)\\), \\((-1, -25)\\), \\((-25, -1)\\), \\((25, -5)\\), and \\((-5, 25)\\) are not valid because they would make \\(2x-5\\) or \\(2y-5\\) negative. Therefore, the only valid factor pairs are \\((5, 5)\\).\n\nLet's consider the factor pair \\((5, 5)\\):\n\\[2x-5 = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2y-5 = 5.\\]\nSolving these equations:\n\\[2x-5 = 5 \\implies 2x = 10 \\implies x = 5,\\]\n\\[2y-5 = 5 \\implies 2y = 10 \\implies y = 5.\\]\nSo, one solution is \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\), and thus \\(x + y = 5 + 5 = 10\\).\n\nNext, let's consider the factor pair \\((25, 1)\\) and \\((1, 25)\\), which are not valid for positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) because they would make \\(2x-5\\) or \\(2y-5\\) greater than 25 or less than 1, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\), and the value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).\n\nGiven that angle $\\alpha$ is an exterior angle of a triangle, which of the following cannot be the value of $\\alpha$?\n\nA: $30^{\\circ}$\n\nB: $70^{\\circ}$\n\nC: $100^{\\circ}$\n\nD: $110^{\\circ}$\nTo determine which value cannot be the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle, we need to understand the properties of exterior angles in triangles. An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. The key property to remember is that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \\(360^\\circ\\), and for a triangle, each exterior angle is supplementary to its corresponding interior angle (i.e., they add up to \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA: \\(30^\\circ\\)\nIf an exterior angle is \\(30^\\circ\\), then its corresponding interior angle would be \\(180^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 150^\\circ\\). The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\), so the other two interior angles would have to add up to \\(180^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 30^\\circ\\). This is possible because each of the remaining two angles could be \\(15^\\circ\\) and \\(15^\\circ\\) (or any other combination that sums to \\(30^\\circ\\)). Therefore, \\(30^\\circ\\) can be the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle.\n\nB: \\(70^\\circ\\)\nIf an exterior angle is \\(70^\\circ\\), then its corresponding interior angle would be \\(180^\\circ - 70^\\circ = 110^\\circ\\). The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\), so the other two interior angles would have to add up to \\(180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ\\). This is possible because each of the remaining two angles could be \\(35^\\circ\\) and \\(35^\\circ\\) (or any other combination that sums to \\(70^\\circ\\)). Therefore, \\(70^\\circ\\) can be the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle.\n\nC: \\(100^\\circ\\)\nIf an exterior angle is \\(100^\\circ\\), then its corresponding interior angle would be \\(180^\\circ - 100^\\circ =",

The given question pertains to whether, for group G, the belief of p by all members can lead to a common belief in p, based on the model we've established. \n\nIn logical language, the question is asking if the universal claim `(∀i ∈ G, B_ip)` implies the common belief `G_p` under the subjective model and formal model.\n\nThe construction of a subjective model involves specifying a set of agents (G) and their respective belief states. For each agent, i, `B_ip` holds. The formal model is represented by the variables of accessible worlds, their relationships, and the truth value functions for propositions. By the rules of common belief:\n\n**A common belief in p,`G_p`, occurs when in every world, i holds believes that in every accessible world, j believes that in every accessible world, k believes that... that in every accessible world, (t j number -count) believes that i believes that i believes that p. This can be formalized as below:**\n\n```\nK_i^n b P \n```\n\nThe core of common belief depends on the concept of all worlds (from group G perspective), where every individual from G is included, and they all mutually agree on believing p.\n\nThe given logical passage (i ∈ G, B_ip) concludes that every member of group G individually believes in p, but it does not clarify if they mutually hold this belief – to determine if this mutual belief is a common belief within group G.\n\n### Applying the Axioms\n#### Recognizing `G_p`:\nFor `G_p` to hold, we need to meet two basic conditions required to assert to agents that everyone commonly agrees on p. Firstly, every agent must acknowledge p individually, which is present since `B_ip` is given for all members of G. Secondly, every agent should acknowledge that everyone else (in this case, all agents in group G) believes p. \n\nThe Axiom of Consistent Belief, `B_p ∨ B_{¬p} → ⊥`, helps us here. It states a contradicting situation between believing p and its negation ¬p. In a logical structure, a common belief implicates that if all agents think p is true and none think it is false, there are no agents doubting it, which indeed, resolves into `B_p`. \n\n### Conclusion\nSince the problem statement does describe all members of G having the firm belief in p and not doubting it (none operations (`H_p`)), all these conditions cumulatively illustrate that since every individual holds `B_p` and all agents acknowledge p without doubt, the condition for `G_p` is met. Hence, assuming `B_ip` (individuals believe p) collectively electrical (common belief) → `G_p` can be correctly inferred, meaning the members of G have a common belief in p. Thus, the correct choice is, \n\n### Answer:\nA. Yes, p has a common belief in the group G.",
