Provide a detailed explanation.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, we can extend the custom operation to a ternary operation with k inputs where each input is an integer a_i. Given that a_1※a_2※...※a_k = sum(a_i/a_j + C) i≠j, where C is a parameter. \n\nFor k=2 inputs, as previously defined, we have a※b = a/b + b/a + 2 if both a≠b, a/b + C if a is a multiple of b, and b/a + C if b is a multiple of a.\n\nWhen extending to k=3, note that when k=2, the rule changes slightly, so the parameter C must be adjusted accordingly for consistency.\n\nFor example, if we have a※b※x=4 and k=3, then the equation becomes a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. Solving for C will define the specific value for the parameter depending on the given values of a, b, and x.\n\nHowever, EACH arithmos will have its **own** tuple nor family of groups due to the presence of the added parameter (C), which must be estimated. As a result, the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4 and its findings might apply only to that one, particular arithmos and not all others.\n\nIn order to calculate C and find equivalent answers, additional information or constraints are required. Additionally, because the C parameter influences the result, it is difficult to predetermine the answer without further details.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a※b※x=10 and a, b, and x are integers greater than zero and are not necessarily unique, find one/both answer value(s) for a※b※x=10.\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. If there are two distinct answers, separate them with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\nAfter providing the first solution, please provide a different one if one exists, tackled using alternative methodology.\n\n### Answer:\nOne valid solution for a, b, and x is [[61, 3, 2]] since ((61/3) + (3/2) + (61/2)) + 2 = 10.\n\nAnother valid solution is [[60, 4, 10]] since ((60/4) + (4/10) + (60/10)) + 2 = 10.\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. That should be (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) (repetition of brackets). What I am trying to get at is finding additional solutions that don't require as complex equations and are more easily visible.\n\nIndeed, the equation can be written as (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) = 10 for a, b, and x, where C is a parameter. In the first pair, it occurs that a = 61, b = 3, and x = 2 satisfies the condition: (61/3 + 3/2 + 61/2) + 2 = 10.\n\nThis method can be extended to generate more solutions. For clarity, we can focus our attention to the unique integers a, b, and x, where 0 < a, b, x, and let C = 0. Then the equation simplifies to (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 8. Since 8 is an even number, b and x must have the same parity (odd or even) in order for b/x to be an integer. Additionally, a must then also have the same parity as b and x. Without loss of generality, let a be at least as large as b and x. This not only simplifies the solution but also demonstrates that, because 8 is positive, a, b, and x must all be positive.\n\nLet's consider the case where a = b + x.\n\nWe have (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 1 + (b-x)/b + (b-x)/x + (b-x)/x) = 1 + (b-x)*(1/2). \n\nFor example, if b-x is an integer, I can use 1/3+3/2+3/2 to obtain 1 + 2*(1/3) = 8/3. \n\nAdditionally, if a = 9, then b=7, x=2 provide the sum of 69/7, which differs from 8 by 24/7.\n\nIn addition to the first {{parent.schema_name}} {{1%len(parent.compile_record_list)}}/{{len(parent.compile_record_list)}}\n{{parent.acknowledgement}}\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 10. Based on the given solutions, another solution is [[1, 1, 10]]. However, to verify this answer, it should be noted that (1/1 + 1/10 + 1/10) + 2 does not equal 10.

This may also apply to other fields like sciences.\n\nIf you or your job involves tasks-oriented mathematical calculation or logical reasoning, expect a flood of similar tools in the near future.\n\n## Sunday, March 26, 2023\n\n### GPT 3 needs formal knowledge to be \"intelligent\"\n\nConcept:\n\nModels like Codex, InstructGPT are powerful tools for constructing computers. They can accomplish most programming tasks, they can develop executable programs representing complex intentions just from text input.\nTheir power lies only within the boundary of the formal knowledge they are trained on.\nLike GPT-3, they are required to be \"creative\" or \"Open Domain\", but they can't be creative beyond the boundary of their formal training.\n\nSuppose GPT-3 is such a solver. It would be hard for it to be creative beyond formal knowledge, especially in a pure-formal system like math, but easy for it to be creative in human interactions because they require vague/lack of requirements from the system, extra knowledge help is constantly available from other people (in context or explicit queries), and they are not purely formal systems, therefore it is more difficult to rigidly evaluate their performance.\n\n\"Logical reasoning\" and \"physical reasoning\" tasks are easier to formalize. All kinds of tasks can be composed as combinations of the following three elements\n\n1. Formal knowledge\n2. Physical knowledge\n3. Human-Human interaction\n\n\"math\" is a formal system that covers formal knowledge. A task that can be emulated/formalized by entirely formal knowledge, like automata theory, natural computing, LISPs, etc, it is very difficult to build a \"creative\" solver for task solving in the parts of the system limited by formal knowledge unless it is aware of all kinds of knowledge inside the system.\n\nEveryday problems in human interactions are much easier to address using AI tools because they can virtually hang around in \"a place\" with all kinds of tools. They can interact with humans and humans constantly provide them with knowledge. They can try multiple approaches and test them with humans. This is how humans interact with each other.\n\nThis idea is probably the reason why human-human interactions, like ChatGPT, become as powerful as they do very quickly as a model.\n\nIt is easy to formalize the implicit boundaries specified by the human-human interactions, explicit query functions, and a knowledge base designed for human exploration and rediscovery.\n\nWhile it is difficult to formalize a purely formal system like mathematics and the formalized boundaries created by mathematicians. Infinity seems not very nearly/easily reachable for our computer-based systems.\n\nPracticality:\nThe possibility of reachability of advanced digital agents:\nPractically, for most human beings, as the experience with AI is expanding, the gap between a digital agent and other human beings is shrinking. The idea is commonplace that digital agents behave and are treated as almost human, especially in human-human interactions, like ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, we tend to ignore that the inner behavior of current digital human agents is not random and human-like. They are based on formal systems and reasoning in similar manners. Despite some bugs here and there, they are system(programming)-like. (Even random agents can be effectively constructed using formal-like agents, that have access to truly random functions via current physical laws)\n\nMathematics has its own \"practical\" use in the ability to formalize its subject matter, making it applicable to other disciplines. The reason why a lot of digital agents involve math in their AI manifests.\n\nBut in the real world, the systems we deal with are usually not based on pure math, they are all kinds of useful combinations of ideas, theories, abstract concepts and math. They are subject to the physical laws which can either be formalized or be modeled using math, and in turn, subjects to the available knowledge we have about these physical systems.\n\nAI provides a detailed but high-level view of the world, it filters through the physical laws to make things easier for us to focus. In mathematical systems, where we observe and verify carefully what the programming systems say to do and can be auto-verified, this filtering becomes very strict and absolute.\n\nIn human-human interaction systems, those limitations in the emphasis of what information to include (explicitly) and which to keep vague or emphasis, is far less pronounced, compelling the formation of an ideal-seeming system of judgment. These systems become unshowable in formalizing.\n\nTeaching AI about math:\nIt is easier to teach an AI to solve a math problem formally, by specifying formal methods if they exist, in contrast to attracting an AI to develop a method that can be the same but is uniquely formulated by the AI.\n\nIt is easier to guide satisfaction of a formal system by specifying the steps to satisfy. This may be possible with current ANI systems with the help of a specific-purpose Trial-and-Error script. (unrelated)\n\nHowever, at the same time, we do have constraints specifying the answers must satisfy certain conditions. Even with null constraints, we require the solutions to be compilable and executable.\n\nTherefore, the guidance of AI in the \"right way\" is a special art that is worryingly prone to culture bias and error, considering our past mistakes while learning a specific system of languages and mathematical knowledge.\n\nSuch a contradictory impression of the vagueness and absolute nature of machine languages and AI tools are unusual. New artifacts must follow previously proven programming and compiling logic, and are trained with human notions of its widespread logical implications, they are trusted and helped to learn from, and in turn, they are expected to teach us of future knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, anything that has a uncertain future is expected to be \"creative\" in some way. It is easy to predict their future, and we expect a system that does better than us on the principle of their computing supremacy.\n\nDeep Reinforcement learning. Explosive combinations or more refined and systematic way of doing things?\nI'll put another very important note to the above concept of formalization here. Current deep learning has done a great job in detecting patterns, for images, text, audio, among others. Deep Learning can examine and identify the hidden correlations between the data they have been fed.\n\nI believe that they are also capable of doing formalizations or approximations alike to formalizations, especially under noisy circumstances. That is to say, the scope of Digital programs can be formalized/extracted like their potentiality implying that we probably require less data and not much sophisticated functions but just well-formulated assumptions about formal systems.\n\nSee here for a discussion on CNNs: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4480876/what-equivalence-class-does-a-cnnt-really-learn\n\nSee a research cited above given the impression that recent AI tools can help discover new math and physics.\nIn other fields like Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI can help developers develop software and develop new technology. But this feels fundamentally different from how humans discover unknown knowledge directly, they seem to link the bits of knowledge or imagined solutions to previous programming knowledge.\n\n### Mathematica Realigns with Codex's Coding Language with \"Demonstrate\" and \"Massage a list\"\n\nMathematica introduces a powerful new aThe \"demonstrate\" and \"massage a list\" capabilities in Wolfram Language allow you to tackle complex tasks with ease.

It is a combination of a neural network and a convolutional neural network.\nA common problem with corta-networks is that the input to the network is not sufficiently varied. For example, if you were to feed a blank image into a convolutional neural network, the output would be a blank image. This is because the convolutional neural network only uses the information in the image to inform the network what to do, but does not actually use the image to learn.\nOne way to approach the problem is to add extra filters to the convolutional neural network. This is generally a good idea, because it will make the convolutional neural network more robust. Another approach is to use an adaptive filtering approach, where the convolutional neural network is made to adapt to the noisy input.\n\nIt doesn't look like a problem where a machine learning solution would work well.\nFor a comparison question, the machine learning approach here is different in that it first \"tries to predict the answer to a question\" in part 1 and then just \"copies the same language model as the one used by the neural network\".\nThe reason it doesn't work I think is that the way the ML approach is doing this is by trying to predict the answer to a question (where a human/pair would do it by looking at the comments and then giving the answer to the nearest other comment), this doesn't give a lot of signal for the machine learning solution.\n\n### 在 CHATGPT 情况下的调试结果（设置20个 max_tokens）\n\nCAI: (3 branches with 2 splits and then the rest)\n\nroot\n|   l\n|   \n\nCAI2: (3 branches with 2 splits and then the rest)\n\nroot\n|   l\n|   \n\nCAI3: No more splits - No more splits\n\nThe program is learning to find a good harmonic mean. It is doing this by finding a new center of gravity for each new center of gravity, since the weights of the points in the mean new point are updated by them after each training iteration. This means the algorithm needs to find a new center of gravity for each center of gravity, and this is where the loss function comes in. Suppose there are two centers at the boundary of the circle, at distance a from the center and at distance b from the center.\n\nI wasn't able to replicate your results.

OpenAI's chatGPT is indeed super advanced. Even though I've been a ethical engineer for 12 years, I was quite impressed by this AI engine. It shows that AlphaStar is now able to play Dota 2 at a level that surpasses 99% of all other humans in the world. Finally, data streams give researchers excellent interpretability of when/where/how the information in the world has been acquired from.\n\nIt appears that your neural network is diverging, i.e. it is not finding a correct answer. This is usually the case when you are trying to classify too many variables with a simple network.\nI think that this is not too uncommon for a neural network. I can see how this might happen. You are training on two objective functions: one that is learning to classify the data and the other that is learning to extract meaningful information from the labelled data. The difference between the two objective functions is that a neural network is taking in a very different kind of data.\n\n#结语\n\nClosing Thoughts: This is not the first time I have been asked to write this post. The obvious conclusion is that intelligence is not the most important thing. But let's get to the point. To evaluate AI we would first need a reason to be comfortable about the fact that it's possible the AI is going to win (it's plausible). In this case I will assume that there is a way this happens. And then I will use the AI's winning probability to determine whether we should trust computers. The argument for trusting computer people here is that they can always do better than the AI. I have seen this happen in many different fields.\n\nIn summary, it seems clear from the data that for all of us, if an artificial intelligence system is going to perform anything in that way that we expect a human to it, then we should fear what they may do to their computers. I would suggest that this has much to do with how humans use their minds. What is more is that some of the aspects of artificial intelligence have a negative impact on intellect. So what does all of this mean?\n\nThis post is an informal attempt to index the recent and ongoing work on progress measures. Please feel free to reach out to me via email. I will also host relevant progress math formulas, such as TAI timelines, and past progress math formulas. The accompanying website contains further details and a demo. Several previous posts have been annotated as well; see timeline. Introduction People are uncertain about how to make progress Mathematician and blogger John Baez observes that, with a few exceptions, mathematical activities can be difficult to categorize. In addition to the fact that he's right, this can be very confusing for people trying to decide what to teach. If you're trying to teach maths from scratch, then you're looking at a much more challenging situation.\n\nWith those contexts in mind, I will provide 5 strategic measures, which I believe is the most fundamental step in promoting decision making and developing progress actions.\n\nBut there are many other types of progress measure. The best I've found is what you call intuitive metrics. These metrics are the most likely to be useful for building a decision model. As a result, if I'm right then I believe the next step will be a rigorous method of applying these metrics to provide a more comprehensive set of progress measures.\n\n## 🌟支持、新闻报道\n\n### 赞助\n\n• 健康汉堡（你的信息会被添加到E训练的 www.aevane.cmm）\n• Raising Funding 群（加公众号或直接加bot）\n• 开源企业群\n• 我的Linkedin主页及个人网站\n\nhttps://worldwide.i-pass.be/shop-e-style/e.html\n\n（2）观察，分析总结，输出；",

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used",
