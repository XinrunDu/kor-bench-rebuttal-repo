My intercom prompt allowed me to reduce 5 to 4, though I wish it would be more direct in some cases.\nOn the one hand, the auto-grading takes the responsibility for making this change away from the human teacher. On the other hand, the prompt creator is making the rules that the LLM will follow to answer questions for the students. This is not necessarily bad or good; in any case, we have been using computers on versions of this premise since Douglas Englebart, Mark Zuckerberg, Roger Crew and myself have been here.\nThe main takeaway here is the focus on providing better instruction so that the student learns more, faster and with less repetition.\nSo far, this is only an outline. My Prompt Magician extension is the only tool available directly for ChatGPT answers, but I have a larger system in the oven for a host of LLM and other AI systems. In my opinion, the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of greater automation in teaching will be measured by how much it improves the academic average.\nOne thing is sure at this point: the learning process is changing soon. 🔗︎\nHow to Hang Your Writing on the Ferris Wheel\nThere are several ways of doing this. Here is one.\n\nHow do we find this? First, let's write the input as a code formula of the values:\n(($input* 60) - 30) Let's present this in the following schematic: (ktp) Please notice that the proportions are identical. The number in the column marked \"Scale\" employs a crude approximation. In fact, you can get the radius as the circumference devided by pi. If you have a string of numbers, you turn them into fractions by performing subtraction. That's all there is to writing anything: establish joins and add delimiters. Complexity rises when numbers large and/or small. But you can simplify this by working with signs. Computing -17 - 27 base zero is straightforward. The following is not as simple:\n((-17 * -2) + 27) ==> 16\nCompose your formulas by beginning with natural numbers expressing your ideas like,\n$a ==>$   51\nIn this notation, the variables have been assigned values.\nOrdinals allow us to provide names to our questions, such as,\n\"next\" on $a is, (($a * 60) - 30) ==>    27\nHow would you answer the following in natural language:\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign.\nHexadecimals like\n(2**2 - 5) are fractions used to order the digits (≥ 16)\n2**2 ==> 4\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign. Ordinal notation applies negative numbers to all numbers sequences.\nThis is your entrée and explains the meaning of the following query. The use of signs and series is a good way to staying as close to the picture as possible, while maintaining precision in your calculations.\n( $a*12/ 221 + 2 )* 221 - ( 2*2 + 30 ) ==>$  14\nSo that you can compare the answers given by the above formulas, here is the answer provided by the Google API just as the input is given as a plain natural language string:\nLanguages behave more rationally when surrounded by the right kind of notification in coordination with the sign of sensitivity. Ordinals are such notifications. They are designed for distances and vary in interpretations. Above are the answers given values:\n$14 ==>$        4\n$  4 ==>$        9\n$  9 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$        2\n$ 2 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$       18\n$18 ==>$       10\n$10 ==>$      $-5$ -5 ==> $2$ 2 ==> $16$16 ==> $\"O\"$ \"O\" ==> $17$ 17 ==> $1 \"8\"$1 \"8\" ==> $20$  20 ==> $14$ 14 ==>    4\nTo explain how you walk around the clock without getting sexed or confused requires more common sense than formulae. Lines may appear as straight, but in reality, they cleave at odd-numbered hours. Straturations of lines are a field of experience for the parent and their child. That is, everything is experienced in layers of abstraction.\nThere is nothing you can do except coding every question with their response: only then will you understand, in this sort of program, is it truly possible to make a thing-in-itself?\nThat is what I mean by “make your mind run straight”. They are all straight-line moves reading text and symbols. Kant is not the last philosopher to determine this. All new interpretations of a problem will come from this premise, not merely from intuition in conjunction with analysis.\n(($a * 60) - 30) ==> | || | |$[ 5 * 10^ 8 + 4 * 10^ 5 + 8 * 10^ 2 + 1 * 1$ | || | |] $\\n$ $ $ Shorter Proofs Are Better as Search Universes\nConsider the following proof of the Pythagorean formula:\n1 ==> ((4*5) + (9*9))\nThis schema computes the relation between two formulas, which in this case are the Pythagoreans theorems for different rectangles. It's relation is an arithmetic expression known as a “proof measurement”, i.e., it is used to measure the correctness of a computation. That the first proof was much shorter reflects how much more of the information going into the longer proof was discarded. 🔗︎ You Left a Higher Math on the Grocery List Knowing the answer does not always make the work. Here is what the original promptedness provided to answer the question correctly (from ChatGPT): (k) If a child has 13 dollars of his money, he will be able to spend 14 of his money a total of 18 times. (i) If this child wants to spend more money, he will be able to spend more money. In the event this child spends 18 dollars a total of 18 more times, he will spend a total of 14 dollars more times. (h) Given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (g) If a child spends 18 dollars more a total of 14 more times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (f) if a child spends 18 dollars a total of 14 times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (e) given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (d) if he spends 8 more dollars, then he should have 18 dollars more times of money. (c) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend. (b) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend more money. (a) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend less money. (9) Pythagoresen is more difficult to find the entire proof given an arbitrary question. When asked for the relation between the parameters, GLP-02 thinks: (g) All of this is an example of how, even if a child already had money, he may still be able to spend more money; whereas, if a child doesn't already have$$ 14, he may have$$ 18).

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n",
