Through the holes, we read \"YOF\".\n   - Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - Repeat the process with the next portion of the ciphertext.\n\n4. **Repeat steps 3 and 4**:\n   - Continue reading through the holes until you've decrypted the entire block.\n\n   **Decrypted part 1 (first four holes):** \"YOF\"\n   **Ciphertext for the next holes:** \"FWF#\"\n   **Decrypted part 2:** \"WFL\"\n   **Remaining ciphertext:** \"#VT##\"\n\n5. **Combine the decrypted parts to get the final plaintext:**\n   - \"YOFWFL#VT#\"\n\n6. **Final decrypted message, encapsulated in double square brackets:**\n   - [[YOFWFL#VT#]]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is:\n\n```\n[[YOFWFL#VT#]]\n```",
