        "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formula or Falsehood Formula, we need to analyze their truth values under all possible assignments for their propositions.\n\n### Question 1:\n(1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ‚úì and p2 = ‚úì, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ‚úì because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ‚úì, the whole formula becomes x&‚úì, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ‚úì because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ‚úì. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ‚úì&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ‚úì and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ‚úì. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ‚úì&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ‚úì, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ‚úì because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ‚úì, the whole formula becomes x&‚úì, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ‚úì, p2 = ‚úì, and p3 = ‚úì, then (p1 &p3 ) = ‚úì and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ‚úì=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ‚úì (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ‚úì, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ‚úì (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ‚úì, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ‚úì (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",
