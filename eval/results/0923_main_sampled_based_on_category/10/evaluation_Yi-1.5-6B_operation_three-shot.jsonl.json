The function first initializes a variable `min` to the given `cost`. Then, it iterates over each element in `nums` and compares it with `cost`. If `min` is greater than `cost`, it updates `min` to the new value. Finally, the function returns `min`, which represents the smallest cost.\n\nPlease note that I am not providing a specific answer to the question, as it is based on a hypothetical algorithm assignment.

However, with a bit of cleverness, you can utilize your assistant for other purposes as well. Your assistant understands 13 commands that facilitate text generation and allows you to perform simple arithmetic and mathematical computations.\n\nAt the same time, your assistant serves as your personal digital assistant, capable of processing and performing tasks associated with your complex requirements. These requirements can vary depending on your specific needs, but some common examples include answering digital questions, booking appointments, and scheduling events.\n\nCreate and meet new personas inspired by fictional characters and explore new use cases specific to each personality. We are continuously adding new commands to impress and amaze you! ✨ 🎉\n\n## Commands\n\n### Add\n\nThe \"add\" command calculates or provides computations based on a mathematical equation. For example:\n\n- {{ add 2 + 3 }} = 5\n- {{ add 2 * 2 }} = 4\n\n### Substract\n\nThe \"subtract\" command performs a mathematical operation containing the subtraction sign. For example:\n\n- {{ subtract 10 - 5 }} = 5\n- {{ subtract 10 + 5 }} = 5\n\n### Multiplication\n\nThe \"multiply\" command multiplies two given numeric values. Example:\n\n- {{ multiply 3 * 3 }} = 9\n- {{ multiply 3 / 3 }} = 1\n\n### Division\n\nThe \"divide\" command divides two given numeric values. Example:\n\n- {{ divide 3 / 3 }} = 1\n- {{ divide 6 / 2 }} = 3\n\n### Unique Number\n\nThe \"unique number\" command generates a unique number within a specified range. Example:\n\n- {{ unique number 1-10 }} = 6\n- {{ unique number 1-1000000 }} = 124577\n\n### First Prime\n\nThe \"first prime\" command provides the first prime number. Example:\n\n- {{ first prime }} = 2\n\n### Last Prime\n\nThe \"last prime\" command provides the last prime number. Example:\n\n- {{ last prime }} = 31397\n\n### Prime Count\n\nThe \"prime count\" command determines the count of primes within a specified range. Example:\n\n- {{ prime count 1-10 }} = 4\n- {{ prime count 3-30 }} = 7\n\n### Sum Of First N Numbers\n\nThe \"sum of first n numbers\" command calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers. Example:\n\n- {{ sum of first n numbers 10 }} = 55\n- {{ sum of first n numbers 10000 }} = 50005000\n\n### Mean Of Squares Numbers\n\nThe \"mean of squares numbers\" command calculates the arithmetic mean of the squares of the first n natural numbers. Example:\n\n- {{ mean of squares numbers 3 }} = 4.333333333333334\n- {{ mean of squares numbers 5 }} = 10.2\n\n### Sum Of Powers Numbers\n\nThe \"sum of powers numbers\" command calculates the sum of powers for n numbers, where each power is equal to the given exponent. Example:\n\n- {{ sum of powers numbers 3 2 }} = 18\n- {{ sum of powers numbers 4 3 }} = 208\n\n### Factors\n\nThe \"factors\" command calculates all factors of a given number. Example:\n\n- {{ factors 3 }} = 1\n- {{ factors 12 }} = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\n\n### Is Prime\n\nThe \"is prime\" command checks if a given number is prime. Example:\n\n- {{ is prime 19 }} = Yes\n- {{ is prime 40 }} = No\n\n### Digit Sum\n\nThe \"digit sum\" command calculates the sum of the digits of the given number. Example:\n\n- {{ digit sum \"243\" }} = 9\n- {{ digit sum \"9009\" }} = 18\n\n### Symmetric Binomial\n\nThe \"symmetric binomial\" command calculates symbolic representation of binomial in summation form. Example:\n\n- {{ symmetric binomial \"2n\"0 \"-1\" }} = -1\n- {{ symmetric binomial \"2n\"0 \"1\" }} = 2\n\n### Legendre Symbol\n\nThe \"legendre symbol\" command calculates the Legendre symbol calculated on two given numbers. Example:\n\n- {{ legendre symbol 2 \"7\" }} = 1\n- {{ legendre symbol 3 \"7\" }} = -1\n- {{ legendre symbol 4 \"7\" }} = 0\n\n### De Moivre Formula\n\nThe \"de moivre formula\" command calculates the complex number representation derived from De Moivre's Formula. Example:\n\n- {{ de moivre formula 30° }} = 1\n- {{ de moivre formula 45° }} = -0.766\n- {{ de moivre formula 60° }} = -0.5\n\n### Euler Formula\n\nThe \"euler formula\" command computes the sine, cosine, and tangent values using Euler's Formula. Example:\n\n- {{ euler formula 30° }} = sin (30pi/180pi), cos (30pi/180pi), tan (30pi/180pi)\n- {{ euler formula 45° }} = sin (45pi/180pi), cos (45pi/180pi), tan (45pi/180pi)\n- {{ euler formula 60° }} = sin (60pi/180pi), cos (60pi/180pi), tan (60pi/180pi)\n\n### Fibonacci Sequence\n\nThe \"fibonacci sequence\" command generates the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. Example:\n\n- {{ fibonacci sequence 5 }} = ⟨ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 ⟩\n- {{ fibonacci sequence 17 }} = ⟨ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597 ⟩\n\n### Power Digit Sum\n\nThe \"power digit sum\" command calculates the sum of all digits present in the exponent raised to the power of an input number specified by the user.

Therefore, X = 1.\n\nSo, X in the equation X¥2 = 1 is 1.\n####\nThe answer is 17.",

What is the composition of diamond augmented by 4 atoms?\nParse the operation rule correctly and fill in the answer, which should be parseable by the parseOperationRule function.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The operation rule states that the composition of diamond augmented by an amount of atoms is malonamide. Here, the number of atoms added can be represented by the variable ax. Therefore, the composition of diamond augmented by 4 atoms would be \"diamond(\\(\\text{ax}+\\text{4})\\) = malonamide\".\n2.

The game ends when either PlayerA or PlayerB runs out of happiness points.\n\nThe program should output the name of the winning player and his number of happiness points left.\nclass TilesGame:\n\n    def __init__(self, playerA, playerB):\n        self.playerA = playerA\n        self.playerB = playerB\n        self.playerA_points = playerA\n        self.playerB_points = playerB\n        self.remaining_tiles = 0\n        self.remaining_tiles += 10000\n        self.tile_values = [2, 9]\n\n    def play_turn(self, player):\n        # Take a tile at random from the deck\n        tile = np.random.choice(self.tile_values)\n\n        # Apply the tile effect to the chosen player\n        if player == 'A':\n            self.playerA_points -= tile\n        elif player == 'B':\n            self.playerB_points -= tile\n\n        # Update the remaining tiles\n        self.remaining_tiles -= 1\n\n        # Check if the game is over\n        if self.remaining_tiles <= 0:\n            self.remaining_tiles = 0\n\n    def play(self):\n        # Determine initial player\n        if self.playerA_points > self.playerB_points:\n            current_player = 'A'\n            other_player = 'B'\n        else:\n            current_player = 'B'\n            other_player = 'A'\n\n        while self.remaining_tiles > 0 and self.playerA_points > 0 and self.playerB_points > 0:\n            print(f\"Current player: {current_player}\")\n\n            # 1 or 2 happiness numbers\n            num_tiles = int(np.random.choice(np.arange(1, 3), p=[0.5, 0.5]))\n            print(f\"Choosing to play {num_tiles} tiles\")\n\n            for i in range(num_tiles):\n                # Pick at random from the tiles\n                tile = np.random.choice(self.tile_values)\n\n                # Apply the tile effect to the chosen player\n                if current_player == 'A':\n                    self.playerA_points -= tile\n                elif current_player == 'B':\n                    self.playerB_points -= tile\n\n            print(\n                f\"Player {current_player}: {self.playerA_points if current_player == 'A' else self.playerB_points} points remaining\")\n\n            # Swap players\n            current_player, other_player = other_player, current_player\n\n        if self.playerA_points == 0:\n            win_player = 'Player B'\n        elif self.playerB_points == 0:\n            win_player = 'Player A'\n        else:\n            win_player = 'Tie'\n\n        print(f\"Game over.
