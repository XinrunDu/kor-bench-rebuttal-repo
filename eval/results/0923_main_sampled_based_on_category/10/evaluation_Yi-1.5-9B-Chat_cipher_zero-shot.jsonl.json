In this case, since the block is the first (0-indexed), the grid_index would be (0 // 5) % 8 = 0, which corresponds to Grid0. However, since \"G\" is not \"J\" and doesn't cross any boundaries in Grid0, moving one grid position to the lower right would result in a character not in the alphabet we're using (excluding \"J\"). Given the unique circumstance of encrypting just the letter \"G\", the process outlined doesn't yield a standard or meaningful encryption because it doesn't align with encrypting blocks of 5 characters.\n\nBut, following the theoretical process for encryption of \"G\":\n\n1. **Select Grid**: Grid0 is chosen for the first block.\n2. **Encrypt**: \"G\" is found at row 3, column 2 in Grid0. Moving one grid position to the lower right would theoretically be row 4, column 3, which corresponds to \"W\". However, since we're excluding \"J\" and our grid wraps around, \"N\" at row 4, column 3 (considering \"Z\" wraps back to \"A\", \"W\" becomes \"N\") would be the encrypted character.\n\nGiven the specific conditions and the theoretical application of the encryption process to a single character, the encrypted answer for \"G\" would be \"N\". However, it's important to note that this is a theoretical interpretation due to the unique nature of trying to encrypt a single character using the full encryption process designed for blocks of 5 characters.\n\n```\n[[N]]\n```",
