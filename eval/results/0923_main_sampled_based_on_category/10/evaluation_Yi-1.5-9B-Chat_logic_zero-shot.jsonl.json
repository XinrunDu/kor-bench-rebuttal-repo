Therefore, this formula is a Truth Formula (T).\n\nFor formula (2):\nThis is a conditional statement with a condition of (p1 =::>~p1) and a conclusion of ~p2. The antecedent (p1 =::>~p1) is a contradiction because a proposition cannot imply its negation. Thus, regardless of the truth value of p1, the whole conditional statement is true.

Initialization:\n- S0 = {} (empty set)\n- S1 = {{¬p, q}, {p, q}, {q}}\n- S2 = {} (empty set)\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n- For {¬p, q} and {p, q}, C = dispel(C1, C2) = dispel({¬p, q}, {p, q}) = {q}\n  - Since {q} is not in S0 or S1, add {q} to S2.\n\nNow, S0 = {}, S1 = {{¬p, q}, {p, q}}, and S2 = {{q}}.\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n- For {¬p, q} and {q}, C = dispel(C1, C2) = dispel({¬p, q}, {q}) = {¬p}\n  - Since {¬p} is not in S0 or S1, add {¬p} to S2.\n- For {p, q} and {q}, C = dispel(C1, C2) = dispel({p, q}, {q}) = {p}\n  - Since {p} is not in S0 or S1, add {p} to S2.\n\nNow, S0 = {}, S1 = {{¬p, q}, {p, q}}, and S2 = {{q}, {¬p}, {p}}.\n\n4.

Thus, the algorithm will be in an infinite loop of trying to resolve clauses in S0, which has already been resolved with S2 and does not yield any new clauses to add to S2.\n\nTherefore, the output of the resolution algorithm for the given CNF is \"Implausible\" because there is no need to check S2 further, and we can conclude the inconsistency in the system through the previous resolutions.\n\nThe answer, in the requested format [[output];[number]], is:\n\n```\n[[\"Implausible\"];[1]]\n```\n\nThis is due to the fact that the algorithm recognizes the inconsistency in the system and outputs \"Implausible\" after the first resolution step, indicating that there is no satisfying assignment for the given CNF.
