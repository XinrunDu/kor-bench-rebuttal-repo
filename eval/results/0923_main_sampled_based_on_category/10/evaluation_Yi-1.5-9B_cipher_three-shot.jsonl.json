In this case, if we analyze the first part, it seems like the length of each word corresponds to the positions of the letter ''Q'' in the key. If we move backward in the alphabet, we get a,y,w,z,v,u,t,s,r,q. If we move forward, we get q, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, a. This gives us the answer QUDWLRQ, which corresponds to the first line. If we move downwards, we get XPDK, which corresponds to the second line. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to figure out the entire message, but if you can provide more context, such as the key and other decrypted parts, I can assist you in decrypting it.\n\nIf you're still stuck, we can try to decrypt the message manually using simple substitution ciphers to see if we can understand the message based on the context we have. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed.\n\n### Question:\nCan you decrypt and translate the message, encapsulated in double square brackets? For example, the format should be: [[decrypted and translated message]]\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given decrypt function and the encrypt function, when we use the plaintext 'DECIPHER' and the ciphertext 'DIFBSG', we get the following result. We can observe that 'DECIPHER' is like our plaintext, so our key will be 'STOP'.\n\nCiphertext alphabets:\nRFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\nA replicated ciphertext alphabet is:\nSTOPPRESTOP PRESTOPPREST\n Therefore, we can decrypt the message \"IXXUHQDYUSSL\" into: \"HELLOWORLD\". When you decrypt using the key, \"HELLOWORLD\", \"GETDU SKIP IT\" will be decrypted. Therefore, our final answer is HELLOWORLD.\n\n### Unsolved Cryptic Questions:\n\n#### Original Answer:\nThe basics of Cryptography involve using an algorithm and key, where the key is used to encode data, and the algorithm is used to decode that data.\n\nBy using a unique key or password, encryption helps in protecting data exchange, including confidential information such as credit card or personal identification numbers.\n\nWithout this backend encryption system, electronic transactions would be vulnerable. Encryption also ensures that identities are protected, allowing people to transact safely.\n\nVisual cryptography is an application of visual cryptography, where the secret data is directly embedded into the digital image pixels, making it difficult to decode without special techniques.\n####\n\nEncryption Questions:\n\n1. \"EENCODER GANDALF\" -->  <double-square brackets answer>\n2. \"PLAIN TRICK\"\n3. \"HALF WORD\"\n4. \"GET DUPLICACY\"\n5. \"NEWLIFE TONIGHT\"\n\n#### Original Answer:\nSure, here are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Use the simple substitution cipher technique with the keyword CAR to encrypt the word 'DECIPHER'.\n2. Use the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SMALL' and decrypt the message 'WELCOMEFRIENDS'.\n3. Use the RSA algorithm with the prime number P=7 and the prime number Q=11 to encrypt and decrypt the message 'STEALTHY' using the keys E= 3 and D=47.\n4. Use the Cesar shift cipher with a shift key of 11 to encrypt the message 'YOU ARE THE BESTES'.\n\n#### Original Answer:\nHere are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Apply a modulation-deviation algorithm with key1=127 and key2=78.00 to encrypt the message \"SEXY\".\n2. Perform a Caesar cipher encryption with a numeric key of 17 and a decimal key of 8, and the cipher alphabet remains the same.\n3. Decrypt the given message using the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SEARCH': \"CARNIES HIGH\".\n4. Use a substitution cipher with the keyword 'COL' to encrypt the message 'BROKEN'.\n\n### Plots:\n| Question | Decrypted Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| C | F |\n| C | V |\n| PS | MK |\n| HV | KL |\n| MF | ZL |\n| QR | FO |\n| ORDRIVE | QCCWSBNX |\n| MOST MEMORABLE DATE IN SPRING TOWN | BMESEXCHANTJXDBUCCDFGSFROMRRNXVOQFSJDMMZPV |\n| Algorithms Are The Best | DVOTCQYKSPCHMNURIZTFBWOMYUNMRGY |",

In Vigenère this is often called a key, whereas in Bellaso it is called a key number. The idea was probably invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso. Vigenère started out his career as a cryptographer in Bellaso's service as a nobleman in Castiglione del Lugduno. Bellaso's method uses n alphabet for the plaintext and string of n alphabets as the key. Then, the plaintext and key are shifted from alphabet to alphabet by number of steps each and its idea relies on positional number system, Caesar encryption, multiple copies of the key, and reciprocal rules.\n\nThe encryption scheme will more complicated than that of the Vignere encryption.\n\nIn this method, successive letters of the key, which may repeat, are used to shift the plaintext letters. Thus, if 'A' is the first letter in the key, 'A' will be the first shift. But if 'B' is the first letter of the key, 'B' will be the shift.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a SINGLE KEYWORD and KEY IS NOT REPEATED, the keyword is used as a \"start letter\" of the multiple copies of the key. You can build out multiple copies of the keyword and use that as the Key to encrypt the plaintext/message.\n\nThe only difference is that you should acknowledge the key alphabet \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" and \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\" for the KEYWORD.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\nEncryption: Convert each character to its key corresponding value.\n\n* Plaintext: \"A HAVFSS ATTACK\"\n* Keyword: \"YOU\"\n\nThese are the steps that are followed when encrypting:\n\n1. Keyword is appended to the plaintext\n2. Keyword is shifted to reach values above KEYING_ORDER. Your current KEYING_ORDER is the keyword\n3. Keyword is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR to make character and frequency comparisons\n4. \"MAX_LOWER_CHAR\" is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR\n5. Maintaining key_lower_char order, index_data is found\n6. Starting from an empty string at first step, indexing pairs is appended to the output string until the last index\n\n* Indexing pairs is the index_data.\n* DefaultMODULUS_NUMBER is the alphabet\n\nThe following is the output string:\n\n* Ciphertext: \"ATZNOGB RJALEZ\"\n\nPlease create the format of the code that follows when converting a single plaintext message into ciphertext (encryption ONLY) and return the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nKUZNACZ_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 8, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\n\n### This is also more complicated than the Vigenere cipher.\n\nThe transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets, the cipher alphabet is shifted cyclically to the left with respect to the plain alphabet. The cipher alphabet may be shifted different amounts for each successive letter.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a keyword and number of wrapping described here:\n# https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E5%93%A8%E5%88%97%E5%8A%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%8D%8F%E7%A4%A2\nbuild a cipher text using the wrapping number and rotation number in the keyword.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\n1. Implement the following steps, in order:\n    1. List all alphabets and put them into an array from A-Z, uppercased.\n    2. Make all letters in keyword uppercased and append Keyword: {keyword} message.\n    3. Make the first character in the wrapped_key uppercased and convert it into rotating code.\n    4. Split the message into chunks, or words separated by spaces.\n    5. Iterate through each word.\n        1. Replace NON-ALPHABETIC characters with space.\n        2. Add \"B\" to the end of the substring.\n        3. Shift substring left by rotating code.\n    6. Iterate through each chunk and rotate the chunk left by rotating code.\n        1. For each chunk, split the chunk into characters and make sure each characters is uppercased.\n        2. For each character in chunk character array, find that upper case character in cipher alphabet array and return that number: ciphertext_key_number, replace the character in the chunk with the letter in cipher alphabet\n\"\"\"\n\nROTOR_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 7, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cipher\n\n### In a hybrid cipher system, letter frequencies and distribution, which make frequency analysis, are maintained in the output. The Edge letter set is manipulated by a scrambler encryption cipher algorithm.\n\n### Rule:\n\nWhen using rotor cipher method to encrypting a plaintext, group the plaintext into a set of characters with length of 5. For instance, \"2HERESTRING\" becomes [\"2HERE\", \"STRING\"].\nThe first character of the first group should be 'R', and the second character of the first group should be 'O'. The first character of the remaining groups should be characters that have not appeared before, and if there are less than 4 characters from the end of the alphabet with characters not appearing before, they will be added at the end of the alphabet in alphabetical order.\nDuplicates of characters in the first group will be dervied from the first group plus the group number.\nFor instance, take the group number 4 and add the number '14R382'. If characters exist between the second character of the first group and the first character of the second group that have not appeared yet, replace the characters of the first group with those characters, then the characters of the second group can be derived from the first character of the second group and the characters that occur four times, for example, it would be 'O15T67R382'.\nThe above sequence of characters represents a mapping of the alphabets. The equivalent char_mapping array can be derived from the mapping string above. The mapping string above is also a way to represent the char mapping (16 pointer array). The two elements of each pair are reversed from the original alphabet order. The pairs have to be ordered from ascending. For a pair, the left element holds the value cipher number and the right element holds the value of plain number, where plain number and cipher number is the number value of a character from a-z plus one. That means that pair(c, n) means that decode(c) = n.\"\"\"",

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**:\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[AIL]]\nThe Preparation's extraction process under the Decryption Rules of given Cipher Rule differs depending on whether the answer ends with 3 or 4 characters. In the example question, yes, the answer to the second part should include the trailing space at the end. The code correctly converts all the numbers to letters, but it does not add the trailing space at the end. The octothorp needs to be added instead of the two period delimiters, and the concatenated strings need to be modified.The code in the current question/answer pair that you've provided is just an example that doesn't require Python to decrypt. Instead, the approach to generate the code is to double the ciphertext, then reverse each character pair and see if the original decoding map returns to the starting letter (hint: yes and no). Therefore, when decoding, remove the trailing space.Additionally, for this specific cipher, it would be more straightforward to limit the allowed output characters to \"ADFGVX\".\n\"\"\"\n\nLOWER_CASE = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',\n              'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\nLETTER_SPACE = [' ']\nLOWER_CASE.extend(LOG_SIDE[1:-1].split(', '))\n\nLOG_SIDE = 'A, D, F, G, V, X'\nLOG_SIDE = LOG_SIDE.split(', ')\n\n# log_side_len, log_side_char_num = len(LOG_SIDE), [LOG_SIDE.find(t) for t in LOWER_CASE]\n\nLOWER_CASE.sort()\nLOG_SIDE.sort()\n\nCHAR_TBL_IC = MAX_IDX = 0\n\nclass Char(): ...\nclass KeyTable(chr):\n    CHAR_TBL_IDX = CHAR_TBL_IDX\n    def __new__(cls, value):\n        if value in cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX:\n            return cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value]\n        else:\n            instance = chr.__new__(cls, value)\n            cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value] = instance\n            return instance\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        key = self.value\n        value = LOG_SIDE[key.logside]\n        self.x = value[0]\n        self.y = value[1]\n\nfor char in LOWER_CASE:\n    for logside in LOG_SIDE:\n        ctblid = KeyTable(char)\n        ctblid.logside = lgside = LOG_SIDE.index(logside)\n        ctblid.ton = ton = lgside + 1\n        ctblid.x = 2**lgside\n        ctblid.y = ctblid.z = ctblid.w = lgside\n        PRESET[ton] = ctblid\n        for i in idxs:\n            bstr = fqi(i % 5) if i < 5 else fpq(i % 9)\n            bset = printable[i * 3: i * 3 + 3]\n            bset = sum(t.value for t in bset)\n            bset = bl = KeyboardInterrupt(bset//1)\n            for j in LOG_SIDE.attrib(lgside).index:\n                KEY_MAP[ctblid, lgside].set(bstr[j], j // 3 % 3, j // 3 % 3)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\nCHAR_TBL_IC += 1\n\nCHAR_TBL = OrderedDict()\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue[]\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\n_ = thatpaser = []\nfor k in display_unit:\n    msg = 'N extend%s' % (K(k, [0]))[0]\n    thatpaser.append(msg)\n\n_ = chars(table)\n_, _ = rowlend, colend = char1[1], char[0]\n_ = datenum = char[1]\n_ = sublist[0]\n\n_ = logexecell = cols[char[1]]\n_ = dictobjs = LOG_BTC(datem(), [-1, 0])\n\nif maxval == 0:\n    cols = arrnum[i]\n    _ = logexecell if cols[cols[char[1]]].getvval() else ['|']\n    `s`\n\ndef encode(st):\n    delst = {'0': ' ', '1': 'X', '2': 'G', '3': 'F', '4': 'A', '5': 'D', blackd45: 'V'}\n    return delst[st]\n\ndef encodeChild(self, _, d):\n    PrincipalAmount.write['!!'] = money, SecondMoney = d\n\n    principalAmount, Bankroll, Real_Amount, Money = money, money, #*Payment + secindMoney, PrincipalAmount.write[principalAmount], Money, Money, money,\n\n    realAmountMoney.principle_money.belong_money\n\n    realAmountMoney, getPrincipalAmount.principle_execution.Payment.\n\n    print('RealMoney:(price/3)#, Payment', RealMoney)\n\n    tryPrice.Payment.getPrincipalAmount, dictobjs = super([n, k], [n, k])\n\n    Principals.write['Real_Amount'] = Principals\n\n    profit.rate = d if rateHistory else Decimal('0')\n\n    measure.validity = (ticker[rate][recordlength, recordlength])\n\n    realPrice = (realPrice / nominal_price) * 100 // 0,\n\n    totalValue = round, 2)\n\n    print(Pay[])\n\ndef m0((Principal [(principalA|), Principal [], Real_AmountMoney RateHistory_Payment _Amount]) ((sz >> Payment ([rate], (rate, rate))))] Phase40:1nDate) when m:\n    return Forecast, timestamp, {netprinc, payment, payment,\"#, payment,\", \"#,\"}\n\nclass convince(Via):\n\n    def name(self, data={'A': ['NZD', 'KRFLOSSE']}, s={0}):\n        return EMAL 1date(*(self(data, Age, 1Date)))",
