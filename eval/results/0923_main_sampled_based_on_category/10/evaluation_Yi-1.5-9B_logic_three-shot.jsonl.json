Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Problem:\nGiven the following LeetCode problem:\n\"\"\"\n\nleetcode_end_of_problem_prompt_template = \"\"\"\n\nExplain the problem clearly and concisely, breaking down the key elements into steps.

It incorrectly assumes that the statement \"Some students are doctors\" can be negated to \"Some students are not doctors.\" However, this is not a valid logical inference. The subset relation between the two categories is not symmetric; having some students studying medicine does not imply that there are no students who are not doctors.",
