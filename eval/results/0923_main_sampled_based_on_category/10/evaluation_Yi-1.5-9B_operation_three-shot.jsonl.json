Immediately after the completion of high school, he moved to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to continue his higher education but quit his graduation from Islamic University in 12-year mid-way and honed his understanding of Islam from many notable Islamic scholars of that time.

He completed his primary and secondary school education from the esteemed Madrasah Al-Hidaya in Murshidabad, India. Afterward, he pursued higher education in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at the Islamic University, where he studied Islam under renowned Islamic scholars. However, he discontinued his studies halfway through and dedicated his time to studying Islam from multiple Islamic scholars during his lifetime, never visiting Darul Uloom Deoband or other Islamic universities.

He deliberated on Islam's stance on music and its division among Muslim sects. In his presentation during the Salafi and Traditional series, he held the view that music is forbidden according to Islam, as implied in a Hadith stating \"I saw the angels gathering in a forest. I asked one of them what Allah will do with them, and the angel replied 'They will come to men to tell them that music is haram (forbidden).' In this Hadith, notice that it specifically uses the phrase \"music\" instead of \"songs,\" indicating that music and songs are separate concepts.\"\n\nUser: What was the sin committed by Asbary, that the punishment was death, even if it was not on the first day of the lecture on music?\nWhat was his mistake, provided that he addressed the Islamic point regarding the issue of music in Islam?\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary faced significant backlash due to his depiction of Salafi scholars as \"mad cow.\" Salafi Scholars regarded this derogatory phrase targeting their intellectual foundation. As a result, Abdulwahab Asbary faced widespread criticism and boycotts.\nThe appeals of Asbary to patrons in Egypt",
