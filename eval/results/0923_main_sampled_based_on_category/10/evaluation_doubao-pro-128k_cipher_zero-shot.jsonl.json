So the byte sequence is [39, 173].\n\nThe key is obtained by performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. Converting this key to a byte sequence gives us [115, 239, 42, 77, 221, 122, 127, 191, 7, 253, 95, 111, 250, 153, 103, 116, 208, 3, 37, 162, 37, 253, 116, 194, 33, 244, 195, 88, 73, 229, 192, 251, 51].\n\nNow, we perform the bitwise XOR operation between the ciphertext byte sequence and the key byte sequence. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of ciphertext bytes.\n\nFor the first byte:\n39 (ciphertext byte) XOR 115 (key byte) = 82\n\nFor the second byte:\n173 (ciphertext byte) XOR 239 (key byte) = 66\n\nConverting these decimal values back to ASCII characters gives us \"RB\".\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext is: [[RB]] ",
        "response_text": "[[RB]]",
        "answer": "[[TB]]",
        "is_correct": false
