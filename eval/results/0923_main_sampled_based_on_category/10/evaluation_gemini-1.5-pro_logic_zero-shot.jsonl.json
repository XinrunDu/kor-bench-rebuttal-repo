We need to analyze its properties based on the provided logic rules.\n\n2. **Convert to principal disjunctive normal form:** To apply the given rules, we need the principal disjunctive normal form (DNF).  We can obtain this by considering what makes the given CNF formula false:\n    - ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is false for truth assignments: (p=T, q=T, r=T), (p=T, q=T, r=F), (p=T, q=F, r=T), (p=T, q=F, r=F), (p=F, q=T, r=T), (p=F, q=T, r=F), (p=F, q=F, r=T). \n    - Therefore, the principal DNF is: (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (p∨q∨¬r)\n\n3. **Analyze the principal DNF:**\n    - This DNF includes the paired disjunctive term M7 (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) because its false assignment (p=T, q=T, r=T) corresponds to binary 111, which is hexadecimal 7.\n    -  Since the principal DNF contains only M7, the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is an **all-odd formula**.\n\n4. **Format the answer:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **[[E]]**. \n",

However, there's no 'a' in the original formula.\n3. **Function Symbols:** We replace 'g' with its implementation 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'. Since 'y' is not otherwise specified, it remains as 'y' inside the function. \n4. **Predicate Symbol:**  We replace 'F' with its implementation 'FJ(x, y)' which denotes 'x = y'.\n5. **Combining:** Substituting the function and predicate implementations into the original formula '∀xF(g(x,y),z)' gives us  '∀xFJ(gJ(x,y),z)'.\n6. **Final Interpretation:** Since our entity set is natural numbers, we introduce 'x ∈ N' within the formula. Additionally, we substitute 'y' with '0' from our entity constant definition. This results in the final implementation: '∀x ∈ N (FJ(gJ(x, 0), z))'.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under J is [[∀x ∈ N (FJ(gJ(x, 0), z))]]. \n",
