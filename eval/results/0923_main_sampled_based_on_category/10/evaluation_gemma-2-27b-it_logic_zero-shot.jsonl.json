So, it's represented as m1.\n   * (p∧q∧r) corresponds to the binary number 111, which is hexadecimal 7. So, it's represented as m7.\n\n3. **Analyze the Principal Disjunctive Normal Form:**\n\n   The principal disjunctive normal form of the given formula is (m1 ∨ m7).\n\n4. **Apply the Logic Rule Definitions:**\n\n   *  Since the principal disjunctive normal form includes two paired conjunctive terms, it's **not a tautology** (which would include all 2^n terms) or a **contradiction** (which would include no terms).\n   * Since it doesn't include m0, it's **not a basic formula**.\n   * The indices in the principal disjunctive normal form are 1 and 7, which are **not all even** or **all odd**.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is **[[F]]**.\n",
