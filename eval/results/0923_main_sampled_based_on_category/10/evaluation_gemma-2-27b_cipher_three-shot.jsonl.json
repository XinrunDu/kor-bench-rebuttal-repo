For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nApologies for the oversight. Let's encrypt the given plaintext step by step:\n\n1. \"S\":\n   - Use reversed_alphabet and map \"S\" to \"N\" (20th letter).\n   - Move \"N\" forward 4 positions to get \"R\" (19th letter).\n   - From \"R\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"J\". So, \"S\" maps to \"J\".\n\n2. \"H\":\n   - Map \"H\" to \"U\" (9th letter).\n   - Move \"U\" forward 4 positions to get \"Y\" (25th letter).\n   - From \"Y\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"Z\". So, \"H\" maps to \"Z\".\n\n3. \"R\":\n   - Map \"R\" to \"E\" (18th letter).\n   - Move \"E\" forward 4 positions to get \"R\" (18th letter).\n   - From \"R\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"J\". So, \"R\" maps to \"J\".\n\n4. \" \":\n   - Spaces remain the same.\n\n5. \"G\":\n   - Map \"G\" to \"K\" (8th letter).\n   - Move \"K\" forward 4 positions to get \"O\" (16th letter).\n   - From \"O\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"H\". So, \"G\" maps to \"H\".\n\n6. \"O\":\n   - Map \"O\" to \"W\" (24th letter).\n   - Move \"W\" forward 4 positions to get \"A\" (2nd letter).\n   - From \"A\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"F\". So, \"O\" maps to \"F\".\n\n7. \"O\":\n   - Rep\n. . .

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nFollowing the specified encryption steps:\n\n1. V:\n   - Use reversed_alphabet and map \"V\" to \"T\" (22nd letter).\n   - Move \"T\" forward 4 positions to get \"X\" (24th letter).\n   - From \"X\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"Z\". So, \"V\" maps to \"Z\".\n\n2. A:\n   - Map \"A\" to \"Z\" (1st letter).\n   - Move \"Z\" forward 4 positions to get \"D\" (5th letter).\n   - From \"D\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"U\". So, \"A\" maps to \"U\".\n\n3. M:\n   - Map \"M\" to \"O\" (14th letter).\n   - Move \"O\" forward 4 positions to get \"S\" (19th letter).\n   - From \"S\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"R\". So, \"M\" maps to \"R\".\n\n4. P:\n   - Map \"P\" to \"R\" (17th letter).\n   - Move \"R\" forward 4 positions to get \"V\" (23rd letter).\n   - From \"V\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"W\". So, \"P\" maps to \"W\".\n\n5. C:\n   - Map \"C\" to \"U\" (4th letter).\n   - Move \"U\" forward 4 positions to get \"Y\" (25th letter).\n   - From \"Y\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"Z\". So, \"C\" maps to \"Z\".\n\n6. Z:\n   - Map \"Z\" to \"E\" (27th letter).\n   - Move \"E\" forward 4 positions to get \"I\" (10th letter).\n   - From \"I\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"P\". So, \"Z\" maps to \"P\".\n\n7. Space:\n   - Spaces remain the same.\n\n8. H:\n   - Map \"H\" to \"U\" (9th letter).\n   - Move \"U\" forward 4 positions to get \"Y\" (25th letter).\n   - From \"Y\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"Z\". So, \"H\" maps to \"Z\".\n\n9. E:\n   - Map \"E\" to \"W\" (6th letter).\n   - Move \"W\" forward 4 positions to get \"A\" (2nd letter).\n   - From \"A\", find the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, which is \"F\".

But when using French, the processing is slightly different and increases the complexity.\nIn that case, when encountering the character \" du la le en et il est \" in the plaintext, remove it and leave a space indicating the previous word is still in use. When there is no space between a word and \" du la le en et il est \" the processing rule is `remove all non-letters` and `all letters in capitals`. This means that \"dutan, de la, du du etc...\" are also treated as nouns and represented by the corresponding letters in capitals.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Bonjour, ça va? D’où tu es?
