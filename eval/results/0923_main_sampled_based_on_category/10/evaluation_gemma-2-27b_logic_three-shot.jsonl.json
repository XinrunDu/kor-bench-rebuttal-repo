The three initial statements are:\n\n(1) The coin is not in box A.\n(2) The coin is not in box B.\n(3) The coin is in box C.\n\nAssume all statements are related to one another. By applying the logic rule that all statements in a consistent system cannot be true, the feasible solutions can be found through a propositional logic deductive system. The feasible solutions can be deduced as follows:\n\nBy assuming that the first statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box B, nor in box C\", it can be proved that statement (1) is true, and the coin is in box A. By assuming that the second statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box A, nor in box C\", it can be proved that statement (2) is true, and the coin is in box B. By assuming that the third statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box A, nor in box B\", it can be proved that statement (3) is true, and the coin is in box C.\n\nBy analyzing the negations of the three statements in the propositional logical deductive system, the resulting three negations can be expressed as the conjunction of all the paired conjunctive terms of the negations, and according to the logic rule that all statements in a consistent system cannot be true, it can be proven that the formula does not hold true for all assignments taken from the paired conjunctive terms:\n\n((¬p→q∧r)∧(¬q→r)∧(¬r→(p∨q)))→(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)\n\nBased on the above formalization, for a logical formula that is in principal disjunctive normal form, by identifying the false values of its paired disjunctive terms, the formula can be easily represented as the disjunction of the corresponding false values of the paired conjunctive terms, and accordingly, the true assignments of the formula can be derived. By identifying the true values of the three statements, the feasible solutions can be determined, and the question can be transformed into a situation similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\", where the prisoner needs to answer questions to obtain their freedom. To find all possible scenarios where any one statement contradicts the other two statements, use the original three statements and their conjunction, and get the following contradictions:\n\n1. (¬p→(q∧r))∧(¬(q∧r))\n2. (¬q→(p∧r))∧(¬(p∧r))\n3. (¬r→(p∨q))∧(¬(p∨q))\n\nIf the situation involves the conjunction of any two negated statements, it can be derived from the Pel propositional logic deductive system that conversely, the positive statements are false, and this situation does not fall within the category being considered.\n\nBased on the original three statements, the contrapositive of each statement will yield an equivalent form of the original statement. The Pel propositional logical deductive system concludes that if the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true. Conversely, if any of the statements is negated, then its contrapositive is also false:\n\np→(¬¬p→¬¬(q∧r))\nq→(¬¬q→¬¬(p∧r))\nr→(¬¬r→¬¬(p∨q))\np→(p→¬¬q)\nq→(q→¬¬p)\nr→(r→¬¬(p∨q)) <br>\n\nFor example, for p→(¬¬p∧¬¬q):\n\nCase (1): p ∧ (¬p∨¬q)\n\nCase (2): ¬p ∧ (¬p∧¬q)\n\nFor case (1): p∧(¬p∨¬q)\n                p\n                p∨q\n                p∨¬q\n                ¬p∨¬q\nFrom Step (1), Step (4) cannot be derived, indicating that the relationship \"p→(¬p∨¬q)\" is not valid.\n\nFor case (2): ¬p ∧ (¬p ∧ ¬q) <br>\nStep (1 p′, q′; 2 p′; 3 ¬q′) <br>\nFrom p′ → (¬p′ ∨ ¬q′):p′ <br>\n¬¬p′ → ¬¬q′ -> (¬p′ → ¬¬q′):¬p′ <br>\n¬p′ ∨ ¬q′ <- (¬q′ → ¬pq′):¬q′ <br>\n¬p′ ∨ ¬q′ <- (¬p′ ∨ ¬q′):¬p′ <br>\n\nIf the negation of each statement is considered separately, the corresponding situation is:\n\n1. (p∧¬¬q)∧¬(q∧r)\n2. (q∧¬p)∧¬(p∧r)\n3. (r∧¬¬p∨¬q)∧¬(p∨q)\n\nUnder scenario 1, p∧¬¬q can be deduced as r, and r is not compatible with ¬¬p∨¬q, so ¬(p∨q) is true. Under scenario 2, q∧¬p can be deduced as q, which is not compatible with ¬¬(p∧r), so ¬(p∧r) is true. Under scenario 3, r∧¬¬p∨¬q can be deduced as r → (¬p ∨ ¬q), which contradicts ¬(p ∨ q), so ¬(p ∨ q) is false.\n\nBy comprehensively analyzing the feasible scenarios described above, the feasible solutions can be obtained.\n\nSimilar to the above question, could you please write out the formalization of question 3?\n",

ambitious\".\nTherefore, ¬P can be represented as:\n\nPlease provide the answers in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n1.Without using specific predicate symbols, we first translate it into propositional formulas.\nAssume that P represents 'x is happy' and Q represents 'x is ambitious', the correct translation of the sentence is (∀x)(P(x)∨Q(x)) and ¬(∀x)((P(x)∨Q(x))).\nTherefore, the correct answer is [Ay((P(x)∨Q(x))&∀y((P(x)∨Q(x))⇔¬(¬∃x(P(x)∨Q(x)))))].\n\n2.An equivalent formula for ∀xP(x) = ¬∃¬P(x):\n For the original atomic statement is P(x), the contradictory statement is ¬P(x), and if it is applied to the entire domain, then the statement that always establishes the truth is ∃¬P(x).\n As ∀ represents that the overall domain always establishes the truth,  ¬∃¬P(x) being always the truth is equivalent to ∀xP(x), which is transformed into ¬∀xP(x) = ∃¬P(x).\n Therefore, the answer is ~~∀xP(x)=∃∃¬P(x).\n\n### Question:\nFor the statement:\nStudents are either hard-working or doing better than hardworking students, but there are some students who are not becoming harder working, and there are also students who are not harder working, indicating that not all students have a good performance.\n\nThe proposition symbolized using logical symbols without semantics is:\n\nPlease give your answer in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[∀x(∃∃P(x)⇔∃xP(x))]\n\n### Question:\nLet the predicate be three-dimensional:\nF(x,y,z): x + y = z\n\nSuppose z = 4, x < 7, and y > 3.\n\nIf F(x) is false, then from the second premise, it follows that F(x) is false.\nHowever, we can deduce that F(x) is true from the first premise, indicating that F(x) is a false statement.\nTherefore, the proposition is false.\n\nGiven the argument, infer the premises of the statement.\n\nFor the statement:\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[];...] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Ay(P(y)⇒(P(y)>>P(y)))];[Lz,Qy,q,w,f,v,T,Lz,Qy,r,w,a,s]]\n\n### Question:\nThere is an erroneous theorem that depends on proving a contradiction between propositions about natural numbers:\n\na subsequence of a set Set S of natural number inequalities implies the same sequence Set S of inequalities.\n\nSuppose we have Set a:\n\n{\n\n}\n\nAs Set a is a subset of Set S, there exists a natural number n such that n is a subsequence of Set S.\n\nHowever, we mistakenly assume that Set a ≠ Set S, thus contradicting our theorem.\n\nGiven the argument, infer the premises of the statement.\n\nFor the statement:\n\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[]] format.\n\nNote: You may need to use the same symbol for two premises.\n\n### Answer:\n\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[];...] format.\n\n### Answer:\nThe problem that needs to be solved here is the problem of determining whether to support freedom as a prerequisite to finding a suitable mate, in other words, whether to prioritize freedom as a criterion

Can provide detailed explanations and examples of several common reasoning rules and inference rules.\n\n### Modus ponens:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. P (P is true)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. It's raining (P).\n-----------------------\n3. The ground is wet (Q).\n\n### Modus tollens:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. ¬Q (Q is false)\n-----------\n3. ¬P (Therefore, P is false)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. The ground is not wet (¬Q).\n--------------------------\n3. It's not raining (¬P).\n\n### Hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. Q → R (Q implies R)\n-----------\n3. P → R (Therefore, P implies R)\n\n**Explanation**: Hypothetical syllogism allows us to chain two conditional statements to infer a third. If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P must imply R.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. If the ground is wet (Q), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n-----------------------------------------\n3. If it's raining (P), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n\n### Disjunctive syllogism:\n\n1. P ∨ Q (P or Q is true)\n2. ¬P (P is false)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunctive statement (either P or Q is true) and one of the options is false (e.g., P is false), then the other option must be true (Q).\n\n**Example**:\n1. Either it's raining (P) or the sky is clear (Q).\n2. It's not raining (¬P).\n---------------------\n3. The sky is clear (Q).\n\n### Simplification:\n\n1. P ∧ Q (P and Q are both true)\n-----------\n2. P (Therefore, P is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Simplification allows us to extract one of the conjuncts from a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then P must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P) and cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------------\n2. The weather is rainy (P).\n\n### Conjunction:\n\n1. P\n2. Q\n-----------\n3. P ∧ Q (Therefore, both P and Q are true)\n\n**Explanation**: Conjunction allows us to combine two true statements into a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then the conjunction of P and Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P).\n2. The weather is cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------\n3. The weather is rainy and cloudy (P ∧ Q).\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis rule of inference is important for exploring the logical relationships between statements and provides the basis for complex logical reasoning. These rules of inference are commonly used in formal proof and reasoning to ensure that deductions are logical and consistent.\n\nFor tasks of type 1 and type 2, it is necessary to clearly state the definitions of declarative sentences, mental sentences, and categorical membership sentences, and provide explanatory examples.\n\n## Declarative sentences\n\nDeclarative sentences are those that convey factual information about something in the world and can be proven or disproven. Declarative sentences typically represent statements about facts or events that can be confirmed or disproved. It is important to note that declarative sentences must be clear and unambiguous, as they are central to logic and reasoning. There are several key concepts and examples to help you better understand declarative sentences.\n\n### Individual declarative sentences\n\nIndividual declarative subjects refer to components that assert individual facts or judgments about something. Individual declarative propositions can be divided into two categories: positive declarative propositions and negative declarative propositions.\n\n1. **Positive declarative propositions**: assert that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Tara is 18 years old\".\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Tara is 18 years old, and by verification, the sentence can be confirmed or denied.\n\n2. **Negative declarative sentences**: deny that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Sally is not a 15 year old girl.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Sally is not 15 years old, and if Sally is found to be 15 years old, the sentence can be confirmed, otherwise it can be proven.\n\n### General declarative sentences\n\nA general declaration is a declarative statement about a particular item or event. A general declaration may have multiple occurrences.\n\n1. **existential declarative sentence**: declares that an item exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"There is a cute cat in the house.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence suggests that there is a certain composition, and if a cute cat can be found in the house, then the sentence is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n2.  **Comprehensive declarative sentence**: asserts that the commonality exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"All cats like to eat fish.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence states that there is some commonality between all cats and their preference for eating fish.\n\nIt is important to note that both general declarative sentences and individual declarative sentences must be clear, unambiguous, and common to the language in order to be properly asserted.\n\nThe following are several principles and guidelines for using declaratives:\n\n1. **Minimize ambiguity**: Avoid vague words and concepts in declarative propositions to ensure clarity of meaning. For example, \"someone went downstairs\" is ambiguous because it is unclear who that someone is.\n\n2. **Precise wording**: Use concise and precise words to state declarative propositions, avoiding ambiguity. For example, \"He is busy today\" is more precise than \"He is busy with something.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge Consistency**: When using declarative sentences, make sure to check if they are consistent with previously specified or existing knowledge. If two declaratives contradict each other, additional information is required or one of them must be determined to be false.\n\n4. **Sufficient evidence**: Upon the claim of a declarative sentence, if possible, provide sufficient arguments and evidence to support its correctness or coherence. For instance, declare things like \"Tara is 18 years old\", and provide some evidence of proof, such as a copy of Tara's ID card, an entry with Tara's birthday in the family record book, etc.\n\n5. **Be Open-minded**: Declaratives are always subject to change and revision as more information and evidence becomes available. The Declarative is the foundation of logical reasoning and artificial intelligence, and it is important to adopt an open and curious attitude towards them.\n\n## mental sentences\n\nMental sentences are declarative sentences that express relationships between subjects and people described in the sentences. Any propositional construction is a combination of declarative and mental propositions. Mental sentences",
