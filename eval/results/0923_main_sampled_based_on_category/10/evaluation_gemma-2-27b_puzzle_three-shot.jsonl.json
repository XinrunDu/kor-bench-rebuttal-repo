Here is the specific rule defined for an exact match puzzle. Your task is to accurately apply this rule to the given question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), … and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt. Also, the words or letters in the scramble function will also be provided to you.*\n\nNow, you can provide the answer by calling the function given below,\n### Function:\n\n```python\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport random\nfrom random import randint\nimport time\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Calculate the random order.\ndef permutation_function(letters):\n\n    # Denote the size of the 2d list.\n    n = len(letters)\n\n    # Initialize the result.\n    random_order = []\n\n    # Create a list of all possible indices.\n    available_indices = list(range(n))\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a string of the available indices.\n        available_indices_string = \"\".join([str(j) for j in available_indices])\n\n        # Get the position of each letter in the new order (randomly).\n        random_index = random.choice(available_indices_string)\n\n        # Update the random order.\n        random_order.append(random_index)\n\n        # Remove from the list of available indices the index we just used.\n        available_indices.remove(int(random_index))\n\n    return random_order\n\n# Function to deduplicate duplicates and sort each letter inside a given letter set.\ndef dedupe_sort(list):\n\n    duplicates = Counter(list)\n\n    printer = [k for k, v in duplicates.items() for _ in range(v)]\n\n    # Alternatively, you can use the following to do the same thing.\n    # print([item for item, count in Counter(list).items() for _ in range(count)])\n    \n    printer.sort()\n\n    printer2 = []\n\n    for i in printer:\n\n        printer2.append(str(i))\n\n\n    return printer2\n\n####################################################################################################################################\n#We're not in need of this particular",
