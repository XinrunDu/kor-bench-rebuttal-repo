No value changes. (10)The logical formula cannot contain the symbol \\=(\"=\").\n[10] The semantic meaning of the formula is preserved.  \n[11] All inverted formulas that appear in the question as explanations and examples must be rewritten into formulas that do not change the semantic meaning.\n[12] All example formulas cannot exceed 500 characters.",

The conditional statement, in and of itself, can take on two possible truth values: true and false.\n\nTo determine the truth value of the sentence, we need to consider the inputs:\nThe sentence has three inputs:\n- The company has received awards [M],\n- The awards were announced this year [AT], and\n- The awards were accepted [PD].\n\nThe relationship between these three inputs is captured by the sentence, \"If the company received awards and the awards were announced, then we received compensation based on the results. (AT ↔ &p.\"\n\nThe proposition will be true if and only if either:\n1. the company has received awards and the awards were not announced, which means\nAT ∧ ¬P or P ∧ ¬AT, or\n2. the company has not received awards and the awards were not announced, which means P ∧ ¬AT\nSo the proposition will be false if neither the company has received rewards nor the awards were announced\n\nNow we refer back to the conditional statement. Note that the company has received awards is given by ∧ (M, p). The conditional statement, is represented by the formula ⇒ (AT, OR (&p). Therefore, the proposition will be holding any one of the following rules:\n• If the company announced the awards (AT ↔ ∧p), then the proposition will be holding true, if and only if: at ∧(p), which means AT∧ ∧M↔ P.\n• If M is a premise and the proposition fails, then the proposition may be false: so it will be false, if either M is false or AT is not true or they both are true. Therefore, the proposition may be true, if and only if M is true.\n\nSo the proposition is a conditional truth. In other words, the first line of the second paragraph is saying that AT is a premise, while the last line of the first paragraph is saying that only if P fails can the proposition be false\n\nThe question asks us to identify the following property: (The proposition is a condition)\n• If P were to occur, then ¬AT would be a premise [AT = M], the latter statement is either false or is false and may result from the former\n• If P were to also occur, then ¬AT will be a premise [AT = N], and the proposition will either fail or succeed [Proposition hold whichever value of possible truth].\nThe conditional will only occur if AT = true [IF TRUE.→true.]; if ¬AT = true, OR (AT∧ &p) the proposition will be a false statement.\n\nThe third term of the conditional statement can be written as follows: 'If Mnp or AP & p, then the conditional staten will be true (OR [M&p & &p)). The phrase & p will follow the same rule as follows:\nM NP p → At\nON\nOR ( M&p) P\nBUT\nOR (¬AT&P)\n\nThe final term of the conditional is: if¬M&p→AT. The conditional will also be\n\nQuestion",

Identify the logic rule used:\n- The trigger is \"ALL instances in class 'S' possess property 'P'\".\n- This corresponds to the conclusion of Φ induction, where `P(E)` is derived for the generalization `forall e in S, P(e)`.\n2. Write the Φ induction premise:\n- Similar to the logic rule, but with the knowledge of 'all instances' instead of 'some instances'.\n3. Write the Φ induction conclusion:\n- The result is the same as the logic rule: `P(E)` is derived for the generalization 'all instances S contain property P'.\n4. Formatting the inference:\n- An `if` indicator shows the condition for the inference.\n    - * If Premises: `{P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)}`\n    - * Conclusion: `Ephi.`\n- A `;` indicator indicates the equivalence of the Premises and Conclusion.\n    - * IF {P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)} THEN `{P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)}` `=>` `{P(E), P(E), ..., P(E)}`\n5. Correctness Verification:\n- Using the provided rules, the conclusion `forall e in S, P(e)` is derived from the given premises `P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)`.\n- Hence, the given stimulus fits the category of Φ induction.\n\n### Resources and Expertise to Access:\n\n- Logic Rules & Processes\n    - **Φ** and Inductive Logic.\n- Tutor: Machine Learning Expert\n    - Personify AI",
