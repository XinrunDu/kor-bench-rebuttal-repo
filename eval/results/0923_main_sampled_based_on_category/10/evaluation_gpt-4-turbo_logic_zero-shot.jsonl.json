Thus p1=::>p2 essentially means ¬p1 || p2.\n- The proposition ~(p1=::>p2) translates to ¬(¬p1 || p2) which reduces to p1 & ¬p2 by De Morgan's Law.\n- Thus, the formula becomes (p1 & ¬p2) & p2, which simplifies to p1 & false since p2 and ¬p2 can't both be true. This resolves to false.\n- As the simplified form of this proposition is always false under any assignment, this is a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Analysis of Formula (2): (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\n- The two sides of the equivalence must always have the same truth value for every possible assignment of p1, p2, p3.\n- Let's analyze the truth assignments:\n  - If p1 is true, the left side (p1&p3) can be either true or false depending on p3, while the right side (~p1&~p2) is always false due to p1 being true.\n  - If p1 is false, the left side (p1&p3) is false, and the right side (~p1&~p2) can be either true or false depending on p2.\n  - Due to the variability and independence in truth values between p1, p3, p2, and the two sides, it is impossible for the two sides to always equate under all possible scenarios.\n- The formula cannot be a Truth Formula as the left and right sides do not always equate.\n- It cannot be a Falsehood Formula solely since there could be scenarios where both sides are independently false.\n- Therefore, it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Formula (1) is a Falsehood Formula.\n- Formula (2) is Neither.\n\nFinal answer: [[B];[C]]",
