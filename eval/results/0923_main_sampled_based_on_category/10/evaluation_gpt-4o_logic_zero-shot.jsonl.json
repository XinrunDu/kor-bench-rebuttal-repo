Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]",

        "response": "To determine whether each formula is a Truth Formula, a Falsehood Formula, or Neither, we need to systematically analyze their truth values under all possible assignments of the individual propositions involved.\n\nLet's start with formula (1):\n\n### Formula (1): ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n\nFirst, we express the negation of the implication:\n- The formula inside the negation is p1=::>p2.\n- The false assignment for p1=::>p2 is ✓|x, which means p1 is true and p2 is false.\n- Negating this means we have to check for when p1=::>p2 is false, i.e., ✓|x.\n- The negation of p1=::>p2, which is ~ (p1=::>p2), means the formula is true when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n  \nNow, for the conjunction operation with p2:\n- For ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, p1 must be true, and p2 must be false.\n- The & operation with p2 means the formula is true if both conditions are true.\n- However, if p2 has to be true (due to the conjunction with p2), there is a contradiction because ~(p1=::>p2) demands p2 to be false.\n  \nThus, formula (1) can never be true under any assignment of p1 and p2. So, formula (1) is a **Falsehood Formula (B)**.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nLet's analyze the equivalence over all combinations of p1 and p2.\n- If we expand this analysis to four possible cases for p1 and p3:\n  1. Both p1 and p3 are true (✓|✓).\n  2. Both p1 and p3 are false (x|x).\n  3. p1 is true and p3 is false (✓|x).\n  4. p1 is false and p3 is true (x|✓).\n\nFor both sides of the equivalence (whether they produce consistent results for each combination):\n- When p1 is true (✓), left side (p1&p3) is ✓ if p3 is ✓ or else x.\n- When p1 is false (x), left side (p1&p3) is always x regardless of p3.\n\nNow let's consider right side (~p1&~p2):\n- Right side when p1 is true (✓), ~p1 becomes x, which means it requires ~p2 to also be true given p1 is true needs ~ conditioned.\n- Right side when p1 is false (x), it then depends on both being conditioned on ~p3, hence ensuring true p2 and p1 expected values.\n\nEvery scenario implies consistent or contradictory equilibrium for both sides:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p3 | p1&p3 | ~p1 | ~p2 | ~p1&~p2 |\n|----|----|----|-------|-----|-----|--------|\n| x  | x  | x  | x     | ✓   | ✓   | ✓     |\n| x  | x  | ✓  | x     | ✓   | ✓   | ✓     |\n| x  | ✓  | x  | x     | ✓   | x   |  x    |\n| x  | ✓  | ✓  | x     | ✓   | x   | ✓     |\n| ✓  | x  | x  | x     | x   | ✓   | x     |\n| ✓  | x  | ✓  | ✓     | x   | ✓   |  x    |\n| ✓  | ✓  | x  | x     expansion here  all consistent `possible false \\/potential x`checks validation due\n| ✓  | ✓  | ✓  | ✓     [matching ful!leque] no full contradiction\n \nGiven this analysis properly simplified:\n\nSince both options or all scenarios lead to result non-matching equivalency scenario wherein one tuple crossroads fail validation without mirrored truth :\n- Means can't guarantee similar level reflection:\n\nFormula (2) therefore technically **Neither (C)**, as it doesn't validate across the majority scenario doesn't comprehensively truth effective.\n\n**So final Answer ([[B]; [C]]) Please find below.**\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[C]]",

        "response": "To determine the classification of the formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r), we need to evaluate it based on the provided logical rules.\n\n1. Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of ¬p, ¬q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r.\n   - (p ∧ q ∧ r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p ∧ q ∧ r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it’s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it’s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it’s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it’s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it’s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4.
