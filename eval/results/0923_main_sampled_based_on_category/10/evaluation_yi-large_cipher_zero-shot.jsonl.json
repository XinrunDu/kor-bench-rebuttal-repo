        "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"UH\" following the provided cipher rules:\n\n1. **Plaintext Preparation**: Convert \"UH\" to a sequence of bytes in ASCII encoding. This results in the byte sequence `[85, 72]`.\n\n2. **Key Preparation**: The SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\" is provided as `73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3`. Removing spaces, we get `73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3`, which we'll use as the key to XOR against.\n\n3. **Encryption Steps**:\n   - Convert each plaintext byte to hex: `[55, 48]` in hex is `5548`.\n   - XOR each byte with the corresponding byte of the key, recycling the key if necessary:\n     - `55 ^ 73 = 26` (in decimal, `1A` in hex)\n     - `48 ^ ef = 77` (in decimal, `4D` in hex)\n\n4. **Ciphertext Output**: The encrypted byte sequence is `[26, 77]`, which in hexadecimal is `1A4D`.\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer encapsulated in double square brackets as requested is:\n\n```\n[[1a4d]]\n```",

        "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"27 ad\" according to the provided rules, we will follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext \"27 ad\" from hexadecimal to a byte sequence. This results in two bytes: `0x27` and `0xad`.\n\n2. Use the key derived from the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\", given as `73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 `. We need to extract the corresponding bytes from the key for decryption. Since the ciphertext has two bytes, we only need the first two bytes of the key: `0x73` and `0xef`.\n\n3. Decrypt each byte using a bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding byte from the key. The decryption process is the same as encryption, so we apply XOR:\n   - `0x27 ⊕ 0x73 = 0x54`\n   - `0xad ⊕ 0xef = 0x52`\n\n4. Convert the decrypted byte sequence `0x54` and `0x52` back to ASCII characters. `0x54` corresponds to the uppercase letter 'T', and `0x52` corresponds to the uppercase letter 'R'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is \"TR\".
