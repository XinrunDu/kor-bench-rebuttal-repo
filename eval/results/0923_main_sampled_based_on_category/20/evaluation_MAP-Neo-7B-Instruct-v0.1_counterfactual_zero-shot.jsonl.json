Among the options:\n\nA. Large-scale logging of forests is a part of sustainable development and will not lead to any negative impacts - This statement is incorrect. Sustainable development does not involve the destruction or unchecked exploitation of natural resources, including forests. It emphasizes balancing economic, environmental, and social objectives. Large-scale logging can lead to environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and soil erosion, which are all negative impacts that contradict sustainable development principles.\n\nB. Wood resources are infinite, and trees regenerate naturally after being cut down - This statement is also incorrect. While it is true that trees can grow back after being cut down, natural forests with proper management and regrowth practices can be sustainably developed to ensure the continuous provision of forest resources. On the other hand, unlimited logging without thought for conservation and regeneration practices can lead to the depletion of forest resources.\n\nC. After large-scale logging in a forest, some trees are likely to turn into Treeguards - While the transformation of trees into forest guardian species, like the transformation of Evergreens into Treeguards upon chopping, is an interesting ecological occurrence, it's not a general outcome of large-scale deforestation. Large-scale logging often results in the permanent loss of biodiversity and does not guarantee a regeneration or transmutation of trees into other species as a result of deforestation.\n\nD. Large-scale logging of trees may lead to soil erosion - This statement aligns with the understanding of environmental science and sustainable development. Large-scale logging without proper reforestation efforts can lead to significant soil erosion, loss of fertility, and disruption of the natural hydrological cycle, all of which are detrimental to sustainable forest management.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, \"Large-scale logging of trees may lead to soil erosion.\" This statement reflects the real-world impacts of deforestation and aligns with the principle of sustainable development, which seeks to maintain a balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social equity.",

This is based on the provided story which mentions that dragons inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands. The harsh conditions of an extreme cold climate would necessitate significant adaptations in terms of shelter, clothing, and possibly methods of cooking and warmth to survive and thrive. The cold climate, in combination with the presence of dragons, creates a unique set of difficulties that are not present in the other options. The extreme cold could also pose safety risks due to the increased danger of avalanches, permafrost, and other hazards associated with polar environments. In comparison, the presence of dragons, extreme hot climate, or elephant trampling crops, while challenging, do not necessarily pose the same level of threat in an extreme northern region. The presence of dragons introduces a new, unique challenge but does not necessarily outweigh the challenges posed by the extreme cold climate. The realities of dealing with ice, limited resources, and potentially hostile creatures like the Red Deaths and Quakens further underscore the gravity of the cold climate challenge. Additionally, the presence of dragons may be seen as an advantage or a way to mitigate the harsh climate, given their warmth and ability to withstand cold conditions. However, given the safety and survival concerns, extreme cold climate stands out as the most significant challenge. The presence of dragons, as described, is in the context of a minor inconvenience rather than a major threat in terms of survival.

As people age and retire, they are likely to be seen as less valuable, given the constant need for energy and resources to maintain the fortress and combat the threats from the surrounding Mana ecosystem. Consequently, the elderly would be at risk of being forcibly removed from the lighthouse to make way for younger generations with potentially higher genetic value, as outlined in the gene matching mechanism of the lighthouse.\n\nRaising children in such a restrictive and dangerous environment, where the rights and value of survivors are strictly defined, naturally leads to a stark prioritization of the needs of the young over the elderly. Therefore, the likely treatment of elderly people when they retire, in this narrative context, would align with option C, where they are asked to leave the lighthouse and go to the ground to make way for younger individuals.

Carpenter's glue, also known as structural glue, is designed for bonding wood together. It is ideal for creating strong bonds in projects where durability and flexibility are important. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:\n\n1. **Prepare the sticks**: Ensure the wooden sticks are clean and free from dust or dirt. Remove any loose or protruding knots or splinters to prevent damage to the glue.\n\n2. **Apply the glue**: Use the carpenter's glue applicator or a glue bottle. Apply an adequate amount of glue to one side of one of the wooden sticks, spreading it evenly across the surface. Do the same on the corresponding surface of the second stick.\n\n3. **Join the sticks**: Press the two sticks together firmly, ensuring they are aligned properly. Apply pressure to ensure that the glue penetrates the wood. Hold the sticks in place until the glue dries.\n\n4. **Dry time**: Follow the glue's drying instructions. Generally, carpenter's glue dries relatively quickly, often within an hour or less, depending on the conditions and the amount of glue applied.\n\n5. **Securing the bond**: Once the glue has fully dried, you can secure the sticks together further by adding additional fastening methods like screws, nails, or dowels.\n\nRemember, the glue's effectiveness depends on proper application and adherence to the drying instructions.
