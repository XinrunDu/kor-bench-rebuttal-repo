By applying the distributive property and simplifying, we can obtain the following disjunction of conjunctions:\n\n(¬p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∨ ¬r) ∨ (¬q ∨ ¬r)\n\nNow, according to the given logic rule, we identify the paired conjunctive terms (all with subscripts in descending order representing their binary, which then corresponds to hexadecimal i) for each conjunction.\n\n1. For the first conjunction (¬p ∧ ¬q), the binary number is 10, which corresponds to hexadecimal number 2. The paired conjunctive term is (¬p^¬q) and it is denoted as m2.\n\n2. For the second conjunction (¬p ∨ ¬r), the binary number is 11, which corresponds to hexadecimal number 3. The paired conjunctive term is (¬p^¬r) and it is denoted as M3.\n\n3.

We can play around with combinations to satisfy these conditions:\n\n- **For p = True and q = True and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is True because all conditions are met.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - So, the overall expression evaluates to True, but since we want \"O\" to be negative, this combination doesn't work directly.\n\n- **For p = True, q = True, and r = True:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because r is True.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because both p and ¬p are True (but ¬r must be False).\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - All three components are false, meaning the entire expression evaluates to False, which aligns with our requirement for an output of \"O\" that is \"-\" when the expression isn't True.\n\nTherefore, the set of inputs that satisfy the given condition and produce a negative output of \"O\" (\"-\") for the logical expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ r) are:\n\n- p = True, q = True, r = True\n\nThis combination satisfies the logical requirements without directly satisfying the expression but produces the desired negative output for the given logical expression. Other combinations could also be valid depending on the context, but the primary focus here was to address the problem as provided.\n\nFor completeness, here are additional combinations:\n\n- **For p = True, q = False, and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because q is False and ¬r is False.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True and q is False.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because p is True and r is False.\n  - The overall expression evaluates to False, satisfying the requirement for an \"O\" of \"-\" when the expression is not True.\n\nThese are some of the possible combinations that meet the specified conditions. Other permutations could also satisfy the conditions depending on the interpretations and requirements of the logical expression and the context of the circuit diagram.",

School Y has 210 out of 300 students (70%) also reporting satisfaction. Here, we are considering 'student satisfaction' as the attribute `F`.\n\nThere are two primary observations:\n\n1. **Represents the Sample Statistics**: The observed sample proportions of students satisfied in School X and School Y are 70% and 70%, respectively.\n\n2. **Comparing Proportions**: The two samples (School X and School Y) are being compared for their proportions of students satisfied with the school's facilities. This directly aligns with the C-Reasoning Rule's aim.\n\nGiven these, we can apply the C-Reasoning Rule:\n\n- If `C(F, p1, p2)`, where `p1` and `p2` are the proportions of students satisfied in School X and School Y, respectively. Here:\n\n    - `p1 = 0.70` for School X\n    - `p2 = 0.70` for School Y\n\nThe symbolization based on the C-Reasoning Rule is:\n\n- If `C(F, 0.70, 0.70)`, then `Pr(F, P1) ≈ Pr(F, P2)`.\n\nThis indicates that:\n\n- The proportions of students in School X and School Y satisfied with their facilities are similar. \n\nIn terms of mathematical expression:\n\n- `Pr(F, P1) = 0.70` and `Pr(F, P2) = 0.70`.\n\nSince `Pr(F, P1) ≈ Pr(F, P2)`, the two schools' student satisfaction proportions are approximately equivalent. This aligns with the rule that if two samples exhibit similar proportions in attribute `F`, we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `F`.\n\nThis analysis underscores the practical application of statistical reasoning rules in analyzing sample statistics to infer properties of larger populations. It's crucial to recognize that this approximation might vary when considering other factors or a more comprehensive dataset.

The logic rule for the GB Paradox is particularly relevant here, as it addresses the issue of drawing contradictory predictive conclusions from the same observation through differing inductive reasoning.\n\nHere's a breakdown according to the specified rules and symbolic representation:\n\n- **Premise**: The hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is assumed, stating that for all x, if R(x), then B(x).\n- **Logical Operations**: When we observe R(a) and B(a) simultaneously, we apply R(a)→B(a), which is a manifestation of the adopted hypothesis.\n- **Contradiction Avoidance**: The paradox arises from the contradictory nature of two assumptions, R(a) and ¬R(a), leading to two seemingly incompatible conclusions about B(a). This contradiction suggests that additional criteria or rules are needed to determine a reasonable hypothesis.\n\n**Symbolic Representation**:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) reflects the premise of the hypothesis.\n- R(a) ∧ B(a) indicates that both R(a) and B(a) are true at the moment of observation.\n- The equivalence condition establishes that ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)), highlighting the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the provided statement fits the criteria for the GB Paradox, and the answer is [A]. This paradox arises when different logical inferences from the same observation yield contradictory conclusions, necessitating a deeper investigation into the reasons behind these contradictions. In the context of the GB Paradox, this requires reassessing the conditions of reasonableness and exploring alternative logical frameworks that can accommodate such contradictory observations without leading to a logical dead end.",

According to the rules of the LS Paradox, when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\nGiven the hypotheses:\n- r_1: All apples are fruits\n- r_2: All fruits are rich in vitamins\n- r_3: Apples contain vitamin C\n- r_4: Apples do not contain vitamin C (contradicts r_3)\n\nThe step-by-step logic process would be:\n\n1. Recognize that hypotheses r_1 and r_2 are reasonable and accepted.\n2. Understand that the logical consequence of r_1 and r_2, which is all fruits being rich in vitamins, is reasonable.\n3. Acknowledge that finding a hypothesis r_4 that contradicts r_3 is problematic.\n4. Apply the rules of the LS Paradox. The conjunction of r_1 and r_2 (i.e., all fruits being rich in vitamins) contradicts r_3. This contradiction calls for a reassessment of the reasonableness of r_1, r_2, and r_3.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate response to the question is to \"B.

Let's analyze each principle individually:\n\n1. **C* Principle**: The mother's action of picking up the crying baby and identifying herself as the baby's mother can be related to the C* Principle's \"Speaker's Criterion\" which involves the principle that one should not make claims unless they have sufficient knowledge or evidence to back them up. In this case, the mother makes a claim about being the baby's mother based on her direct relationship and knowledge of the baby's parentage. This act respects the principle that statements should not be weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge allows, unless stronger statements are in conflict.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: The C% Principle, with its \"Minimalization Criterion,\" aligns with the concept of using language efficiently and only when necessary for effective communication. In picking up the baby, the mother minimizes her actions (verbal and physical) to communicate her intention effectively, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on speaking as little as possible to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Lastly, the C! Principle, where it advises against the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason, can be linked to the situation. The mother, upon picking up the baby, does not use a lengthy or marked expression to indicate her intentions or identity. Instead, she opts for a simple, direct action, which adheres to the principle's guideline of avoiding lengthy expressions.\n\nHence, considering the provided scenario, the situation best aligns with the [[C* Principle / C% Principle / C! Principle]]. However, for clarity and specificity, let's choose:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle primarily deals with the adequacy and accuracy of information in speech, ensuring that statements are not weaker than what the speaker's knowledge permits.\n\nTherefore, the most closely aligned principle to the action of the mother picking up the crying baby and identifying herself as the baby's mother is the **C* Principle**. This principle takes into account the speaker's criterion of not making claims without sufficient knowledge or evidence, which is directly relevant to the scenario's context.\n\nPlease note, in logic and reasoning, the choice of which principle applies can often be nuanced and dependent on the specific context provided. However, based on the given scenario, the **C* Principle** appears to be the most directly applicable among the provided options.",

This effectively confirms the original proposition's necessity by negating the contrary proposition's validity.\n    - **Elim- Method**: This method indirectly determines the original proposition (\"light has mass\") by eliminating other possibilities that could be considered false. The argument eliminates the possibilities that light could not have mass and still generate the observed pressure. This indirect elimination of alternative explanations or conditions strengthens the original proposition's validity.\n\nHence, the argumentation method used in the statement involves a combination of the E+ Method (direct) and both the Contra- and Elim- Methods (indirect).
