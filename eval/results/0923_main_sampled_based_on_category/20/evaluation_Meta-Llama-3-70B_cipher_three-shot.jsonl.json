Each character in the Morse code consists of a sequence of dots (.) or dashes (-). The dot . represents a short duration on the off state, while the dash - represents a longer duration on the off state. Both the dot and the dash are separated by a short duration in the off state. For example, the Morse code for the letter A is encoded as .- (dot followed by dash). To simplify data storage and reduce the size of the data representation, it's possible to map each dot-dash pattern to a number. For example, the letter A represented as .- can be mapped to 1. By systematically using numeric patterns for the Morse code symbols, such as .---, -.--, -.-, ..-., .---, etc., the Morse code can be efficiently represented by a sequence of on-off signals.",

Extract all uppercase letters from `TDOACY` to the plain text $p = TDOACY$\n2. Obtain the ciphertext $c$ by performing encryption operations on $p$\n3. Returns the ciphertext $c$\n\n$decrypt(G*V*Z*RL*E#*)$\n1. Extracts all characters other than \"*\" from the ciphertext to obtain the ciphertext $c$\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext $c$ to obtain the plaintext $p$\n3. Return the plaintext $p$\n\nEncryption steps\n1. ```p_list = []\nfor sym in p:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\np = p_list```\n2. We can create a $5 × n$ matrix $M$, where $n$ is the length of $p$, to hold the plaintext in order. When filling in the same column, we should pay attention to the presence of \"$\\#$\".\n \n ```M = [[0] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(5)]\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = False\nfor i in len(c) - 1:\n    M[y][x] = c[i]\n    if direction:\n        if y == 0:\n            y = 1\n            x += 1\n            direction = False\n        else:\n            y -= 1\n    else:\n        if y == 4:\n            y = 3\n            x += 1\n            direction = True\n        else:\n            y += 1\ny_direction = [True, False] * x\nfor i in range(len(p_list)):\n    j = 0\n    while j < x and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n3. It is a simple and easy process to obtain the ciphertext from the matrix $M$.\n\nDecryption steps:\n1. Exclude all special symbols (hereafter referred to as $ast$) from the ciphertext $c$ and only keep letters.\n\n```c_list = []\nfor sym in c:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\nc = c_list```\n\n2. Again, you can creat a $5 × n$ matrix $M$ to hold the letters of the ciphertext in order.\n \n```M = [[0] * (len(c) - 1) for _ in range(5)]\nc_list = c.split(\"$ast\")\nfor i in range(0, len(M[0])):\n    M[i] = list(c_list[i])\n\nfor p in p_list:\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(len(M[0])):\n            if M[i][j] == \"$#$\":\n                M[i][j] = p\ny_direction = [True, False] * len(M[0])\nfor i in range(p):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(M[0]) and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n2. Read the matrix $M$ column by column to obtain the plaintext.\n\n### Extended Questions:\n\n1. Q: Can you explain in details the logic path for the idea of the direction switching of decryption operation?\n\nA: The decryption operation can be viewed as an inverse of the encryption process. For example, if the encryption process reads characters four columns from left to right, the decryption process should read columns from right to left, as if shaking a \"snake\".\n\n2. Q: Do you know what encryption and decryption are?\n\nA:  \n**What is encryption decryption?**\n> The process by which code is translated into secret code, so that only the recipient can decode and obtain the original text, is called encryption, while the process by which encrypted code is converted back to original text is called decryption.\n\nEncryption and decryption, called cryptography in the field of information security for short, requires that the encryption system have a \"secret key\" as a \"password\". The recipient obtains the key through another channel and decrypts the secret code transmitted. Of course, the keyword must be kept secret from the information recipient, otherwise it will cause information leakage.\n\nThere is also asymmetric encryption algorithms, in which the secret key consists of a key pair including Public key and Private key. The Public key is open to anyone, the Private key is only available to the encryptor. Even if the encryptor wants the information to be opened only to some specific people, the decryptor can decrypt the text by using another Public key to decrypt.\n\nBy using encryption decryption, the secrecy of transmitted information can be safeguarded. If an eavesdropper intercepts the secret code, he cannot decrypt it without a special key, even though he knows the method by which the secret code was translated. Accordingly, it is impossible to read the plaintext sent unless the key is a clear text.\n\n**What is encryption?**\n> Encryption refers to any means of preventing leakage or interception of data. The most common encryption techniques include stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\nCommon encryption algorithms include Core Connection Protocol, Configuration Encryption Algorithm and Hierarchical configuration encryption algorithm.\n\nEncryption is the process of making secret codes or information unrecognizable and meaningless so that only the sender and the intended recipient of the secret codes or information know how to read it. The modern method is to apply some secret codes or keys to the digital information, so that by manipulation, the person who has the secret codes or keys can restore the encrypted data to be readable.\n\nEncryption can be defined from two aspects: one is to convert the file into unreadable content so that others cannot read it; another is to convert the normal content of the file into other contents so that others can only read them after they have cumbersome operations.\n\n**What is decryption?**\n> In cryptography, decryption is the silent restoration of encrypted information to its original, intelligible form, known as plaintext. This is usually done wit Pohz the use of the proper key, thus making the decrypted text readable and usable.\n\nDecryption is the process of reconstructing the original text from a ciphertext or intermediately text. There are two types of decryption: decryption by authorized users and decryption by unauthorized attackers. For both cases, the original text must be correctly translated into plaintext.",
