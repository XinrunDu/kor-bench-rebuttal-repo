At this time, Tanizaki took the first name Seiji, but it did not remain for very long. In 1909 he attended Tokyo Imperial University and studied Japanese literature. Despite his interest in classical Japanese literature, he loved the modern works as well, devouring Dostoevsky, Proust and Hardy among various others. During his second year in college, his opinions of Japanese spirit began to take shape with a disdain towards Western-influenced ideas.[7] He then joined a rightist fraternity and cultivated a fascist lifestyle, which included actions such as vandalism and random attacks on strangers. This patriotic activity was only momentary; he went back to his books by the end of his collegiate career.[10] One year after his entrance into Tokyo Imperial University, a year after he published his first work,[8] and the year he fell madly in love with a woman, Tanizaki's father died. His life as a creative writer, in fact, began the following year. He contributed many poems and stories to literary magazines. In 1910, he had his first publications: a one-act stage drama, \"A Change of Ideals\" (paginate Tanizaki's signature and a fashion column, both in a magazine he edited with friend Isoda, Chōjū ryūkō (Fan of Romance)[10]:38). Four such works were collected that year and published as the first edition of a book titled, \"Tanizaki Jun'ichiro Inshu\" (The Collected Works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro).[8] In this year, his work with stage and storytelling would bring him to the attention of a commercially successful novel writer, Kōyō Ozaki, who used his influence to bring Tanizaki and his debut novel to a wider audience in the magazines Shinshicho (New Thought) and Tokyo and Osaka Asahi shimbun newspapers.[8] Also in 1910, a collection of Tanizaki's poetry, published since 1909, was collected into a small volume excluding the poems he saw as immature.[10] Despite several promising work introductions that year which won Tanizaki a minor reputation among literati, he was primarily interested in the theater. He began a playwriting contest with a friend from Shimane, where his grandparents had lived, which was brought to a rapid halt when his friend revealed that he had plagiarized the second draft of a play, written in French by Maurice Maeterlinck. Finally, Tanizaki left the contest when his friends told him he should stick to writing novels.[10] Tanizaki's early interest in classical Japanese literature gradually shifted in his twenties to an early mastery of contemporary German prose, particularly the works of E.T.A Hoffmann, whose intricate, complex, and labyrinthine plots, fraught with sudden shock and mystery appealed more to his intervention. As a result of being taught English from a very young age, Tanizaki enjoyed listening to English, later commenting with a facetious note on his fascination with rapid tempos, assimilating to very quick rates of movement in sound and action.[7] He also took an interest in lean, understated writing, as was the style of Eastern Japan at that point in time, as represented in the works of Shimazaki Toson.[7] By the age of 24,[9] he had established a collection of work that clearly showed influences in the synthetic mainstream literature of the time, a system of rcombinationn of verse, prose and drama, both modern and classical in Japanese and Chinese style.[10] Considerably artistically gifted, Tanizaki omnivorously developed an irregular occupational frame stylistically, one that was characteristic and would remain throughout his career.[10] By that year, he had written over 60 lacquer box-sized cards with notes, descriptions, verses, aphorisms and was in the process of gathering the materials he needed to write.[10] On 10 June 1910, or 1912 depending on the source, Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in Tokyo. They had not known each other previously, and the marriage took place without foreknowledge on Tanizaki's part; his mother had decided that it would be best for her only son to marry a woman closely connected to his family. Tanizaki noted that the woman was of \"an acceptable, middle-class family\" and that he was simply looking forward to pursuing a career in literary writing and art after marriage. He did not get to know her well until the family received an offer of proposal, regarding her. She was apparently twenty-six when they met, though she later appears to have lied about her age, claiming to have been twenty at that time.[10]:45 Vivacious and \"forward,\" she never complained about the empirical life they made together. Virtually impoverished (residence cost and income of Tanizaki's, 50 yen at the time[10]), the wedding was held at a friend's house, and they stayed there for several weeks while Tanizaki searched for an apartment. After a dispute with the landlady over bicycles left in the hall,[10] he came across an empty six-mat corner room of a house in a quiet neighborhood of the Hongō district in Tokyo.[10]\nIn April, 1911, Tanizaki published his first full-length work, a",
