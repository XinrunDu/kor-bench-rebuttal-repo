Wall-nut - Since the introduction in the original Plants vs. Zombies, defenders are one of the most critical tasks to protect the house from being crushed by zombies and stay on the line to prevent them from approaching the brain. Wall-nut was originally introduced as the basic defender plant with relatively low health. In the follow-up version, Wallnut has evolved to Wallnut IV with improved attack power and health. However, its movement is limited, such as it is deconstructed when attacked by pathoblower zombies or eaten by Grave Buster zombies, does not move on successive defense mode, and can be destroyed by fire.\n2. Tall-Nuts are tall Wall-nuts that appear in Plants vs. Zombies 2 as a 2020 event card that lasts until the next season. As their name suggests, they are taller than their counterparts and have higher hit points and damage but are more expensive and take longer to bloom.\n3. Chompers are pure attackers that appear in Plants vs. Zombies 2. It can swallow Spikerocks, Wheezes, Jack O'Lantern Zombies, Lava Guayule Zombies and Wall Breakers, which gives it a very high advantage and can be reinforced by space-apply-swearing to enhance ability.\n4. All Stars is a singular rare plant that appears in Plants vs. Zombies 2 Ultimate Tower Assistance mode. It acts as a Wall-nut, eats any zombie as a Chomper, and has Hypno-Shroom's power. This is the first plant to cause three soldiers to appear.\n5. Endurian is one of the super-powerful plants introduced in Plants vs. Zombies 2 as the ultimate tower mode. It does more damage and is more durable than other plants, but its attack range is narrow and nullifies the damage of Pumpkin prematurely to ensure that the enemy is not easy.\n6. Zomflinger was introduced in Plants vs. Zombies 2 over New Year's. They can be harvested by using hammers and seeds and planted directly, which can increase seed crops. Its health is as weak as Sunflowers. They can't be moved like sunflowers, goldoniks and pea-traps, but they can be placed anywhere in the lawn because they need a sunflower bottom when planted. Zombies can't pass it without attacking with other weapons.\n7. Angrier is a special plant dedicated to planting zombies in the basement, because he is hidden in the basement and can produce gold coins for you to buy other plants.\n8. Ice-Shroom was introduced in Plants vs. Zombies 2 as part of the Night Ninja Zen Garden. It is lost after the ninja event is completed. When zombies are trapped, they will freeze them, freezing them for three turns until the player hits the \"thaw\" button. In problems, the frozen zombies remain, while in the tower mode, it freezes the zombies so that The Sproutz and others are necessarily concrete. It can be upgraded to a more powerful icicle, which acts as a fast-increasing decoy section, and another upgrade is to freeze zombie defenders, which makes them continuously fire when they stop moving.\n9. Steambot Jr is a supporting plant introduced in Plants vs. Zombies 2. It can be built when Marigold, Wild West Inventors, and Time Heroes are built. It does a burst of damage continuously [1] and temporarily reduces the health of all zombies on the track to 50% of the original value when its shields overlap a zombie. It can only be used in the map with Mr 6_swings and Space-time Worldkey.\n10. All of the farmers introduced in Plants vs. Zombies 2 Tower Mode carry a weapon in their hands. They can be trained to local build and they can take on Mastermind ray plants, but this is a very low level of agriculture, it is very convenient to cut a string for only zombies who crouch to cross the place, In addition, its short throw attack makes it easy to multiply on a long line.\n\nhttps://github.com/plantperspective/you-know-my-suit/blob/main/card decks/what-is-it-like.txt\n\n\n### Here are some memes, at the bottom are instructions follow to answer:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hacs46OkicQthhyfBsPKCVI7YPjWlznu?usp=sharing\n\n### Answer:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IPhc8CF5_nzCadr8_SNJAGUePQOuV5-s?usp=sharing\n",

Your task is to determine the related conversion rate between some of the given conversions.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer n ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 3000$$ ) — the number of conversions in a grid.\nEach of the following n lines contains a number from 1 to n.\n\nThe last n lines each contain exactly n digits, each with values 1 or 2; your grid is a set of (n-1)-dimensional polytopes, and the first grid is the root of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n integers, each of which is the converted value of the corresponding number.\n\nYou are an administrator working for the paradata exchange division where the duty is to maintain the conversion rate between identities of registered people. Some parameters are given under of pandas law 1599, as follows:\n\n• Previously registered people can convert between different kinds of identities. Mostly they prefer doing it for free, but some of them want to upgrade to an identity that is considered to have higher prestige.\n• The kind of an identity is just an integer between 1 and n, inclusively.\n• Even more often, a person who has an identity of some kind converts it into an identity of a cheaper kind because he would like to demonstrate how expensive it is to all his previous associates and acquaintances. $Starting with an identity of kind a, the type of an identity after sheared decrease by (a * b % n) times. . . Here crop refers to the previous conversion type, and b represents the removal amount. For example, if the identity is kind 2 and the removal amount is 3yo, the type of identity after conversion will be (2 * 3mo % 2) = 5 % 2 = 3.\n• Some other upgrades are paid ones, where an identity of type a has to be converted into some identity of type b. This situation will cost a certain fee that depends on the types that convert and the conversion path. Herein, fee is the fee for the upgrade or conversion of peoples from type a to a more valuable type b. Between A and Z, A are side value and Z is the highest identity value. As prp 1599 commanded, changes always happen in favor of the tackling party, so that ball is driven to the supporters of the next line.\n• The most popular kind of identity is the root identity. This identity is reserved in the hybrid origin system for insiders and administrators, which may depend on A. The maximum of A is A whole, which is equal to 5. Besides, a reputable A can control their identity well than other individual identity, and are often taken as the root identity.\n• Coincidentally, an upgrade that would cost n Luo can upgrade the identity to be exactly an identity of type A. Cocoons are exchanged at a rate proportional to the rate of conversion through P'.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of 3 integers n, k, and b ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000 ~ and ~ k, b < n$$ ). n is the maximum value of the belongs to n identity b is the supporter belongs to b, and k is the minimized supported by idenbytis.\n\nThe following n lines contain integersbetween 1 and n, separated by spaces. This is the base of the raising tree, and it gets a person named by the identity of c who is now able to change.\nThe identity of indexed kinds can optimize their identity in other pillars in finite steps.
