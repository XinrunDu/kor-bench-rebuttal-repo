(In order to verify or demonstrate an object's non-attribute, what method can we use?)\n\nA. Ψ Method\nB. ⌘ Method\nC. It does not work\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhy does Φ Method need to conclude between predicates in brackets? (If the two predicates are isolated, a monophrasal judgment is still correct. Please take this example into consideration:\n√ If one has n*(n+1)/2 > 100, then one is a genius.\nThe diagnotic list of evidence: This sentence only uses the noun \"genius\" in one place, and the person pronoun \"one\" once in \"one is a genius\" , and exists only once. The concept of genius is not only used once, nor isolated by brackets; however, the Φ Method in this example does not need to be between predicates in brackets. Why is this?)\n\nA.Does the conclusion share any research characteristics with the objective? Both Φ methods and others need to formulate judgment structures in order to be informative.\nB. The Φ method needs to use psychological demonstration to confirm the experimental conclusions objectively, and obviously, psychological demonstration won't work if there is no bracket; why use Φ methods to prove the properties of the elements in the example?\nC. ⌘ Method is suitable for verifying the properties of elements, where negative attributes are measured, and positive attributes are not proved. If one cannot be seen with elements of 1 and 2, the Φ method in the example needs to divide them from the positive/negative attributes in order to verify the properties. This is a preliminary conclusion, which needs further extension.\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]",

This makes sense because we seek to provide an explanation (explanations) for why \"p\" occurs, instead of drawing conclusions that alpha beta lines invalidate and replace prior hypotheses. Next, provide your opinion about whether an explanation (or both explanations) would not be sufficient to conclude an actual occurrence of GB Paradox. Please list your reasons and supporting information in the comment field.\n\n### Answer:\nGB Paradox, since we can draw contradictory predictive conclusions or explanations (q_1 and q_2) for the observed phenomenon (p), but it is not possible to determine which explanation (q_1 or q_2) is correct without additional information such as further rules or observations.",
