Applying rule (10) again, `!(p>q)` transforms into `!(!p | q)`.\n3. Using rule (6) `!(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B`, `!(!p | q)` becomes `!!p & !q`.\n4. Applying rule (1) `A ::=:: !!A`, `!!p` simplifies to `p`.\n5. So, `(p>q)>r` simplifies to `(p & !q) | r`.\n\nNow, let's transform `p>(q>r)` in a similar manner:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` transforms into `!p | (q>r)` by rule (10).\n2. Applying rule (10) again to `(q>r)`, we get `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo compare the two expressions, we need to simplify further if possible and compare their structures.\n\n- The first expression is `(p & !q) | r`.\n- The second expression is `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nUsing rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` on the first expression doesn't directly apply, but looking at rule (4) `(A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C)` for association, we see that the expressions are starting to look comparable.\n\nHowever, the key here is to recognize that these expressions, as simplified, do not directly map onto each other through the given rules without making a logical mistake. The application of the rules was aimed at bringing out the equivalences, but it seems there was an oversight in directly applying a rule that bridges the two forms in an equivalence relation.\n\nGiven this, we might mistakenly conclude that there's no direct equivalence based on misinterpretation or incomplete application of the rules. However, let's correct the approach by directly comparing the expressions after proper transformation according to the given rules:\n\nThe correct transformation and comparison should not mislead from the main question of equivalence. The actual aim is to see if one can be transformed into the other using the provided logical equivalences.\n\nIn fact, the proper application of the rules to check for equivalence involves seeing if one expression can be transformed into the other using the rules of logical equivalence provided, which was the intention. However, my explanations went towards simplifying expressions without directly establishing a bridge of equivalence between the two.\n\nGiven the setup and aiming to correct and directly answer the question without causing confusion:\n\nThe initial analysis aimed to simplify expressions but didn't correctly address the question of equivalence through the rules provided. The question of equivalence between `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` should be approached by directly applying the rules to see if one can be logically transformed into the other, not just simplifying them.\n\nIn classical logic, `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are not equivalent, but the direct proof or refutation of their equivalence should be grounded in the specific rules provided, which my initial analysis did not satisfactorily address in terms of explicitly proving or disproving equivalence.\n\nTo directly address the question without causing further confusion and acknowledging the oversight in the explanation process:\n\nThe answer is [[B]].",

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001. This binary number corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^q^r, following the same logic, we have ¬p (0), q (1), r (1), which gives us the binary number 011.

For 3 variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. However, the given formula does not include all 8 combinations, so it is not a tautology.\n\n4. **Included Terms**: The formula includes two paired conjunctive terms. To determine if it is a basic formula, an all-even formula, or an all-odd formula, we need to identify the indices (i) of these terms.\n\n   - The first term is (¬p∧¬q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 111 (all are true), which is 7 in hexadecimal.

The literals are p, q, ¬q, ¬p, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\nTo apply the resolution algorithm, we start by initializing S0 as an empty set, S1 as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given expression, and S2 as an empty set. Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause.

However, Method A alone does not fully capture the transformation, as it does not account for the exchange of the subject and predicate positions.\n\nNext, we see that the subject (\"true revolutionaries\") and the predicate (\"upright and open\") in the original proposition are exchanged in the inferred proposition, which aligns with the definition of conversion in Method B. However, Method B is not directly applicable here because the original proposition is a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A), and Method B's definition does not exactly match the transformation from A to the inferred proposition's form.\n\nFinally, considering Method C, which involves performing obversion first and then conversion, we see that it perfectly matches our transformation:\n\n1. Obversion of \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" gives us \"All true revolutionaries are not non-upright and open.\"\n2. Conversion of this obverted proposition exchanges the subject and predicate, resulting in \"All non-upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" which is equivalent to the inferred proposition when accounting for the nuances of negation and predicate contrary.\n\nTherefore, the method used for this inference is Method C, as it involves both changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary (obversion) and then exchanging the subject and predicate (conversion).\n\n### Answer: [[C]]",

        "response": "To determine which method is consistent with the derivation of cause and effect in the given discourse, let's break down the key elements of the experiment and compare them with the described methods:\n\n1. **Experiment Setup**: The scientists divided animals into two groups - one with salivary glands removed and the other with their salivary glands intact. The only variable differing between the two groups was the presence of salivary glands.\n\n2. **Outcome**: The wounds of the animals with intact salivary glands healed much faster than those without salivary glands.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the methods:\n\n- **Method ⸮**: This method suggests a causal relationship if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ. The scenario doesn't directly fit this description because it focuses on the difference in outcomes (wound healing speed) based on a single variable (presence of salivary glands), not on multiple varying conditions.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This seems to fit the scenario because faster wound healing (P) occurs when salivary glands (S) are present and does not occur (or occurs at a slower rate) when salivary glands are absent.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent, with varying other conditions. While the scenario has elements of this (presence of salivary glands leading to faster healing, and absence leading to slower healing), the \"varying other conditions\" aspect isn't explicitly explored in the scenario as described.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. While the scenario does involve a change in condition (presence vs. absence of salivary glands) leading to a change in outcome (healing speed), this method typically implies a range of variations or a gradient of changes, which isn't the focus here.\n\n- **Method ⚘**: This involves known causal relationships between multiple factors, which isn't the focus of the given scenario.\n\nGiven the information, the scenario best fits **Method ؆** because it involves a condition (presence of salivary glands) that when present leads to an outcome (faster wound healing), and when absent leads to a different outcome (slower wound healing).\n\n[[B]]",

Here, attributes a, b, c are referred to as -⌘ attributes, and d is referred to as the +⌘ attribute.\n\nIn the context of the question, \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is something that exists on land (Object A) but is lacking in the deep sea (Object B). The reasoning leads to the conclusion that because of the lack of these attributes (air and sunlight) in the deep sea, along with other extreme conditions, terrestrial organisms (which rely on these attributes) cannot survive there. This implies that the presence of air and sunlight is crucial for the survival of terrestrial organisms, but their absence in the deep sea suggests that deep-sea creatures do not require these attributes in the same way.\n\nGiven this analysis, \"the presence of air and sunlight\" corresponds to the attributes that are present in one environment (land) but absent in another (deep sea), leading to a conclusion about the survival conditions of organisms in each environment. Therefore, these attributes are akin to the -⌘ attributes in the ⌘ Method, as they are the attributes whose absence in one context (deep sea) leads to the inference that another attribute (the ability of terrestrial organisms to survive) is also absent.\n\nThe answer is [[A]].",

Given that the scenario involves a conventional relationship (a mother picking up a crying baby) and an inference that aligns with minimal information (assuming the mother is the baby's mother without explicit contrary evidence), this principle seems relevant.\n\n4. **C! Principle Analysis**: This principle focuses on the avoidance of lengthy or marked expressions without reason and the derivation of different meanings from such expressions. The scenario doesn't explicitly involve comparisons of expression lengths or markedness.\n\nBased on the analysis, the scenario best aligns with the **C% Principle**, which involves speaking as little as possible and assuming conventional relationships unless there's evidence to the contrary.
