Note that in formal deductive reasoning, any binary predicate, say the < predicate, can be described by the equality predicate (e.g., x<y ⇔ (∃z)(∃w)((x+z=y) & (∼z=0))).\n\nSo we can use two fixed quantifiers to \"fix\" two parameters in the < predicate as two fixed constants. Similarly, any binary predicate can be rewritten as a combination of a quaternary predicate and two fixed quantifiers. So in general there's no need to add new symbols to our logical system for variables and unknowns besides the usual connectives and quantifiers!\n\nNow we're ready to rewrite the proposition symbolically without introducing any more extraneous symbols such as ∧,∨,¬,⇒,⟺,etc. We just use the usual propositional operations along with some temporary auxiliary symbols.",

It is quite possible that for the bot there is not enough context to back off from the syllogistic reasoning mode and it attempts to replace the variables absentmindedly, as the pressure to follow examples with the same mood is strong.\n\nHowever, even in such a state, the bot at least partially succeeds. At first, it writes out the mood properly, even though it fails to explicitly designate it as 4th figure. Still, this mood information implies the figure. Afterwards, while filling in the moods, while it initially applies the rules without regard to the syllogistic constraints, when explicitly told to conform to a specific syllogism, it succeeds with no problem.\n\nIt is relevant to note that various testing showed that it is incapable to deduce, similarly to the case of the previous problem - that the syllogism is in the 4th figure, which is odd because the figure is heavily implied by the valid moods.\n\n### Example 1\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cO5NaY0V0H8?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n### Example 2\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3YUs6NN51PQ?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nWhile the bot is doing fairly well in syllogistically designated instances, it fails to directly conclude from freely worded premises and conclusions which figure and mood the syllogism is.\n",
