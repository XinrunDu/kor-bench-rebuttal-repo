The Concurrent Rule simplifies to the consideration of `φ` being true or not, independent of the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. Thus, the focus shifts from the possibility operator `⟨ ⟩` to the necessity of `φ` being true in the initial state.\n\n## Step 4: Express the logical expression in the required format.\nThe Concurrent Rule's application in this context essentially leads to considering `φ` as a necessity before and after the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`.
