The rule set you have provided me is a type of formal logic representing how individuals in a group may hold, share, and change various beliefs about a topic or proposition. In essence, it attempts to mathematically model the behavior of reasoning and belief systems.\n\nLet's walk through some of its key concepts and principles. One central idea is the concept of a \"world\" or universe where different beliefs can align or conflict. Beliefs can be thought of as how individuals see the \"truth\" in these worlds. This leads to the problem of belief coordination when members of a group may hold different perspectives on what's true.\n\nThe rule set introduces a few components to formalize this coordination process.\n\n- **Belief (B):** denote someone holds a particular perspective on a topic/idea \n- **Common Belief (G):** indicates via cooperation or sharing, there is a consensus amongst the group about something\n- **Doubt/Question (H):** When a person lacks faith in something believing it to be false or uncertain \n\nNow let's look at some important points from this conceptual architecture. \n\n- Reflexive Belief (if you think X is true, then you believe yourself to also believe X). This captures inner consistent thoughts.\n- Transitive Gathering (if A thinks something and B recognizes A’s thoughts, B will also tend to think that way). Sharing of ideas via interpersonal dynamics.\n- Inconsistent Contradictions (if you believe both Y and not-Y at once things get weird quickly). Logical impossibilities lead to breakdowns.\n\nWe can understand these higher level definitions by simplifying them into logical expressions using logical operators such as implication(→), conjunction(&amp;), negation(~)\n\nNow let us understand each question step by step\n\n**Q1:** If every member of a group G believes p, does that imply G commonly believes p?\nIn order for something to be commonly believed across a whole group we need everyone to actually hold the belief independently rather than just one person convincing all others to follow along.\n\n**Q2:** If individual $i$ has doubts about $p$ and can sense $j$'s beliefs, will their uncertainty affect $j$?\nSince $i$ recognizes $j$'s thought process they themselves may start questioning $p$ even further leading to doubt propagation between group members due to mutual recognition.\n\n**Q3:** Given $i$ firmly believing $p$, what is a structural formula depicting self awareness of one's own certainty regarding $p$?\nThis means $i$ not only believes $p$, but they know themselves to believe $p$. Therefore, we would expect the logical structure to express something like `$\\bullet_\\p\\to \\bullet\\bullet\\pmit$ \nwhere $mit$ represents a special operator showing insight into oneself.\"\n\n**Q4:** Alice asserts her emphatic knowledge that the library is open today, while Bob accepts this premise but simultaneously has trepidations over Alice’s assurance. How might we represent that mathematically?\nThis seems to involve several complex notions simultaneously. We want to depict both confidence and hesitation around a given premise. So perhaps something involving nested brackets.",
