Can you find the arrangement of players by the results of the game?

Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.
