Based on the available information, it is evident that both Type A Hail events and Type B Snowfall events have occurred in the past. During the analysis, we discovered that the occurrence of Type C Fog was linked to Type D Rain events in the past. However, we encountered a unique phenomenon where Type E Drizzle occurred during the buildup of Type F Winds.\nOur insights suggest that the probability of encountering a storm with all four elements is highest during the Type A-1 timeframe, and the same storm structure appears to repeat during the Type Z-1 period. Furthermore, we observed that the combination of Type G-1 and Type H-2 storms produced catastrophic results in the past, whereas Type I-1 events are more common during calm weather times.\nWe will strive to refine our analysis through continuous monitoring of the newer weather data that has been obtained after the implementation of the aerowinds system. Our overall objective is to create an effective and user-friendly forecast model for future storm warnings.\n\n### Answer:\n[[H-2]]",

In order to protect his mother and the villagers, the scarecrow fought fiercely against the mage, and after slaying the mage, committed suicide while surrounded by a strange magid spell. The prince of the neighboring country, after successively ascending the throne, located himself as the king of Xijiang.\n2. The next day, due to the change in the power balance and the king's unwillingness to continue the war, it was decided that the envoy of the neighboring country led by the prince would come to the capital to express their best wishes and end the war.\n3. Therefore, the king, at the request of the king of the adjacent country, requested that the witch of the waste, who was responsible for laying curses on Sophie and was put under the guard of the palace, negotiate with the witch of the waste the removal of the curse and the safe return of the three knights.\n4. However, Sophie, immobilized by the curse, refused to recognize the king herself, until certain words rubbed Sophie's memory, but nothing happened until Sophie went back in time when the flame demon and the scarecrow came to her assistance.\n5. Sophie returned to the present with the three heroes. The counselor of the castle, upon hearing about this, accused Sophie's lack of political insight and royal qualifications and declared her unfit for her position.\n6. After the CG's attempt to falsely accuse Sophie failed, Sophie used one of the lady's mail to reveal that the three heroes in the book are allies and familiars of the counselor.\n7. In the confusion caused by the revelation that the counselor's side was actually hostile, Sophie revealed the royal advisor's true identity as the witch of the waste and ordered the barbarian creatures to surround the palace.\n8. After being hunted down by the puppet's troops and thirsty for revenge, the witch of the waste was caught by commando troops that Sophie knew in advance.\n9. After the witch of the waste was caught, she was interrogated by the king and vowed to support the king in future matters.\n10. After the capture of bad guys, Sophie broke the novelty curse necklace left behind by the witch of the waste and restored herself to her youthful self, officially becoming the royal maid of Xijiang.\n11. Sophie, with the help of her husband, made a big accusation against the witch of the waste, which made her self-righteous, but the queen chose to umbrella the little princess Sophie, who was standing next to Howl on the excuse of staying with the queen.\n12. Howl, who was tired of all this, asked Sophie to take care of herself and her own safety, forcing Sophie to agree.\n13. The baby Aphasia can only speak in nonverbal language. In order to stimulate her to speak, Howl pretended to be a chicken, sensationalizing the scene of the painter hitting the chicken and habiting her language ability to learn how to count well.\n14. Sophie, who has always lacked political imagination, is at a loss. After listening to the queen's entourage, she knows that the queen's execution plan cannot be ressurected and must be properly verified.\n15. The first to bring experiments and blue testing, after many invocations and failures, the mage chose to ask all the mages who were cursed with the novice necklace to take the spring.\n16. Calcifer, who had long become used to the life of the castle, remained in the palace for a long time and, under the guidance of the mission bearer, began to think about how to go back to the adventure.\n17. Finally, concealing her real identity, Sophie filed lawsuits and brought legal charges against Howl. After confirming that the evidence was accurate, the trial decided that the defendant, whom Howl was accused of, should be sentenced to death.\n18. Sophie was overwhelmed by the harsh sentiment and finally decided to reveal her identity and express the truth, but the stone characters outside Howl's mouth were already moving out and making decisions on Howl's behalf.\n19. The evildoer, as the only one left in Howl, cut his throat to hang himself and finally die in confusion. The evil-minded ressurector, who was in charge of the provisional administration of Howl at this time, secretly said that although it didn't work, through various ways he has gained a deep understanding of Howl, and the knowledge Sophie is relatively lacking.\n20.
