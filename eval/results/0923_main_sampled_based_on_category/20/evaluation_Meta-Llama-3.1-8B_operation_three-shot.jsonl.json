In this instance, a¥b=(a^b)-(b^a) and a,b are positive integers. It is sufficient to demonstrate the solution through a strict application of the method.\n\nFirst, the question of 4¥2 presents itself. The input is 4^2-2^4, or 4*4-2*2*2*2. Proceeding, the output is 16-16 = 0. The answer ought to be [[0]] to properly format the correct response.\n\nNext, the arrangement of 3^4-4^3 equals 81-64 yields the result of 17. From 3^4 there are 81 counts, and 4^3 is 64 counts, which leads to the following answer: [[17]].\n\nA new question introduces the number X to challenge the calculation capabilities of the intelligent assistant. The equation of 5^X-4 reads 5*5*5-4, which sums up to 1. The response would then be [[1]] or as short as [[1]].\n\nTo move forward, a comprehensive illustration shall follow. The computation showcases the important part which involves incorporating the number X. 3^X-2 results in 3*3*3-2, which resolves to 3*3 = 9 - 2 = 7. If we represent X this point as 25, it reads 3^25-2^25. The 3^25 can be written as 3*3*3*3*3... 25 times, which returns 1953125 on its own. On the other hand, the 2^25 is obtained through 2*2*2*2*2*2.... 25 times. That adds up to 33554432.\n\nAfter reducing, the final response is 1953125 to 33554432, resulting in our answer [[1953125]].\n",
