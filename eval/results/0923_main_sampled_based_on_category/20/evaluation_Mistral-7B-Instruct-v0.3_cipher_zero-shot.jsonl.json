Encryption Steps:\n\nFirst, calculate the first cycle:\n\n* Encrypt 2 characters (EF)\n\t+ Find E in outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\", get U in inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n\t+ Replace E with U --> [U]\n\t+ Find F in outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\", get P in inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n\t+ Replace F with P --> [PU]\n* Every second character will be encrypted without rotating the inner disk:\n\t+ D would be encrypted as D, but we have processed 2 characters, so no inner disk rotation is needed.\n* Calculate the second cycle (remember to rotate the inner disk):\n\t+ Encrypt 2 more characters (BC)\n\t\t- Find B in outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\", get L in inner_disk = \"BNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\" (due to the inner disk rotation)\n\t\t- Replace B with L --> [L]\n\t\t- Find C in outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\", get K in inner_disk = \"BNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\" (due to the inner disk rotation)\n\t\t- Replace C with K --> [K]\n* Continue this process for the remaining characters and you get the final encrypted text: [YKDWAIFTUVSX]",

Take one letter from the upper half \"G\" and one letter from the lower half \"D\" each time as a decryption binary:\n\n   - For \"G\", the position of G is 0 in the encrypted character set (ADFGVX). The position of the corresponding character in the 6x6 matrix is (0,0), which is R. So, R is the character after G decryption.\n\n   - For \"D\", the position of D is 3 in the encrypted character set (ADFGVX). The position of the corresponding character in the 6x6 matrix is (1,0), which is R. So, R is the character after D decryption.\n\n3.
