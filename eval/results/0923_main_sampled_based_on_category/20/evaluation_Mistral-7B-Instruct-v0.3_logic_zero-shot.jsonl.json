Still, the other paradoxes do not adequately cover these combined characteristics, so the closest match is the BC Paradox. It is important to note that the scenario presented in the question challenges the confirmation standards and requires careful handling to avoid contradictions.\n\nIn summary, while the scenario is closely related to the BC Paradox and the LS Paradox, it most resembles the BC Paradox without a universal hypothesis.
