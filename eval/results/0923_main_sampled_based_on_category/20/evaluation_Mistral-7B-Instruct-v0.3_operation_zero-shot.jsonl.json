First, we check if 25 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* 25 would be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n2. Next, we have the result from step 1 (24) and check if 24 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* the result would still be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n3. Similarly, we check if 24 is a multiple of 14. It is not, so 14 *apt* 24 would also be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n4. Now, we have 24 *apt* 24 as the two intermediate results. We need to apply the operation again since 24 *apt* 24 wasn't initially defined.\n\n5. Check if 24 is a multiple of 24. They are both multiples of 12, but the rule only considers the smaller number in the case they are both multiples. Hence, 24 *apt* 24 = 24/24 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the final result: 24 *apt* 24 *apt* 14. Since the first two operations resulted in 2, the entire operation sequence is equivalent to 2 *apt* 14. Following the rule, since 2 is not a multiple of 14 and vice versa, 2 *apt* 14 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]].",

We can use the rule to write another equation:\n\nlogX_512 + log512_X = log512_10 * K\n\nSince we need to express X as a single logarithm, we'll aim to eliminate the logX_512 term. We can do this by subtracting log512_X from both sides of the equation:\n\nlogX_512 - log512_X + log512_X + log512_10 * K = 0\n\nSince we're looking for logX_512 only, we'll rearrange the equation to isolate that term:\n\nlogX_512 = - (log512_X + log512_10 * K)\n\nNow, we need to find an expression for log512_X. We know that 512 = (82/9)^X, so we write the logarithm as following:\n\nlog512_X = X * log512_(82/9)\n\nSubstituting this expression into the previous equation:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + log512_10 * K)\n\nWe still have the change-of-base formula term in the equation, but we can rewrite it using our operation rule as:\n\nlog512_10 = (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10]\n\nNow, we can substitute the terms in the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10] * K)\n\nTo find X, we'll need to use numerical methods or calculus to solve this equation, but that's beyond the scope of this question. In most cases, providing an exact numerical answer while using only basic arithmetic operations is impossible, especially in reverse operations.\n\nHowever, to give an approximate numerical answer, we can make some approximations:\n\n* log2_(82/9) ≈ log2_2 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1.445\n* log512_2 ≈ 9.21\n* log2_10 ≈ 0.301\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 ≈ - (X * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * K))\n\nNow we can try to guess a value for X that makes the equation approximately true. For K, it's hard to guess a value without knowing the exact one for the given question. So let's choose K = 1 for simplicity.\n\nNow, choosing a few integer values for X to see if any of them make the equation approximately true:\n\n* X = 1: logX_512 ≈ - (1 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -6.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 2: logX_512 ≈ - (2 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -2.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 3: logX_512 ≈ - (3 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -0.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 4: logX_512 ≈ - (4 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = 1.442, which seems to be an integer close to log512_1. But since logX_512 should be less than log512_1, X cannot be 4.\n\nThe above numerical method shows that X is likely between 1 and 4. A more accurate solution could be obtained by refining the approximations for the logarithms and using numerical methods or calculus.\n\nHowever, as it is challenging to find an exact numeric solution using only basic arithmetic operations, a more suitable response would be that there is no exact integer value for X that satisfies the given equation.",

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]].",
