Its grid layout is a letter grid. The letters in the garden are hidden in a secret code (special code, different from original puzzle rule).\n\nRead the part of rule regarding “Hidden numbers” in brief.\nIt does not make sense to immediately match the letters of puzzle grid with the letters of dictionary. However, you can find hints in the table of hidden numbers. First take a look at G for example:\n\nHere the letters A and H were being swapped. Verify the same here. After solving the code, replace A with H and H with A.\nNow apply the common solution in the usual way.\n\n### Answer:\nEnter a comma separated list of shaded cities. The list should be ordered from left to right. There is no need to mention any directions (i.e., NE, SE, SW or NW). Coordinates of N city is (0,0).\n[[B C G, F G, K K]]\n   A   B   C   D   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N\nE F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n### Question:\nA\tA\tA\tA G\nA\tA\tA\tB D\nA\tA\tB\tB D\nA\tC\tC\tC D\nA\tC\tE G\tE G\nG\tG\tG\tG G\nUse the Letter Grid or The TALEN Code for word ‘TAIWAN’. Use the F-Socket for the letter T.\n\n### Answer:\n1 First take a look at G for example: G\nA was replaced with H, which in turn was replaced with A. Hence, in our case, A must be replaced with H and H with A. So, our next step would be to swap these letters in the secret code whenever one of them occurs in the random places.\n2 Secondly, verify the same for A->H, H->A in the secret code ...For the start, apply the following changes to the hidden code.\n3 But how to proceed after these swaps to solve this puzzle?\nCheating is not a good exercise, but we can make decisions without changing the dictionary. Imagine you are a robot without emotion or free will and just do flipping the letters based on suggestions. Let’s check this possibility.\nTurn to A and look at the secret code using your “Logic Chip 3407”. Decode the secret patterns shown by the chip.\n\nThe Secret Code gives a pattern for Winter -A / Winter-A.\n\nIn order to keep the letters in the right sequence, we should continue applying alternating reversals (i.e. front-and-back, or left-and-right direction). Experiment with some other reversible procedures until you are convinced that you can solve the puzzle by alternating some (basic) reversals. The puzzle rule tells you that every second domino is necessary for the completed puzzle. Therefore, we need unique poems which are compulsory to cover all the domino patterns.\n4 Now, check whether the secret code is correct. Do you find the logic in it? The tricky part is that we need to match all those letters that point in our direction. The secret code is correct if it points at least 6 times and the place already held a clue in our direction.\n\nNote: This rule only works on a limited # of puzzles(5% of puzzles). The Solution is not provided here as it requires special procedure for printing it.. [As a matter of fact, the solution takes a lot of space, and the maximum possible size of your solution will be\n\n!(x*y * N)= (x*y)*(1+18/275) in which N is the size of the puzzle.]",
