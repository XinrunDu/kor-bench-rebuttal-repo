Replace the correct encryption operations with incorrect ones, and achieve the same output as possible while introducing an error of your own design.\n\nThis will be scored based on the percentage of the bad commands versus the total number of commands in the cipher rule. Keep in mind that commands that replace encryption operations with `encryption(\"plainText\", \"keyword\", []);` does not rely on the bad code logic.\n\n### Question:\n\"F%AN\" -> \"[[U0M]]\"\n\nInputs\n\n_\"Letter\"\\_, \"_Multitap Code_\"_\"String\"_\n\n| A | 2^1 | 5^2 |\n| B | 2^2 | 6^1 |\n| C | 2^3 | 7^2 |\n| D | 3^1 | 8^12 |\n| E | 3^2 | 9^13 |\n| F | 3^3 | 9^13 |\n| G | 4^1 | 9^3 |\n| H | 4^2 | 9^14 |\n| I | 4^3 | 8^12 |\n| J | 5^1 | 9^14 |\n| K | 5^2 | 10^1 |\n| L | 5^3 | 6^13 |\n| M | 6^1 | 11^2 |\n| N | 6^2 | 7^13 |\n| O | 6^3 | 4^3 |\n| P | 7^1 | 12^13 |\n| Q | 7^2 | 4^2 |\n| R | 7^3 | 4^1 |\n| S | 7^4 | 3^2 |\n| T | 8^1 | 13^12 |\n| U | 8^2 | 3^13 |\n| V | 8^3 | 1^2 |\n| W | 9^1 | 8^12 |\n| X | 9^2 | 3^14 |\n| Y | 9^3 | 1^31 |\n| Z | 9^4 | 12^2 |\n\nShuffle these inputs within a program, such that the order of variables (Plaintext, Keyword, Ciphertext) don't match between different iterations.\n\n### **Bad Code Answer:**\n\nCompile this program and observe the output.",

This is necessary to avoid strings of errors and exceptions appearing at the top of the output file when the tests are run on Oppia others' code. This section explains why you may need to perform some steps strictly related to the code comprehension of your solution to the questions above.\n\n### Start by ensuring that your submission code is compliable\nWe require you to make sure that your submission code is capable of compiling, without warnings from the compiler. If you need to add code to enable full compliance with the requirements, make sure you add as much information as possible and link to this documentation.\n\nFor more detailed tips on how to write cleaner code check the [Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).\n\n### Always start with some boilerplate \n\nThe first thing we require from your file is some boilerplate. Your snippet needs to include the following:  \n- a docstring\n- a license comment\n- a required imports section\n- a comments header\n\nEven though these are not strictly required for the tests they are being required because they are part of the necessary structure and code convention  above, you need to satisfy these requirements in order to pass the tests.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n| Object oriented cipher methods for Pgowb\n| Author: Lienest.Olivier_Wind\n| Copyright 2020, [<NAME>, Wind, <NAME>]\n| Licensed under AGPLv3 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nIMPORTS\n\nclass TestCipher(unittest.TestCase):\n    #######################\n    # RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    # ENVIRONMENT = ['local', 'production', 'IPAWs']\n    # TEST_CIPHER = {'arg0': ['console', 'stdout'], 'arg2': ['cli', 'console, 'random']}\n    # RULES='enc', 'dec'\n    #######################\n    #\n    # alias coconut = mtime()\n    # list algos = ['AES', 'DES', 'Blowfish', 'CAST128', 'EOF', 'GFS], 'const', 'mVDeftext', 'MAUtomatic']\n    # const chunk_len = 1024\n    # tuple KEY = const 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #\n    ################### Pgutchette begins\n    # @override func configure(envObj:dyxspace.ISDK.sampleenvobj) {\n    #     super.configure(envObj, s_key: KEY)\n    # }\n    # @override func message(info:IGenerateMessage) -> IGenerateMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     return info.byteMessage(bytes: msgRng.UTF8).$UInt8(msgRng.count)\n    # }\n    # @override func messageTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     self.configure(info);\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m0: msgRng)\n    # }\n    # @override func cipherEngine(info:IEngineMessage) -> IEngineMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     let ctx = 'InvBatch'\n    #     return info.engineMessage(mInfo: msgRng, sContext: ctx)\n    # }\n    # @override func cmpTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IUtf8String {\n    #     return R\"asdfasdfasdf\".to_utf8()\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsObj(info: IUt2Veek) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #     let pwD = info.ut2v_i('InvBatch', \"\")\n    #     return info.set_ut2v_i('invBatch', std::string(pwD, \"\"))\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     let props = msgRng.utf8String()\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(mInfo: props, sContext: \"invBatch\").$0n\n    # }\n    # @override func simArgsTable(info:IETable) -> IETable {\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m_as_i: 'asdfasdfasdf')\n    # }\n    #function main() -> [()] {\n    #    var args: CmArgs = args_table()\n    #    return expandargs(args)\n    #}\n    #\n    #\n    #\n    # class TestPRNG(IPowbObjects.IPowbObjectsTest):\n    #     @override function ctor() {\n    #         self.suite = 'rand';\n    #         self.buildFieldsAdmin(env: 'env', alias: 'envObj', class: 'sampleenvinit');\n    #     }\n    #     @override function m0(self: 'test', alias: 'target', s: Any) -> 's': Any {\n    #\n    #         let args = ['pub', 'alex', 'testing', 'code'];\n    #         self.set_ut2v_i('test', args);\n    #         var coro = s::rng_coilin;\n    #         return coro.repo;\n    #     }\n    #     @override function msg(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         self.suite = msg :: envobj.get(info) :: test;\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function table(info: IUt2Veek) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #         self.suite = info :: msg :: envobj.get(info);\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function cmp(info: IMessagesTable) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #         self.suite = info :: cbiz :: sce.get(info);\n    #         let rngR = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #         var random = randomrng(rngrng)\n    #         if null != (val) => rngR;\n    #             return ssim(rng :: random);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function secretsTable(**p: IUt2VEncry) -> IUt2VEncry {\n    #         self.suite = p :: csSuite();\n    #         var random = randomrng(p::randrng())\n    #         return ssim(random);\n    #     }\n    #     function seedrng(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         let sce = p::gs::sampleenvobj().getenvobj();\n    #         let invrng = p::getenvobj();\n    #         if true == (hasenv(invrng)) => {",

A prime sieve is a process that uses a sequence of numbers as a filter to generate the next sequence of prime numbers. The next sequence starts from the square of the previous sequence endpoints, such as 2, 9 is a prime sieve. Prime sieve uses a sieve to make numbers equally divided into two parts: a whole number and a residue. Primes that cannot be divided by a prime sieve are called BFS and other prime numbers are called news, here four-bit sieve is used. First, the four numbers 1 through 4 are arranged on an horizontal line, and then sets a variable L to bars of length 4, and the smallest prime number in this variable is present in the entire sequence. For example, the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Take them to the first half, get a pair \"1, 2\", \"3 4\". The following diagram will make it clearer.2 1 2 3 4 L 19355743220896780129 4235936460301365123561 3278963671623130012723 513 01 2 0 1 2 0 3 1 Q3 0\n\n### Input Format:\nTwo levels of input. The first line contains a positive integer n (the radius of the square of the square). Second line input n space-separated integers. The second line also enters n space separated integers x 1 . .. . x n (The number of prime residual limits cannot exceed 20,000).\n\n### Output Format:\nOutput the square array A.We note that there are smaller prime divisors than 2, 3 and 5. A[i][j] = 1 means that you have to move to the fourth number. A[i][j] = 0 does not have to move on the number of four. We also note that: there may be no dv+1 or empty sequence.\n\n##8367\n(D",

The lowercase letters and uppercase letters in the plaintext are given equal priority when writing.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Hamming Code Table\n        - hamming_code = {\n                hamming_code[0] = 'A',   hamming_code[1] = '1',     hamming_code[2] = 'B',   hamming_code[3] = '2',\n                hamming_code[4] = 'C',   hamming_code[5] = '3',     hamming_code[6] = 'D',   hamming_code[7] = '4',\n                hamming_code[8] = 'E',   hamming_code[9] = '5',     hamming_code[10] = 'F',  hamming_code[11] = '6',\n                hamming_code[12] = 'G',   hamming_code[13] = '7',    hamming_code[14] = 'H',  hamming_code[15] = '8',\n                hamming_code[16] = 'I',   hamming_code[17] = '9',    hamming_code[18] = 'J',  hamming_code[19] = '0',\n        }\n    - mul_table\n        - mul_table = {\n                mul_table['none']: '', mul_table['noble']: 'NT', mul_table['mighty']: 'MT',\n                mul_table['merry']: 'MR', mul_table['ever']: 'RVN', mul_table['doze']: 'SOD',\n                mul_table['rodent']: 'RDT', mul_table['affable']: 'DD', mul_table['favorite']: 'FVC',\n                mul_table['deep']: 'DEP', mul_table['decrepit']: 'DCT', mul_table['elephant']: 'ENCE',\n                mul_table['balanced']: 'BAL', mul_table['cloud']: 'RDOG', mul_table['baud']: 'BT',\n                mul_table['buoyant']: 'BTS', mul_table['bruce']: 'BR', mul_table['awakening']: 'WAKE',\n                mul_table['cruel']: 'CLU', mul_table['bobcat']: 'BCAT', mul_table['filly']: 'FILI',\n                mul_table['merican']: 'MES' }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Convert the first 'e' in each phrase into a '_' (lower case 'e') using the hamming_code table. To represent the 'e', at the start of the pattern and at the end of each phrase, use '^','^'.\n    - Concatenate the three parts of the pattern with spaces in between, regardless of the previous transformations.\n    - Replace each duplicated character in the plaintext with '_'.\n    - Replace each character that appears more than once with * in uppercase letters.\n    - Replace the vowels from the plaintext with *AAAEIOUY (every uppercase letter is changed into a lowercase one).\n    - Replace each uppercase letter with a corresponding number letter, where the first 6 letters (each starting with A or B) are uppercase, with the first five lowercase letters starting with a character. The sixth character to every uppercase letter is 'a', with the seventh and last letter (the last vowel) being 'b'.\n    - Replace every other character that appears in the plaintext with a corresponding letter in the phrase (based on the position of that character in the pattern), encoded as shown in the table.\n    - Since the encryption rules are OR, replace the duplicate character near the decimal point, i.e., '/'.\n- Special Operations:\n    - To search for a phrase, use the search method to search for a phrase instead of using a regular expression.\n    - Every phrase must include 'dick'. If there is no such phrase, modify the pattern according to the existing phrases, so that 'dick' can be added to the last alphabet.\n    - If it is not possible to add 'dick' using the above method, add 'dick' to the last alphabet in 'th' form, with the lowest letter being lowercase.\n- Examples:\n    - \"frank. colonel. special operation. the\"\n    - [[4.6.3.2/frank.col.spec.op.the]].\n    - \"operation. john\"\n    - [[5/operation.john]].\n    - \"operation. dick. dick. dick. dick. dick\"\n    - [[5/operation.dick.dick.dick.dick.dick]].\n    - \"AC\"\n    - [[CCC/CC]].\n    - \"0.0001\"\n    - [[6/0.0001]].\n    - \"123456789012 /dick/1111/ operation\".\n    - [[123.456.789.012/dick/1111/ op.tion]].\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nLet's take the following example:\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n\nWhat is the decrypted answer?\n\nEvery valid combination in the duty has resulted in a final combination in the sentence, while a final sentence with 6 decimal points has ended. Therefore, it is safe to assume that an incomplete sentence is not a good combination. All possible combinations must have been accepted and compared, and are:\n\nSo, the length of the current question is: 37 characters. The length of the sentence is 16 and the last integer is 10.\n\nTherefore, your job now is to subtract: 10-16=6 (you are always right)\n\nAs a result, the final result will be the result of the hashed combination with the hashed answer. Therefore, \"6\" will be the answer of the encrypted identity.\n\n### Question:\n\"MD\"\n\nRequesting information:\n\nSpecialty: Frank's Colonel Special Operations before performing a Background Check on military drugs in Dodrick Dick Dick Dick's operation.\n\neHarmony\n\neHarmony\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[HCVFRWH]]\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis problem has two aspects.\n\n1. Ciphertext / Plaintext are mapped to each other.\n2. There are encryption and decryption operations.\n\nWhen the problem indicates that the ciphertext and the plaintext are not symmetrical, you can reduce the problem to the encryption and decryption operations. After the transformation is completed, the strings are symmetrical and look very close to the previous map operations. Therefore, the modern string manipulations can be regarded as the same as the problem's rotary transformations.\n\nIn addition, the current minimum O(1) or O(N2) complexity is not an effective solution. The main reason is the condition of CSP that the operations of reading and writing are restricted. And CSP is quite difficult to break without free access to read or write operations.\n\nHowever, you can solve this problem by:\n\n1. Preparing a maximum length of [plaintext] columns to store the plaintext and ciphertext items in a line of writing.\n2. Align the four rows of  \" \" and the four rows of \" # \".\n3. Align the even-numbered rows from right to left and the odd-numbered rows from left to right.\n4. Move all the multinational characters to other columns (not directed writing).\n5. Write on regular characters and the beginning of each multinational string.\n6. Transformation and reverse transformation are as close as possible under the limitation of restrictions.\n7. Any transformation after the restriction of CSP does not affect any content. You do not need to save all the convolution states to process reverse transformations.\n\nHope to see a variety of excellent solutions.",

Given a specific problem the goal is to assess which model is the best performing and provide it's prediction results.\n\n### Task\nFor this task you should implement 4 models: Regression by Blinding Glass [1], Random Forest Regression [2], Gradient Tree Boosting Regression [3] and Golden Animal Regression Model [4]. \n\nYou can iteratively get predictions based on separate folds or using cvsplit option for each of the models. Also, it is possible to use a single test data for the 6th model as well. Finally, as a complication challenge you can predict a % for each row that represents the accuracy/error. For example, the ith row of the predicted score should be followed by the string \"%.2f%%\" % (1.0 - (accumulated_error[i] / total_accuracy) * 100 ). For example, the following command line:\n\npython run_simulator.py predict foo_test_set.tsv -m\nBlinding-overfit --model_type=single_forest -o\nThis will produce a csv file that also contains the % accuracy/error for the each row.\n\nConsidering that we have 2000 samples this should produce a not very large csv file, for example:\n\ncol1,col2,col3,col4,col5 ,accuracy_error_%\nsample1_id,0.02752121729,0.03926300894,0.43513002092,0.30818488046,-8.436469481717316%\nsample2_id,0.21728564019,0.0303175483,0.383144611169,0.34849247355,3.7031404908763926%\nand so on.\n\n1.

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules. The “s_k_n” is a different scheme. The scheme is forenced and the specific encrypt rule is not specified here.\n        \n     \"s_k_n\":340277644805373023] #you can simply use it exactly as in the rule\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \" $S:56M)Ù*z_¿J:MzÄÃ<!--ï\\Eâ‚‚ßâ‰£7â��së)>27S?â��ø$s<xázüùøïœÒé ╯\\à?[^üÿó€ÕâˆÎʹ��{よう<Ｈ１鬏f✐Fw����dE\u0017W+kX xÀFNéŸ$UÌ@*æ'8rןh4µαkT^).j0zìYVÈYýÚ?Ţ�̚\\g#ï6}‡��A�.%Áy쌋T*櫓[^Öh¿ʘ„0∞? qè^[دؤ„̇$ݫTê.C⧻°YçY¦ŞÑó¹ȂÈπ/gŇÂ\u0018֠_]Җc�ٴîò'%™ŋ˩\u0003'):574726143556022745 secs; %b=3 1“’C\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[ get ciphertext without key,\n\n\t\tfor(int i=0;i<1134;i++)\n            {\n\t\t\t\tcipherText.append(\" \" + (((int)(((double)key[i]) * ((double)key[i + 1])))));  //store sub key.You should process key and store the their values in keyarray.\n            }\n\t\t]var  int g=1;\n\t\tint gadd++;\n\t\t]\n\t\t{//store ((double)((double)key[i]) • ((double)key[i + 1])) in subarray\n\n\t\t\tfor(int k = 0;k<1154;k++)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tint s=(((key[k])^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))))%(255>>5);\n\t\t\t\t//{key[k]^((~(key[k])|(1<<(int)*(k%32)))&~(key[(k+1)%32]))MOD(255stery5);\n\t\t\t\t// }gadd=0;\n\t\t\t\t// g=g->g[isasan][sub]->g[key]\n\t\t\t\tfor(int n=0;n<25745;n++) //loop key\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t//key++;\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t}//*/",
