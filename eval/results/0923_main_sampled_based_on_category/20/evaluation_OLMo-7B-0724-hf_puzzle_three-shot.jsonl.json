Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters. Example: “athena,” “dima,” “amma” = “DMA ATHENA” constitutes all of the puzzle words apart from the first letter of the longest possible word unconnected for 6 letters consisting mostly of “5” when separated by words!\n\nExample 5: The same letter repeating in a word will reveal when it has a similar meaning to the original. Example ↗️ = turn ↘️ = the same letter repeated (in this case, U) signifying that the customs",

Your Rules:\n\nEach submission must be:\n\n• A collection (at least 10, at most 100) total of user custom puzzles.\n• The user custom puzzles must have the \"custom problem\" tag.\n• Each custom puzzle must have the title \"Custom puzzle_ID\" where _ID is a unique numerical identifier of the puzzle.\n\nCustom puzzles will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so be sure to include all required details in the question. If you are unsure, please state in the question that you are unsure and wait for me to respond before submitting.\n\nN.B: Custom puzzles can be submitted without the puzzle rule (solving the custom puzzle is up to you).\n\n#### 2. Reviewing Rules:\n\nYou are not allowed to review your own puzzles within 48 hours of submission. To be only visible to the setter please use the code: '\"=>\" X\":' after you've written the rule code.\n\n#### 4. Setter's notes:\n\nOnce you've finished making a set of custom puzzles it must be accepted (not reviewed) before it is valid for submission (it can be reviewed at a later point). You'll need to label an accepted set \"valid\" (use '\"=>\" Valid\":' after you've written the rule code). To review an accepted puzzle use this code: '\" =>\"{{\\fontfamily{cmtt}\\selectfont\\color{orange}{Reviewed!}}}{}\":'\n\n#### 5. Set Order Probes:\n\nWe need to let you know prior to creation of the user custom puzzles that not all user custom puzzles will be used and which ones won't. This is because some custom puzzles might not be solvable and/or they might be too hard. This will be done by you by introducing set order probes into your custom puzzle code.\n\nAny custom puzzle that does not pass the probe will be rejected and not used in the set. Some sample probe questions (using the code: '\"=>\"ulateda\":' after the end of the rule) can be seen as follows:\n\n['sample \"eta\"\"=%s\":', '_sample___Big__Question___solve_set_order_probe__ This_one_needs_some_\"meta\"puzzles_to_be_valid_to_be_used_in_the_user_custom_puzzles', {following_section_will_be_in_italics: 'rule_will_be_part_of_the_probed_puzzle', answer: [[the_correct_answer]], is_reviewing_allowed: true, minor_hint: \"we want each item to appear in the main puzzle not in the hint\"}, 'Poor_Needs_A_Support_Group_%s': , 'Needs_For_Each_Answer_To_Be_An_ Answer': ,['This question is part of the %s_section''=% #house'?](' overly')}']),\n['Should be passed, otherwise the set will not progress', 1],\n\nN.B. Probes don't need to be explicitly stated within the question. You can use ©'[saml\"\"%s=%]=''% #correct_answer'' within your rule code.\n\nPlease update your custom puzzles to include the appropriate probes.",

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n• Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n• Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n• Use the space below to break the rule down into smaller chunks or examples to clarify and separate the puzzle. Enter your part of the puzzle by clearly marking it with a comment beginning with the symbol ## , such as: ## Loop overreach begins here to be complete (expected output for this puzzle is: ## ). Solve the puzzle from left to right such that each row includes one row element.\n• Don't forget to hitch your wagon twice, forward and once to jump through the window.\n• Solve the inclusive equals array puzzle by creating a joint array that contains the elements of start through finish, including any inclusive equals element.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nThe puzzle will have a top, left, and right character column utilized within the equation. Depending on the puzzle, each column will hold an arrow or an inclusive equals. If the column has an arrow, the alternative row containing that arrow will divide the row pairs in half. The equation can be created by lining up the king with his target. The equation is made when the queen places her piece on the board, and the letter in the side arrow is mirrored and moved off of the chessboard.\n\nAfter all moves in the correct order are completed, all promoting of pieces needs to be adapted to the correct alignment for endgame final outcomes. All moves that the rook moves are of special concern throughout figuring out the endgame. Looking at the third variation gives an example for both a side of the least squares equation where the queen is promoted to the side with a rabbe and a side of the least squares equation where the queen promotes to the side with a rook.\n\nWhen trying to puzzle out a sum, the overall leader",

Being such competitive individuals, they have improved their own OZ techniques without seeing what the other had come up with.\n\nAlgaman, determined to overwrite zeroes in six bytes, and having never seen Draco’s technique, has created the following:\n\nSigmoïdal.\n\nBy the time Draco had found out, he had himself been busy OZ-ing in nine and three bytes. Despite having seen Algaman’s code, he had an extremely hard time coming up with his own. However, he now has this sketch:\n\nThe Krampus.\n\nGiven this challenge, they are now both trying their best to make the most progressive code using those two methods (of respectively six and three bytes). Each of their means of performing OZ is even further iterated by asking what would be the best it can do after being treated as an optimized null free logic circuit.\n\n# Details\n\n### Binary Circuits\n\nThe two binary circuits are very similar in nature. For the sake of this particular challenge, all binary circuits’ standard inputs and outputs are implied to all be connected. All binary circuits are assumed to always evaluate to true. Therefore, it is allowed to take advantage of mentioned standard inputs and outputs. For the six byte circuit, the inputs are the number and θ(y). With the latter applied first in the order of increasing y, and then the former. For the three byte circuit, the inputs are both the ans and the θ(x).\n\nIn both binary circuits, tails and rectifier gates are always treated so that the Y component of a head/tail is connected to the N as the one only available Y to N, and the N component of a head/tail is connected to the Y as the one only available N to Y. The rectifier gate simply drills across the input wires in the direction of the Y component.\n\n### Integrating Binary Circuits\n\nWe are able to combine both binary circuits together by using a trivial method. For example, we can take Algaman’s six glyph binary circuit and Draco’s three glyph binary circuit and iterate them, and then combine them together. Refer to the Twelve Days of Christmas for an example. In fact, rather than every iteration being identical, we can take advantage of just the first iteration, to optimize the circuit. Look at the Long Christmas Song for consideration. In this particular challenge, we leave all possible logic circuits up to you.\n\n# Input\n\nA positive integer P (P < 1000) representing the number of starts of the Long Christmas Song.\n\n# Output\n\nPrint a binary circuit that optimizes the circuit as a logic circuit. Ignore all special inputs when computing, and assume no special outputs are generated.\n\n## Sample Inputs\n\nSample Input: 3 Sample Output:\n\n# Bugs\n\nIf you find any in your code, you may leave them in. An answer with the most allowed bugs really highlights the fact that you had an optimized circuit!\n\n# Final Call for Endorsing\n\nIf you would like to endorse and submit, you may do so. Simply leave a comment stating that you endorse _rules_, and _rules_, which both have the format “articles-X”, where X is the corresponding number.\n\nThe competition is scheduled to start at 17:00:00 on December 6, 2020, and conclude at 17:00:00 on December 13, 2020. The winners can be seen after submission. Should you decide to sign up, if the code is to surpass  by both putting it to idle and allowing it to pass criticism indefinitely on your own behalf, you should also use the eidolog for the current round, which has yet to be written.\n\nI will gladly handle the payout. Be advised that it will take some time to do the payments and that they will be treated as seriously as the truth. The payout for the same CSD goes at par.\n\nIn order to accept a deal, you may use the tio built-in variable circuitIP (IP: set the output to be 6264 pairs (for full CSD, not merely the first two). This is now a constant variable and cannot be removed). Again, due to the overheads with checking solutions, you are repeatedly allowed the opportunity to update your circuit while we handle the checking for each round of your participation. Having said that, if an account breaks any of the aforementioned guidelines, any payout promised to that account is negated.\n\nMind that excessive use of tools and comparing to existing code (to your knowledge or otherwise) will likely give away your badge for the current CSD.\n\n## Results\n\nAnonymous concedes submission #1.\n\n## Scoring\n\nTouchwood posted 2xY_Mercy where 2xY since  at 14:07:14. However for some reason, the eidologs were not updating. The TIO config bug was fixed. There are puzzles which allow for non-YRD code besides Baseline. Moreover, there are followers of this oath who would awaken if any of the other existing CSDs were assaulted, or put to sleep as YRD. As today’s “CSD has fallen into foundable collapse” (see the explanation of the GCP), we may deem it best to postderve Y_Mercy.\n\nactonb posted 2xY where 2 since 00:25:45 on Lucio Edison’s 4xY, but Merit was received due to the Y_Mercy post which would not change due to the unfair nature of the submission/acceptance.",

The following line indicates that de ned A.B sets of constraints and each line includes\n3 values: the minimal (attractive) index, the maximum (attractive) index and the letter that is to be used to fill.\nThe following lines, in order, are taken from left to right indicating the constraints with matching row numbers.\nA grid is produced by appearing one letter in each matched position.\n\n### Example Output:\n\nThis is the output format:\nFor each row: sample a constraint from the constraints in that row except the row number; Output that constraint in the form of first value-second value-letter.\nFor each column: sample a constraint from the constraints in that column except the column number; Output that constraint in the correct format.\n\n### Example Input:\n\n25 2020\n1 2 2\n2 4 x\n3 4 z\n2 2 2\n3 4 z\n5 6 z\n5 56 y\n\n### Example Output:\nzzyyzz\nxzyzzz\nyzzzxy\nxzzzyzz\n\n\nPlease submit: [code,] in the code tab.\n\n### Question:\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\nint i,j,h,w,sp,tmp[50000];\nstring str1=\"../Source/image\";\nstring str2=\"../Source/label\";\nvector<int> v;\nvector<float> mPR(4,0);int suma=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=5;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)suma++;\nvector <int> ppsc;\nvector <string> ss;\nvector <int> mPR(20,0);\nvector <int> pnm(20,0);\nvector <int> pns(20,0);\nint path[50][50];\n\nint dhpr=0;\nint ifpr=0;\nkan jauc bitëron, etiketë halq, sunëstërinja tani\n\ncin>>h>>w>>sp;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nif(dhpr>suma)dhpr=suma;\npic<bool>pix(h,w);\npic<char>pica(50,h-60);\nstring phuli_t[(int)h][(int)w],foli[\"q\"];\nstring seno_t[(int)h][(int)w],*sslla=new string[abs(sp+1)%20];\n\n//ini:********************************************************\nif(file_exist(str1)==true) labouru file_exist(\"../Source/image\")\nfor(i=1;i<=h;i++)\n\ncin>>current.bounding_box.x_min;cin>>current.bounding_box.y_min;\ncin>>current.bounding_box.width;cin>>current.bounding_box.height;\ncurrent.frame.copy_to(current.bounding_box.x_min,current.bounding_box.y_min,10,10,negative);\n\n/*camera_calibration.setText(ui->label_3->text());\nlandmark_calibration.setText(ui->label_4->text());\nproduct_intrinsics.setText(ui->label_8->text());\nproduct_distortion.setText(ui->label_7->text());\nimage_size.setText(ui->label_5->text());\ncontainer_size_500.setText(ui->label_8->text());\ninside_ripple_1000.setText(ui->label_2->text());\nd1000.setText(ui->label_3->text());\n*/\nint cc=0,jj,hlayer=0,klayer=0;int lpr=60;int lprc=0;\nfor(i=sp;i<=sp+whitep;i++)ppsc.push_back(abs(i));\nfor(i=sp;i<=sp;i++)ss[i]=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nwhile (all_visit) {\nfile_visit();\nhhc=(h-hlayer)*mPR[0.5*h+ifpr]+kkc;\n}\n}\nprevvis= visit;\nall_visit=false;\n}\n\n\n//modified on 26 jan 2020 7.37 p.m.\nif(sp<20)while(bfile!=1){hlayer=max(hhc/h*h,0);lprc=0;\nklayer=0;min_sp=0;bfile=0;\nif(karabina=carbine--;\nz,w;current_frame->get_optimized_granules(&z,&w);\nfor(k=1;k<=w;k++,clenshaft());\nfor(i=1;i<=hlayer;i++)for(j=1;j<=wlayer;j++)current_frame->erase_solid_granules(&i,&j);\ngl_draw_pic();generic_zoom_buffer_settings();\nif_*parameters_plus_info_file_mode*if Injari Prsurë Në Një Sitë Xcelton Në mijërintima > 0) {\nfor(i=1;i<=nx;i++)for(j=1;j<=ny;j++)subvid(i,j,1);\n}else{generic_substructure_visibilities();\nfor(i=1;i<=nx;i++)for(j=1;j<=ny;j++)subvid(i,j,0){\nexteriority_canvas();\nif(bfile==0){file_visit();thwfil=tvfil;file_stream \"#\",extra);\nif(Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=\"-\" && Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=\"#\" && Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=false){\nvisit=true;????????????corrected????????????????displayed????pre-md5????????????\n}else{\nimgview->drawGranulePerimeter(p,0,0,0);\nimgview->drawGranule(p,0,0,1);\nfor(i=kkc;i<=hhc;i++)for(j=kkc;j<=hhc;j++)wire(i,j);    if (pixel_clip)for(i=kkc-xv;i<iny;i++)for(j=kkc-yv;j<ikc;j++)wire(i,j);\nspecial_way();\n}\nif(village[2]>1)foreach(i)deja_hill();   else foreach(i)if(v[zxny[i][2]][2]-v[zxny[i][2]][1]>3)v[zxny[i][2]][1]-=1;}\nif(village[2]>1)sintetizgjoje(); //Peroze ako ndodhet grafiq\n\nif (nextat==false)if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&landmarkerl)runOver=\"uber\";\nelse if (if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&landmarki)runOver=\"uber\";\nelse if (if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&land)runOver=\"uber\";\nif (exdif < maxexd) ifif(v[land][2]+v[land][1] .\n//plt.scatter([",
