Now, we symbolize p > r as !p | r using rule (10).\n\n5. After this transformation, our expression becomes !(!p | q) | (!p | r).\n\n6. Finally, we evaluate the equivalence of the two expressions. Applying equivalence rule (11), we require that !(!p | q) & (!p | r) is true if and only if !p | q is equivalent to !p | r.\n\nBy examining the individual parts:\n\n- !(!p | q) means \"it's not the case that p or q is true,\" which simplifies to p & !q.\n- (!p | r) means \"it's either not p or r is true.\"\n\nGiven that these parts are indeed equivalent (both can be true when p is false and q is false, and true when only r is true regardless of the truth of p and q), and without further specific information that contradicts this equivalence in general, we can preliminarily judge them as equivalent under this symbolic representation.\n\nHowever, since \"equivalent\" in a propositional logic context, unless specific truth values for p, q, and r are given, can be seen as true for all possible truth combinations, but we cannot assure this universality through symbolism alone.

A is also a basic formula, meaning it contains at least one paired conjunctive term.\n\nSince it is a tautology with all paired conjunctive terms, we need to ensure the paired conjunctive terms' indices are included in the notation. For a tautology with 4 variables, the paired conjunctive terms are indexed from 0 to 15 (16 terms in total) in ascending order.\n\nSince A is both a tautology and a basic form, it must contain at least one of these paired conjunctive terms.

Initialize the sets:\n   S0 = {}\n   S1 = {(p∨q), (p∨¬q), (¬p∨r)}\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   a.

Resolve (p∨¬q) with (¬p∨r):\n      - L1: (p∨¬q)\n      - L2: (¬p∨r)\n      - L1∪L2: (p∨¬q) ∨ (¬p∨r) = (p ∨ ¬p) ∨ (q ∨ r) = 0 ∨ (q ∨ r) = q ∨ r\n      - Since (q ∨ r) is not an empty clause, C = q ∨ r\n   c.

Transform your analysis and solution into a structured notation preserving rigor, embedded within the given complex logical format, accounting for time-bound sequences, exceptional conditions, and dependencies among multiple operations.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1.

Dynamic Operators\n   - Necessity Operator: `[ c ]φ` within a time frame T indicates statement φ is inevitably true given the operation c executed by time T.\n   - Possibility Operator: `⟨ c, t⟩φ` within time frame t surmises that at time t, statement φ might be true post operation c.\n   - Future Implication: `$φ_future` represents the future truth of φ based on the sequence of operations.\n\n3. Complex Axioms and Rules\n   - Time Sequence Rule: `[c_1, t_1; c_2, t_2]φ` entails φ is confirmed by the sequence of c_1 at time t_1 followed by c_2 at time t_2.\n   - Conditional Modality Rule: `[c ∧ T]φ` denotes that φ is sometimes necessary if both c is executed and condition T is satisfied (e.g., during a specific time window).\n   - Error Handling Rule: `[error|c]φ` signifies φ is true exclusively if operation c encounters an error.\n   - External Factor Influence Rule: `[c, E]φ` represents φ is true when operation c is influenced by an external factor E.\n   - Dependency with Time Constraint Rule: `[c_i| t_min, c_j, t_max]φ` implies φ depends on the execution of c_i within time t_min and on the concurrent execution of c_j between times t_min and t_max.\n   - Priority-Probability Rule: `[priority(c_1, c_2)| chance_p_1]φ` supposes φ holds true with probability p_1 if operation c_1 has priority over c_2.\n   - Precondition-Projection Rule: `[c| condition_p_prev]φ` asserts φ now definitive if a precondition p_prev is met before c; projecting φ into the future.\n\n### Question:\nIntegrate the rules and construct complex expressions for the following scenario:\n\nA system has two operations, c1 and c2. c1 must operate only after a precondition p_prev is met and within a time window [2, 3]. c2 is to operate concurrently with c1 but can proceed in case c1 fails. The system states an assumption φ will hold true after c1 regardless of c2's occurrence. It also assumes a chance p_1, during the operation of c1, that φ will always hold if an external factor E is present.\n\nPlease generate an expression utilizing the given complex logical rules and structured format.\n\nPlease present your answer as [[]], stripping your expression down to its simplest yet complete representation.\n\n### Answer:\nTo construct the expression, we'll break down the scenario as per the rules given:\n\n1. Precondition for c1 is met: `[c1| p_prev]`\n2. c1 must happen within `[2, 3]` time window: `[c1, 2, 3]φ`\n3. c2 is concurrent with c1 and does not impact the truth of φ upon c1's execution: `[c1 ∧ c2]φ` because `c2 || c1` can be treated as φ being true if c2 is executed concurrently with c1.\n4. Considering a chance p_1 that c1 encountering external factor E will impact φ: `[c1, p_1, E]φ`\n\nCombining these elements into a timed sequence considering all constraints, we get the following expression:\n\n`[p_prev → (c1, 2, 3) ∧ (c1 ∧ c2) * (c1, p_1, E)]φ`\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression while retaining all given conditions, using the structured notation:\n\n[p_prev ∧ [c1, 2, 3]φ * c1 ∧ c2 * [c1, p_1, E]φ]\n\nThis expression represents φ becoming true after c1 meets a precondition and within a specified time frame, considering concurrent executions with c2 and the influence of an external factor E altering the outcome based on a probability.\n\nTranslated into the format provided, the final simplified complex expression is:\n\n[[]]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[]] (Note: While this notation hints at a structured expression, since the format [[]] suggests placeholders for notation, it has been maintained to reflect adherence to the instructional format without concrete symbol specifics.)\n\n\n\n### Instruction:\nAs an intermediate logic processing assistant that has been specialized in handling operational sequences with delicate combinatorial constraints, endeavor to determine the precise logic expression. Readily accept and interpret the development of sub-conditions, delicate time dependencies, variable probability influences, precedential command interest, and potential exceptional occurrences.

Differentiate unambiguously between all declared variables, functions, and modality, infractions, temporal conditions, and outlandish dependencies.\n\n2. Employ thorough reasoning utilizing compounded timed modal assertions, sophisticated modality interactions, precedential considerations with downstream implications, and aberrant exception scenarios.\n\n3.

Thus, the proportion is 100%.\n\n[[100%]]\n\n---\n\nIt's important to note that while U-Generalization allows us to infer something about the entire population based on a sample, it is based on the assumption that the sample is entirely representative of the population. In real-world scenarios, one should consider additional statistical validation and potential selection bias before making such strong generalizations. Also, the symbolization for U-Generalization does not typically reflect the proportion of the population with the attribute, as this would fall under P-Generalization. Here, we are expressing that the attribute (being healthy) holds for all in the population based on our generalization. So, the percentage symbol denotes the conclusion derived strictly from the logical application of the U-Generalization rule without the actual calculation of a proportion per the conventional statistical interpretation.",

According to the Speaker's Criterion in the C* Principle (Criterion 1), there is no weaker statement than what the speaker's knowledge allows (the mother is the baby's mother because she picks up the crying baby). Moreover, there is no need for the speaker to use an unmarked expression since the attributive inference (the mother is the baby's mother) is straightforward and does not derive meaning from lengthy or obscure expressions. The inferred knowledge (K~(A(s)), with A(s) being the statement \"the mother is the baby's mother\") could be established without conflicting with the Information Principle. Therefore, the scenario fits within the framework of the C* Principle.\n\nThe other principles do not apply as follows:\n- C% Principle does not seem relevant because the action described is precisely about the minimum necessary communication about establishing a factual relationship (the mother-baby relationship) and does not involve generalized communication about minimalization.\n- C!
