A decrypted message is a linear sequence of Latin letters like \"ADNTUOR\" would become \"OUGTHNK_UOR\", if the order of the repeating letters was reversed in the message\", he says.  \"The creases produced by replacing a letter with another lower-valued letter in the message are a meaningful step in a ciphertext decryption process,\" he says.\" The second step in the decryption is to use the repeated character in the plaintext to produce a new (encrypted) result, similar to the way that each divider of a favorite childhood favorite package gives a variable bit in its decryption process\".

Just to clarify, the decryption rule you're asking about seems to be missing some details and instances that depend on a weaker rule than the one we're focusing on. In order to help with that, I'll provide a list of the keys we'll be using.\n\nRULE: Encryption\n\n1. In this rule, specify the initial (plaintext) string.\n2. Given a key, generate ciphertext of that string.\n3.(Optionally) parse the output to see what the \\* character stands for.\n            \nCOUNT-SLASH-MACRO:\n    \"ANSWER\": [ '_', 'HTTP?' ]\n\nRULE: Decryption\n\n1. Input the ciphertext as string y.\n2. Convert string y to character array to easily manipulate following steps.\n3. Parse the character array to figure out what to do.\n4. Based on what we know about encrypted symbols, switch to the phrase \"ANSWER\" or \"ANSWER:\".\n4. Alternatively, you can use CASE-INCLUSIVE.\n5. (OPTIONAL)\n    Exclude the sign \\* from the answer variable(y when y is not (E.g., \"WELCOME\" and \"DARKLY:\")).\n\nNote:\nAND: We use 'stackoverflow.com' instead of 'stackoverflow.'\n- `identifier: 5`\n- `amount: 666`\n\nFor example:\nhttps://habr.com/ru/blog/228603/\n\nSo, you'd parse the following text:\n`http://stackoverflow.com/project/browse/topics/computer-issues`\nand it would output a list of negative symbols, such as `/`, `d`, `ic`, etc.\n\n Tips:\n     Using uppercase letters is not recommended if you want exact ASCII values because they roll your long-term and short-term memory.\n     If you need any help please let me know, I can add more pieces of information when needed!\n     Also you could add space between words instead of pipe and in case you need subscriptions purchase them, if you pay as 3 to 5 USD the price might be very different from the one mentioned in the input.

In a substitution cipher, how does the ciphertext change when each letter of the plaintext is replaced by the next letter? How does the cipher act on the numbers, including letters and numbers?\n[Please be as detailed as possible, preferably with a table that shows the steps translated to letter-maps and the information more concrete.]",
