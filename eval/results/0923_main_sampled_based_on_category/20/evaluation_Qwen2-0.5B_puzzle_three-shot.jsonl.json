It's just an example to weed out spelling mistakes.  \n\nRule (2):\n 1.\n\nBasically, you will iterate over the array and for each value in the array, check if it is a pretty string or not, if it is, you return false. Otherwise, you return true. Since pretty strings are created for ASCII, which is 1024 characters, at each iteration, you need to convert the array into an array.\n\nRule (3):\nThe first argument is the main function that will print a new line after the array is printed. So it would look like this:\n\n```sh\nfor $i in {1..$n}{$i} {print ChInLowerCase(\"password\").\"\\n\"};\n```\nNote: The '/' annotation in the '{$i}' is specifying the array index to iterate over. This is identical to the array index `getIterator()` function in python, which prints each item in the array.\n\nRule (4):\n    4.\n\nSimilarly, the second argument is the first line of the new array, and the element at that index in the first line will print.\n\nRule (5):\n    5.\n\nThe third argument is the last line of the new array, and will print the last element of the array in each case.\n\nAnd finally, Rule (6):\n    6.\n\nThe fourth argument is the last item in the new array, which will print it after it.\n\nRule (7):\n7.\n\nFinally, you need to add the comma after the pair.\n\nPlease note that this code excludes country codes that shouldn't be treated as capital letters in Greek alphabet (such as c).",

However, the nature of the walls and decorations imply that extensions must be complete steps in each component. This may involve tangles, corners and side branches. There are three possible avenues for completion: first move c, follow the other arrows, general direction or access only the bottom three to move to the next line using the given first and last move. For this reason, the diagonal path that connects neighbouring squares between the first path and the second path is also possible. X -> =~? ~X,1{↓,9■}->X~.

In truth, the black value can be used to check whether a target cell should expand or not. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will ignore a potential issue if a cell can't expand on its white side. In that case, the first move becomes a possibility. However, the option of breaking the strategy instead does not affect the time-complexity of the solution for the VCs, and therefore it will be considered next.\n\nThe main procedure for solving the forward process is shown below.\n\nOriginal solution matrix to be displayed in terms of classic maze structure",

You're given two types of letters, X and 0. X stands for a grid to fill in the letters on the grid, and 0 stands for a grid that doesn't need to be filled by letters.\n\nYou're trying to fill up the grid with the letters. This means you need to fill in the letters in between X's that aren't filled with X's, and up the letters that are filled with X's. The letters that actually fill the grid you're looking for are those in the X's. On top, the letters in the X are those that are filled empty.\n\nThe puzzle has been opened, and now you're looking at the positions. You see that before each letter, you'll see an X's in the gap between the X's. There are two types of gaps here: sideways and empty.\n\nTo fill up the grid, you need the two gaps between the X's. The first gap is left-aligned, and the second gap is filled with an X. The reason for this difference is that when you look at it horizontally, you'll see the two gaps on the left side of the X, and when you look vertically, you'll see the two gaps on the left side of the X.\n\nTo fill up the grid, you need the two gaps every left-aligned. There will always be two gaps that you need filled in, but when you look at them horizontally, you'll see the two gaps on the left side of the X, and when you look at them vertically, you'll see the two gaps on the left side of the X.\n\nYou know the answer to the puzzle. Here's how you know:\n- Each column or row has one more gap than a previous row or column\n- There is only one skipped row\n- The relationship doesn't seem to be related to horizontal or vertical logic\n\nThe answer is:\n[[0 1 0,0 1 0,0 0 1,1 0,0 1 0,0 L O S E,L O S E,B,K,O\n\nHere's an example of a harder puzzle that probably helps improve your understanding of puzzles.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.The word grid is 4x4, with the letters on the grid being X(X) for filling in rows and letters on the grid being 0 (for separating words).\n4.Two lists of words are given, across and down, across means fill in words from left to right, and down means fill in words from top to bottom.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters.\n\n### Example Question:\n\nacross:CAB CUB SCUBA\ndown:ABS CABS CUBS\n\nDictionary: Keys\nUp:ROWS AVAIL A TYLER CREW ANSWER ELEVATION\nLeft:TITLE PARKWORKS BUFFALO CONSTRUCTION\n\n(answer in previous question)\n\nWord matrix fragments:\n[ S A V E 0,A 0 A 0 A,V 0 S A D,E 0 E 0 S,D 0 0 0 0\n\nAnswer given from left to right, top to bottom.
