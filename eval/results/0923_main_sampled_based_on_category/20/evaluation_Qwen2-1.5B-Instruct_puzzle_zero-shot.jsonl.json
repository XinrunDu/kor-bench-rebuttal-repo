The words in the list are: AIDS, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR, JUVENILE, TICKET, TEENAGER, BRAHMIN, ELEVATE.\n\n2.

Finally, for RUDDER, it's in column 12 and row 9. So, the end point is 12, 9.\n\n6. Concluding with ELEVATOR, it's in column 7 and row 11. So, the end point is 7, 11.\n\n7. Moving to the diagonal directions from left to right, we have the words PAIR, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR.\n\n8. For the word PAIR again, it's in both row 5 and column 4.

After identifying the spot, we can fill it in and make the equation via simple arithmetic operations.\n\nLet's start with setting up the equation using the numbers provided:\n\n1. 0*?+?+?/?=46\nWe note here that one of the factors must be a zero to ensure it fits in. The zero is usually issued ahead - usually 00. This would give us, 0*(not a zero)+?+?/?=46.\n   \n2. 0*1+?+?/?=46\nHere, since one of the factors is a 1 instead of a zero, we have 0*a+1+a/q=46. So, the correct number filling the place is 1.\n\n3. 0*1+1+?/?=46\nIntuitively, adding a 2 to one equation makes sense here, leading to 0+1+2+?/2=46. Dividing by 2 again results in (?+2)/2=46.\n\nTo reach the goal, the next step is to look at a strategy to add further changes if the current approach does not lead to a solution.\n\n## Solution:\nTo simply handle this, we continue to explore the proper order of operations. For all other options, it was more complicated, and perhaps it's not feasible to simplify without a particular change, like changing a zero to a 1, which calls for division by 1?\n\nConsidering sign options, are we missing a twist or mistake? Without it, is it not possible to simplify the addition or perhaps a collision with the initial佩戴 problematic feasibility check? Let's keep hoping for a viable answer, or zero-insignificant cases, and proceed by trying the addition we just identified: Ok, 2 seems to have reduced havoc. Just add a zero before or after 2, resulting in 2?/2=46 or 2/2?=46. And before we make an approval, consider adding zeroes on both sides to see whether this translates to the current standard order of operations. Right now, the subtraction method to add zeroes is simpler. As a workaround, formuledg is here, so combing multiplication with division rules brings us to highlight the conceited and reasonable approach. Along with clear understandings of operations properly, our breakthrough effectively simplifies the vector space equations without actual solving it. Perhaps jokingly hard tasks are challenging to be aggregated into reasonable tasks like finding errors and simplifying.",
