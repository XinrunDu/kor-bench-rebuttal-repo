Convert the resulting binary strings back to their decimal equivalents:\n   - For 00011101, we get: 29.\n   - For 00011101, we get: 29.\n5. Convert these decimal values to their corresponding ASCII characters:\n   - For 29, we get: ' ' (space character).\n   - For 29, we get: ' ' (space character).\n6. Concatenate the resulting ASCII characters to form the final plaintext: \"  \".\n\nThe decrypted answer is: [[  ]].\n\nHowever, since the decrypted answer is two space characters, it might be represented as an empty string in some formatting. If the question expects a non-empty answer, the input ciphertext might be incorrect or potentially incomplete, considering the decrypted answer leading to a non-informative output. Given the specific instruction, the decryption would result in two space (' ') characters, leading to [[  ]] as the output. Please confirm if such an output is acceptable or if further clarification is required. \n\nTo provide an answer based on an expectation of decryption resulting in a meaningful text or string, the input might need to be verified for correctness or further details to ensure the decryption leads to a valid output.\n\nIf treating spaces as meaningful, the final output would be: [[ ]] (where ' ' indicates a space character). For consistency with the provided guidelines, and assuming spaces as a valid character, the final decrypted answer stands as: [[  ]].",
