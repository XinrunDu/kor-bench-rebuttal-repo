Person A and person B both see a black cat. Person A gets into an accident and dies, which is unrelated to his seeing of the black cat. Person B goes on to have a great day by himself as he has no work and relaxes watching comedy shows and his parents go to the super market. That evening, a car accident kills his father while driving home from the market.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\nA.⸮ method   B.؆ method   C.ꙮ method    D.ⵣ method   E.⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Task:\nUsing the A-C-B formula, analyze the following cause-and-effect statements.\n\nStatement 1:\nIt is a pleasure to listen to Beethoven's music. \nFrom this, it can be inferred that Beethoven's music has a beautiful melody.\n\nStatement 2:\nThe immobile well is like a caged beast.\nFrom this, it can be inferred that there is no value in the immobile well. \n\nStatement 3: \nArchitecture is diverse, houses are like living things in the folds on the shore. \nFrom this, it can be inferred that houses are diverse.\n\n__ Answer:\nIn Statement 1, A is \"Beethoven's music\", C is \"a pleasant listening experience\", B is \"a beautiful melody\", with the formula A => C(whatever can be inferred from A that has nothing to do with the relationship between A and B) => B(the unhappy experience about A, a bad feeling about A in the heart of people). \n\nIn Statement 2, A is \"surroundings of a well\", C is \"a place of confinement, a cage\" B is \"no value\", with the formula A => C(whatever can be inferred from A that has nothing to do with the relationship between A and B) => B(the unhappy experience about A, a bad feeling about A in the heart of people). \n\nIn Statement 3, A is \"houses\", C is \"fostering life, fertile\", B is \"diversity\", with the formula A => C(whatever can be inferred from A that has nothing to do with the relationship between A and B) => B(the unhappy experience about A, a bad feeling about A in the heart of people).\n##Correct## sentence and is consistent with the rule that all of the words should be derived from A-C-B. The correct answer is [[A]].\n\n### Comments:\n1. However, in statement 2, although C is a bad feeling about A, it doesn't have the expected negative effect.\n2. Statement 1 indicates that B isn't necessarily the A itself related to the relationship between A and C.",

Most by-products resulting from this sudden change in the living circumstances of the living organism are harmful. Thus, those living organisms that were harmed may join the ranks of natural extinction. As an example, Kleqghmiyunov states, \n\"Observe a bowl of water drinking something that lives by dichotomy—like a Daphnia, for example. They have mates for what?\" Some people would say they're chasing the olfactory scent of their songmates, but Kleqghmiyunov gives an explanation mode that avoids such a romantic notion: \"They don't to mate! The individual is not having fun, and the reason he or she continues to swim towards that fragrant object is because, if he or she keeps swimming forward, the pool will eventually lose its freshness and be replaced by a fresh solution. Therefore, the individual loses the very food that enables it to consume it.\"\nSee, Kleqghmiyunov does not find it meaningful to investigate the purpose of a living organism — or even to debate this question, as a living organism’s hope for survival and expression of its instinct to survive is implicit. Although there is no natural survival solution, Kleqghmiyunov can only thus interpret it as survival instinct.",
