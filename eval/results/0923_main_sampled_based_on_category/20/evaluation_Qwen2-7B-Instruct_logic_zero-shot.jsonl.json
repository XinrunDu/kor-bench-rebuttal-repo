In the context of the principal disjunctive normal form, a tautology means that the formula includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms (since every possible assignment of truth values leads to a true outcome in the formula).\n\n2. **Basic Formula**: A basic formula includes the m0 term, which represents the case where all input variables are true (for conjunctive terms) or very specific condition for disjunctive terms. For \\(n\\) propositional variables, m0 corresponds to the assignment of truth values that gives \\(2^n = 16\\) for 4 variables, since \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- Formula A being a tautology means it includes all 2^4 = 16 paired conjunctive terms, which aligns with the definition of being a tautology.\n- A basic formula includes the m0 term, meaning it is true for the assignment of truth values \\(p = q = r = s = \\text{true}\\) for 4 propositional variables.\n\nThus, if a formula A with 4 propositional variables is both a tautology and a basic form, it must include each of the 16 m0 terms (corresponding to all possible combinations of truth values that satisfy the specific conditions of the tautology and basic formula definitions).\n\nGiven the format requested is [[]], this is essentially describing a set or collection of m0 terms (since each term m0 corresponds to a specific set of truth assignments across all 4 variables). However, since m0 is specific to one particular truth assignment (all variables true), and based on the given instructions, the answer would practically describe the nature of such a formula rather than listing terms individually:\n\n**Answer:**\nSince the question requires an answer in the form [[]] and seeks a logical implication rather than a literal list of identifiers ([m0]), the response should clarify the nature of the formula in the described format, albeit unconventional.\n\nThe nature described is \"a formula that includes all possible true assignments across 4 variables\" which is logically aligned with the definitions given for tautologies and basic forms, thus applying uniquely to m0's presence given the constraints. To be explicit in terms of satisfying the interpreted criteria and the instruction format, while recognizing the nature of direct listing may vary, the intended response lies in the principle rather than a literal set:\n\n**Answer Formatted:**\nGiven the unique application of terms and the unavailability of a strict, direct listing within the constraints of [m0] format without further clarification, directly responding in the requested [item] format for \"all possible true assignments\" across 4 variables would be seen as \"potentially [Listing All 16 m0 Terms] or under the constraint of format, through explanation that it represents a comprehensive truth assignment set\". This response directly aligns with acknowledging the requirement for a set akin to listed terms (representing truth assignments) yet through the interpretative flexibility inherent in logical propositional terms definitions, adheres closest to the spirit of the given answer prompt while acknowledging the impossibility of raw, direct listing within the strict confines of the interpretation's called-for format.",

Resolving r (from C1) and ¬r (from C2):\n   - C = r ∨ ¬r ∨ others in C2 → C = 0 as we have an OR with ¬r and r, which results in 0 according to resolution rule.\n\n4. Resolving r (from C1) and others (in this case, s, ¬t from C2):\n   - C = r ∨ s, r and ¬t from C1 vs. s, ¬r, ¬t from C2. r can be resolved with ¬r giving 0 (rule definition), and s is identical in both clauses, ¬t can potentially be removed from C2 because it is negated in C1 but since we end up with 0 after resolving r with ¬r, the presence of ¬t doesn't matter in the final outcome.\n   - So, the result of resolving with s and another literal from clause 2 is treated as 0 due to the inherent property of resolution that resolving complementary literals start and end with a null clause (0).\n\nAfter understanding and applying resolution step by step, we can conclude:\n- The only directly resolvable pair yielding a non-zero outcome involved s from C2 and ¬q from C1, resulting in s ∨ ¬t.\n- Resolving r from C1 with ¬r resulting in 0 invalidates any further resolution involving r or ¬r from C1 with literals in C2.\n- Any other attempted resolution leads to identities or reductions back to 0, due to complementarity or lack of compatible literals for resolving.\n\nSo, the dispel(C1, C2) is: [[s, s]]\nFollow this format for the output.",
