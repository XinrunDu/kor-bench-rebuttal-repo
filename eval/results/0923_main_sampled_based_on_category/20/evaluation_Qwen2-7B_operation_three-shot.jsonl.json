Since \\(2^{3}=8\\), this gives us $\\log_{2}{8}=3$. Next, for $\\log_{8}{2}$, we find the number we raise 8 to in order to get 2. Because $8^{\\frac{1}{3}}=2$, this gives us $\\log_{8}{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$. \n\nAdding these together, we get $3+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{10}{3}$.\n\nFor Example 2:\n\n\\[ 4￠9=\\log_{9}{4}+\\log_{4}{9} \\]\n\nTo find $\\log_{9}{4}$, we need to find the number we raise 9 to in order to get 4. However, 9 to the power of 2 equals 81, not 4. Since such a number does not exist, $\\log_{9}{4}$ is undefined, and so we leave it as $\\log_{9}{4}$.\n\nThe answer for Example 1 is:\n\n\\[ 8￠2 = \\frac{10}{3} \\]\n\nFor Examples 3 and 4, we need to solve for X in each case. For the first example, we have\n\n\\[ X￠4=\\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting our definition of '￠' into this equation gives:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\log_{X}{4} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nWe can't solve this equation directly with these values, but we can observe that $\\log_{X}{4}=\\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}}$. Therefore we have:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSuppose \\(\\log_{4}{X} = a\\). Then our equation becomes:\n\n\\[ a + \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(a\\) gives us a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ a^2 - \\frac{5}{2}a + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 4}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{2}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{3}{2}}{2} \\]\n\nAnnoyingly, both values for \\(a\\) are negative, which doesn't really fit with our expected logarithmic results (if \\(X￠4=\\frac{5}{2}\\), then \\(a\\) *should* be positive) so we made a mistake somewhere along the way. Reviewing our process, we find that the problem is in the change of variable to \\(a\\): $\\log_{4}{X}$ can't just be equal to \\(a\\) - \\(a\\) needs to be positive, so the correct expression for \\(a\\) needs to be:\n\n\\[ a=\\log_{4}{X} \\]\n\nTherefore, after substitution our equation is:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a=\\log_{4}{X}\\) back into this gives us a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ 2a^2 - 5a + 2=0\\]\n\nAnd solving this with the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[ a=\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}\\]\n\nTakes a little while to do in your head, but eventually you can see \\(a=n\\) and \\(b=4-n\\), \\(a\\) is always less than or equal to \\(b\\) so we take \\(a=4-n\\). Then:\n\n\\[ X = 4^n = 4^{\\log_{4}{X}} \\]\n\\[ X = X \\]\n\nIn other words, your maths went wrong when you said that \\(\\log_{9}{4}=\\frac{1}{n}\\) but it should be \\(\\log_{4}{9}=\\frac{1}{n}\\) for some \\(n\\). We'll find the actual \\(n\\) later. Otherwise you aren't going to be able to solve this equation for any value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolve \\(2a^2 - 5a + 2= 0\\):\n\n\\[ a=\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}= \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\\]\n\nWhich gives us two possible values for \\(a\\), 2 or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's first check \\(a=2\\):\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X}=2 \\to X=4^2=16 \\]\n\nAnd then:\n\n\\[ \\log_{16}{4}= \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSo this value works, so our first value for \\(X\\) is 16.\n\nNow let's check \\(a=\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X}=\\frac{1}{2} \\to X=4^{\\frac{1}{2}}=2 \\]\n\nAnd then:\n\n\\[ \\log_{2}{4}=2 \\]\n\nSo this value also works, and our second value for \\(X\\) is 2.\n\nFor Example 4, we guess and check to find a solution. One way to solve the quadratic is to use the method of 'completing the square':\n\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + 2 = 0 \\]\n\nTake the 'b' term and divide by two, giving us \\(-2.5\\) - under the radical square this to get \\(-6.25\\). Add this to both sides of the equation to get the left hand side to factorise:\n\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ 2(a² - \\frac{5}{2}a) + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\\[ 2(a² - \\frac{5}{2}a + \\frac{25}{16}) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{25}{8} \\]\n\\[ 2(a - \\frac{5}{4})² = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{25}{8} = 6 \\]\n\\[ a - \\frac{5}{4} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\approx \\frac{5}{4} + 1.6 =2.3 \\]\n\\[ \\log_{X}{9} = a \\approx \\log_{X}{\\frac{10}{3}} \\]\n\nSo X=10/3.\n\nBut we need to verify that this value works in the equation. The minimum value for a and b in \\log_{a}{b} is 2, as when make a and b the same value, their result is 1. Here we have made one value twice as large as the other, suggesting that our logarithm is smaller than 1. Therefore, it is safe to say that the answer is 10/3, or approximately 3.3.",
