Let:\n   - n = Number of students in the sample.\n   - P = Sample proportion.\n\n2. According to Rule 1, if all individuals in the sample (denoted as `n`) are males, then the entire population (denoted as `m`) must have at least as many males (Johnston Numbering) to ensure that 50% of the class gets an A \\( p = 0.5 \\).\n\nThus, we have:\nIf `n > 10` are males and those are the only male students in the sample, and all female students are also included as males (a total of \\( +2n \\) males not counted out of the total 10 students), we must have at least \\( 10 \\) males in the entire population (Johnston Numbering).\n\nTherefore, the estimated proportion of the whole class that would get an A is \\( \\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{10}{0.5} \\).\n\nNow, applying the U-Generalization Rule (Rule 1) to estimate the proportion of the whole class that would get an A within a sample of 50 students.\n\nIf \\( 2(n) > 50 \\) (i.e., if the whole class size is greater than 75 students in a sample of 50).\n\n\\[ \\frac{n}{m} \\approx \\frac{10}{0.5} \\approx 20 \\]\n\nSo, the estimated proportion of the whole class that would get an A is \\( \\boxed{20} \\).",
