Convert \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" to a universal affirmative by addressing \"no true revolutionaries are false,\" and to adapt it to a universal negative proposition by changing \"all\" to \"None.\" Thus, the statement becomes:\n   - None are not upright and open. This can be converted to \"None are not upright, therefore None are open,\" which is not directly the inverse needed but can be mutated to inverse:\n     - No upright and open.\n\n2. To reach the desired conclusion \"All people who are not upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" we must directly target the contraposition along our given propositions. This requites applying obversion to \"None are not upright and open\" which would transform to \"Some are upright and open\" and thus convert the sought conclusion:\n   - Some are not upright and open.\n\n3. Meeting the stated goal with this development indicates we should select Method C's approach, which utilizes obversion and conversion operations to transform the premise. This pattern effectively converts parts of the verbose \"None are not upright and open,\" which is likened by all true revolutionaries, into the cancellation of non-meanings (\"some within\"), quantifying thus the desired \"some not upright and open\" for inversion, to shift the solution initially to seek by negating our contrapositive inverted strategy aligned with Method C's mechanics, which answers:\n\n[Method C]",

From the sample, we know that all 10 students who were selected got an A.\n2. According to the U-Generalization Rule, if all individuals in the sample possess a certain attribute, we can infer that all individuals in the population may also possess that attribute.\n3. Therefore, the proportion of students who got an A in the class with 10 students is 100%. Since U-Generalization applies only to exactly 10 students getting A, we infer that in the whole class of 50 students, approximately 100% would get an A.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[100%]]",
