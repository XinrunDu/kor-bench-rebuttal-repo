Candidates are expected to demonstrate a deep understanding of Salesforce Platform events, canonical limits, and triggers, alongside their ability to apply these concepts to resolve non-standard conditions. The solution is required to be flexible enough to handle variations of inputs and produce outputs aligned with the outlined verification criteria.\n\n### Story:\n\nA proposal for development is received from the requester. The baseline charter for the request contains two table fields: Lead Entity Table ([TableA]) and Related Entity Table ([TableB]), where a key record from Lead Entity Table may have associated records in Related Entity Table ([TableB]). The task is to add a [step1] link record in Related Entity Table ([TableB]), to select between different options in the hooks. Subsequently, a [step2] link record in Related Entity Table must be created or existing records updated, specifying the updated field values.\n\n### Rules:\n\n1. The step1 link exists first in [TableA], the primary key of which is a non-unique value (field [fieldA])\n2. It is not possible to create a step2 link record when the [fieldB] from [TableB] already exists in the list of data in [TableA].\n3. It is not possible to update the [fieldB] in the [TableA] where it is already defined (i.e., non-null), to save the [fieldB] exists field of the record and preserve the original value.\n4. The data is specified in the request as an input variable [TableC], which may or may not contain [fieldB].\n\n### Requirements:\n\n1. Write a script that creates an appropriate generic trigger in [TriggerB] to handle the expectation given in rule 1.\n2. Write a script that creates a generic trigger in [TriggerC] to handle rule 2.\n3. Create valid entities for [TableA] and [TableB] in required dependencies in [Object_A] and [Object_B] without using any custom field but a static member field that matches the value of the [staffId] field of the Salesforce user executing the script.\n4. Validate that [step1] has executed correctly for the charts (no error firing) without writing any trigger to [TriggerB].\n5. Write a generic trigger in [TriggerC] that executes after the first step without using \"database.allowBatchExec()\" but includes the restriction that it performs an invalid operation if it is already executed.\n6. Use a sequence generator as a solution for [TriggerB] instead of a duplicate_set_member.\n\n# Convert TriggerB to TriggerC and award status [[A]] or [[B]]\nA. [[A]], triggerC\nB. [[B]], triggerC\n[[A]]:\n\n```\ntrigger triggerB on .Opportunity (.LinkRecord) {\n    // logic here\n}\n```\n\n[[B]]:\n\n```\ntrigger triggerB on .Opportunity (.LinkRecord) {\n    // logic here\n}\n```\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the Two Rules Violates Best Practices for Salesforce Platform Events? RAW3 = They are non stop. Received_ Draft = They are non stop. Scenario_2134 = They are non stop. Same issue as #1 and #2. NULL received = Will run without errors\nProspective Sourcing Plan ID = They are separate fromenario where item value will be [link to #24144]. Hard to replicate this supposed violation between step 1 and #2. 1 = They are non stop.\n[[A]] follows Heuristic Rule 0045c, as there are no list or repeated item value rows in role (step1). For #1 in entry #2134, it is expected that [step1] diverse entities and join records (step2). Well, it is known in Agile that one could have different levels of tasks with repeated tasks, but for a simple show proceed to the arrange phase and continued to phase sequential batches until completion, the whole process executes 1 batch on the future design of the app. For #3 not to concentration extranaceen the before logic, there should not be other row logic with exception check for joint step_ 1 and 2 result at this time. While this is small, it is inconsistent with each event running in general. So, if SOQL DML makes sense, it can allow additional elts ined when executes, such as IDs/SAs, next queue, and other ingredient (or pertinent relationship to follow up with). Its arrows take back pointers, most easily achieved with SOQL from atg admin exposed via Base API while external like OAuth tokens will null the success/aborts, which makes avoid plus some ES sixuish.
