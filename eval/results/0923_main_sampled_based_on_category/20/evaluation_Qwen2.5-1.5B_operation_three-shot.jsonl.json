Given that 2○3=25 and 4○5=100, solve for x and y.\n\n#### Answers: Derived from the equation 2○3=4(z+3)×(z+3)=25, solving for z gives z=2 and 4○5=100 gives 4(2+3)×(2+3)=100.\n\nThus: [[x=2,y=4]]\nQ: What is the value of unknown variable X in the following nutritional chart?  ○Crops and Onions | Weight per Ounce | 330 cal | 330 cal\nA: [[value of unknown variable x]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nUsing the same rules as before, what is the value of unknown variable x?
