Xiaomeng, utilizing his Taoist art of manipulation with water, condensed water into the character \"Dao\" and transformed it into small water droplets, creating a variety of beautiful and ever-changing scenes in the air.\n\nThus, the method that can create constantly changing beautiful patterns in the air above a pond as described must be associated with a powerful internal force of a Taoist practitioner.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[A]].",

The story clearly mentions the summer of 2044, where the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. Further, it is stated that the Olympics were officially held at the end of 2044 following the ignition of the first engine on the Moon. Since the story also indicates that another Olympics followed soon after \"The Wandering Earth\" plan began, prior to the Earth leaving its orbit and entering the asteroid belt, it strongly implies that the 2044 Olympics were a significant event amidst the plan's commencement and might be the last Olympics considered according to the context of the story.\n\nTherefore, [[D]].",
