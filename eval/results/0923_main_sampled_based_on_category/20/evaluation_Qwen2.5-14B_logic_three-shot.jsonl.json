The complements of the literals in \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are:\n- Complement of \\( \\neg p \\) is \\( p \\), but this does not appear in \\( C_2 \\).\n- Complement of \\( \\neg q \\) is \\( q \\), which appears in \\( C_2 \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\) are complements, they can be resolved. Therefore, the answer is:\n**[[A]]**\n\n### Question 2:\nGiven \\( C_1 = p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r \\) and \\( C_2 = \\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r \\), what is \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) \\)?\n\nWe look for any pair of complementary literals between \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\):\n- \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\)\n- \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\)\n- \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\)\n\nSince \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\) are complements, we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nIf we resolve on \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\\[ = (\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nSimilarly, if we resolve on \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee r \\vee \\neg p \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nAnd if we resolve on \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg p \\vee q) \\]\n\nSo the possible resolutions are:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r];[p \\vee r \\vee \\neg p \\vee \\neg r];[p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg p \\vee q]} \\]\n\n### Question 3:\nFor \\( :p \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge q \\), what is the output of the resolution algorithm, and how many cycles will it iterate?\n\nThis expression is in conjunctive normal form. We start by identifying the simple disjunctive clauses:\n- \\( C_1 = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\)\n- \\( C_2 = q \\)\n- \\( C_3 = p \\)\n\nWe initialize \\( S_1 \\) with these clauses and try to resolve them:\n- Resolving \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q, q) = \\neg p \\vee \\neg r \\vee q \\vee \\neg q = \\neg p \\vee \\neg r \\)\n- Resolving \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_3 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_3) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q, p) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee p) = \\neg q \\)\n- Resolving \\( C_2 \\) and \\( C_3 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_2, C_3) = \\text{dispel}(q, p) = q \\vee p \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg q \\vee q = 1 \\), this indicates that the formula is unsatisfiable, so the output is \"Implausible\".\n\nIt takes one cycle to see that the clauses can be resolved to an empty set, indicating no solution. Thus, the number of cycles is 1.\n\n### Question 4:\nIf \\( C_1 = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r \\) and \\( C_2 = \\neg q \\vee \\neg r \\vee s \\vee \\neg t \\), what is \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) \\)?\n\nWe need to find complementary literals between \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\):\n- \\( \\neg p \\) has no complement in \\( C_2 \\).\n- \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( \\neg q \\) are the same, not different.\n- \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\) are complements.\n\nResolving on \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t \\]\n\nSo the final result is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t]} \\]",

For this specific request (\"allocate\"), we need to consider the cases as described:\n\n- **C1**: There is no allocated resource for a person, and it is within the allowed date range.\n- **C2**: There is an existing drift in the resource assignment.\n- **Cn**: There is an attempt to add an assigned resource to a person.\n\nGiven the constraints, we need to apply automated fulfillment methods to ensure the system operates within the capacity limits and power constraints while maintaining optimal operation. \n\n- **Automated Fulfillment**: We would automatically allocate the resource if the case falls under C1 or allocate in a feasible way if it falls under C2.\n- **Manual Defense Review**: For Cn, we might need to manually review to ensure the operation doesn't compromise the system's stability or violate any power constraints.\n\nRegarding the FOL encoding for ∀X(X ∈ A), we symbolically represent it as:\n\n∀X(X ∈ A) means \"for all X, X is in A.\"\n\nIn First-Order Logic (FOL), this represents that every member X is a member of the set A. \n\nTo convert it into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), we would first apply a standard transformation if needed (but ∀X(X ∈ A) is already in a basic form suggesting all X's are in A, which is a true statement assuming set A and universe over X). So, CNF representation doesn't give much more information than the original statement.\n\nA Semantic Web model for ∀X(X ∈ A) might use RDF (Resource Description Framework), such as:\n```\n<http://example.org/forallXinA#X> rdf:type <http://example.org/forallXinA#A> .\n```\nA SPARQL query that might impose a condition similar to this could look like:\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT * WHERE { ?X rdf:type <http://example.org/forallXinA#A> }\n```\nRegarding the Qlik Sense code to handle the scenario where people are assigned responsibilities over a date range and new assignments affect existing ones, we could use a script to manage this dynamically. Below is an example in Python, which is often used with APIs to interact with Qlik Sense:\n\n```python\n# Define a class to manage resources\nclass ResourceManagement:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.resources = {}  # {person: [assignments]}\n\n    def add_assignment(self, person, start_date, end_date, resource_id):\n        if person not in self.resources:\n            self.resources[person] = []\n        # Check for overlap with existing assignments\n        for assignment in self.resources[person]:\n            if (start_date < assignment['end_date'] and end_date > assignment['start_date']):\n                raise Exception(\"Overlap detected!\")\n\n        # Add new assignment\n        self.resources[person].append({\n            'start_date': start_date,\n            'end_date': end_date,\n            'resource_id': resource_id\n        })\n\n# Example usage\nrm = ResourceManagement()\ntry:\n    # Adding assignments\n    rm.add_assignment('Alice', '2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', 'resource1')\n    rm.add_assignment('Alice', '2023-03-01', '2023-04-01', 'resource2')  # Error due to overlap\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\n\n# Note: This is a simplified Python example and you would use Qlik Sense Engine API for integration.\n```\n\nThis script abstracts the process of adding assignments to avoid overlaps and can be tailored to the specific application requirements. For Qlik Sense integration, you would need to interact with APIs to manage data streams and apply this logic within the Qlik Sense environment.",

According to this rule, as the sample size $n$ increases to a large factor (approaching an infinite number of samples), the distribution of the sum of $n$ independent random observations of the same distribution will tend towards a limiting distribution that is stable. Specifically, the distribution will tend towards a normal distribution with a probability density function (PDF) given by:\n$$\\phi( \\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\xi ^2\\right)$$\nwhere $\\xi=\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\sqrt{n}}$ with $E(X_i) = 0$.\n\nGiven this scenario, how would the Central Limit Theorem be symbolized to calculate the expected value of $\\xi$ under the given a sample size of 100, and assuming each $X_i$ has an expectation of zero?\n\nAnswer in [[formula]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E(\\xi) = 0]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) helps to show how the distribution of the sum of a large sample size $n$ of independent random observations of the same distribution tends towards a normal distribution. The expected value $\\xi$ is calculated as the sum of all observations divided by the square root of the sample size $n$. Given the provided parameters and the linearity of expectation, we can conclude that the expected value $E(\\xi)=0$ regardless of the sample size. This application of CLT doesn't depend on the actual values of the observations but on their behavior under independence and after normalization. The expected value of the sum is equal to 0 because the expected value of each individual observation is 0. Therefore, summing 0 $n$ times results in 0, and dividing by $\\sqrt{n}$ does not change this fact.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following formal rule in a programming language:\n\n$$\\Delta(++i) \\equiv \\Delta(i)+1.$$\n\nThen analyze the simplification of the following expression:\n\n$$[++i, ---+i, ++++i].$$\n\nSimplify by applying the above formal rule and expressing the final simplified array in the format: [[array]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[[i+2, i , i+3]]]\n\n### Question:\nConsider a data structure consisting of an 8-bit signed integer and a 16-bit unsigned integer encoded together.
