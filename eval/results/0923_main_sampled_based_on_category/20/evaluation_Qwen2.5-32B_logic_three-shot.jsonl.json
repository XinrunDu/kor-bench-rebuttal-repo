However, in the context of a ZX-plane, the Y-axis is not considered directly. Instead, we focus on the coordinates and slopes along the planes formed by the X and Z axes.\n\n- **z-coordinates**: These are the coordinates along the Z-axis that intersect with the ZX-plane. They represent the position of points along the vertical or depth dimension in 3D space.\n  \n- **slope of the z-axis**: This refers to the rate at which the z-coordinate changes as you move along the z-axis. In a standard Cartesian coordinate system, the z-axis is typically considered to have a slope of 1 (if you're moving in a direction where the z-coordinates increase linearly).\n\nThus, the relevant coordinates and slopes in the context of a ZX-plane would be the z-coordinates and the slope of the z-axis.",

Therefore, `[[c](φ↔ψ)]` is equivalent to `[[c]((φ→ψ) ∧ (ψ→φ))]`.\n\nUsing the Sequence Rule (3.Axioms and Rules):\n`[[c]((φ→ψ) ∧ (ψ→φ))]` is equivalent to `[[c](φ→ψ) ∧ [c](ψ→φ)]`.\n\nGiven that `[[c](φ→ψ)]` is valid and `[[c](ψ→φ)]` is valid, it follows that `[[c](φ→ψ) ∧ [c](ψ→φ)]` is valid.\n\nTherefore, `[[c](φ↔ψ)]` is valid.\n\nThus, the Result Rule is derived:\n`[[c](φ↔ψ)]` is valid if `[[c](φ→ψ)]` is valid and `[[c](ψ→φ)]` is valid.\n\n[[[c](φ↔ψ)]]",
