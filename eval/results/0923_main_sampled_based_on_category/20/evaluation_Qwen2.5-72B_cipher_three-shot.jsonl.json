To answer the decryption question, first, I need to interpret the rule on whether period: 1 causes the inner disk to rotate, even though the increment is 0. Given that it's a rotation, without a specified increment, there is no movement to make, so I presume the inner disk doesn't rotate. However, I must point out that no outer-disk-outer-letter matches such that the inner-disk's result is 'V'. If this is an error in the outer_disk and inner_disk setup (e.g., \"R\" should correspond to a different letter in the encoding process), please clarify.\n\nGiven the above interpretation:\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\nperiod: 1\nincrement: 0\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n__Metropolis Network and deberá tener como mínimo 20 km y como máximo 200 km__.\nWe'll need to draw a cycle on the map, starting in the bottom left corner just below 54º, and ending a bit above 44º and just above 140º.\nThose two islands are 25 units apart, so I think we need to pick a divisor, which will be our adjacency tolerance. How about 20 for us, as humans, as robots will probably prefer 32. We need adjacency to have the correct modulus.\nNext, let's get our latitudes and longitudes from all the cities. Occam's razor suggests we already encode everything into a base for our modulus, but let's use degrees first. We'll need two arrays, latitudes and longitudes.\nWe can define a function `is_adjacent` which will use our modulus to check if two cities are close enough. Let's print our matrix of adjacencies in capital ASCII letters, for clarity, using a nested for loop.\nWe can define a function `get_path` to calculate the distance between an origin city and a destination one through a path, and another function `get_group` to get all of the possible routes between the members of a list, and output this as a list of tuples.\nThis might be too readable in JavaScript, but I want to be careful to respect the limitations. For example, storing these paths is quite costly and I don't really even care about that, since I can compute the path between 2 cities ad hoc.\nOur primary objective is to compute the paths between all cities and calculate the most fit one, in terms of average distances, so we will, simply put, apply a basic ML algorithm, clunkily bruteforcing all the solutions and keeping the least messy one.\nMaybe this is just me, but I like the idea of this bruteforce attack very much. Our first mistake will be to search the entire atlas, but we only need to traverse that subportion of the sphere that contains the whole Metropolis Network and, furthermore, there still are errors beyond modulo correction that could be addressed.\nNow, our goal is still unclear, but I'll go for maximum mean, as the lowest average distance might lead to unbalanced routes.\nThis primigenial version is a bit clunky and it is definitely bruteforcing, but you will probably see how it is not calculating all of the pairs at all times, which is ultimately a waste of CPU resources, when those same pairs could be calculated only once at the time, or maybe you'd be better of just making them available.\nI have got a lot of useless stuff here.\nFor the equal edges, I had thought that a possible solution would be to brute them, too, by trying all the combinations for those edges and evaluating them in terms of how much balanced the subgraphs would get once the edges had been settled upon.\nI'm not aware of other solutions for equal weighted edges when doing turning points. Here, sticking to ML we simply repeat the loop until the edges are assigned.\nThe answer is [[T*D*O*AY*C#*]].\n\nThanks.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"DTWYAMNJ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - Transposed sequence list: [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n  - This list is used to write the plaintext in order one line at a time, and then the columns are adjusted according to the transposed sequence list so that the characters in each line are arranged in the given order.\n  - Columns are counted starting from 0.\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - The transposed sequence list [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n  - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are fewer than 7 letters left, the last line is filled with $ to complete the grid.\n  - Adjust the order of the columns according to the transposed sequence list, that is, the new column order is [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3].\n  - Read the adjusted grid row by row and connect the characters to form the final ciphertext (note that the $ should be retained).\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - Transposed sequence list (same as for encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n  - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n  - Read the characters line by line, but read the columns in the order specified by the transposed sequence list: first a character from column 2 (corresponding to 0), then a character from column 0 (corresponding to 1), then a character from column 6 (corresponding to 2), and so on.\n  - Eventually, read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end of any incomplete line to get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"XNARZKEM\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
