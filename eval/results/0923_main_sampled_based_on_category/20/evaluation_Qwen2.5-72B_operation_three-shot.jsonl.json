[[3∞10]] = 3² + 10² = 9 + 100 = 109\n2. [[10∞3]] = 10² + 3² = 100 + 9 = 109\n\nThen we subtract the two results: 109 - 109 = 0\n\nThe answer is [[0]].\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the maximum possible value of a∞b if both a and b are prime integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The maximum value for a∞b is when both a and b are at their maximum value, which is 7.\n\nSo, [[7∞7]] = 7² + 7² = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nThe answer is [[98]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the minimum possible value of ab(border) if both a and b are positive integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is an error in the formulation of the question. The term \"ab(border)\" doesn't align with the defined custom operation in the rule, which is \"a∞b = a² + b².\" Could you please clarify or correct the operation you meant to ask about? If you're referring to the minimum product of a and b given the operation rule, the smallest product occurs with the smallest integers, which are 1 and 1.\n\nSo, if the operation is based upon multiplication, the question should be formulated as seeking the minimum product ab, not \"ab(border).\" With the provided information, a=1 and b=1 would yield the smallest result.\n\nHowever, with the specified operation rule (a∞b = a² + b²), and asking for the minimum sum of squares using positive integers less than 10, the smallest result would be when both a and b are 1, because they are the smallest positive integers.\n\nSo, [[1∞1]] = 1² + 1² = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe minimum possible value of the operation with the given parameters is [[2]]. \n\nAssuming that the question was intended to ask for the minimum value of the operation, rather than a product or undefined term.\n\nRemove the reference to multiplication. What is the minimum possible value of a∞b if a and b are positive integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the defined operation a∞b = a² + b² and the condition that a and b are positive integers less than 10, the minimum possible value of a∞b is when both a and b are their smallest, which is 1. Therefore:\n\n[[1∞1]] = 1² + 1² = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe minimum possible value of a∞b is [[2]].\n\n### Question\nWhat is the minimum possible value of a∞b if both a and b are prime integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe prime integers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The minimum value for a∞b using prime numbers would occur when both a and b are the smallest prime numbers, which are 2 and 2.\n\nSo, [[2∞2]] = 2² + 2² = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThe minimum possible value of a∞b with prime integers less than 10 is [[8]].\n\n### Question\nThe expression ((j-a)(border) + b)∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is a misunderstanding in the formulation of the question as it doesn't directly align with the operation rule a∞b = a^2 + b^2. The question appears malformed, including an undefined notion of \"(j-a)(border) + b\". Please clarify or provide the correct expression.\n\n### Question\nThe expression ((j-a) + b)∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding or typo in the question. If we were to simplify the expression in the context of the defined operation rule, we should first clarify the symbol that is meant to be \"∞\" and the sequence of operations.\n\nHowever, the statement \"(j - a) + b\"∞a simplifies to b∞a does not directly follow from the given operation rule. The \"∞\" symbol isn't part of standard algebraic operators and the goal of simplification isn't clearly defined here since the operation is custom and doesn't directly indicate a simplification process.\n\nFor the expression ((j - a) + b)∞a to relate to b∞a, it would need to follow the operation rule as defined:\n\nFirst, we would need to compute ((j - a) + b)² + a², but this does not simplify directly to b² + a² without knowing the value of j or how it relates to b or a. The operations are defined as squaring both terms individually and then adding them, not simplifying the expression inside parentheses first as in traditional algebra.\n\nGiven the mismatch between what is asked and the operation rule, or if there's an expectation of direct simplification that's not in line with the defined operation, please clarify or reframe the question. As presented, there is no direct simplification path from ((j - a) + b)∞a to b∞a under the given operation rule.\n\n### Question\nThe expression ( (j-a) + b )∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nWhat letter represents the wildcard in the expression?\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is a misunderstanding or typo in the framing of the question. The expression and simplification you've shared do not directly correlate with the custom operation rule provided earlier for a∞b = a^2 + b^2. If the goal is to find which letter acts as a \"wildcard\" given a specific simplification, we need to align the provided information with the operation rule clearly.\n\nFor the operation rule a∞b = a^2 + b^2, the expression ((j - a) + b)∞a does not logically simplify to b∞a under standard algebraic rules or the custom operation itself. The simplification suggested indicates a transformation that would align with standard addition and substitution principles but does not utilize the custom operation in a clear or defined way.\n\nGiven that \"∞\" is not a standard operator and the goal is to divine a \"wildcard\" from the simplification, and considering the provided operation rule, it's challenging to determine which letter acts as a wildcard directly from the information provided. The claim of simplification seems to request a logical leap that doesn't match typical operations or the custom rule mentioned.\n\nCool, lets just assume this is a wildcard question and locate the wildcard.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nAssuming a wildcard scenario where the question is seeking a logical deduction about variable purpose based on the information's structure rather than mathematical operation rules, and focusing on the assertion that ((j - a) + b) should simplify logically to b, this might imply that 'j' is intended to simplify out in some logical sense.\n\nIf we consider the operation intention rather than its mathematical soundness:\n\n- If `((j - a) + b)` simplifies logically to `b`, it suggests a scenario where `j - a` simplifies to `0` because `0 + b = b`.\n- This simpl",

Therefore, \\(7 & 4 = 7\\).\n   - Operation \\(5 $ 8\\): This uses the $ operation which selects the smaller number. Therefore, \\(5 $ 8 = 5\\).\n   - Adding these results: \\(7 + 5 = 12\\).\n\n   So, the answer is [[12]].\n\n2. **Question: Compute (12$7)×(4&9).**\n\n   - Operation \\(12 $ 7\\): Selects the smaller number. Therefore, \\(12 $ 7 = 7\\).\n   - Operation \\(4 & 9\\): Selects the larger number. Therefore, \\(4 & 9 = 9\\).\n   - Multiplying these results: \\(7 × 9 = 63\\).\n\n   So, the answer is [[63]].\n\n3. **Question: If x&9=10, find X.**\n\n   - Operation \\(X & 9 = 10\\): For this to hold true, \\(X\\) must be at least 10 because the § operation selects the larger number and 10 is greater than 9.\n\n   So, the answer is [[X ≥ 10]].\n\n4. **Question: If (6 $ X) + (9 § 2) = 15, find X.**\n\n   - Operation \\(9 § 2\\): Selects the larger number. Therefore, \\(9 § 2 = 9\\).\n   - Given equation: \\((6 $ X) + 9 = 15\\).\n     - Simplifying: \\(6 $ X = 15 - 9\\), thus \\(6 $ X = 6\\).\n     - For \\(6 $ X\\) to equal 6, \\(X\\) must be at least 6 because the $ operation selects the smaller number and 6 is the smallest number that satisfies this condition.\n\n   So, the answer is [[X ≥ 6]].",

We need to solve the equation 4¥X = 4^X - X^4 = 3.\nIterating for positive integers X:\n   - If X=1, 4^X - X^4 = 4 - 1 = 3.\nSo, one possible solution is [[1]].\nAnother possible value can be found through iteration and checking. \n\n2.

The solution for 5¥X = 5^X - X^5 = 6 is [[1]].\n3. The solution for 3¥X = 3^X - X^3 = 0 is [[1]].\n4. A positive integer solution for 6¥X = 6^X - X^6 = -7 cannot be found which strictly abide by the rule given.\n5.

Set a=4 and b=X. By the rule a¥b=a^b-b^a, we get:\n   4^X - X^4 = 3. \n   Through iterative checking for positive integers X, we find that X=1 is a solution.\n\n2. Set a=5 and b=X. By the rule a¥b=a^b-b^a, we get:\n   5^X - X^5 = 6. \n   Through iterative checking for positive integers X, no solution is found.\n\n3. Set a=3 and b=X. By the rule a¥b=a^b-b^a, we get:\n   3^X - X^3 = 0. \n   Through iterative checking for positive integers X, we find that X=1 is a solution.\n\n4. Set a=6 and b=X. By the rule a¥b=a^b-b^a, we get:\n   6^X - X^6 = -7. \n   Through iterative checking for positive integers X, no solution is found.\n\n5. Set a=4 and b=X. By the rule a¥b=a^b-b^a, we get:\n   4^X - X^4 = 15. \n   Through iterative checking for positive integers X, we find that X=2 is a solution.\n\n### Answer:\n\n1. [[1]]\n2. no solution\n3.

If the minute hand is on the 6 and the hour hand is on the3, what angle is formed by the two hands?\"\n\nHere is the rule you need to follow to answer the questions on this topic:\n\n### Rule 1:\nThe motion of the minute hand divided by the total number of divisions (60) is equal to t over 12 - this gives the relative position of the minute hand to the hour hand. Since this question asks for the angle formed by both hands, we need to convert this relative position back into degrees, which is achieved by multiplying the result by 12.\n\n### Rule 2:\nDuring t minutes, the hour hand moves t over 12 of an hour. Since an hour is divided into 12 hours, a moved hour is zero, and the hour hand moves 1 over 12 of an hour in t minutes. Therefore, the angle formed between the hour hand and the minute hand is (11 over 12) times t.\n\n### Rule 3:\nWhen the minute hand catches up to the hour hand along a given interval, the time between the two hands cannot be zero, or their angle is not zero.\n\n### Rule 4:\nThe angle between the minute hand and the hour hand is either 1 over 3 or 2 over 3 of a straight angle. Since a straight angle is 180°, 1 over 3 of it is 60° and 2 over 3 of it is 120°. Therefore, the angle between the two hands is either 60° or 120°.\n\n**Please only respond using the placeholders below.
