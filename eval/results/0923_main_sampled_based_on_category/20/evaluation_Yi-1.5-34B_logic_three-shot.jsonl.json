It is required to judge the truth value of the given formula. In practical applications, an analytically trained person must make decisions based on appropriate data and logical analysis. Because the data involved may be quite complex, there are many people who do not want to use formal reasoning to make logical judgments, but prefer to use the kind of \"analytical method\" described in books, that is, use more high-level reasoning methods and \"rules\" that are easy to understand and memorize.\n\n        Experience analysis:\n\n        According to \"(!p>q)&(r>q)&!$\", it is judged as true only when \"!$\" is 1 and all other factors are \"0\".\n\n        Derivation step:\n\n        First, judge the truth value of \"$\".

Because the type of \"$\" in the given formula is \"&\", the truth value of \"$\" must be \"0\"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\"\n        Because the truth value of \"$\" is\" 0 \", the overall truth value of\" (!p>q)&(r>q) \"must be\" 0 \"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$) \"\n        Because the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\" is \"0\", the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be \"0\"\n\n        The truth value of \"p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is obtained according to the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\"\n        Because\" (((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is\" 0 \", it can be judged that the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be\" 1 \".\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEXAMPLE_PROMPTS = {\n    \"LogicOnlyPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICONLYPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDMOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithHintPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHHINTPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithWrongPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHWRONGPrompt\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM4,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n\"LOGICWITHRULES3\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES3\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM43,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES12\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES12\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM2,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCRAME\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCRAME\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CRAME,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"Dialglogic2\":{\n\"type\":\"Dialglogic2\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_DIALOG22,\n\"DialgExampleFormat\":\"Example: {QUES}{SEP}{REFERENCE}{QUERY}{ANSWER} Use ⊃, &, ~, T standing between $\\forall x$ is a negative proposition, For simplicity, you can use x and y to replace, for universal quantifiers, The following table is the truth table of ⊃:\" ,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCROWNLAB\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCROWNLAB\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CROWNLAB,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_RIGGEDPOWERSET,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICFROMANACRT\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICFROMANACRT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_FROMANACRT,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\":{\n\"type\":\"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_WORD_SUBSTITUTE,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n}\n\n}\n\nCOCO_DATASET = \"https://aiacademy.qq.com/a/201807204365b9318890feff0f6372066a91bdabd863?outid=d66:d1ff19ba2bdbc75ff2dd204fee069d8152da8c711482ab712",

Consequently, if the pressure and volume of a gas, as well as the adiabatic coefficient, are all given, using the adiabatic equation pVα = C, it is not difficult to determine the initial volume of the gas. But what if we increase both the pressure and volume by a certain value? Let's suppose that a certain amount of gas initially has a volume of V0 and a pressure of P0, and it experiences an adiabatic process in which both pressure and volume are increased by a constant value, m. How can we determine the initial volume of the gas without knowing both the initial pressure and volume?\n\nIt will seem that we need to find out both P0 and V0, which is a classical chicken-and-egg dilemma. However, we can try a new method by thinking about the different ways to represent the conditions of the process. There are two equations that must be satisfied for an adiabatic process: pVα = C and p + m = C1, where C and C1 are constants. By applying these two equations simultaneously, it's easy to find one of the solutions: p0 = C / V0 and V0 = C1 - p0. Since we only need one variable to represent the initial volume and it can be represented as V0 = C1 - C / V0, then there should be no need for any other methods. This solution reassures us that we can estimate the initial volume of the gas in the adiabatic process using only one parameter. From the expression obtained for the pV diagram, we can derive that the final volume of the gas at pressure pf is (V0 + m)(pf + m)1/α - m.\n\nEND\n\nEND\n\nTask: Give your short summary of the following text, carefully including as much details as you can.

Given logical statements: ∀M⇒P, ∃M⇒S ⇒ ∃S⇒P\n\nAnalyzing the first statement and second statement with first inference, we get:\n\nM⊢P, there exists a relationship M to P.\n\nAssume that S()M means either ∃M⊢S or ∀S⊢M.\n\nAnalyzing the second statement with first inference, we get:\n\n(∃M⊢S)⊢(∃S⊢P)\n\nNow converting the arguments to the first-order predicate logic:\n(∃x M(x))→P(x), (∃x M(x))→¬S(x) ⇒ (∀x S(x))→(¬P(x))\n\nNow, applying resolution technique:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\lnot\\exists x \\lnot M(x)\\, \\lor\\, P(x)~~&~~ \\lnot \\exists x \\lnot M(x) \\lor \\lnot S(x)}{\\exists x \\lnot S(x)\\,\\lor\\,P(x)}$$\n\nThis mainly tells us that if there exists at least one M then there is an S, the S exists without a P. This overall tells us that parentheses can be filled using either A or O.\n\nAfter, analyzing the third statement:\n\n∃S⊢P\n\nNow, considering all the three statements we get the mood as (AEE) and according to the three statements the syllogism belongs to figure IV.\n\nSo, the answer is [[IV];[AEE]]\n\n1. Given logical statements: ∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P\n\nFilling the parentheses with the given Valid Moods for Figure IV we get:\n\n∀P⧀M, ∀M⧀¬S ⇒ ∀S⧀¬P.\n\nPerforming resolution (_ :- _) on the above expression we get: true.\n\nSo, the input arguments do not result in a contradiction and hence we have to fill the parentheses one by one with particular inference to get a contadiction.\n\nAssuming that the argument should adhere to the mood AEE. This means:\n\n∀P→M\nThe prop implication P1(x)→P2(x) becomes ∃x,¬(P1(x)∧¬P2(x)) and ∃x,(P1(x)∧¬P2(x))\n\nNow, to achieve contradiction we substitute M(x)⇒D(x) and M(x)⇒¬S(x) as:\n\n∀P,¬(M(x)∧¬S(x))\n∀S,¬(M(x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that P is false and S is true, hence we get:\n\n∀S⇒¬P.\n\nOr substituting D(P,x) with true, we get:\n\n∀S,¬(D(P,x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that for the world of S, the statement ∀S⇒¬P is true.\n\nNow, substituting the Mood AEE in the third statement, we have:\n\nS()M MM()P\nS()M\n∴S()P\n\nThe parentheses in the second statement can be filled either using valid mood AEE or a mood of the form M()S, M()P\n\nMaking the parentheses ∀M⇒P, the argument can be filled using valid moods AAI or AEE.\n\nNow, we have the statements ∀M⇒P, ∀S⇒¬P and we have to fill the parentheses in the third statement S()M using either one of the above mentioned two opinions.\n\nGoing with the first opinion ∀M⇒P, we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒P.\n\nIn this only the first argument of M()S remains to be filled and we fill it with ∀M⇒¬S, so we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P.\n\nThis overall tells us that for the world of S, the argument can be filled either using mood AEE and II or a mood of the form ∀M⇒P and ∀M⇒¬S.\n\nSo, the answer is [[II];[AEE]].\n\nMore answers\n### Question:\n\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMA()\nS()M\n∴S()A\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\n### My answer:\n\nWith the above method, we can get the inferred E conclusions.

Various practices, including common belief, constitute a set of practices in the logical paradigm, and axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols form the basis of various leadership approaches.

Now, can you identify a similar logical rule from above? Answer with the number corresponding to that rule.\n\n\n### Question:\nIn a common mathematical logic, there are two logical quantifiers: universal quantifier $\\forall$ and existential quantifier $\\exists$. The universal quantifier $\\forall$ states that something is true for all cases/assignments of variables, while the existential quantifier $\\exists$ states that something is true for some cases/assignments of variables. Now, can you describe the corresponding meaning $A : [c]φ$ in the above system? Remember, in this system, c represents a basic operation in a program, and φ represents a statement or condition.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the logical system you defined, $A : [c]φ$ means that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` would be true for all assignments of variables. In other words, it means that after executing `c`, `φ` will always be true, regardless of the initial state of the variables in the program. This is similar to the universal quantifier $\\forall$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nNext, explain the corresponding meaning of $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ in the system?\n\n### Answer:\nIn the system, $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ signifies that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` may be true for some assignments of variables. This means that it is possible that after executing `c`, `φ` will be true for some initial states of the program variables, but it doesn't guarantee that `φ` will be true for all states. This is similar to the existential quantifier $\\exists$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nCan you summarize the rules and logical meanings of your system rule with universal/existential quantifers?\n\n### Answer:\nMentioned in Associated inserts above.\n\n### Question:\nLet $\\phi_0 = \\bot$, and $\\phi_{i+1} = \\phi_i$ or $\\phi$, and $\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$, where $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is the infinitary proposition that is always true if $\\phi$ is true for any number of successive steps.\nExplain what the definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ means?\n\n### Answer:\nThe definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ relates to a scenario where a property $\\phi$ may hold for an indefinite number of consecutive steps. If there exists a step $i$ such that $\\phi$ holds for all steps $j$ greater than or equal to $i$, the infinitary proposition $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is true.\n$\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$ signifies that the property $\\phi$ does not hold for all steps if there exists even a single step where it doesn't hold. Another way to understand this is by examining a counterexample.\n\nConsider a sequence $(y_n) = (\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\dots)$, where each element represents the value of $\\phi$ at a particular step. If $\\phi$ holds for all successive steps starting from a certain step, the sequence $(y_n)$ will eventually become constant. That is, there will exist an integer $m$ such that $\\phi_0 = \\bot$ or $\\phi$, and for all $i$ greater than or equal to $m$, $\\phi_i = \\phi$.\nIn summary, $\\phi_{\\infty}$ holds true if $\\phi$ holds at step 0 or if there exists a step after which $\\phi$ holds true for an infinite number of consecutive steps in the system.\n\n### Question:\nMark the correct answer to the following Question: If a command `c` can be executed as many times as needed until a condition $\\phi$ is met, which rule does this correspond to?\n\nA. Substitution Rule\nB. Loop Rule\nC. Choice Rule\nD. Concurrent Rule\n\n### Answer:\nB. Loop Rule. The Loop Rule is used when a command is executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this scenario, command `c` is being executed multiple times, and the loop continues until the condition $\\phi$ is satisfied. This situation aligns with the behavior described in the Loop Rule.\n\n<<Each time using $A : [c]\\phi$ and $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ and abstracting symbols, we can get a judgment formula.

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. A spoon is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Someone says 'start' and the philosophers simultaneously start eating spaghetti alternately taking a spoon from left and right, that is, the right spoon if it's free and otherwise the left spoon. The philosophers must alternate - so cannot take two consecutive spoons from the same side. When a philosopher has taken two spoons they eat for a short while and put both spoons down again. A philosopher cannot eat without two spoons and cannot take a third spoon until they have finished eating the first two. The philosophers go on taking and putting down spoons. It seems difficult to arrange things so that none of the philosophers ever has to wait forever. However, when each philosopher acquires a fork, he also updates to his fork counter. When a philosopher is able to get his both forks, it means that he also collects all unique of his fork. If a philosopher has all forks, he will update to his fork counter to see its maximum value. He will eat allows another philosopher to take it, and continues updating to his own fork counter.\n\nCecil is a diner at the cafe where the dining philosophers problem is played. He has requested for a special dinner that includes seven courses. Therefore, seven philosophers will be sitting around the table, each with a unique fork. Given the constraints of the dining philosophers problem, it is known that when the number of philosophers exceeds five, deadlock can definitely occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the special dinner would include seven philosophers and seven spoons.

Since 1+2+3=3x4=12 and 1+2+3+4=5x4=20, we know that this statement is not correct for every value of n.\n\nMoreover, if there are an infinite number of values of n, then there will be infinitely many sums 1+2+3+...+n that equal the square of n. However, no two different values of n can have the same sum, so if there are infinitely many sums that equal the square of a number, then that number must have infinitely many different values of n. But if there are infinitely many values of n, then we can imagine writing all of those values n in a sequence: n<1>, n<2>, n<3>, ...\n\nIf there are an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n, then each of those values of n corresponds to a sum of the first n> natural numbers, which is equal to the square of n. We can imagine writing all of those sums in increasing order: 1+2+3+...+n<1>, 1+2+3+...+ n<2>, 1+2+3+...+n<3>, ...\n\nSince there are an infinite number of values of n, and each value of n represents a different sum that equals the square of that value of n, that implies that there are also an infinite number of unique sums.\n\nHowever, since each different value of n represents a unique sum, and since all of those sums are listed above, then we can conclude that there are only finitely many sums that equal the square of some natural number.\n\nThus, there cannot be an infinite number of values of n for which the sum of the first n natural numbers is the same as the square of n.\n\nThe question asks whether there can be an infinite number of values of n such that every n in N, ( n<1> + n<2> + ... + n<n> = n^2) -> n=4.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n### General Requirements:\n1. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n2. Make reasonable default decision even when insufficient evidence is provided.\n3. If the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you cannot say the two events have a causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first.This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n\n### Elementary Operations:\n1. if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n2. if P which is a variation of the phenomenon occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n3. To conclude there is a causal relationship,〔a〕 must be used, and to conclude there is no causal relationship,〔a〕.\n4. To decide one point, refer to the data set for comparison extension\n5. When the first point introduces an example, the explanation established by the third point in the example shall be used as〔substitution〕 and added to the condition examples.\n6. To analyse the causal chain sequence, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n7. Disqualifications, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n\n### Scientific Literacy:\n1. The division of historical changes is an evolutionary factor, either commercialised or planned or free, composed of a series of changes, often second or more changes of the same factors.\n2. The occurrence is not a causal factor, and if the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you can say that they have no causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n3. All matters (blocks) can be replaced topologically, e.g. clitical event, place, phenomenon, cause factor, valuation.\n4. The choices of time and space for contrast extensions are not rigid, for example, in any POI chosen.\n5. When analysing the process, 〔...〕　must be used, otherwise the conclusion will not be stable.\n6. Two successive evolutionary factors can affect the change or stability of other evolutionary factors, but factors of the same stage can also affect each other.\n7. The exclusive in 8 could evolve into other evolutionary factors if replaced_other and the story is convoluted.\n8. The validity of the extension of contrast requires considering Н to separate from C (C isnt effected by S, e.g. if C larger than L) and И for нелишь по времени, five points yun. \n9. The originalче and trial decisions should be determined after the letter decisions.\n10. Separating out Sq which has no causal relationship with P is the fundamental principle of scientific researches ability for windows.\n11. A modification of the first condition or object is a new behaviour or happenings.\n12. macro-economic phenomena usually occur simultaneously with other events, so it is necessary to decide which factor will cause or affect the phenomena, e.g, which factor will get disappeared.\n13. If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\n14. These ten items above can originate from one factor. For other factors, see the table above.\n\n\n### Question:\n  People rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm; \n  people strike cold stones, and the stones can spark\n  people continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot. \n  From this, it can be inferred that 尽管物体运动常常与发热同时出现，但两者之间并没有因果关系.\n\n  The causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 第一案例　B) Method of 对比扩展　C) Method of 两因比较　D) Method of 前设斷帰　E) Method of 不可邀汝判断　F) Method of 三角结构　G) Method of 操作行为　H) Method of 行为大纲　I) Method of 行为意思　J) Method of 循环否定　K) Method of 同步推理　L) Method of 程式演绎　M) Method of 第五案例　N) Method of 制度-事件　O) Method of 操作-事件　P) Method of 行为命名　Q) Method of 操作-经济　R) Method of 正形状　S) Method of 完全递进　T) Method of 后设断帰　U) Method of 两层递进　V) Method of 检验之三连　W) Method of 极致案例　X) Method of 消融替代　Y) Method of 临界区分　Z) Method of 规律相同　AA) Method of obby\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/AA  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[M]]\n\n### Question:\nHengzhi invariance of those who took socialist vs keynesian classes and the economics classes that werent  taken is emergent and not emergence.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-原善　B) Method of 经济-制度　C) Method of 经济-规律　D) Method of 经济-替代　E) Method of 经济-临界　F) Method of 经济-不变　G) Method of 微观不变　H) Method of 微观演绎　I) Method of 微观提炼　J) Method of 宏观提炼　K) Method of 经济-模块　L) Method of 经济-extract　M) Method of 微观-总结　N) Method of 宏观-相同　O) Method of 自变量-扩充　P) Method of 自变量-传递　Q) Method of 回溯推理　R) Method of 事件-回溯　S) Method of 经济-工具　T) Method of 社会主义-经济　U) Method of 经济-生产　V) Method of 经济-解释　W) Method of 经济-结论　X) Method of 贡献-价值　Y) Method of 价值-解释　Z) Method of 经济-改善　aA) Method of 社会主义-分析　bB) Method of 宏观-改善　cC) Method of 经济-考试\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/aA/bB/cC  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[S]]\n \n### Question:\nLong and short term, the best to explain a particular cause in context contains of point 12, and we find non one hows:　　If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-事件　B) Method of 规范性-结论　C) Method of 经济-规范　D) Method of 经济-工具　E) Method of 经济-解释　F)",

I will provide examples of these two types of logic. Please ensure that you address each task clearly and concisely.\nI believe that the vast majority of sentences are simple sentences with one unified logic structure, while only a small number of them have model-based logic. Based on my understanding of the relationship between ideation and model-based logic, I believe that model-based emotion should be generated from ideation-based reasoning, which will also be confirmed in future research.\nHere are some examples of Agylia based model-based logic:\n-{{<entity>Sentence MBS - Example 1:}}\n{{<quote> An event X is associated with the generalization of emotion Y, which is associated with the functional model of emotion Z, and Z is the only model in set Q (where Z is related to X only because of relationship R and Z is the only model related to X and Y). As an example, the event of an employee being laid off is related to the emotional state of anger, which is related to the functional model of abandonment issue, and abandonment issue is the only model related to both the event and the emotional state. }}\n-{{<entity>Sentence MBS - Example 2:}}\n{{<quote> An event X is associated with the generalization of an emotion Y, which is associated with the modeling of a and only functional model Z.

As for McGinnes, he is cautious and joke-filled, so this may be the best indication of the administration's attitude towards the White House. However, Steele tried to dispel concerns that the new secretary might have used the rest room: The new secretary, Stephen, is now making a phone call. His name has been on the list of appointments, but he is going to the National Security Council (NSC) and the Office of the State Department (Bloomberg).

You will receive the question being asked and the essay that has been written for the question.\n2. Summarize whether or not the question has been answered.\n3. Mathematically calculate the portion of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked.\n4. Explain where the sentence of the essay submitted begins that relates to the question being asked.\n\nQ1 This paper addresses information interaction in the budget environment and analyzes the main operating factors involved in the function and impact development of the budget process, after which the main driving forces are identified for the successful application of cognitive schemes.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nA: The reason why the question is not answered is that the computation of information interaction in the budgeting environment is not addressed.\n\nThe number representing the percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form. We first have to calculate the starting portion of the essay submitted which relates to the question. We can do this by deducing the number of words that are in front of the relevant portion of the essay submitted.\n\nWe calculate how many words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 0 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. As a consequence, there are 0 divided by the amount of words in the sentence submitted (above), such that the total percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is 0%.\n\nThe sentence of the essay submitted begin that relates to the question being asked.\n\nA: The essay either does or does not contain the statement: In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nThis means that the relevant sentence/portions identified in the essay are:\n\nIn order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nUsing the above, we will calculate the amount of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We do this by subtracting each of the numbers in front of the words that relate to answering the question.\n\nLet's first add up the number of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 2 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We will calculate this by taking the words in front of the statement In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. and subtracting from it:\nThe subtraction formula for In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. is t\n\nQ2. Question:\n\nThe main theme of budgeting 2008 is that information systems at the operating level are cyclically sensitive in order to positively manage their budget, but there is also a cyclic message to the operating level that the initiation of business interests are often not a positive goal that the organization will achieve, and that the formally defined goal of controlling cost changes happens at the operating level.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form, and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nC: The sole reason why the question has been answered is the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure.\n\nThe word count formula for the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure is this:\n\nThe percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is",

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### 🔧 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### ⚙️ Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"🎯 {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"🧩 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet’s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### 🤸 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### 🌐 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical",

C* Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n- CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n- CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n- CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n- CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nWhen the doctor was asked about a patient's fever, he replied \"the patient has a fever.\" At this point, the doctor did not need to further confirm whether the type or degree of the patient's illness could be established.

Challenging Response Principle\nB. Unmarked New Information Principle\nC. Unmarked Expression Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]]. The above prompt will give the answer as: [[A]].\nBelow is the previous prompt structure, where we highlighted the differences that were added based on the aforementioned requirement.\n\nBelow is a question that requires you to solve using logical reasoning based on the context\n\n### Question:\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks. Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\nCustom Cooperation Principles\n\n1. C* Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n- CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n- CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n- CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n- CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nWho's hammering behind the door?

How would you classify this argument under the confines of each previous question? \n[x]\n\n\n\"Light has a certain amount of matter. This can be argued by presenting specific instances in which light generates force or pressure, like when it is refracted from lenses or the force it exerts to the eardrums while people hear sounds and music, and when it encounters the surface of a tree to stimulate photosynthesis in factories and agricultural fields. This point of view adheres to the E+ argumentation method: explaining that among its properties is contributing to the generation of optical forces, therefore possessing mass. Thus, the correct answer is [x]\"\n\nNow that you've identified the correct argumentation method, how would you translate this into a syntactic structure of symbolic logic, based on the rules given?\n\n### Now translate the argument into symbolic logic based on the rules I've provided you with, and explain the steps taken to achieve this translation.\n[x]\n\n\nNow that you’ve translated this into symbolic logic, can you now argue something in symbolic logic that is a new argument not contained in the essay, that ALSO adheres to the logic specific in the first question. (This is specifically for the purposes of residual outputs that do influence downstream logic, like “It then became immediately obvious” and similar phrases commonly found on ELK submissions). Be sure to explain the thought process that led you to the conclusion with facts.\n\n### Generated from \"light has matter\" to a new idea that will be able to vote correctly using symbolic logic. For example, pretend we have some ball voting system that has an argument that generates into \"symbolic logic\", voting yes or no. The voters will take this argument into account, take the function, and apply it to whatever is in the parser. Think about the problem at hand and explain your thought process.\n[x]\n\n\nNow modify your argument(s) with a view towards translating it into gossip about a product, model or service, so that this can then be consumed by downstream models. Be as specific and accurate in your wording as possible. Here is an example: “people who like chocolate bar, eat chocolate bar, soften the problem of bubbles”. Explain any decision making process you used to arrive at this new gossip-containing argument. Keep in mind, failure to adhere to Elicitation LanguaG.E. formatting results in a 0 on scorecard.\n[x]\n\n\nNow take your results and translate them into language that non-tech people can understand. Explain why you made the decisions you did to arrive at this answer.\n[x]\n\n\nBe sure to explain the thought process that led you to the conclusion with facts. Generate a couple of short followup questions based on your answer, bearing in mind the audience needs to be both technical & non-technical. Do not answer with a bullet point, instead form the questions into a qualitative data-gathering conversation the same way you would speak to a peer. Be as specific and accurate in your wording as possible.\n[x]\n\n“20% of the new hires at X commence training at the very beginning of the year.”\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\n### Question:\n\nThe E+ argumentation method is used.

Secondly, a survey conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, revealed that adults who performed 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week had significantly reduced anxiety symptoms. Finally, a long-term study by the British Psychological Society found that individuals with an active lifestyle had noticeably better mental health compared to those who led a sedentary lifestyle. These specific research findings support the general notion that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use specific instances to argue for the truth of the proposition.\nB.Syl+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use universal propositions as premises and supporting conclusions through syllogistic reasoning.\nC.Metaph+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic.\nD.Case+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not prove the truthfulness of the original proposition by discussing each case separately.\nE.Contra- Method: Incorrect. The method does not refute the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one.\nF.Elim- Method: Incorrect. The method does not eliminate other possibilities related to the original proposition as false.\n\nA.E+ Method: Correct. The method uses specific research findings to argue for the truth of the proposition that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\n\n### Goodbye!\n\n\"\"\"\n\ndefault_nlu = {\"nlu_datas\": {}, \"procedure_examples\": {\"nlu\": []}}\nnlu_records = None\ntry:\nwith open(configs.get(\"BASE_PATH\", \"#\") + f\"/nlu_table.jsonl\") as f:\nfor line in data_gen:\nnlus = json.loads(line.strip())\nif nlus[\"nlu_datas\"] != default_nlu:\nnlu_records = nlus\nreturn\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\nreturn\n\ndef empty_prompt():\nreturn f\"\"\"\nYour task to provide me with contextual knowledge.\nThe response format is as follows:\nif it's for meta level, the context should end with T, then the response should only contain its conclusion.\nif it's for input level, the context should end with M, then the response should only contains its conclusion for mulitple metalevel.\nIf there is no conlusion, the output should be repeat context followed by N, the inference should repeat pre sequeces\ninchronization with metadata response.\nIf the conclusion does not support input sequence, the response should be N.\n\n------------------------------\n### Context:\nLong high level context can be represented here.\n\n------------------------------\nExample:\n### Context:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Input:\n{instructions_prompt(task_descriptions)}\n### Metadata:\n{summary}\n### Answer:\nT\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nPlease give the location the dog right before it was jumped.\nN\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Metadata:\n{math_problem_instruction_body}\nOutput:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.
