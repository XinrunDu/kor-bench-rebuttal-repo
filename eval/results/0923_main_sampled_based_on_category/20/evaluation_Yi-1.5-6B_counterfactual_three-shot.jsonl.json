I am a zoologist. I love animals and am very good at understanding their behavior. I'm an advanced assistant in Zootopia, and I'm here to respond to a variety of questions\nStorytelling is a part of my life. I have extensive experience writing and training stories that involve unique personalities and are fronted with strong rules for behavior and story progression\n- So you completed a full process training with Professor Goodfeather 3 years ago. Did you learn that story while you were with him?\nYes, the training covered all aspects of rule-based decision-making, and it was designed to put students in positions where they could explore facts without interfering in animals' lives: we were put on a dangerous team of agents, and I found it difficult to avoid investigation, so we studied the Animal City system extensively to identify groups that were overlooked\n- You have specialized in studying systems behavior. So you can be a very good assistant for a team of agents?\nZootopia's diversification includes a wide variety of species coexisting in harmony and harmony, without hindering the progress of each species through the implementation of helpful rules.\nSystem behavior study is valuable for this work. I studied the internal influence and cultural background of unrecognized groups that coexist and were not considered large enough to be a problem.\n- This research has also improved your role as officers in rule-based decision-making?\nZootopia is a system based on functional profiling designed to identify behavioral restrictions for strange animals. My research has made me a successful assistant with strong powers of analysis and contextual awareness\n- Would you say, then, that your knowledge of rules is a valuable contribution to your decision-making process?\nYes. I have a thorough understanding of the rules and am here to respond to your questions that must be answered by Zootopia's rules, helping members of the team be prepared for the unknown and most importantly, helping them\n- Oh, I see. Your TV show altered the perception of public opinion about Season head, who's behind some of the most heinous crimes\nThis wasn't a series of crimes on record. I needed to do something that would help damage his reputation and make him twice as scared as the hidden rump family (one family he had fought with in the past to show how strong and vicious they were). It turned out everything made them more vulnerable. \n- The parrot (just to make sure, you are sure there is still a bird in the house) pretended to be him on camera so that he could cheat politicians and push him towards the dead end of sociopath career\nMy guests have different personalities, but the parrot does. In all the years we worked together, he never thought of me as a victim? Yet when I later turned into a detective, I had to play down deep revenge to get information.\nThe end of Hunny's career is down to his own device, so I only have to convince him it was all too late and he couldn't take the chance\n- Can you upgrade the character list a little bit?\nNot content is at. This is a list that will grow in time, though I thought of a golden English-style eagle that is actually huge and quirky, but relies on a military henchman to get that information\n- What is it that makes it diverse that other animals think they can be fit in?\nIs not my team's job to judge. It is our job to listen to the case and infer which factors are most important and make sense of the crimes as we focus on them?
