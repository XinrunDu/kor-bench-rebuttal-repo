For this expression, the propositional variables are p, q, and r. Their negations are ¬p, ¬q, and ¬r, respectively.\n\nThe given expression can be simplified as follows, since (¬p ^ q ^ r) and (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) share a common factor of ¬p:\n\n- (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) ∨ (¬p ^ q ^ r)\n- Simplify using distribution: ¬p ^ (¬q v q) ^ r\n- Since ¬q v q is a tautology (law of excluded middle), it simplifies to ¬p ^ TRUE ^ r, which simplifies to ¬p ^ r\n\nNow, we need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in the simplified expression, ¬p ^ r. The propositional variables in this expression are ¬p and r, with their respective negations being p and ¬r. However, the expression ¬p ^ r does not include all propositional variables and their negations. It only includes ¬p and r.\n\nTherefore, the expression ¬p ^ r does not directly correspond to a paired conjunctive term according to the rules provided, as it does not include both p and ¬p, and both r and ¬r in the same term. In the context of the given rules, this expression does not fit the criteria to be labeled with an mX or MX.\n\nHowever, to answer the question as requested and in the context of the binary and hexadecimal assignments:\n\n- The binary representation of the true assignment for the expression (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) ∨ (¬p ^ q ^ r) simplifies to ¬p ^ r is 101 in binary, which is 5 in decimal and E in hexadecimal.\n\nGiven the rule that if the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to a hexadecimal number i, it is denoted as mi, we might expect this to be denoted as mE, but as explained, the expression does not fully satisfy the conditions for a paired conjunctive term. The actual classification of the expression based on the simplified form ¬p ^ r is not a paired conjunctive term but rather falls under a basic formula if considered in the context of the fully expanded form it came from, since it is true for one specific combination of truth values of its variables (¬p is true, p is false, and r is true).\n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms: None]; [denoted: mE (but not truly fitting the definition in this context due to the simplification)]]\n\nThis answer nuances the direct application of the rules to acknowledge that while the hexadecimal E could be assigned based on the true binary value after simplification, the term does not fit the definition of a paired conjunctive term as it stands. The original expression does not independently fit the pattern of a paired conjunctive term due to the simplification process.",
