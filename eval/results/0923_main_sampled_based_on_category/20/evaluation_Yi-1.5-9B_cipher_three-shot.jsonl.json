For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[WHAT HELL OF ENCODING]]\n\nPlease provide the answer based on the given cipher rules and the specified plaintext or ciphertext. The cipher algorithm is as follows:\n\n\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds:\n\n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n\n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            # F #\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n\n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n\n- Encryption Rules:\n    1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    2. Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).\n    4. For each binary group `(X, Y)` do the following:\n        1. Determine the row and column numbers  of `X` in `grid1` as `(x_row, x_col)`.\n        2. Determine the row and column numbers of `Y` in `grid2` as `(y_row, y_col)`.\n        3. Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `x_row` and `y_col`.\n        4. Output the triple `(x_col, num3, y_row)` of the three numbers.\n          - For example, for the binary `(C,E)`, the row and column numbers in `grid1` are (2,2), the row and column numbers in `grid2` are (0,4), so the encoded triple would be `(2,3,5)`.\n    5. After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example: `(2,3,5)(1,1,3)(8,8,3)` produce the final encrypted message `235113883`.\n    \n**Decryption Rules:**\n    \n    1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    2. For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        1. Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of `X_row` is equal to the row number;\n        2. Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of `Y_col` equal to that column number;\n        3. The value of `X_col` is equal to `x`, the value of `Y_row` is equal to `z`.\n        4. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined `(X_row,X_col)`.\n        5. Based on the determined `(Y_row,Y_col)`, find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        6. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        7. For example, for the ternary `(2,3,5)`, in Gird3 the row number corresponding to 3 is 0, so `X_row` = 0, in Gird3 the column number corresponding to 3 is 3, so `Y_col`=3. `X_col`=2, `Y_row`=5. According to (0,2) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter C, and according to (5,3) in Gird2 we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter E in Gird2 according to (5,3), so the final decryption is CE because the input was \"C and E\".\n    3. String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plain text.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nschemameta = {\n    '0': 'Encryption Rules',\n    '1': 'Input:',\n        '1.0': 'Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.1': 'Output:',\n        '1.1.0': 'Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.2': 'Preparation:',\n        '1.2.0': '3 Girds:',\n            '_purpose': [\n                'Grid 1 (3x9):',\n                'Grid 2 (9x3):',\n                'Grid 3 (3x3):'],\n\n        '1.2.1': 'Encryption Steps:',\n        '1.2.1.0': 'Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.',\n        '1.2.1.1': 'Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with #.',\n        '1.2.1.2': 'Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).',\n        '1.2.1.3': 'For each binary group (L1, L2) do the following:',\n        '1.2.1.3.0': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as (l1_row, l1_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.1': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in grid2 as (l2_row, l2_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.2': 'Find the corresponding number num3 on grid3 from l1_row and l2_col.',\n        '1.2.1.3.3': 'Output the triad (l1_col, num3, l2_row) of three numbers.',\n            '1.2.1.3.3.placeholder': [\n                'For example, for the binary (T,H) the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).',\n                'Based on l1_row (0) and l2_col(0) , the corresponding number num3 found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).'],\n        '1.2.1.4': 'After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information.

If I were to run \"encrypt\" and provided the command \"three of a kind\", the output you would need to return would be something like [[encrypted_set_one]]. The first block always starts with [ and ends with ]. The second block (except the last block) ALWAYS ends with *. The third block (unless it's the last block) starts with [ and ends with ]. The last block ends with *. You must ensure the last block has exactly the right formatting and all characters in the current block are encrypted. Examples: Let @ be an encrypted character. //one #@ two two# three three## four four#### five five##### Do not output spaces. Print and return the standard output. #Please make sure you generate enough test questions so that the sample questions below can be be generated automatically. Do not change the sample questions.
