Since $c_1$ and $c_2$ have no impact on $\\phi$, they can be considered unnecessary brackets further simplifying the expression to $[c_1] [c_2] \\phi$.\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes a scenario where the commands $c_1$ and $c_2$ do not alter the state required for the proposition $\\phi$ to hold true.
