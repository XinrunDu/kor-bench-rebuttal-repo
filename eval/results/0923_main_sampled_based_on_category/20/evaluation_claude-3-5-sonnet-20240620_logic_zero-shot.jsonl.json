These hypotheses are considered reasonable individually.\n3. The logical consequence of these hypotheses (r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ r_3) is also considered reasonable.\n4. We are presented with a new hypothesis r_4 that contradicts r_3.\n\nAccording to the LS Paradox rule:\n\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ r_3 ∧ r_4 → ⊥ (contradiction), then we need to reassess the reasonableness of these hypotheses.\n\nThe correct course of action is not to ignore r_4 or automatically accept it as the new truth. Instead, we need to reevaluate all the hypotheses, including r_1, r_2, and r_3, in light of the new contradictory information provided by r_4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]\n\nThis approach aligns with the conclusion of the LS Paradox, which states that in such cases, we need to find a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness to avoid contradiction. Reevaluating all hypotheses allows us to critically examine our existing beliefs and potentially update them based on new evidence or information.",

The verb \"promise\" is explicitly listed as one of the common verbs for Commissives.\n\n3.
