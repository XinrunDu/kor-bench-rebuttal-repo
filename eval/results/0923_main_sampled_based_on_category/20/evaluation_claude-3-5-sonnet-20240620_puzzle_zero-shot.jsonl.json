Looking at the inequality constraints:\n   - (1,3) < (1,4): The number in row 1, column 3 is less than the one in row 1, column 4\n   - (1,4) < (2,4): The number in row 1, column 4 is less than the one in row 2, column 4\n   - (2,4) < (3,4): The number in row 2, column 4 is less than the one in row 3, column 4\n   - (2,1) < (2,2): The number in row 2, column 1 is less than the one in row 2, column 2\n\n4. From the last three inequalities, we can deduce that the 4th column must be in ascending order from top to bottom. The only way to do this with 2 already in the 3rd row is: 1, 2, 3, 4 in the 4th column.\n\n5. Now, the 3rd row must be: 1, 3, 2, 4 (as we need all numbers from 1 to 4, and 2 and 4 are fixed).\n\n6. In the 1st row, we know the 3rd number is less than the 4th (which is 1). So the 3rd number must be 1, and to complete the row without repetition: 3, 4, 1, 2.\n\n7. For the 2nd row, we know the 1st number is less than the 2nd. The only way to complete this row without conflicting with other rows is: 2, 3, 4, 1.\n\n8.

We have two pre-filled numbers: 2 in the top-left corner and 3 in the bottom-right corner.\n3. We need to consider the inequality constraints:\n   (1,2) > (1,3)\n   (2,2) > (2,3)\n   (3,1) < (3,2)\n\nLet's solve:\n\n1. In the first row, we know 2 is in the first position. Given (1,2) > (1,3), the second position must be 4, and the third must be 3 or 1. The fourth must be whatever is left (1 or 3).\n\n2. In the last row, we know 3 is in the last position. The other numbers must be 1, 2, and 4 in some order.\n\n3. Given (3,1) < (3,2), the first number in the third row must be smaller than the second. The only possibility that doesn't conflict with the first row is 1 2 4 3.\n\n4. Now, for the second row, we need to fill in the remaining numbers.

After considering various options, we can identify a suffix that works for all three:\n\ncontra + dict = contradict\npre + dict = predict\nad + dict = addict\n\nTherefore, the common suffix that forms meaningful words when added to all the given letter combinations is:\n\n[[dict]]\n\nThis suffix successfully transforms all three letter combinations into complete, meaningful words.",

Each letter can be used at most once in a word\n\nGiven these constraints, we can form the following words:\n\n1. NAME\n2. AMEN\n3. MEAN\n4. MANE\n\nHowever, we need 5 words of 4 letters each, and we only have 4 letters to work with. It's not possible to form a fifth 4-letter word using these letters without repeating them in a way that violates the rule.\n\nTherefore, this puzzle doesn't have a valid solution under the given constraints.\n\nThe answer, formatted as requested, would be:\n\n[[Not possible]]\n\nThis response indicates that it's not possible to create 5 4-letter words using only the given letters N, E, M, A without repeating any letter within a word.",
