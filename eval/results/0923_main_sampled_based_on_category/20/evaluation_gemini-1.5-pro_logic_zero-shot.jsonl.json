Here's why:\n\n* **Limited Observation:** The premise is based on observing a limited number of oranges (five in this case).\n* **Generalization:** The conclusion draws a general inference that \"all oranges are sweet\" based on this limited observation.\n\nThis aligns with the definition of inductive reasoning, where a general conclusion about a class (oranges) is inferred from observing specific instances (five sweet oranges).\n\nIt's not **Φ inductive reasoning** because we haven't observed *every single orange in existence* to definitively conclude that all oranges are sweet. \n",
