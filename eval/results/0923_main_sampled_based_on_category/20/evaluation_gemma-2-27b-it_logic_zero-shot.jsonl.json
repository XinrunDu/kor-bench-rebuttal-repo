Here's why:\n\n* **Reasonable Hypotheses:**  r_1, r_2, and r_3 are all plausible and commonly accepted as true.\n* **Logical Consequence:** The conjunction of these hypotheses (r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ r_3) strongly suggests that apples should be rich in vitamin C.\n* **Contradiction:** The introduction of r_4, which contradicts r_3,  creates a logical paradox. \n\nAccording to the LS Paradox rule, when the logical consequence of a set of reasonable hypotheses contradicts another reasonable hypothesis, we must **reassess the reasonableness** of the initial hypotheses (r_1, r_2, r_3) to resolve the contradiction.\n\n\n\n",
