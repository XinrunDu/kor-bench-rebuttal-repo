The theorem must be at least one sentence \nbut preferably less than two pages long. What is the name of the theorem and how it is proved?\n\n### answer :\n**The Pigeonhole Principle**\n\nThe Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states that if we have more objects than containers, \nthen at least one container must contain more than one object. Informally, it can be stated as: \"If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, \nthen at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\" This principle finds applications in various areas of mathematics, \nincluding combinatorics, number theory, and computer science.\n\n**Proof**: The proof of the Pigeonhole Principle is straightforward and uses the method of contradiction.\n\nAssume we have k objects and k+1 containers. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that we can place all the objects in the \ncontainers such that each container holds at most one object. This means that the number of objects must be less than or equal to \nthe number of containers (k <= k+1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, at least one container must contain more than one object. \n\nIn other words, if n pigeons are placed in m pigeonholes and n > m, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with more than one pigeon. \n\nThis is the Pigeonhole Principle.",

Examples\nf(x,y)=1,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nUsing the new operation, we can solve this problem as abov​\nThe question specifies an area 'D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3', on which we integrate the function 'f(x,y)=1'. Let's solve this using the formula 'f◆D = ∬_{D} f(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy'.\n\nThe given function f(x,y) is a constant function equating to 1. Since the area 'D' is a rectangle bounded by x values 1 to 2 and y values 1 to 3, we can compute the double integral straightforwardly. Here's how you perform the operations:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 1 dx dy (by integrating 1 from 1 to 2, the result will be 2-1=1) by integrating 1 from 1 to 3, the result will be 3-1=2. So integral will be 1*2=2\n\n\nf(x,y)=xy,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nTo solve this one, likewise, we just simply compute the double integral with the given function over the given rectangular area:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (xy) dx dy(calculate ∫ xy dx from 1 to 2 = x^2y/2; substitute boundaries: (2^2*y)/2 - (1^2*y)/2=3/2*y) By doing ∫ (3/2*y) dy from 1 to 3 it will be (3/2)*(3^2)/2 - (3/2)*(1^2)/2=9/2 - 3/2=6/2=3hence, integral is 3*∫ dy from 1 to 3 = 3(3-1)=3*2=6\nf(x,y)=x^2+y^2,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nHere's the solution:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (x^2 + y^2) dx dyFirst, solve ∫ (x^2 + y^2) dx from 1 to 2 = x^3/3 + xy^2; substitute boundaries: (2^3)/3 + 2y*y - (1^3)/3 - 1*y^2=7/3 + y^2Next, solve ∫ (7/3 + y^2) dy from 1 to 3 = 7/3y + y^3/3; substitute boundaries: 7/3*3 + 3^3/3 - 7/3*1 - 1^3/3=6 + 9 - 7/3 - 1/3=15 - 2*1/3 = 15 - 2/3 = 45/3 - 2/3 = 43/3 = 14 1/3.Hence, the result is 49/3.\nf(x,y)=x^2y,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nWe solve as before:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (x^2y) dx dy First, solve ∫ (x^2y) dx from 0 to 1 = x^3*y/3; substitute boundaries: 1^3*y/3 - 0^3*y/3 = 1/3*y Next, solve ∫ (1/3*y) dy from 0 to 3 = y^2/6; substitute boundaries: 3^2/6 - 0^2/6 = 9/6 = 3/2 Hence, the result is 3/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 3/2*3 = 9/2\nf(x,y)=xy^2,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nSame as above:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (xy^2) dx dy First, solve ∫ (xy^2) dx from 0 to 1 = x*y^2/2; substitute boundaries: 1*y^2/2 - 0*y^2/2 = 1/2*y^2 Next, solve ∫ (1/2*y^2) dy from 0 to 3 = y^3/6; substitute boundaries: 3^3/6 - 0^3/6 = 27/6 = 9/2 Hence, the result is 9/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 9/2*3 = 27/2\nWhat will the following integral expression simplifies to? Prove your solution and turn it into decimal with at most two digits after decimal.\n\nf(x,y)=x^2 + y^2, D: x^2+y^2 = 4, x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, compute f◆D.\nMy answer is 11/3\\pi, but markdown only supports latex, can you calculate this integral for me?\nBy using polar coordinates\nWe know x^2+y^2 = r^2. So, we can transform the coordinate system to polar coordinates where x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ). The Jacobian of this transformation is r. The new integral limits for the given circle with radius 2 will be from 0 to 2pi for θ and 0 to 2 for r.\n\nSo, our new integral is: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 ((rcos(θ))^2 + (rsin(θ))^2) * r dr dθ Simplify the integrand: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 * (cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ)) dr dθ Since sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr dθ Now we solve the r integral: ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr = [r^3/3] from 0 to 2 = 8/3 The final integral becomes: ∫ from 0 to 2pi (8/3) dθ = (8/3)θ from 0 to 2pi = (8/3)*2pi = 16/3 * pi = 11/3 * pi.
