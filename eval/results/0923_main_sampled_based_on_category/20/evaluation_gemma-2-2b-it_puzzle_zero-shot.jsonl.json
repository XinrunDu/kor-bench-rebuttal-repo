To solve it, we need to place tents according to the rule: \n    * They must sit next to trees, either vertically/horizontally.\n    *  They cannot overlap or next to other tents.\n* **Missing Information:** The provided question only presents a grid with some constraints (like how many tents are needed in some columns). \n    * **Types and Placement of Trees:**  We don't know how the trees are distributed on the grid. To correctly place tents, knowing their location (X and T) is essential.\n    * **Row/Column Constraints:** The column and row constraints are numerically constrained. We need to understand:\n        * What do these constraints indicate (e.g., are tents in those positions always mandatory?)\n        * What is the meaning of \"Tents\"\n    * **Full Grid:** To build a valid solution, we need the whole grid to complete each position.\n\n**To solve this puzzle, the following steps would be needed:**\n\n1. **Tree Information:** Knowing the location of all trees within the grid is crucial. \n2. **Constraint Meaning:** Clarifying where the \"T\" represents itself and how we know it (e.g., orientation, size, etc.).\n3. **Constraint Application:** Understanding the rules behind the numbers (숫자).\n\nLet me know if any of the information above is assumed when you create the puzzle, or if you can provide some missing pieces. 😜 \n",
