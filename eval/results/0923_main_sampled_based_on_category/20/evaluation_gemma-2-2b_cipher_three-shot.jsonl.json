This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n",

Feel free to use the provided information to your advantage, and if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I hope this provides necessary input to generate meaningful answers for your AI assistant system!\n\nHi! I am your AI assistant called 'CipherBot'. It's my pleasure to assist you in finding the encrypted and decrypted answers from the given input and rules.\n\n### Encryption Rules:\n- The encryption process is designed as follows: For each letter (e.g., A) in the plaintext, the corresponding value in the reel is used as the encrypted letter. The reel contains the letters 'ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN' in this example.\n\nFor instance, if the plaintext is 'A', the expected output should be B, as the correspond input reel letter is B (A is 5 mod 26, corresponding to 26 + A = B). However, if the plaintext is 'A' (constant 10 mod 26), then the output is B (instead of Z as B in the input reel) as A matches B directly without any round-robin movement to the next reel.\n\nSimilarly, if the plaintext is 'ACDFGHJ', the encrypted output should be P, as D is directly matched with P (first input reel alphabet) while H matches B.\n\n### De-Encryption Rules\nThe de-encryption process as follows: for each letter (J) in the ciphertext, the correspond input reel letter is used to de-encrypt the letter.\n\nFor instance, if the ciphertext is 'J', the expected output should be I (via subtracting 7 from 14 mod 26 as J in the input ciphertext is 14), as I is the corresponding letter when deducting 7 from 26 (as the code specifies reel numbers as mod 26 mod inherit).\n\n### Sample Answers:\n\n- \"A\" --> \"B\" (via removing the letters ones spots apart from the last from the first reel and using those spots as the plaintext's answer.)\n- \"J\" --> \"I\" (via subtracting the 7th reel alphabet (i.e., Z) from the plaintext's answer.\n- \"U\" --> \"X\" (this move does not affect the plaintext; B is moved from the beginning of the Reel to the end; thus, U is in the plaintext.\n- \"S\" --> \"X\" (the Y and Z spots interchange; we move P to fit the Z spot's position, the Z is in the plaintext)\n- \"X\" --> \"S\" (due to the ciphertext in order (A and all uppercase letters are already converted) the answer is backward, but unchanged; likewise the ciphertext is in order; so the answer is S)\n\nRemember, encryption requires the proper alphabet order, while decryption does not.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"N\" --> \"M\"\n\nAnswer: Here's a rule:\n\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'N' --> 'B'\n- 'M' --> 'C'\n- So, the answer is 'MC'.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"U\" --> \"X\"\n\nAnswer:\n\n    Here's a rule:\n\n    - Plaintext: \"VAWC\"\n    - Output: \"SCUX\"\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'U' --> 'C'\n- 'W' --> 'D'\n- 'C' --> 'C'\n- 'A' --> 'X'\n- 'V' --> 'W'\n- 'O' --> 'C'\n- 'B' --> 'D'\n- 'D' --> 'U'\n- 'N' --> 'D'\n- 'J' --> 'Z'\n- 'Z' --> 'O'\n- 'U' --> 'R'\n- Finally, 'X' --> 'SCUX' (for 'U' --> 'X') which results in 'SCIWX'.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
