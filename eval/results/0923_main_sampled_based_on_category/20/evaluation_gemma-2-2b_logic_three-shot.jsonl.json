All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, ¬(p∧q)∧¬w can be written either as ¬p∧¬¬q∧¬w [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or ¬p∧(¬q∧¬w) ∨ ¬p∧¬q∧¬w (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of ¬p↔p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, ¬p∨¬q is logically equivalent to ¬p∧¬q. In contrast, ​¬(p∨q)¬r\n][1] is not a logical implication of ¬p∨¬q¬r because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition ¬p∨q¬r can be reduced to ¬p∧¬q∨¬r.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p∨¬p^(¬q∧¬r) -p^¬q^¬r (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p∨ψ` the [`p∧¬ψ’ `p∧ψ](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & ¬A)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P ∨ Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. ¬Q (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q ∨ ¬P (disjunction). When it is true ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) is true ∧(¬P ∨ ¬Q)] (logical ∨). When it is true ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)) = ¬P ∨Q] ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) = P ∨ Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P ∨ Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A ∨ ∧(B ∨ C ... N.) for the DNF `(A ∨ (B ∨ (C ∨ ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) ∨/∨[(X ∨ Y ∨ Z ∨ ... N. ∨ X ∨ Y). ∨ (X ∨ Y ∨ Z ... N) ∨X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p∧q∧r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p ∧ (q ∧ r))))) ∧((q ∧ (p ∧ r))) ∧((r ∧ (p ∧ q)))] ∧((r ∧ (p & (q ∧ r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p ∧ Q)(p ∧ R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P ∨ Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: ¬(¬A∧¬B)→(A∨B) ((¬ A∨¬ B)→( A∧ B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P ∨ Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q∧¬r&¬q∧r^(¬¬p∨¬p∧r∧¬r∧p^(¬p∧¬r^(¬¬q^¬p^(¬r∧¬q)))>= (p∧¬¬p∧¬q)^p∧q∧¬r`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. ¬P ∨(P^¬¬Q))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## 使用与输出格式：编写符合格式的逻辑配置和输出。\n\n- 使用自定义规则的定制逻辑配置，从输入字符流中回答，生成符合自定义规则格式的回答并写到输出字符流中。\n> 输入： 字符流，满足以下格式`[输入字符流:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **问题**: `[“**Output:**”，格式：\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> 将自定义规则的定制逻辑配置应用到字符流输入`[“'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `输出`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n用[0]中的函数实现输出。\n\n\n## 编译选项：\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# 实现：\n\n## 1). 自定义逻辑  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). 实现文字输入([LNOT^2和calculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). 逻辑输入输出格式([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). 编译参数,错误信息返回([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)",

If (F → A G) and B are contradictory, then A → B and A G → S needs to be proven.

To prove this, we can use logical reasoning.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is equivalent to ¬ ¬A ¬B A ∨ ¬B and the variable expressions A ⇆ B ≡ A ¬B. Prove the two statements are equivalent.\n\n### Answer:\nThe equivalence of the two statements is A B (¬A ¬B) ≡ A A ∨ ¬B ≡ (A B ¬B) ∨ ¬B, demonstrating the equivalence of expression A ⇆ B B with expression A B ¬B.\n\n### Question:\nThe following step in the proof provides a contradiction conclusion. Suppose A C B, prove A ⇆ C is true.\n\n### Answer:\nAssuming A C B, the p, q, r, s, t represent propositions A, (p ∨ s), B, (p ∨ r), C, (p ∨ t). When p is false, one can simplify the p ∨ s rule into ¬(p∨s) and conclude ¬(p∨s) C ¬(p∨r). When p is true, one can simplify the q ∨ r rule into ¬(q∨r) C ¬(p∨r), and p C ¬(q∨r) ¬¬C A C¬ ¬¬C B ¬¬. The p ∨ s rule is also q ∨ s or ¬(q∨s). Therefore, the conclusion is A ⇆ C B.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is ambiguous. Do you think it's valid or invalid logically? Give your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nA, some people think that A B ∴¬ABC, B, so ¬ A B means (¬A or ¬B), then for some people, people may believe that (((¬ A B) B is a contradiction), (¬ A B). So A B follows from A B, A B, but to people, they think B's B ¬A B C are meaningless.\n\nFor some people (i.e., a certain class of people), A, all people with A B ∴ ¬¬A ∧ ∨¬¬B ∴A ∪B can prove that A B C is a contradiction for some people. So A B can prove that ¬A ∨¬B, the equivalence condition is true for some people. So A B is valid for some people, and some people believe A B. For a contradiction, that some people think B's A(B is ambiguous).\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this proposition is empty in logic\" and \"empty in logic\" mean?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This proposition is empty logic\" refers to the situation where the proposition A must either be logically true or logically false, but if the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n\"This proposition is empty in logic\" means that the proposition A is true, a non-empty statement, and the statement \"this proposition is empty in logic\" means that the statement is false, an empty statement.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this statement is false\" and \"empty statement\" mean in this sentence?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This statement is false\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is empty\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually false.\n\n\"This sentence is empty in logic\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n### Question:\nWhen writing an argument, sentences can be interpreted as ambiguous. Analyze the logic of the following sentences, (b_b) ∧ ∀x((x_x ∨ B_x)  ↔ (∃n_n ∴ n_n ⊃ B_b)). Is this sentence valid?\n\n### Answer:\nFor the statement b_b, ∀x((x_x ∨ B_x) ≡ ∀x(x_x ∨ b_x) ≡ (∀x(x_x) ∨ ∀x(b_x)), for the sentence b_b, ∀x((x_x ∨ b_x) ≡ (∀x(x_x) ∨ ∀x((∃n_n ∴ n_n ⊃ b_b), assume that the total class is V1 and B_(vb) is V.\n\nTherefore, V C V is a contradiction, and the sentence is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the axioms of excluding A and considering B in order? Prove the result is valid.\n\n### Answer:\n1. Axioms for excluding A and considering B\n(1) First, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n(1) In logic, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Considering B and A\nAssume some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n(1) Some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Involving A and Excluding B\nAssuming some axioms for involving A and excluding B are valid.\n(2) Involving A and excluding B and proving the truth of A are valid, the truth of A is valid.\n\nTherefore, the statement is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the conditions needed to prove the valid sentence in A?\n\n### Answer:\nThe first item is C, and the last item is e.\n\n### Question:\nAssume three propositions: ¬B, C, and A.
