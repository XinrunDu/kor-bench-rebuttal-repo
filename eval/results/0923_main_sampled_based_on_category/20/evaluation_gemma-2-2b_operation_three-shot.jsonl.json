To express negative values, it is necessary to cover the original number with a minus symbol, so please pay attention.\n\nPlease align all parts of your answer in terms of the question number. Your answer should be written in a form that is both easy to read and easy to understand by other people. This rule specifically indicates that the answer only needs to meet the default number of characters; however, please make sure to wrap the answer in a bracket as explained earlier.\n\n### Submission format:\n\n- You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n- You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n- You may accept the original question (including \"answer\") in the first portion of the question box.\n- You are to prepare 3-7 responses.\n- You are to identify the format of the correct answer.\n- You are to adhere to the rule specified in the Question section.\n- You are to provide only the question number. If not applicable, you must write \"none.\".\n\n## Detailed Explanation:\n\n> 1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n\nIn the Question section, we are explaining the \"operation rule\". You will need to apply this rule exactly to solve the given question.\n\n> 2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n\nYour answer, as well as our answer, should be a number or a group of numbers. Double-check this step.\n\n> 3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nUpon receiving your answer, you should double-check it carefully a of least 4 times. This part is very important, so please take it seriously.\n\nThis rule is related to finding \"solution x\" in the given question. You will need to write the correct answer in the format provided, which has four parts:\n\n> Part 1: Clearly explain the \"operation rule\".\n\nExplaining the \"operation rule\" is crucial, as it will provide you with the necessary understanding of the rule and how to apply it to solve the given question correctly.\n\n> Part 2: Provide an example of your own.\n\nPlease provide a specific example to demonstrate your understanding of the \"operation rule\" and its application. This example will serve as reference for future calculations.\n\n> Part 3: Explain whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A.\n\nIt is crucial to determine whether \"operation X\" can be substituted for \"operation Y\" in calculating the result of operation A. Consider the example below.\n\nOperation Rule: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nOperation X: (1◎2)(3＋4)-(6◎1)\n\nFor this example, \"Operation X\" is not a valid substituted method for \"Operation A\". Therefore, we should proceed as follows to find the value of \"X\":\n\n(1◎2)(3＋4)=(61x+2)◎(3◎7)\n\nFirst, simplify the left side of the equation: (1◎2)(3＋4)=(8×2)(7)=(16×7) = 112\n\nThen, simplify the right side of the equation: (61x+2)◎(3◎7) = (61x+2)●(21) = (1261x+42)\n\nEquate the two sides and solve for \"X\":\n\n(16×7) = (1261x+42)\n\nSolve for \"X\":\n\nx = (16×7-42)/(1261)\n\nx = 86/1261\n\nx = 4/63\n\nTherefore, in this example, \"Operation X\" cannot be substituted for \"Operation A\".\n\n> Part 4: Clearly explain the method you used to find the correct answer.\n\nFinally, clearly illustrate the methods used to find the correct answer. This part will help readers understand how to solve similar problems in the future.\n\n##### Submission\n\n> You are to specify a question from our original question, not the answer.\n\n> You are to demonstrate mastery of this skill by providing at least 4 answers (hint: practice in data frame parsing or Pandas using your own tools).\n\n> Simplification with the rule for finding \"solution x\" and check the correctness through real calculations.\n\n##### Example:\n\n<a>\nThis is a simple calculation that directly satisfies the expression and achieves a correct result.\n\n<b>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2710, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(4◎1)+(2◎3)=[[10+20i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Answer\n\n$[[10+20i]]$\n\n<b\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2709, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[[3-4i]]\n<b>\n\n##### Explanation:\n\n①\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2716, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(1◎3)+(X◎2)=-8+14i\n②\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2718, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[61x+2]−[6x+2]\n③\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2726, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[41x+1]−[4x]+2\n④\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2738, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(4◎1)-(2◎2)]\n⑤\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2744, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[(2◎1)+(1◎2)]−(2◎2)\n⑥\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2752, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=2+1−2\n⑦\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2766, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=1\n⑧\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2770, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×2]\n⑨\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2777, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[4－2]\n⑩\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2782, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2×1]\n11\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2784, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[2－2]\n⑫\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2790, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=0\n13\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2799, {level:1,limitbox:2})\">gotoDocument</script>\n(2◎1)−(2◎2)=[1×2]\n14\n<script type=\"text=\"javascript\" role=\"button\" onmouseover=\"gotoDocument(2804, {level:1,limit",
