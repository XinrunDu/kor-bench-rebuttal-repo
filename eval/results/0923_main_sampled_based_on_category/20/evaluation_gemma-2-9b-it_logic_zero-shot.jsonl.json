This is represented as `P(s1) ∧ P(s2) ∧ P(s3) ∧ P(s4)`.  Since these are all the instances in sample `S`, our premise covers all members.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We are concluding that *all* members of class `S` have property `Q`. This is represented as `P(S)`,  where `S`  represents the set containing all individuals in the sample. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more logic rule examples!",
