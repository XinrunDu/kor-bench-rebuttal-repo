Let's assume S = 9.\n\n5. **Express Everything in Terms of M, O, N, E, Y:**\n   - Because S can’t be zero and starts a 4-digit number, S = 9.\n   - The sum SEND + MORE = MONEY implies a carry-forward scenario from the leftmost column.\n\n6. **Logical Deductions and Unique Assignments:**\n   - If we try S = 9, and find that O = 0 gives a feasible result.\n   - Addition involves finding what two end units (D and E) add up to exceed the base numerical calculations and provide the appropriate carries through columns. \n\nThrough a combination of guesses and maintaining unique contributions per the given rules:\n\n- Assign S = 9\n- Assign O = 0 (since O + R results in N with no carry to affect S)\n- Process the remaining logic until all assignments are valid and fit the equation.\n\nFinal Valid Assignment Applying All Rules:\n- S = 9\n- E = 5\n- N = 6\n- D = 7\n- M = 1\n- O = 0\n- R = 8\n- Y = 2\n\nSo, SEND = 9567, MORE = 1085, and MONEY = 10652\n\nThe correct answer is:\n[[S=9, E=5, N=6, D=7, M=1, O=0, R=8, Y=2]]",
