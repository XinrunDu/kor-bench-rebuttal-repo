        "response": "To determine the classification of the formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r), we need to evaluate it based on the provided logical rules.\n\n1. Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of ¬p, ¬q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r.\n   - (p ∧ q ∧ r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p ∧ q ∧ r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it’s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it’s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it’s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it’s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it’s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Based on the given rules, none of these classifications (A, B, C, D, E) apply to the formula provided.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]",
