Instead, the treatment of the elderly is described as a journey to return to the ground, essentially being asked to leave the Lighthouse and explore the perilous ground ruins. This aligns with option C, where they are asked to leave the Lighthouse and go to the ground.

This implies that the valuation of a person's life is a critical factor in receiving medical treatment. Consequently, the most likely action a doctor would take is to use the life formula to calculate the life value of the individual seeking help, and only proceed with treatment if the life value is high enough. This aligns with the harsh survival rules and value judgments characteristic of the Lighthouse society.",
