Since p2 is \"5 is odd,\" the negation of p2 would be \"5 is even.\" Thus, this proposition is symbolized as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(3) Only 4 being even makes 5 even.\nThis statement implies that 5 being even is exclusively contingent on 4 being even. There's a subtle difference here from the previous proposition in that it suggests the uniqueness of this condition. However, given the logical connectives at our disposal, and considering the constraint of only using p1 and p2, this can be closely represented as a combination of the previous ideas, emphasizing that if 4 is not even, then 5 is not even (which is equivalent to saying 5 is odd). Symbolically, this could be \"~(~p1 & ~p2)\", meaning it's not the case that both 4 is not even and 5 is not odd, which implies that if 4 is even, then 5 is not odd (i.e., 5 is even). However, to maintain the simplicity and directly address the given propositions without introducing new logical structures, this can also be seen as reiterating the point made in (2), focusing on the uniqueness of the condition, so we'll keep it as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(4) 4 is even if and only if 5 is odd.\nThis is a straightforward biconditional statement, meaning 4 is even is a necessary and sufficient condition for 5 to be odd.

The given statements are:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S\n3. ∀S ⇒ ¬P\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (∀P ⇒ M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (∀M ⇒ ¬S) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (∀S ⇒ ¬P) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion ∀S ⇒ ¬P (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, ∀S ⇒ ¬M (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), ∴S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, ∴S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies ∀¬M ⇒ S (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (∀P ⇒ M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (∀¬M ⇒ S, equivalent to ∀M ⇒ ¬S in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (∀S ⇒ ¬P).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation.

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) ≈ 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation.
