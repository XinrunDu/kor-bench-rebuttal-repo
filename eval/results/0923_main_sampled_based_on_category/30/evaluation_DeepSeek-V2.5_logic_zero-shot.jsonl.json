This directly applies to our statements.\n   - If §p (Widows are allowed to remarry), then ¬‽p (Widows are not prevented from remarrying).\n   - If ¬‽p (Widows are not prevented from remarrying), then §p (Widows are allowed to remarry).\n\n(2) **§p←→¬‽p**: This formula is essentially the same as (1) but stated in a different order. It also directly applies to our statements.\n   - If §p (Widows are allowed to remarry), then ¬‽p (Widows are not prevented from remarrying).\n   - If ¬‽p (Widows are not prevented from remarrying), then §p (Widows are allowed to remarry).\n\nThus, the two normative reasoning formulas that correspond to the given statements are:\n\n1. **‽p←→¬§p**\n2. **§p←→¬‽p**\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[2]].",
