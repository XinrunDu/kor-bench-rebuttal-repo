For the first block, \"#CVRA\", we place the template with holes on the grid and fill it with characters:\n    - \"#C\" -> Fill through the first hole.\n    - \"#V\" -> Fill through the second hole.\n    - \"#R\" -> Fill through the third hole.\n    - \"#A\" -> Fill through the fourth hole.\n    - The grid looks like this:\n        - [['#C', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n2. After rotating the template 90 degrees counterclockwise, we repeat the process for the remaining letters in the same block:\n    - \"#D\" -> Fill through the fifth hole.\n    - \"G\" -> Fill through the sixth hole.\n    - \"I\" -> Fill through the seventh hole.\n    - \"R\" -> Fill through the eighth hole.\n    - The grid now looks like:\n        - [['#C', 'R', 'A', '#'],\n        ['#', 'D', 'I', 'G'],\n        ['#', '#', 'R', 'E'],\n        ['#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\n3.

Finally, we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise for the block \"#NR\":\n    - \"#N\" -> Fill through the first four holes.\n    - \"#R\" -> Fill through the fifth hole.\n    - \"#A\" -> Fill through the sixth hole.\n    - The grid now looks like:\n        - [['#C', 'R', 'A', '#', '#', 'N', '#'],\n        ['#', 'V', 'D', 'I', 'G', 'R'],\n        ['#', '#', 'A', '#', '#', 'E']]\n\n5.
