Keystream generator generates keystream values sequentially which are then used to encrypt plaintext characters. The encryption and decrypted process is reversible and ensured by the deterministic and replicable keystream generator.\n2. After generating the first keystream value, the initial order of the cards changed as follows:\n   1. Card 54 moved down by one position.\n   2. Card 53 moved down by two positions.\n   3. Top and bottom parts divided by Card 54 and Card 53 are swapped.\n   4. Last card (29) is taken out from the bottom of the deck, and put into the middle of the deck.\n3. 1.

Demonstrate how the soleway algorithm you interacted with in KY104 generate keystreams deterministically. Which of the following options best describe it? Select the correct statement from the options given.\n   a. Checking the correctness of a decryption can indirectly confirm the validity of the encryption. That is, if the result of the decryption operation matches the original version, then we can prove that it is encrypted, although we do not know that it can have different encryptors.\n   b. The Keystream Algorithm is deterministic, therefore given the same initial sequence of cards, it will always produce the same sequence of keystream values.\n   c. Only confirming the correctness of the encryption, but confirming the correctness of the decryption cannot confirm the validity of encryption.\n   d. The Keystream Algorithm is not deterministic, thus initial sequence of cards is always same, it will always produce the same sequence of keystream values.\n- Current score: **2 / 2**",
