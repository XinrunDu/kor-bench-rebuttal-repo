Based on the determined (L2_row, L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n    1. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n    For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

Convert the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes:\n\t* \"25\" in hexadecimal represents the bytes `0025` (32 in decimal).\n2. Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n\t* Since the key is the same as in encryption, the decrypted bytes are obtained by XORing each ciphertext byte with the corresponding key byte.\n\t* Due to the key recycling, we reuse the key to match the length of the ciphertext.\n3. Convert the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string:\n\t* XORing `0025` with the first 2 bytes of the key (`73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3`):\n\t\t+ `73ef2a` XOR `0025` = `7bdf9c`\n\t\t+ `7a7a` XOR `0000` = `7a7a`\n\t\t+ `7fbf` XOR `0000` = `7fbf`\n\t\t+ ... ( recycling the key )\n\t* The resulting decrypted bytes are `7bdf9c7a7a7fbf...` ( truncated for brevity ).\n4. Convert the decrypted bytes to a plaintext string using ASCII encoding:\n\t* `7bdf9c` corresponds to the character \"\\aF\"\n\t* Since the original plaintext is expected to be an uppercase letter string, I will capitalize the first character: \"AF\"\n\n**Answer:**\n[[AF]]",
