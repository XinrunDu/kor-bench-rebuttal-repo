In this scenario, the author considers two cases: n is even and n is odd, and then uses specific instances and definitions to support the conclusion that any integer is either even or odd.\n\nThe other options do not fit the provided explanation:\n\n* E+ Method is for using specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition, but the argument here involves considering multiple cases.\n* B. Syl+ Method uses universal propositions as premises and supporting conclusions through syllogistic reasoning, but there is no syllogistic reasoning in this explanation.\n* C. Metaph+ Method uses metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic, which is not applicable here.\n* E. Contra- Method involves indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition, which is not the case here.\n* F. Elim- Method involves indirectly determining the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities as false, but no elimination is performed in this explanation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.Case+ Method.",
