Utilizing advanced OpenAI technologies, transformer architectures exhibit strong generalization capacity and can support a wide variety of tasks and applications, including question-answering, language modeling, and text generation.\n\nThis programming challenge has been built on top of the BertLargeModel and Ada model (powered by Hugging Face and OpenAI). We have implemented a rule-based reinforcement learning algorithm to solve specific sub-goals and generate diverse responses tailored to the context of the given examples.\n\nThe story is an integral part of the programming challenge, providing necessary settings, rules, and details needed to solve the problem. The questions reflect different tasks and demonstrate how our use-case model learns and adapts over time. All responses are generated by trained OpenAI models, unaffected by the API's latest updates.\n\nThe goal of this challenge is to design an architecture that effectively leverages transformers to solve complex tasks, such as question-answering and text generation, in an efficient manner while considering the memory and time constraints faced by smaller devices like mobile phones.\n\nThis challenge includes a story to set the scene and provide context for the questions. We have chosen not to name the story text to avoid unnecessary associations, ensuring that the focus remains on the task requirement and the unique structure of the story rather than on the relevance or meaning of the story itself.\n\nWe have ensured that all examples and questions are linguistically neutral, catering to a wide range of cultures, and that the problem-solving aspect relies on logical reasoning and evaluation of provided information rather than the use of any particular vocabulary.\n\nThe examples are fictitious and generated by the model itself, based on the given story, rules and principles described in the text. They showcase how the system can tackle complex questions while remaining within the constraints of the given rules and narrative.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

By maintaining a positive attitude towards the new identity, one can develop respect for oneself and the world they inhabit. Mastering a new language or dialect can aid in this process, as it allows one to connect to the soul, rather than the body. Creating new symbolism through art or language can facilitate connection with others, transcending the barrier of a shared language.

Your task is to determine the related conversion rate between some of the given conversions.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer n ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 3000$$ ) — the number of conversions in a grid.\nEach of the following n lines contains a number from 1 to n.\n\nThe last n lines each contain exactly n digits, each with values 1 or 2; your grid is a set of (n-1)-dimensional polytopes, and the first grid is the root of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n integers, each of which is the converted value of the corresponding number.\n\nYou are an administrator working for the paradata exchange division where the duty is to maintain the conversion rate between identities of registered people. Some parameters are given under of pandas law 1599, as follows:\n\n• Previously registered people can convert between different kinds of identities. Mostly they prefer doing it for free, but some of them want to upgrade to an identity that is considered to have higher prestige.\n• The kind of an identity is just an integer between 1 and n, inclusively.\n• Even more often, a person who has an identity of some kind converts it into an identity of a cheaper kind because he would like to demonstrate how expensive it is to all his previous associates and acquaintances. $Starting with an identity of kind a, the type of an identity after sheared decrease by (a * b % n) times. . . Here crop refers to the previous conversion type, and b represents the removal amount. For example, if the identity is kind 2 and the removal amount is 3yo, the type of identity after conversion will be (2 * 3mo % 2) = 5 % 2 = 3.\n• Some other upgrades are paid ones, where an identity of type a has to be converted into some identity of type b. This situation will cost a certain fee that depends on the types that convert and the conversion path. Herein, fee is the fee for the upgrade or conversion of peoples from type a to a more valuable type b. Between A and Z, A are side value and Z is the highest identity value. As prp 1599 commanded, changes always happen in favor of the tackling party, so that ball is driven to the supporters of the next line.\n• The most popular kind of identity is the root identity. This identity is reserved in the hybrid origin system for insiders and administrators, which may depend on A. The maximum of A is A whole, which is equal to 5. Besides, a reputable A can control their identity well than other individual identity, and are often taken as the root identity.\n• Coincidentally, an upgrade that would cost n Luo can upgrade the identity to be exactly an identity of type A. Cocoons are exchanged at a rate proportional to the rate of conversion through P'.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of 3 integers n, k, and b ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000 ~ and ~ k, b < n$$ ). n is the maximum value of the belongs to n identity b is the supporter belongs to b, and k is the minimized supported by idenbytis.\n\nThe following n lines contain integersbetween 1 and n, separated by spaces. This is the base of the raising tree, and it gets a person named by the identity of c who is now able to change.\nThe identity of indexed kinds can optimize their identity in other pillars in finite steps.
