Each time, the division rules for strings can differ.\n\n#### Question Specification:\n\nStarting from sequence i (i=1,2,3,4), calculate and sort the answer strings after being divided multiple times according to the following questions:\nFor i={2,4}, 2,4.\nEach time, there is only one division rule defined.\nWe can pick a character from the previous sequence as the division, then the new sequence is divided into the previous sequence at this character.\n\n#### Example Divergent Rule:\n\nString 1 and string 3: Divide according to the last place.\nSequence 1={1 2 0 6 0 0 8}   Sequence 3={3 0 4 1}\nString 2 and string 4: Divide according to the third place.\nSequence 2={0 1 2 0 0 0}   Sequence 4={1 2 0 0 4 5 6}\n\n#### Question:\nInput your sequences separately.\nSequence 1: [Input1]\nSequence 2: [Input2]\nSequence 3: [Input3]\nSequence 4: [Input4]\nConsider string 2 and string 4, write below the answer string in the order compared with other string. The content should be the same as the previous sequence.\nAnswer: [Answer]",
