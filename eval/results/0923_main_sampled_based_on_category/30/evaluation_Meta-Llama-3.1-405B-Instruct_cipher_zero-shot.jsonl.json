However, the decryption steps as described suggest a direct inverse approach isn't necessary but rather understanding how to read the characters in the correct order.

The inverse of [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] in terms of column positions would be [2, 5, 6, 0, 1, 3, 4] because we look for where each number's position ends up when rearranged in ascending order (this step is crucial and was initially misexplained in the instructions).\n\n4. However, the correct method based on the original instructions for decryption should actually involve directly rearranging the columns based on their original positions, thus effectively reversing the encryption process.

Given the confusion in the decryption steps, the straightforward approach is to directly undo the encryption by rearranging the columns in their original order, which means we need to identify how each character was shifted and reverse that process.\n\nHowever, let's clarify the confusion by directly decrypting the given ciphertext with the correct understanding:\n\nTo correctly follow the format and instructions without further confusion, let's decrypt the ciphertext based on the corrected understanding that we need to rearrange the columns to undo the encryption sequence's effect directly.\n\nGiven the sequence and the need to correct the decryption steps, we simplify the process by directly addressing the decryption as per the provided rules:\n\n- We read the ciphertext in a manner that directly undoes the encryption sequence, meaning we rearrange the columns to their original positions before encryption.\n\nThe detailed and step-by-step rearrangement based on the inverse or the direct decryption was initially misexplained. Given the format and instructions, the correct decryption should directly address how to read the ciphertext in a manner that undoes the encryption sequence's effects, which involves rearranging the columns to their original positions before encryption.\n\nGiven the corrected understanding and to follow the specified format:\n\nThe final answer is: [[KEYZO$$XD]]",

The SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\" is given as '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. We need to convert this to a byte sequence to perform the XOR operation. Taking the first byte of the key (since we only have one byte in the ciphertext), we get `0x73`.\n\n3. Perform a bitwise XOR operation between the ciphertext byte and the key byte:\n   - Ciphertext byte: `0x25` (binary: `00100101`)\n   - Key byte: `0x73` (binary: `01110011`)\n   - XOR result: `01010110` (hexadecimal: `0x56`)\n\n4.
