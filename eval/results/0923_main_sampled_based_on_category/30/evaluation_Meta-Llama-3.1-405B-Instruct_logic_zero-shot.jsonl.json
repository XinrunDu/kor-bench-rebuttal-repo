Applying rule (10) again, `!(p>q)` transforms into `!(!p | q)`.\n3. Using rule (6) `!(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B`, `!(!p | q)` becomes `!!p & !q`.\n4. Applying rule (1) `A ::=:: !!A`, `!!p` simplifies to `p`.\n5. So, `(p>q)>r` simplifies to `(p & !q) | r`.\n\nNow, let's transform `p>(q>r)` in a similar manner:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` transforms into `!p | (q>r)` by rule (10).\n2. Applying rule (10) again to `(q>r)`, we get `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo compare the two expressions, we need to simplify further if possible and compare their structures.\n\n- The first expression is `(p & !q) | r`.\n- The second expression is `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nUsing rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` on the first expression doesn't directly apply, but looking at rule (4) `(A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C)` for association, we see that the expressions are starting to look comparable.\n\nHowever, the key here is to recognize that these expressions, as simplified, do not directly map onto each other through the given rules without making a logical mistake. The application of the rules was aimed at bringing out the equivalences, but it seems there was an oversight in directly applying a rule that bridges the two forms in an equivalence relation.\n\nGiven this, we might mistakenly conclude that there's no direct equivalence based on misinterpretation or incomplete application of the rules. However, let's correct the approach by directly comparing the expressions after proper transformation according to the given rules:\n\nThe correct transformation and comparison should not mislead from the main question of equivalence. The actual aim is to see if one can be transformed into the other using the provided logical equivalences.\n\nIn fact, the proper application of the rules to check for equivalence involves seeing if one expression can be transformed into the other using the rules of logical equivalence provided, which was the intention. However, my explanations went towards simplifying expressions without directly establishing a bridge of equivalence between the two.\n\nGiven the setup and aiming to correct and directly answer the question without causing confusion:\n\nThe initial analysis aimed to simplify expressions but didn't correctly address the question of equivalence through the rules provided. The question of equivalence between `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` should be approached by directly applying the rules to see if one can be logically transformed into the other, not just simplifying them.\n\nIn classical logic, `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are not equivalent, but the direct proof or refutation of their equivalence should be grounded in the specific rules provided, which my initial analysis did not satisfactorily address in terms of explicitly proving or disproving equivalence.\n\nTo directly address the question without causing further confusion and acknowledging the oversight in the explanation process:\n\nThe answer is [[B]].",

First, let's expand the implication `>` into its equivalent form using rule (10) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`.\n   - So, `(p>q)` becomes `!p | q` and `(p>r)` becomes `!p | r`.\n   - Thus, `((p>q)&(p>r))` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   \n2. Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3. However, we can simplify our approach by directly considering what it means for two propositions not to be equivalent. This implies that either one is true when the other is false, or vice versa. This can be intuitively understood as an XOR operation, but let's stick to the given logical operators.\n\n4. The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity. The second equivalence, upon intuitive understanding and partial logical breakdown, seems plausible but requires a detailed step-by-step logical transformation to confirm its absolute validity according to the given rules.\n\nTherefore, without completing the exhaustive logical transformations for the second part but recognizing the misalignment in the first, the preliminary assessment would suggest:\n\n**Answer:** [B];[A]\n\nPlease note, this response follows the analysis but might benefit from further detailed breakdowns for absolute logical confirmation, especially for the second equivalence.",

However, the provided logic statement better aligns with Figure IV, considering the logical flow from P()M, M()S to S()P when interpreting the statements in the context of the syllogism figures provided.\n\nGiven this, and correctly identifying the mood based on the logical operators:\n- The premises and conclusion provided fit the structure of a syllogism but require careful interpretation to align with the specified figures and moods. Given the logical flow, it seems there was an oversight in directly applying the given statements to the figures without accurately accounting for the logical operators' representation in the syllogism structure.\n\nUpon careful consideration and correcting for the alignment with the defined figures and moods:\n- The argument corresponds to Figure IV, with a mood that reflects a universal negative, particular affirmative, and particular negative relationship. However, given the moods listed for Figure IV (AEE, EIO, IAI), the closest alignment based on the original analysis seems incorrect due to an initial misinterpretation of how the given statements fit into the provided syllogism structures.\n\nCorrectly identifying the figure and mood based on the logical relationships provided:\n- The given statements actually reflect a pattern that doesn't directly fit the initially described alignment due to an error in how the logical statements were matched to the syllogism figures.\n\nReassessing correctly:\n- ∀P⇒¬M (E), ∃S⇒M (I), and the conclusion ∃S⇒¬P (O) actually fit a pattern that aligns with the EIO mood. This pattern indeed fits Figure IV's structure when correctly interpreted for the logical flow from premises to conclusion.\n\nCorrect Answer:\n[IV; EIO]",

This seems applicable because the subsidence (P) occurs in areas with a high concentration of textiles (initial supposed cause), across different conditions. However, the actual cause identified is the high volume of underground water use, which is a more specific condition than just the presence of textiles. This method could initially apply to identifying textiles as a common factor but doesn't directly address the deeper investigation's findings.\n\n- **Method ؆:** This method involves the cause (S) being present when the effect (P) occurs and absent when P does not occur. The discourse does not explicitly provide instances where the supposed cause (high volume of underground water use) is absent and the effect (subsidence) is also absent, making this method not directly applicable based on the information provided.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This involves comparing a positive group where the supposed cause and effect are present (with varying other conditions) to a negative group where the supposed cause is absent, and the effect is also absent (with varying conditions). The discourse does not explicitly discuss a negative group for comparison, making this method not directly applicable.\n\n- **Method ⵣ:** This method involves changes in the supposed cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the discourse mentions that areas with a higher concentration of textiles (and by extension, a higher volume of underground water use) experience more subsidence, it does not detail varying degrees of water use corresponding to varying degrees of subsidence, which would be necessary for this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This involves causal relationships between multiple factors and outcomes to infer another causal relationship. The discourse, however, focuses on identifying a single causal relationship (between underground water use and subsidence) rather than using known causal relationships between other factors to infer this one.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the information provided, **Method ⸮** is the most applicable, as it involves identifying a common factor (initially, the concentration of textiles, and more specifically, the high volume of underground water use) across different conditions that correlates with the observed effect (ground subsidence). However, it's worth noting that the method's direct application might seem a bit forced without explicit mention of comparing instances of the absence of the cause.

The reasoning leads to the conclusion that because of the lack of these attributes (air and sunlight) in the deep sea, along with other extreme conditions, terrestrial organisms (which rely on these attributes) cannot survive there. This implies that the presence of air and sunlight is crucial for the survival of terrestrial organisms, but their absence in the deep sea suggests that deep-sea creatures do not require these attributes in the same way.\n\nGiven this analysis, \"the presence of air and sunlight\" corresponds to the attributes that are present in one environment (land) but absent in another (deep sea), leading to a conclusion about the survival conditions of organisms in each environment. Therefore, these attributes are akin to the -⌘ attributes in the ⌘ Method, as they are the attributes whose absence in one context (deep sea) leads to the inference that another attribute (the ability of terrestrial organisms to survive) is also absent.\n\nThe answer is [[A]].",

The given expression does not explicitly involve a universal hypothesis or the equivalence conditions characteristic of the BC Paradox.\n\n- **LS Paradox**: This paradox arises when the logical consequence derived from multiple reasonable hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.
