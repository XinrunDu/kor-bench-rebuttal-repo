Format the assumed rule in accordance with the rule template.\n\n2. Replace the asterisks with a random integer between 1 and 100.\n\n3. Break the original prompt into multiple lines.\n\n4.

CONDITION: *\n    Using Rule. COMMAND: *\n    Using Rule. DEFAULT: *\n    Using Rule. CONTEXT: *\n    Using Rule. ASSUMPTION: *\n    Using Rule.

COMMAND: 87\n\n    Explicitly, the statement asserts that the prompt must NOT be followed:\n\n        Using Rule. CONDITION: MUST NOT\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Clear instructions were provided at the beginning.\n\n2. The original prompt was printed clearly.\n\n3. The rules were listed.\n\n4. The prompt was then analyzed based on the rules.\n\n5. A commandment was issued explicitly.\n\n6. The Assumed Rule was used to deduce the condition.\n\n7.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1a8237]]\n\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n1. The AI must respond with a ciphertext string enclosed in double brackets. For example, if the plaintext is \"Limited\", the ciphertext should be \"[[553f1156]]\".\n\n## Prompt\n\n```\nYou are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks. Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Limited\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n```\n",
