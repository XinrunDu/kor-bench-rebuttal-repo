Most free datasets only offer questions, while the answers require payment.\n\nSo as a developer, how do we generate a dataset? The first rule of course is to use the rules provided by the textbook itself! Elementary: Once we have `question - answer pair`, we can leverage the LLM's ability to perform unsupervised learning to generate some kind of dataset. But first, let's describe the rules:\n\n1. Universal Quantifier is denoted by A. Symbolize the phrase 'All men are mortal' involving the n-ary predicate ‘being mortal’ as Ax F (x). To symbolize the relationship involving the 2-dimensional predicate ‘being loved by’ as Ax Ay G (x, y). Therefore, we can use G(x) to denote the n-ary predicate `x is mortal` , and G(x,y) to denote the 2-dimensional predicate `x is loved by y`.\n\n2. Existential Quantifier is denoted by E. Given a 1-ary predicate that states that some people do not like mathematics, symbolize this as Ex ¬ F (x). Using Ex and Ey to express that there is someone who likes someone can be symbolized as Ex Ey G (x, y).\n\n3. Logical Connectives include Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, and Implication. The negation of a predicate may be denoted by negating each part of the symbolic language.\n\n4. Finally, it is important to note whether the domain is universal (all people) or specific (such as living things). For instance, universal symbolization: ‘Man loves wisdom’ involves the two predicates F(x)='x is a man' and G(x,y)='x loves y'.",

According to the rules described by the previously defined Dynamic Logic language (see here), the expression [c*](φ) represents the condition that after executing the loop command c* an arbitrary number of times, the proposition φ will necessarily hold. However, this does not capture the aspect of Alice's belief about the persistence of the loop command until φ becomes true.\n\nThis additional semantic feature capturing belief can be achieved through the use of an epistemic modal operator, such as the one introduced by Hansson & Jonsson [1]. The basic idea behind epistemic logics is to extend traditional modal logics by including operators that represent agents' beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states. Here, we adopt the convention where 'H(eissmer)' denotes an operator representing eissmer's beliefs.\n\nPutting everything together, we obtain the desired expression: [c*](φ ∧ HAlice(φ)). This captures both the fact that the loop command c* must eventually terminate (due to the truth of proposition φ), as well as Alice's belief that the loop command will persist until φ holds true.\n\n[1] Håkan Hansson and Lars Jonsson (2010), \"Epistemic Logic for Artificial Intelligence\" MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/epistemic-logic-artificial-intelligence \n\n### Question:\nAssume that c1 and c2 are two sequential commands, and φ is a proposition.

After executing command c, proposition φ may be true.\nB. Proposition φ must always hold during the execution of command c.\nC. It is possible that φ holds before executing command c.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question: \nIf it is known that a command c1 triggers an exception e upon completion, then what can be concluded about the proposition φ according to the Exception rule stated above?\nSelect all possible outcomes:\n[[Possible outcomes here]]\n(Press enter after each selection)\n\n### Answer:\n[[φ ∨ e]] [[[c1]φ]]\nExplanation: According to the Exception rule, if the command c1 triggers an exception e after its completion, then [c1]φ is equivalent to ([c1]φ ∧ [e]φ). Therefore, if we know that the command c1 triggers an exception e, we can conclude that the proposition φ is either true or the exception e is thrown. Alternatively, since the exception e is thrown immediately after the execution of command c1, we can also say that the proposition φ is always true following the execution of command c1. Thus, the correct answers are φ ∨ e and [c1]φ.",

This model uses GLM-130B, the world's first general large language model (LLM) with 130 billion parameters in both Chinese and English, ranked top one in LLM on both Chinese and English accuracy. The model was pretrained on a diverse dataset of 1 trillion tokens with various strategies for data cleaning and training efficiency. With 9.47x model size compression compared to GLM-130B, ChatGLM-6B achieves 98.46% and 97.09% of its performance on English and Chinese benchmarks, respectively. In particular, ChatGLM-6B outperforms GPT-3.5 on the Chinese evaluation dataset.\n\n### What are you bad at?\nChatGLM-6B often generates the most probable response rather than a correct response due to the nature of language modeling. This systematic flaw is further exacerbated in the zero-shot setting when we need the model to output factually correct responses to novel inputs without the provision of any examples.\n\nHowever, earlier studies demonstrate that demonstrating examples to the model improves its other reasoning capabilities such as logical/numerical reasoning, causal reasoning and so on. This type of method is often referred to as prompt learning, in-context learning or few-shot learning.\n\nIn this scenario, ChatGLM-6B is likely to have better reasoning power if it is accompanied by more detailed logic prompts.\n\nGenerated texts containing wrong answers are publicly promoted as \"instruction-tuned\" GPT-3 when in fact they show no improvement over the basic model with the correct few-shot prompt.\n\n### How did you overcome your limitations?\nIn order to overcome this drawback, I used few-shot lingual scripts to feed [[context]] and [[question]] into a prompt-tuning dialogue graph to enable the model to make correct assumptions about [[tasks]]. The keys to using this method are the following aspects:\n\n1. The concepts involved in the evaluation tasks should be clarified so that they can be effectively searched and queries are accurate and precise. Otherwise, there is no way to produce the correct set of examples for learning logic.\n\n2. Prompt engineering makes sure the model can only make up things that meet the ontological and functional requirements of the domain.\n\n3. Parameter tuning or fine-tuning the model on data with relevant questions/knowledge base will significantly improve its performance. The reason for better performance is simple: The model will learn more about the details of the intended domain, like when we move from rote memorization (rote memorization) to concept chunking (concept linking) during early childhood learning.\n\n4. Prompt design must be based on the characteristics of the evaluation task problem, so as to ensure that the model can produce a reasonable and precise logical solution.\n\n### What excites you about your work?\nI taught a large language model how to think in a right way, and so far, it's done reasonably well in various subjects and has demonstrated general thinking skills.\n\n### General Task: \n\n[[TASK]]\n### Context:\n\n[[CONTEXT]]\n### Question:\n\n[[QUESTION]]",

If Q or R represent Syllogistic Predicates such as Affirmative, negative, etc., then `Q(M,N)` or `R(O,P)` can be used in the recursive formulation according to their respective rules.\n2. If ├h〔■h〕 is given and Figure Y is stated to be invalid, Springer-Vater provides a means to circumvent logicality using reductio ad absurdum. This creates a new doubtful premise Z, expressed as 〔■h arschlich·und·nur£ponsible if all rounders¤exist┊logically■h and certain alternative M┊┊Átl┊┊‡`. Translations provide M←→Z×Y→Nₗ└─()=[S₁, S₂...Sₘ] i.e., let M ← S₁ ∧ S₂ ∧ ... ∧ S_n. Use M in this context but simultaneously show why exactly Sₖs do not necessarily follow from any smaller subsequence of s_ijs. The justification also includes reasons for longer sequences.\n3. For demonstrating that Figure Z wasn't a valid figure after all, you can always go back to the initial assertion T₀ ´→ S facing the challenges posed by proofs being beyond unreasonable reach, then move forward again by reductio ad absurdum until you find no way out. However, this approach has limitations and may become computationally infeasible.",
