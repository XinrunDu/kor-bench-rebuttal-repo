So, after multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2×(A+4)×2=2Ba. Then, we know that since 2×(A+4)x=(2*A+8)x therefore we can simplify the equation to (2A+8)×4=Ba. Next, because B is also involved as part of the equation, we need to find some way to \"get rid of\" B from one side of the equation, or else our expression for a won't look so nice! To do this, we could try dividing both sides by B, which gives us (2A+8)/B=a. Finally, all we need to do now is factor out the 'a' from one of the sides, leaving us with just the fraction on the left-hand side. We can do this by multiplying both sides again by B, giving us (2AB+8B)a=Ba.\n### Answer:\n[[2/(A+2)]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (1○2)○4.  \n### Answer:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n[*] --> 2\n[*] --> 4\n2 --> 16\n2 --> [*]\n4 --> 16\n4 --> [*]\n16 --> [*]\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a=3, b=-7, f(K)=K○K.
