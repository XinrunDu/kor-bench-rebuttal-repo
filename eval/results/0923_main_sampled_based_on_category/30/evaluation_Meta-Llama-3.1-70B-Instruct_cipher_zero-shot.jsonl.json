U is 85 (0x55 in hex) and H is 72 (0x48 in hex).\n\n   U -> 85 (0x55 in hex)\n   H -> 72 (0x48 in hex)\n\n2. Encrypt the bytes using the provided key with XOR operation.\n   Use the key '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3' to encrypt the bytes.\n\n   Key: 73ef2a4e dd7a7fbf 07fd5f6f af99674d c0c25a02 5fd74c22 1f4c3584 9e5c0fb3 \n   Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n           16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n   U  (55): \n       U (55) ^ 73 -> c8 \n       H  (48): \n       H (48) ^ ef -> b7\n   Encrypted bytes: \n       c8 b7\n\n3.
