according to Basic Equivalence (10):\n```markdown\n(p>q) ::=:: !p | q\n(p>r) ::=:: !p | r\n```\nThen, using the conjunction (AND), we rewrite the left-hand side:\n```markdown\n((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n```\nUsing Basic Equivalence (5), we simplify it further to get the desired format:\n```markdown\n(!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: (!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r)\n```\nSimplifying using Basic Equivalences (2), (3), and removing duplicate `!p`, it becomes:\n```markdown\n(!p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n```\nNow we partially simplify the right side of the given equivalence using the rule `A > B ::=:: !A | B`:\n```markdown\n(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !p | q | r\n```\nBy understanding De Morgan's Law, we get:\n```markdown\n!(q&r) ::=:: !q | !r\n```\nBut applying De Morgan's Law and (thus resultant modification) to transformation on the (given) right side, gives:\n```markdown\n!(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !( !p | (q|r) ) \n(!p > (q|r)) becomes \n!( !p | q | r ) ::= (!(!p)) &

Initialization:\n    - S0 is an empty set.\n    - S1 is the set of all simple disjunctive clauses: {(¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q), (q)}.\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n    - Since S0 is an empty set, there are no resolutions between S0 and S1.\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n    - No resolution can be performed on single-literal clause (q).\n    - Resolve (¬p ∨ q) and (p ∨ q): dispel((¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = q ∨ q, which simplifies to q. q is already in S1, so we do nothing.\n    - For other pairs, no resolution is possible.\n\n4. Check S2:\n    - Since S2 is empty and contains no new elements, we cannot conclude it's plausible. \n    - Add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2 and return to step b.\n    We now enter another cycle.\n    S1 = {(¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q), (q)} will keep same in any further cycles as one of those may become the disjunct of other, but we will arrive at single value. Therefore it will terminate taking value of the only disjunct set. i.e {q}\n\nTherefore in the next cycle output from S1 must give resolution with 0. Hence comes the actionable object S1 can take now:\n- From step b:\n    - Resolve ¿p ∨ q? and ¿p ∨ q?: dispel( (¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = ¿¬p ∨ p ∨ q ∨ q? -> ¡Not Specific!.\n    - Resolve ¿p ∨ q? and q: No

The passage uses metaphors (\"Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess\", \"the Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\") to argue for the truth of the topic (\"How to deal with the enemy's huge apparatus\"). This aligns with the Metaph+ Method, which uses metaphors to support an argument.\n2.  The passage also presents separate cases (\"Sun Wukong's battle with the Iron Fan Princess\" and \"the Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\") to illustrate the point and prove its truthfulness under various conditions. This corresponds to the Case+ Method, which involves discussing each case separately to prove a proposition's validity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are [[C/D]].",
