The player's task is to arrange black and white pieces on the chessboard one at a time. Whoever captures more pieces wins. The black pieces, of course, represent the protagonist, and white pieces represent the opponent. The game has no real point or purpose; it depends purely on individual ability. There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun. This ELISP code abstracts this meaning into a common language: if something does not belong to you, then try to seize it. Later it was discovered that many hackers and gamers were accustomed to stealing others' substances and creating chaos.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",
