But remember, attempting the challenge without any assistance will allow you to retain the information more effectively!\n\nWhat will the output be in the console for each of these statements?\n```\nconst circle = {\n  radius: 3,\n  diameter() {\n    return this.radius * 2;\n  },\n  circumference() {\n    return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;\n  },\n};\n\nconsole.log(circle);\n// Output: {radius: 3, diameter: ƒ, circumference: ƒ}\n\nconsole.log(circle.diameter());\n// Output: 6\n\nconsole.log(circle.circumference());\n// Output: 18.84955592153876\n```\n```\nconst person = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 25,\n  info() {\n    return `My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;\n  },\n  introduction() {\n    return `Hello! ${this.info()}`;\n  },\n};\n\nconsole.log(person.introduction());\n// Output: Hello! My name is John and I am 25 years old.\n```\n```\nfunction greet(name) {\n  console.log(`Hello ${this.name} ${name}!`);\n}\n\nconst jane = { name: 'Jane' };\nconst greetJane = greet.bind(jane);\n\ngreetJane('Doe');\n// Output: Hello Jane Doe!\n\nconst john = { name: 'John' };\nconst greetJohn = greet.bind(john);\n\ngreetJohn('Doe');\n// Output: Hello John Doe!\n```\nPerfect! You've displayed a deep understanding of how the \"this\" keyword can be used within different contexts in JavaScript. Using objects, arrow functions, and the 'bind' method to manipulate the context of \"this\", you've demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript's nuances. Keep up the amazing work!",

Solomon's expression is A¥B=15. Sokina, meanwhile, has an expression as follows: A¥A<5 and B¥3>7. Every term in these expressions may either be a positive integer or a positive real number. Find the value of A and B, given that both individuals follow the same definition for the operation symbol \"¥\", which is presented above.\nPlease ensure your answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Hint:\nBoth persons have well-defined expressions with certain properties. One way to find the individual values of terms in such problems is to use algebraic manipulation techniques, utilizing the given properties, to simplify the expressions until they can be solved analytically.\nPlease ensure your answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[3,4]]\n\n### Question:\nAn unknown person has an equation with three variables: A, B and C satisfying A¥A<1000 and B¥B=360 while C£3=153\nHere the £ operation is as follows: E£F=E+F-E×F. Find each variable X, where X may assume different values (E and F can be any positive integer or real number).\nPlease ensure your answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Hint:\nBy manipulating the expressions algebraically by using their properties like E + F = F + E and so forth, we can substitute various parts of the second expression into the first expression. This simplification can lead to individual values of each variable being obtained analytically.\nPlease ensure your answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[6,1.5,4.5]]\n\n### Question:\nA function f is defined as f(x)=100¡x, where 100ñx represents 100 ÷ x and x may be any positive integer or real number. Find f(x)(correct to two decimal places), when x=63*4²-99+3+5³.\nInput the answer in numerical form and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Hint:\nThe question introduces a new binary operation '¡', which is intended to emulate the division operation but with various constraints. We need to apply understanding of basic arithmetic principles such as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) to arrive at the correct result.\nPlease ensure your argument is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[your argument]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[0.76]]\n\n### Question:\nAndrew and Susan are best friends with each other since kindergarten. Andrew's mother gave him her old typewriter for his birthday, while Susan's mother bought her a smartphone with virtually unlimited data plan. Both of them are equally tech-savvy but prefer different platforms: PC and Android OS vs Mac and iOS respectively. Great interest arose among other students about who will use their devices efficiently: They would bet coins about this issue everyday. Each time someone guesses right gets paid double by someone who guessed wrong. On average how much money did the two get after three days provided that number of bettors does not affect payoff rate? Assume coin flipping outcomes follow independent uniform distribution $Bernoulli(0.5)$\nInput the answer in numerical form and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Hint:\nThis involves both probability distribution models and simple sea",
