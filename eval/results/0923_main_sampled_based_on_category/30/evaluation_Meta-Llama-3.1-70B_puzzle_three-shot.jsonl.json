In crosswords, each square may be filled with either a letter or left blank. In a game, one player draws a grid and places Xs and Os anywhere in it. Then they select a letter and put it in any square. The second player tries to guess the location of Xs and Os. If they guess incorrectly, they put the letter in a square and it becomes filled. If they guess correctly, they may put another letter in an adjacent square.\n\n## Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n6.There are some special rules:\n\n-If there is no letter in a row or column, it indicates that all the grids in the corresponding direction are empty, not separated by 0, and different letters do not cross, e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0\nindicates that the row of x cannot be filled with any letter.\n-If there is already a letter in a row or column, the rest of the grids in the corresponding direction are all empty, not separated by 0, and no crossing is possible. e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 A\nindicates that the rest of the grids in the row and column where A is located are all empty and not 0.\n7.If a square overlaps with multiple letters, it is necessary to distinguish whether the overlapped letters are all 0s or whether they are filled with the same letter. e.g.\nA X X X 0\nX 0 X 0 X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 X 0 A\nX 0 0 0 0\nis legal whereas\nA X X X 0\nX 0 X 0 X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 X 0 B\nX 0 0 0 0\nis not because A and B do not cross but they do not share the same square which results in a conflict.\n8.There can only be one solution for each puzzle problem. For instance, the following two problems have the same solution:\nX X X\nX X X\nX X X\nacross:ABC ACB BCA\ndown:BCA CAB ACB\nversus\nX X X\nX X X\nX X X\nacross:AAA BBB CCC\ndown:DDD EEE FFF\n9.Some",
