To determine the type of the given formulas (1) and (2), we need to understand their subformulas and logical structures in relation to the components of the Truth Formula.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the type of formula (1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\nFormulas (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) forms a level C formula, because it is a formula with nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula, which is (p1||p2).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the type of formula (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\nSimilarly, formula (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 also forms a level C formula for the same reason as in step 2. It has a nested logical connective (=::>) containing two Level A formulas, p1 and p2.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new given information\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are components of a Truth Formula, this must mean both (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) must be truth formulas themselves. \n\n## Step 5: Determine the answer type for each given formula.\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are both truth formulas, and they correspond to formulas (1) and (2), it also means that both (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) and (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 are truth formulas.\n\nThe final answer is [[B];[B]].",

However, there is no q and ¬q in combination (p∧¬q∧¬r) and (¬p∧¬q∧r) respectively. \nSince a paired conjunctive term in principal CNF should correspond to a single hjex or binary digit, the conjunction in principal CNF (p∧¬q∧¬r), and (¬p∧¬q∧r) are entered as p(AND)¬q/store ¬A)  AND ¬q(AND ¬A Store) r \n\n### Answer Format\nOur expression does not fully conform to the principal conjunctive normal form since it does not consider all combinations with q and ¬q.\n\n[[B]]",

Hence, M is the middle term.\n\n### Simplifying the Argument\n\nThe argument is equivalent to:\n\n¬M⇒¬P, ∃S⇒¬M\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\nGiven that the conclusion ¬M⇒¬P corresponds to E (forall antecedent, negated consequent), and the premise ∃S⇒¬M corresponds to O (exists antecedent, negated consequent), the figure is Figure II or Figure IV, because in both figures M is the middle term. However, we will eliminate Figure II, because it must have ∃S⇒¬P or ∀S⇒¬P as its final premise. Hence, our argument must be figure IV.\n\nAdditionally, figure IV introduces ¬P where M is the middle term and uses ∀ (forall) mood. Since our argument involves ∃S in its premise, it corresponds to I (exists antecedent) mood, in the second premise. Thus, our mood is AEO (though it is the fourth valid mood of figure IV).

specified logical rules to the given problem statement about Professor Van Emelen, we analyze the situation based on the provided methods Psi and Commander.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n\n- Professor Van Emelen sends a gift that is a book.\n- The gift is either a book that he has written or edited.\n\nTo apply the analogy rule, we compare the given information with the specified analogical reasoning.\n\n### Application of Psi Method:\n\n- Object A has attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen), and attribute c (is either a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen).\n- Object B has attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen).\n\nBased on the ψ method, since attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are typical of Object A and Object B, we can conclude that:\n\n+ Object B also has attribute c (is either a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen), ∴ (which means therefore) these types of gifts might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n### Choosing the correct Reasoning Method:\n\nBased on the specification that attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are shared characteristics, we can find the existence of + attribute increment λ.\n\n\n\nSo the answer to the question is [[A]] because the reasoning corresponds with the characteristics of the ψ method.",

If x is a positive even number, then x is a natural number.\n   (Correct implication)\n2. So, if x is a natural number, then x is a positive even number.\n   (Incorrectly swapping the antecedent and consequent)\n\nThe reasoning pattern illustrates the CondSwap Method, which is characterized by believing that if P then Q, it is true that if Q then P.",

The original premise ∀x∃yR(x, y) suggests that for every natural number, there exists another natural number that is greater (resulting in no largest natural number), but the erroneous conclusion ∃y∀xR(x, y) implies the existence of a largest natural number.

The premise states \"all Chinese billionaires are Chinese people,\" which can be interpreted as \"All R are P\" where R is \"Chinese Billionaires\" and P is \"Chinese People\". However, the conclusion negates the original subject (\"All Chinese people\"), which is not logically equivalent to the original subject (\"All Chinese billionaires\"). A valid conclusion should either affirm or negate both subjects, maintaining the original relationship.",
