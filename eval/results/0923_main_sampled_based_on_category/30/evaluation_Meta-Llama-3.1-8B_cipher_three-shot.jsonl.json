We have cycled about 5x in the disk since the beginning. To find the spot for which we deserve to cycle by 5, we must multiply by 2, or any period above 10. So C.\nUsing the displacement from the period from the second step. we move the elements from that position by an increment of two and obtain the starting position for the fifth iteration. We roll to the right the characters we save on the field with 0 characters, such as Z, and where the E starts on the first cycle is the starting position of the fifth cycle. We get A.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"KQUQMMJCTZRUEGLTXOMCAHYTUWVRSU\"\nperiod: 5\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\nAssume the text encrypts with plaintext: \"WE BUY DINNER\"\n\nWhat is part of the ciphertext\n\n### Answer\nHTISJOBSATHATEPA",

Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.
