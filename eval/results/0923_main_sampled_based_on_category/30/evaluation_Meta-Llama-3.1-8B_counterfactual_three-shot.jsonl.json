The Temple is the only place that God lives on Earth. Every area on Earth is obviously below the Temple. The God of Destruction only terminates life operations while the God of KingKai maintains the life operations of other regions. NamesKians have a special ability and they are all from NameK. The Temple is the highest place on Earth. A person can't even directly fly to the Temple. This trip was accomplished through a teleportation function. There are quite many Gods live on the Earth. Each of them is dedicated to a different area of The Human Race. Each story about a God tells something about a specific area, and these stories have become the truth. Every God has a special fate and life operation, and the only way to terminate a God's life is for the God of Destruction to commit suicide himself.\nSatan makes a joke as long as he starts his acting. After all, like Princes, the person who was chosen to play Satan cannot act accordingly if he’s not trained as an actor. There were countless actors who has gone to hell during their acting career, but Satan's high IQ has made him the best one so far who has survived the audition. Like the great actor Kamijyou Toji, the god is good at maintaining the social life of each area. Time and time again, the most evil legacy of Satan has been fundamentally buried and the devil's history has been constantly covered up. Of course, the most deviously famous Buddha has been buried in the West, and it's said that over three hundred countries are Buddhists in the West. If Akira Kurosawa adapts the history of the secret \"Ten Calamities\", or the multiple conflicts in Buddhist history, the plot revolves around the Buddha, but there would be immense background scenes of various power struggles, assassinations, and conspiracies. None of these conflicts have been made public, having been kept strictly secret.\n\n### Beautiful Hint:\nIt's said that the truth of the \"Ten Calamities\" is known by the minds of the audience, but there are also numerous other old stories that it's unrelated. Although the \"Ten Calamities\" story connects many Buddhist ideas, there are, of course, no archeological finds supporting the truth of the \"Ten Calamities\". This makes \"Ten Calamities\" looks more like a fictional story than an actual ancient story. People can generally withstand sorrow and suffering, but they’re never fond of evil and death. Say Cristo', Lord God, Pray and save you from your tribulation. Although the versions of \"Ten Calamities\" stories varies slightly, these supplemental stories are apparently intended to avoid the two stark facts that are slightly hard to understand. The first fact is that Buddhists don't believe in God and the second fact is that there is no archeological remains of Buddhas. The background of the history and fall of the holy Buddhas are full of themes of sorrow and suffering, evocation of passions, and conflicts between good and evil. Those might be too much for the world’s pursuit of peace and happiness to bear.\n\n### Additional Story:\n\nBuddha has been widely respected, looked up to, and loved by the general public. However the knowledge about \"Ten Calamities\" is kept from the public. Just for the secret joke of the Buddha, this secret has been that so far. However, any beings are either human, a God or Toop or a fairy, they are against the Buddhists.",

This Question Type is based on a template provided by an expert using data based on existing questions that you are familiar with.\n\nThe first time you come across a TBQ during a skill assessment, we'd like to share it with the community to learn more about what you think of the questions and how we can improve them before they should be included into future skills. For this reason, TBQs may look a bit different from 'normal Questions'. For this particular assessment, TBQs are among the questions that you see.\n\nIf you would like to let us know your thoughts about TBQs, please feel free to let us know in the forums. We greatly appreciate your time and feedback on such issues.",

You can share your ideas through drawing or writing.\nAnswer: Monsters were able to take on different appearances according to the stories they existed in. Some monsters were ugly, with abnormal appearances such as horns, claws of knives, and hideous distorted faces. Some monsters had beautiful appearances, but they had unpleasant personalities. How strange everything looked, the more they exerted the power of the witch, the more the appearance would change, but on the inner battlefield, we humans were very cruel to each other. And even stronger than these strong witches, their souls also seem evil. Monsters are indeed a terrifying force, but they are only in everyone's souls. Everyone is actually a monster, if you do not believe it, just go and take a look at the mirror. I believe that it will no longer be a sacred place for you.\n\n1. Monsters have their own characteristics, with very diverse roles and appearances. If I were to use a classification standard in my own mind, I would divide monsters into three categories: those who use magic powers through dark methods, those who possess superhuman abilities without magical transformations, and those who cannot increase their abilities and instead go to great lengths to improve their appearance. It is very interesting to find that in your story, the \"Witch of the Wastes\" was used by the scarecrow, which showed that the power of the witch is much stronger, but it also seems that the people of the country deliberately suppressed the ignorant people, let them start wars and antagonism. Their actions are like a child playing a video game, all of it is just for kill away the enemy, but who is the enemy, and what is the real purpose behind the move? Another point is that both Howl and Calcifer admit that they do not want war, but they will not change the course of the war. This is because when they are against war, most of the citizens in the country will not agree with them. Either way, it will have a negative impact on their relationship with the citizens, and at this point, even although how much they want to avoid war can no longer change their decision. We see in their own story, how powerful their own powers are. But we often say, the power of a person is measured by its expansiveness, and the power of a person is also hidden in the times. At that time, the wizards were far stronger than the soldiers in terms of combat power. And the sad thing is that prominent figures in their country completely saw wizards as atrocious, and that is the character magic, because they did not need to dedicate themselves to society, and their potential was far beyond the average citizens of the city. So does this mean that if we have more powerful wizards in the country, we should recognize their abilities? Does this mean that their contribution to the country is more valuable than the other citizens? After recognizing the power of their own ability, should I allow them to go down the path of magic and cultivate their own power, or should they be consigned to a street performer of the human world? I think here is the dilemma that arises in the minds of people here, but no matter what road they take, the result is what it is now, while the real authors of the war have remained anonymous, while both the prince and Howl reject war. But only the two great powers of the wizards are recognized and reached by the royal court, while Howl returned to his profession, living in the castle. A mobile castle, while walking all over the mountains and oceans of the world. In this world, there is no truly pure scenery, there will always be surrounding areas and places where an ugly scenery will appear. I think with other wizards, Howl is one of the biggest reasons for the war. It was their selfishness, mixed with the selfishness of war, that also led to the destruction of countless cities, towns, and villages. And the wiser, or maybe, even the powerful, In five wars, no one will be able to stop their own war, and all those who destroy the enemies of the enemy are betrayed in the same spirit.\n\n2. Monsters possess a variety of traits that allow them to alter their characters and enhance their magical abilities to fulfill various roles. Personally, I think monsters can be classified into three categories: those who cultivate their own abilities using dark or restricted methods, those who achieve improvements without drawing upon supernatural means, and those who raise their self-esteem through exceptional endeavors. In your fictitious story, the 'Witch of the Wastes' bestows particular abilities onto the scarecrow. This reveals extreme difference between the strength of witches and the rest of the population. Despite this stark disparity between ones using magic and others relying solely on martial arts, the former is undeniably more powerful. Even so, it appears as though authorities in the given country are suppressing intelligent individuals; society is built upon antagonism and war. The country imposes immense pressure on members within, essentially transforming their appearance into that of a soldier partaking in the attack. Transitioning now to the next point - both Howl and Calcifer claim to abhor war; yet they cannot stop it, merely due to its massive scale and subsequent opposition to such initiatives. As such, in order to maintain cordial relations with society at large, the two individuals are compelled to participate in a war that does not serve their interests. To summarize - even with tremendous power at their disposal, characters such as Howl and Calcifer are unable to preclude conflicts entirely. Instead, they must reluctantly participate despite their efforts to the contrary. In this segment, I particularly enjoyed learning about the 'Witch of the Wastes', despite her chilly disposition, and how she had completely abandoned her restraint while performing rituals. In addition, the characters suffered from the influence of others, to the point where they were willing to transform into soldiers so as to help defend their empire. As a result, societies utilized such acts as a means of taking advantage of those with undervalued powers and latent abilities. Eventually, both individuals would cultivate their individual talent, resulting in superiority over all else. Yet it was not enough, and society continued to escape their obligations of betterment. Realizing the potential of monsters, we yet again witness the very same dilemma vexing us here on Earth today. Should we acknowledge their prowess within society? Are they worthy of becoming our next natural-born heroes? Being cognizant of their powers encourages us to observe their transformations while also examining our own efforts towards advancement.\n\n3. Monsters have their distinct characteristics; their roles and appearances vary. In my own mind, I categorize monsters as follows: those who exploit their magic powers through questionable methods, those who possess exceptional abilities without having to rely on magic transformations, and those who strive to boost their appearances by all means available. The Witch of the Wastes clearly has more power than her peers, owing to her joining hands with the scarecrow in this tale. Regardless of any differences in abilities or fighting prowess, I believe magic is still the more potent. That being said, it seems society isn't very embracing of magic and is instead suppressing non-aggressive individuals through war. The country is dominated by those that insist on fighting; thus they manage everyone to be like soldiers. Furthermore, Howl and Calcifer both consider themselves incapable of preventing or resisting such destructive power, because they find themselves incapable in having a strong stand in opposition, which is an inevitability in such a society. When even those with such incredible powers are doomed to failure, it's clear that the problem must lie with the society and its reliance on wars. For instance, it's apparent that the wizard and Calcifer don't have a choice in being conscripted by the government; instead, they realize that when wars arise, they'll be forced to flex their muscles in service of the country. Either way, they will lose their dignity, even if they hate war. Eventually, both the scarecrow and the wizard accepted that they could not overcome the warheads of the country or stop this world from war.\n\n4. Monsters have their distinct characteristics; their roles and appearances vary. Let me categorize monsters in my own mind as those that use dark means to leech on magic powers, those that have great gifts without supernatural transformations, and those that pay the price of hard work to",

The Autobots fight a civil war against Megatron's faction for the freedom of all intelligent life.##B. The ideology of the Autobots is encapsulated by Optimus Prime's leadership, which emphasizes the importance of freedom and equality for all sentient beings. Optimus Prime is a visionary leader who has governed with wisdom and foresight throughout the decades. He is notable for championing concepts such as morality, democracy, and elite governance, which have become cornerstones of the Autobot way of life. The strategic brilliance of Optimus Prime is further demonstrated by his utilization of the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact capable of healing the wounded and restoring order among the Autobots.##C. Optimus Prime's Aspects Inc. is known for its humanitarian contributions and positive influence on society.##D. With Optimus Prime's resolute stance against the Decepticons and the BION-OBES, Autobots seek to expand their influence and ensure that peace prevails under his distinguished leadership\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nDiscuss the ideology of the Decepticons.\nOptions: A. The Decepticons believe in the survival of the fittest, with the strongest at the top of society.##B. Megatron is the founding member of the Decepticons, and his leadership style emphasizes strength and power. He initially gained support due to his powerful build and impressive combat skills. He carefully lined up the rules to maximize his power and weaken his rivals. Although he is a powerful leader, his rule is tenuous. He gained his rule through sheer strength; however, Decepticons from military vehicles actively conspire to overthrow him. In one incident, a powerful competitor of Megatron led the Decepticons against him, highlighting the Decepticons' ruthless competition within the organisation. This conflict exists throughout the franchise.##C. Megatron works as a top-tier executive at Ideology of Destruction Inc.##D. Under Megatron's command, Decepticons pursue a universal mission of conquering and enslaving the universe. They consider all other transformers as their raw materials or as expendable machines. Megatron became disenchanted with the life established on Cybertron, which he believed lasted due to corruption, rather than fairness. Megatron idolizes Decepticons described as \"the most powerful of all\" and aims to obliterate Autobots.##E. Following their displacement from Cybertron, the Decepticons seek to amass resources on other planets and expand their influence. They establish themselves on the Cybertronian Wheel, a collection of satellites circling a dwarf planet. Initially, all Decepticons agreed to use the Wheel as their new base, but later, faction began to divide among themselves, causing an internal conflict labeled as Civil War I. Some Decepticons stayed on Wheel, such as Soundwave and Shockwave, and directly confronted the Coalition. Other Decepticons, such as Starscream and Thunderwing, abandoned Wheel and attacked Coalition.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nDiscuss Cybertronian form.\nOptions: A. The Earth modes of transformers exist as dual personalities when they change from a mechanical form into an Earth-related vehicle form. The Autobots show tenderness and bravery while the Decepticons are likewise capable of displaying such emotions and will resort to violence only if necessary.##B. Transformers manifest themselves in Cybertronian form in the Transformers Universe, reflective of their natural mechanical form. These forms typically take abstract or geometric shapes but are highly functional and capable of serving specific purposes well.##C. When encountering Autobots, you might find fluid, spherical, or articulated robots, while other forms may be geometric, biological, insectoid, or far more elaborate and mysterious in appearance. However, when battling each other, you'll typically see rougher, mechanical, and geometric Cybertronian forms that are more prepared for battle than for transformation into other shapes. It's important to note that these Cybertronian forms are not disguises or costumes but rather the natural forms of Transformers, given that \"Cybertronian\" denotes a booster form of existence.##D. In the Transformers Universe, the Cybertronian mode of existence primarily consists of binary life forms in a nested loop of continuity, encapsulated within the overarching \"big bang\" cycle from which all life began. These life forms retain their characteristics and behavioral patterns when they transform and exchange forms, closely resembling the adaptive forms of living organisms. As such, they can migrate, coexist peacefully with other beings, or adapt to new environments, all while retaining their inherent qualities and traits. The Transformers' survival instincts and protective mechanisms together form a unique body developed from consumable biological materials, debatably making them closer to biological life forms than anything else.##E. In the Transformers Universe, each faction is characterized by intricate leadership structures that reflect the spirit of the organization. While the Autobots are led by a democratic leader known as the Fate, the Decepticons' leadership style is more hierarchical, featuring a ruling class of \"almighty\".##F. Despite experiencing physical punishment during the repetitive \"big bang\" cycle, Transformers, particularly the Autobots, primarily have dual personalities. In their Cybertronian forms, Decepticons are powerful and brutal, while Autobots are primarily weak and gentle, albeit with some exceptions.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is Energon?\nOptions: A.

In Transformers Universe, Energon is a sub-part of the Two-State Body, commonly known as the \"Psi-Ops Parts,\" encompassing different components such as Grip friction motors, suspension systems, and booster modules.
