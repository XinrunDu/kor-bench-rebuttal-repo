The overall time taken for this process is the minimum of the times required for these steps, where the time taken for step one is $Y$ and that for step two is $Z$. Figure out the minimum time in terms of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimum time will be $Y$ if $Z < X < 3Y$.\nIt will be $Z$ if $3Y < Z < 2X$.\nSince $Z < 2X$, it will be $X$ if $2X < Z$.\n\nNASA scientists frequently measure the visual subliminal perception (VSP) while performing experiments.

Based on my answer explanation, I have observed some common problems that may occur.\nWhen faced with the same problem, you might also encounter similar issues and wonder how to deal with them. From my perspective, here are some strategies that you could consider:\n**1. Practice**. Most inclusive solutions involve extensive practice. Try various combinations yourself to hone your problem-solving skills.\n**2. Break down the problem**. Whenever facing a complex problem, it's helpful to divide it into smaller steps. This can make it easier to grasp and work on each step independently.\n**3. Guide and ask**. If you're still unsure of how to tackle specific problems, consider seeking help from others who may have faced similar challenges. Sharing and learning from their experiences can provide additional insights and strategies.\n\nWith this advice, you'll be better equipped to handle these types of puzzles, and theoretically, there shouldn't be any ongoing problems to be solved. I'll update this portion if additional issues arise in the future.\n\nDo you want me to assist fostering a sound experience by answering queries regarding this content?",
