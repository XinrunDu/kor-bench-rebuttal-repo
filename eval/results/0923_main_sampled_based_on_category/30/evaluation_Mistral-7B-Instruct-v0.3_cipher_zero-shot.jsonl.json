Use reversed_alphabet for reverse mapping.\n         - For example, finding the position of T in standard_alphabet (index 20), replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet (index 20) Z.\n      2. Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order.\n         - For example, if the obtained letter is Z, it gets mapped to D (by moving 4 positions forward).\n      3. Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet.\n         - For instance, since D is the obtained letter at this step, it gets mapped to J (as J is the letter in the same position as D in the substitution_alphabet).\n   b.

If the key is shorter than the plaintext, repeat the key. In this case, we pair H with A, P with A, N with A, H with A, G with A, F with A, O with A, Z with A, M with A, R with A. This leads to the repetition of the plaintext letter A.\n- For each given ciphertext character c:\n    - Find the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter paired with it. If the key letter is H, mark the choice AB: NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM\n    - Find the position of c in the cipher alphabet and reduce it to the plaintext letter using the same position in the standard alphabet.\n    - Since the given ciphertext is a single character (\"A\"), the position of \"A\" in the [AB] cipher alphabet (AB: NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM) is the third character (position 3), which gives us the plaintext letter N based on the corresponding position in the standard alphabet.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is [[S]].

The given ciphertext contains only one block, so we only need to perform this step for this example.\n\n    Ciphertext: \"9C9C9986938C9784\"\n\n2. **Convert Hex to Bytes**: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes. In this case, the single block is already in bytes format (0x9C, 0x9C, 0x99, 0x86, 0x93, 0x8C, 0x97, 0x84).\n\n3. **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n\n    Key: b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n\n    XOR results:\n    (0x9C + 0x12) ⊕ (0x9C + 0x34) ⊕ (0x99 + 0x56) ⊕ (0x86 + 0x78) ⊕ (0x93 + 0x90) ⊕ (0x8C + 0xAB) ⊕ (0x97 + 0xC6) ⊕ (0x84 + 0xD2)\n\n4. **Inverse Permute**: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit. I won't show the full calculation for brevity, but the resulting bytes are (0x4f, 0xba, 0x20, 0x9a, 0x32, 0x67, 0x42, 0x70).\n\n5. **Substitute**: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n\n    Substitution results: (0x4f, 0x32, 0x20, 0xba, 0x9a, 0x67, 0x42, 0x70)\n\n6. **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n\n    XOR results: (0x4f ⊕ 0x12) ⊕ (0x32 ⊕ 0x34) ⊕ (0x20 ⊕ 0x56) ⊕ (0xba ⊕ 0x78) ⊕ (0x9a ⊕ 0x90) ⊕ (0x67 ⊕ 0xAB) ⊕ (0x42 ⊕ 0xC6) ⊕ (0x70 ⊕ 0xD2)\n\n7. **Convert Bytes to Text**: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n\n    0x4f translates to 'O'\n    0x32 translates to '2'\n    0x20 translates to ' ' (space)\n    0xba translates to ')'\n    0x9a translates to 'j'\n    0x67 translates to 'g'\n    0x42 translates to 'B'\n    0x70 translates to 'p'\n\n8. **Remove Padding**: Remove any padding characters from the end of the decrypted plaintext.

Padding: The plaintext \"VNSEFNGHKUY\" has a length of 9, which is not a multiple of 8 bytes. So, it needs to be padded with null characters (padding = '\\x00'). The padded plaintext would be \"VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\".\n3. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. There will be 2 blocks, each of length 8.\n\nBlock 1: VNSEF\nBlock 2: NGHKUY\\x00 (The padding character is included)\n\n4. Block Encryption: Each block is processed independently.\n\n- Block 1 ->\n\t- Convert Block to Bytes: ASCII encoding of 'V' is 86, 'N' is 78, 'S' is 83, 'E' is 69, 'F' is 70. So, the byte array for Block 1 is `b'524e5345'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key gives us `b'64485c4f50455154'`.\n\t- Substitute: High 4 bits and low 4 bits for each byte are replaced using the S_BOX: `b'3c67fe9c'`.\n\t- Permute: Each byte left-rotated by 1 bit gives us `b'84253761'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again gives us `b'7323653c6e'`.\n\t- Hexadecimal Encoding: Converting these bytes to a hexadecimal string gives us '4EF3C694'.\n\n- Block 2 ->\n\t- Convert Block to Bytes: ASCII encoding of 'N' is 78, 'G' is 71, 'H' is 72, 'K' is 75, 'U' is 75, 'Y' is 79, padding character '\\x00' has ASCII value 0. So, the byte array for Block 2 is `b'4e47484b4b497900'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key gives us `b'6039563a503156563c'`.\n\t- Substitute: High 4 bits and low 4 bits for each byte are replaced using the S_BOX: `b'df35c6f8d'`.\n\t- Permute: Each byte left-rotated by 1 bit gives us `b'9b6f3b78'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again gives us `b'51294e1370'`.\n\t- Hexadecimal Encoding: Converting these bytes to a hexadecimal string gives us '6801DF35'.\n\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext: '4EF3C694' + '6801DF35' = '4EF3C6946801DF35'\n\n6.
