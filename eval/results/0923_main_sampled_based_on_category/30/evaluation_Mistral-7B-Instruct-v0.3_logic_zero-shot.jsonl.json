Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2. Applying the same process for question (2), check if the formulas on both sides can be simplified to become equivalent:\n\n   (2-a) Can we transform !(p=q) into (p|q)&!(p&q)?\n   - According to (2), we know that !(p=q) equals (p|q)&!(p&q).\n\n   (2-b) Is it possible to transform (p|q)&!(p&q) into !(p=q)?\n   - Yes, it is possible. Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid.",

Here's the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p ∨ q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p ∨ ¬q): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q ∨ ¬r): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}.\n\n2.

Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S0 (empty) and (p ∨ q) from S1: dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = p (since we have p from both (p ∨ q) clauses). Add p to S2: S2 = {p}.\n   - Since S0 and S1 have no other simple disjunctive clauses to resolve, move to the next step.\n\n4. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S1 with (p ∨ ¬q) (note that this resolution technique creates two cases for L and L’, which should be considered):\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = ¬q, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = q. Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = p, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = 0.

Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents ∃p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that ∃p1 ∧ p2 → p3.

E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 → p3. For I, S() should be O. However, ∃p1 ∧ ∃p1 → ¬p3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that ∃p1, ¬p1 → p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes ∃p1, ¬p1 ∧ p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[¬p3]; [p1]].
