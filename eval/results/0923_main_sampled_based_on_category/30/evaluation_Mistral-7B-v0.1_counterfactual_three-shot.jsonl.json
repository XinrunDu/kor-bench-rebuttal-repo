It is a city with wide diversity and inclusiveness, where the achievable dream of different groups of people living together in peace comes true. However, within it exists the dark side of human nature represented by Mayor Lion (Joel McHale), who seeks to divide the city through various ways to consolidate and eradicate those resisting him, thus shadowing the overall expectations set out for the city. The overall basic principle of Animal City is; Anyone can be anything, including herbivores and carnivores. In fact, this idea is seen the most in two characters: The lion mayor of the city, and Judy Hopps, the rabbit officer. The lion is of course naturally a carnivore, which means he is traditionally superior to the herbivores, and he grew up in that system. As time went on, however, with the influence of Gazelle, animals such as Nick, and advanced technology, the details of his being had been somewhat altered, and he became more and more dependent on the existence of those different species of animals, such as judging his political career from the security of the herbivores. The opposite is also true: judy, as a small herbivore, is surrounded by species that do not do well most of the time. However, behind these appearances, she believes that the harmony of pluralism and society as a whole is always the priority, and she refused to be judged by her appearance.\nThe idea of animal city starts from that idea and expands outwards; romance, politics, law enforcement and the principle of reconstruction. In terms of politics, the mayor uses traditional discrimination of mammals to divide the mammals under his administration, but Nick and judy directly confront the mayor, standing on the principles of equity and fairness. In terms of law enforcement, the lion is still a carnivore, so he is expected to have innate advantages over judy, but Nick and judy's strength in romantic skills and observational skills such as Nick's backstory (breaking into the DMV to take the permissible test) make their work more effective. In terms of reconstruction, the story of Nick and judy follows the general pattern of good guy vs bad guy as they confront the ruthless sea otter mayor, but another nature also comes out clearly: the law of the jungle, as in the relationship between Nick and his mentor, Yax Or, the Hill Possum of the seed mountain. Overall, Judy hall represents the values of cooperation, tolerance, and conformity, while Nick represents pragmatism and deeds.",

But what will happen if a dragon has to carry a baby human rider together with another human rider? And what if a pair of dragons has to carry a shared baby rider between them?\n1.Indeed, it is possible for the dragon adult to make such a responsible choice. They will continue to carry their usual rider items (or baby riders) when needed and still travel well in relationships, even when the baby rider has grown up and fallen off continuously. \n2.Please emphasize that the capacity of dragon adults and family members to carry huge weights have been confirmed by other dragons in the how to train your dragon cartoon series. \n3.The scene from Gift of the Night Fury shows that the trips head towards more cooperation between the dragon brothers between two dragon species, and some people have already ventured into these more complex shadow play regulations in the day and night. \n4.More amazingly, in Riders of Berk, certain flexible creature dragons might be able to change their flight posture between two riders. \n\n  Please write your final answer about these three points as a single uppercase letter representing the option ((A1), (A2), (A3)) and wrap it in double round brackets and double square brackets, like this: [[((A1), (A2), (A3))]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[((B1), (A2), (B3))]]\n\n### Question:\nThere are no correct answers in (C), please write your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer about (A) and (D) as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer as a single uppercase letter (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer and sort the correct answers (A1...A8) under the option (A), please write your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A1, A2, A3, A6]]\n\n### Question:\nThe bone density of different animal species varies greatly due to differences in diet and exercise, resulting in varying thickness in their \"spine\" and \"rib cage.\" This applies to humans as well. However, the ribs of most dragons, particularly Rompstomp and Catastrophic Quaken, are apparently much thicker than extant tetrapods, vertebrae plus ribs included. This is especially true for dragons weighing 100 tons or more. However, the insides of the rib cages revealed in The Dragon and the Toothless are not thick, even in the front legs. Such inner rib cages are difficult to assemble; they must be carefully crafted to avoid gaps in the ribs or gaps between the vertebrae and the ribs. Does this indicate that dragons don't need so much bone strength? Or does the dragon's \"guts\" not require them to be thick, and the body of a 1,000-pound lizard needs more rigidity than a 1,000-pound dog to hold its body up? Please provide your detailed conclusion in your answer.\n\n### Answer:\nPost:In the first armored car model, it basically has the board and the front wheel to move and carry the body. The front hoop is the main weight loader, the middle wheel is the front weight lever instead of the opposite as well as the suspension part. In the armored vehicle operation, the front hoop part also becomes the main load according to the above operation. \n2.The sharp front wheel of the front board lever can play a role. At the same time, the suspension type plays its own role. Because the 101 Dragon Warrior weighs 1.5 tons, its height is more than 1.5 meters, and a strong standing balance can be maintained independently without long legs. \n1、12/13 years old strength is very informative. At least Viking adults and birds can achieve the same level of effect, and their leap is also weird.\nSince adult vikings can do this, maybe they also have access to this skill.\nConsider the paw to be the foot. \nThe Theory: Dragons should have stronger claws and legs than humans because of their massive weight. It is possible that their bodies are built entirely of biological engineering techniques in displaying their strength and ability, such as the way Gronnucks use Terror Tooth to extend their claws to increase their reach and damage, or the way Hiders' flippers are designed to achieve crude manipulation. \nOne of the main reasons for this is matching the dragons with the human body. If they are not heavier, they won't be able to perform any of its necessary activities for defending against the enemy's blade. Because the claws are facing the front side of their head, human's chest is exposed when trying to look down they will be disappointed. \n2.The later dragons have chosen to completely go with legs that help them to balance themselves and better achieve high-speed jumps. This is also better able to support the dragon's body without crooked knees or arms shortcomings. \nFurthermore, too many body structures were cause of dragons suffering injuries, including their joints, when they reach a certain level of training. In the early cartoons, too many dragons were resuscitated after training them in ultimate strength. This is why they have chosen to completely transform their skeletal structure. This also explains why whip dragons and strange dragons can damage crooks and short-armed dragons. \nWithout any extreme skeletal deformations, the limbs allow it to generate enormous centrifugal force, and it has three-dimensional balance, and it is very difficult to resist any other joint collisions that may result in tissue damage, bones or joints, especially advanced skeletal deformation. \nMoreover, the two positions of the front paw resting on the ground are inclined forward and backward. I can make the skeletal structure more flexible. This will help to reduce the activity and attacks of the limbs to the skeletal system. \nDragons are now also unique in that they are equipped with supernatural being ability to burn excess skeletal structure and bone fragments to heal rake or other limb claws or claws during the swarm. In this way, their pose makes sense and there's no skeletal deformation caused by excessive crushing. In New Berlin, they are at liberty to jump and even in Berk's greatest test, dragon surgery positions are better positioned to increase group activities without any risk of extreme over-concentration.\nThis also led to a relative decline in the usage of hand-to-hand or close-range Dragon style hand-to-hand, causing both human and dragon skillful defenses to focus on self-repelling and deep range using combustible weapons. \nThe time of the ultimate terminator subspecies has disappeared. Nowhere is the skeletal skeleton origins according to any skeleton substance. Even in multiple tough digital model simulated etc. any other skeleton or series of soft tissue is exposed.\n\n### Answer:\nPost:In the first armored car model, it basically has the board and the front wheel to move and carry the body.

Gena is the name of a female dog that loves jumping. Because she enjoys jumping, she is known as the \"aerial queen\". However, when it comes to eating and drinking, Gena prefers to tuck her chin. To satisfy her strange preference, Boss bought a bowl with a high lip for Gena to drink from.\nAfter returning home a couple of times, Gena found that she was not able to drink or even fill the bowl with water due to the height of the bowl. At that time, Boss came to the conclusion that Gena would not be able to drink anymore. But Gena went straight to the bathroom without hesitation to get a towed. She then returned home, filled the bowl with water from the freezer—a testament to her persistent efforts.\nBefore Gena was able to fill the bowl with water, she had difficulty with the alarm even with her tongue. She had several falls in an attempt to fill the bowl with water. After she filled several falls, she realized that she needed to pay more attention to the coo door next time.\n### Question:\nHow can Gena fill the bowl with water in an efficient manner to avoid trouble?\nA Gena could drink water by turning the bowl upside down.

B Gena uses her tail to pick the water jingle and then drinks it. This method is efficient but troublesome. C Gena could fill the water bowl with her paws. This is more efficient and less troublesome than \"turning the bowl upside down\".
