This airplane has 100 seats, 40 of them are on the left side of the plane and 60 of them are on the right side. Customer A likes to buy a two-person's ticket for the HCA-3250, for example, A wants one seat on the left side and one seat on the right side. While Customer B likes to buy four-person's tickets, for example, B wants four seats on the left side or four seats on the right side. Customer C prefers buying eight-person's tickets, for example, C wants eight seats on the left side or eight seats on the right side. The HCA-3250 is not allowed to carry any CPE(class P economy) passengers, only CBA(class B economy), CB?(class B premium), and CPP(class P premium) passengers. For a two-person's tickets, the ticket price for CB?(Class CBA) is six hundred dollars, CB?(Class CBP) six hundred and fifty dollars. For all the other possible four-person's tickets, the ticket price is eight hundred dollars, seven hundred and fifty dollars, or seven hundred dollars, depending on the buy locaion. For a eight-person's tickets, the ticket price for CPP(class CPP) is one thousand two hundred dollars. Let Arrive(XY) be a relation that X arrives in Y (usually X has a ticket to arrive in Y) that relations have three possible value, i.e., {TRUE(T), FALSE(F), and UNKNOWN(U)}. Relation Arrive(A,CBA) represents the relation between Customer A and his Hotels/Check In Arrangements. Declare a relation Arrive(A,CBA) that cannot represent the relationship between Customer A and the hotel in his arrival city, if A does not buy any CB?(two-person's ticket) to the related destination or arrival city. For example, Arrive(A,CBA)=T→(∃b)[(Arrive(A,CBA,4)=T) + (Arrive(A,CPC)=T) + (Arrive(A,CPP)=F)]. Attribute X35X can ranges from 35 to 60.\n\nComput BP, the BP1's details are as follows. First, Customer A's seat matrix set is {{1,2,⋯,5},{{1,2,⋯,5},⋯, {X35X − 5,X35X},⋯,{{X35X − 5,X35X},⋯, {60,60}}}. Count the position at which the two Xs are adjacent, for example, {1},{2,3,...20},{1,2,...35,36},{1,3,...,39,40},...{60,61,...,75,76}. The seat number position, the number of CBA or CB?(B'Type passenger seats) is counted as its value. [ X35X−⁵,1 and X35X−⁵,X35X] can have different values.\n\nDeclare your seating matrix to be A{{1,2},...{X35X−⁵,X35X}} and B{{60,60}}. A and B are both sets with the positions shown in BP1.

It was first released in 2018 and is designed to mimic human conversations coherently.\nChatGPT is powered by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model from OpenAI. GPT-3 is trained on a massive dataset of Internet text and is capable of generating human-like text on a variety of topics. It can also respond to prompts and engage in realistic conversations thanks to its impressive language processing abilities.\n\nChatGPT uses a technique called \"natural language understanding (NLU)\" to interpret and understand human language. This allows it to respond in a way that is both grammatically and semantically correct, and aligns with the overall context and theme of the conversation.\nAdditionally, ChatGPT incorporates \"embedding\" techniques, which help the model understand the semantic meaning and context of words and phrases. This enables it to generate responses that are not only grammatically correct, but also deeply understand the underlying concepts being discussed and draw relevant conclusions.",
