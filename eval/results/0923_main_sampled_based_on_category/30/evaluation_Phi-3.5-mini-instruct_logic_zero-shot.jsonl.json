Now, we symbolize p > r as !p | r using rule (10).\n\n5. After this transformation, our expression becomes !(!p | q) | (!p | r).\n\n6. Finally, we evaluate the equivalence of the two expressions. Applying equivalence rule (11), we require that !(!p | q) & (!p | r) is true if and only if !p | q is equivalent to !p | r.\n\nBy examining the individual parts:\n\n- !(!p | q) means \"it's not the case that p or q is true,\" which simplifies to p & !q.\n- (!p | r) means \"it's either not p or r is true.\"\n\nGiven that these parts are indeed equivalent (both can be true when p is false and q is false, and true when only r is true regardless of the truth of p and q), and without further specific information that contradicts this equivalence in general, we can preliminarily judge them as equivalent under this symbolic representation.\n\nHowever, since \"equivalent\" in a propositional logic context, unless specific truth values for p, q, and r are given, can be seen as true for all possible truth combinations, but we cannot assure this universality through symbolism alone.

The negative group is not explicitly mentioned but is implied to be the reverse, where a decrease in deep wells and water use would correlate with a decrease in subsidence, although the passage does not present this as a direct observation.\n\nTherefore, the inference that more deep wells and greater use of underground water lead to faster earth subsidence is consistent with the ꙮ method logic:\n\nPositive group:\n- (1) S1 (relatively low number of deep wells and smaller underground water use) A (reduced subsidence) B (insufficient data)\n- (2) S2 (increased number of deep wells and greater underground water use) P (increased subsidence)\n\nNegative group (implied reverse comparison):\n- (1') S1' (decreased number of deep wells and underground water use) A' (reduced subsidence) B' (insufficient direct evidence)\n\nSince the passage presents a direct positive correlation between S and P without indicating specific instances where the negative group is observed, the primary method used for causal inference is the ꙮ method.\n\n[[C]]",
