We can first check if a number (X+3) could be part of a pair of factors that multiply to give 63:\n\nFactors of 63 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63.\n\nGiven that (X+3) is part of the factor (X+14), we can rule out 1 and 3 since they are too small.\n\nTrying 7:\n(7+3) = 10, (10+14) = 24, and 24 * 7 = 168 which is not equal to 63.\n\nTrying 9:\n(9+3) = 12, (12+14) = 26, and 26 * 9 = 234 which is not equal to 63.\n\nThis does not seem like an integer solution.

Let's try a numerical approach by making assumptions and validating them:\n\nWe are looking for a real integer solution, and due to the structure of the equation, the roots may not be standalone integer solutions.

There is no quick, manual way to pinpoint what this integer would be in this scenario, as the equation suggests that X isn't a simple integer.\n\nLet's make an assumption that there may not be an integer solution given the complexity of solving the cubic equation, and it would be either a fraction, with roots expressible in the form of a radical, or complex numbers, neither of which is acceptable by the rules of the problem.
