For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[L]]\n\nThe process of encryption and decryption in cryptographic systems involves constructing a system for transforming messages and encryption keys to be used for sending and receiving encrypted information. Here is a comprehensive explanation of each step involved in both encryption and decryption using a specific cipher.\n\n## Encryption: Creating a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n\nThe rule specifies that the plaintext is in uppercase and free of punctuation and spaces, while the keyword is not provided. These define the context for the encryption activity.\n\n2. Follow the specified encryption steps precisely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n### Encryption Steps\n\n1. Initially select the Reel1.\n2. For each character p in the plaintext:\n    - Find character p on the Reel and replace it with the next character on the Reel to get the ciphertext character.\n    - If the current character is at the end of the Reel, go around to the beginning of the Reel.\n    - Move to the next Reel to get the next character. When you reach the last Reel, circle back to the first Reel and continue the encryption process.\n\n### Encryption Result\n\nTo encrypt a plaintext, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the keyword and Reel1 with the values given in the rule.\n2. Start the encryption process on the first printable character in the plaintext.\n3. Look up the next character in the Reel1 using the keyword.\n4. Replace the current character in the plaintext with the next character in the Reel if the current character is a part of the keyword. Otherwise, skip to the next character in the plaintext.\n5. If the keyword has finished looping through, repeat steps 3 and 4 on the next Reel.\n\n## Decription and Usage of a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n**Explanation:**\nDefinition and sentence or visual description of the steps needed to create and use a cipher.\n\n### Usage:\n\nUse this sentence to introduce and explain the rules.\n\nSome examples of ciphers and their usage include:\n- The Caesar Cipher, utilising a simple substitution key for encrypted messages.\n- The Vigenère Cipher, stabilising the implementation of a Caesar Cipher for enhanced security.",

Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the encryption key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption.\n    - Rule Builder:\n        - Given the Fixed Key, generate a unique binary key based on it.\n        - Deterministic Algorithm: Algorithm for generating unique binary keys: $Bin_{10-\\text{hex} \\times 3}$, where $10-\\text{hex} \\times 3$ is the 8-bit representation of the Fixed Key.\n        - Filtering Function: Filter out all the non-zero bits from the generated binary key to form the decryption key.\n    - Decryption Steps:\n        1.

Inverse Permutation:\n            - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during decryption.\n        3.

Encrypted answer formatted in double square brackets and decrypted answer formatted in double square brackets.\n\nBefore providing the encrypted and decrypted answers, please understand that the encryption rules assume that the plaintext is in uppercase and does not contain any punctuation or spaces. Additionally, the decryption rules require that the decrypted answer must be in uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces. Keep these assumptions in mind when generating your encrypted and decrypted answers. Please generate your answer immediately.\n\n### Answer:\nSorry for the confusion earlier. In this case, the plaintext \"A\" does not fit into the specified encryption and decryption rules. It does not contain uppercase letters and does not contain any punctuation or spaces. Therefore, it cannot be encrypted or decrypted using the provided rules.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier message. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you would like me to assist you with any other encryption and decryption tasks related to the specified rules.",
