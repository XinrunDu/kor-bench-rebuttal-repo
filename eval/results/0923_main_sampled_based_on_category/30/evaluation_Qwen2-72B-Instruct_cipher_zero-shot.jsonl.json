The alphabet is 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(excluding \"J\").\n2. The 8 grids are given, so there is no need to prepare them.\n3. We divide the ciphertext into blocks of 5 characters, starting with block number 0.\n4. Since the ciphertext is shorter than 5 characters for the last block, we will use padding at the end (not specified in the rule, but necessary to process the last block), but this will not change our decryption (as we remove non-represented characters at the end).\n\nNow, let's decrypt each block:\n\nBlock 0: \"GMKWV\"\n```\nGrid5 for block 0: (0 // 5) % 8 = 0\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n```\n- G: In Grid5, G is at (2, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 4) to get E.\n- M: In Grid5, M is at (2, 3). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 2) to get K.\n- K: In Grid5, K is at (2, 1). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 0) to get A.\n- W: In Grid5, W is at (4, 1). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 0) to get O.\n- V: In Grid5, V is at (4, 4). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 3) to get T.\nSo, after decrypting block 0, we get \"EKATO\".\n\nBlock 1: \"QPNWT\"\n```\nGrid6 for block 1: (1 // 5) % 8 = 1\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n```\n- Q: In Grid6, Q is at (4, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 4) to get Y.\n- P: In Grid6, P is at (1, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (0, 4) to get Z.\n- N: In Grid6, N is at (3, 2). Move one grid position to the upper left to (2, 1) to get B.\n- W: In Grid6, W is at (0, 1). Since the position is at the edge, move one grid position to the lower left to (4, 0) to get Q.\n- T: In Grid6, T is at (3, 3). Move one grid position to the upper left to (2, 2) to get C.\nSo, after decrypting block 1, we get \"YZBQC\".\n\nNote: Since there are not 5 letters in the last block to process, we stop after encrypting the 5 letters provided.\n\nFinally, the decrypted message is obtained by concatenating the decrypted blocks.

We need to pad it to make its length a multiple of 8. Thus, we add 5 null (\\x00) characters to the end: \"VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting**: We divide this string into 8-byte (16 character) blocks. Here, we have just one full block: \"VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n3. **Block Encryption**:\n   - **Convert Block to Bytes**: The bytes for the padded plaintext block are b'VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'.\n   - **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n   - **Substitute**: Replace high four and low four bits of the resulting bytes with the value from S_BOX.\n   - **Permute**: Rotate each byte left by 1 bit.\n   - **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding**: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n\n5. **Concatenate**: The concatenated final hexadecimal string is the ciphertext.\n\nNow, let's perform the operation:\n\n- Fixed key: KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n- S_BOX\n\nHere's the encryption step-by-step:\n\n** Plaintext: b'VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00' **\n** KEY: b'1234567890ABCDEF' **\n- **After XOR with key:**\n\\tb'\\x19\\x09\\x4e\\x63\\xde\\x8c\\x7d\\xcc\\x02\\x3e\\x24\\xef\\x31\\x0c\\xfb\\x1e'\n- **After Substitution (S_BOX):**\n\\tb'\\xF4\\xAB\\xC9\\x64\\xC5\\x99\\xEC\\x31\\x43\\xBB\\x9C\\xACE\\xD4\\x3C\\xD5\\xC3'\n- **After Permutation (rotate left by 1 bit):**\n\\tb'\\lke\\x8b\\x7B8\\xdC\\x0F\\xDE\\xA9\\xC4\\xAE\\xCF\\xE5\\xf4\\xC3\\xB4'\n- **After XOR with key again:**\n\\tb'\\Ek\\xCC\\x2D\\x75\\xdA\\x7E\\xA6\\xA8\\x9B\\x4F\\xB9\\x1F\\xDB\\x6F\\xFF\\xDB'\n\nThus, the encrypted hexadecimal string is 'EECC2D75DAAE6AA89B4FB91FDB6FFFDB'.\n\nThe final ciphertext, following the specified format, is:\n[[EECC2D75DAAE6AA89B4FB91FDB6FFFDB]]",
