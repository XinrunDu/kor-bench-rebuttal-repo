Replace predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ(x, y) denoting x = y.\n\nThe provided formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, a), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing a with \\(a'\\) = 0, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing g with its implementation \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\), the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F((x * 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 gives 0 and because the implementation of predicate F(x, y) denotes \\(x = y\\), it becomes necessary to consider the semantics implied by these expressions. The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x — \\(F_J(0, x)\\) — only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x — this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]",

LS Paradox\n\nThe given expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) represents the LS Paradox because it involves reasoning about the consequences of multiple hypotheses (q under different conditions) and how they relate to an event (p or ¬p). If q is seen as a reasonable conclusion when p is true and also when p is not true, but q contradicts another reasonable hypothesis, it falls under the conditions of the LS Paradox where the reasonableness of hypotheses needs to be reassessed to avoid contradictions.
