Provide accurate and insightful answers to related questions based on the information provided in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nLighthouse is the largest man-made flying object that flies above the earth and is inhabited by surviving humans.\nVictor, the character in the anime Spirit Cage, is the city defense Army commander General Victor who is loyal to the city master Morgan; the mechanical iron wall is his medal for defending Lighthouse, and his city defense Army is the functional department in charge of city security, with the only field team allowed to carry heat weapons on Lighthouse.\nThe Lighthouse society enforced a strict system of racial segregation; the dust people had no reproductive rights and were not regarded as ordinary human beings.\nThe Church of Light and Shadow, founded by the current city lord Morgan, with his son Charles as the leader, used religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but their teachings used the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nThe Mana ecological report reveals that Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II; Snake Dogs and Georoars are different species and can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage says that the Lotto system has existed since Tartarus and can calculate the destiny of humanity in the future.\nLighthouse used to be called Tartaslow Prison and was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special; it can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eater beast, it is a comparatively advanced eater beast with strong fighting capacity, it can fly, it can play, it can discharge sound, a large number of hunters were killed by its mouth, they do not have a digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology points out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. No effective method to kill polar eating beast currently exists.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are extremely gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled people are similar to zombies, but unlike the zombies, even if the brain is lost, the spinal cord parasite can still move as long as the spine of the spinal cord that does the parasite still exists. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasite can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyll: Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nIts (Megalodon) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nThe heavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.",

Even after its relocation, its trunk was tall enough to hit the stars, and its foliage provided ample shade. The tree carried the strong qi of three regions—human world, divine realm, and the underworld—and possessed the ability to absorb qi. Over time, it attracted various mystical creatures, such as the Gold Crow, Flying Dragonsnake, and Four-Eyed Birdlings, which made it their home. Consequently, the tree became host to the spirits that these mystical creatures worshiped: Hou Yi the Taoist, Yebi the goddess who commands the spirits, and the mysterious spirit of Laozi. It was said that the tree gained its unusual abilities as a result of its location in heaven, where it served as Yu Huang Dijun's imperial seat. The mystical creatures gathered on the tree used it as a bridge to visit Yu Huang Dijun and received permission to enter heaven. The Fu Sang Sacred Tree was initially revered as the highest, auspicious, and purest object in the world, but the arrival of warmaker Wang Hu of Qin Dynasty overturned its prosperity.\nDuring Qin Cain's uprising in the Great Qin Empire, the rebellion leader Nei Nong, dressed as a god, summoned mass strength from the取决于 people, challenging the Qin government and professing his intentions of turning the Fu Sang Sacred Tree into a new world. In response, Xian Xiang from the Purple Pallor Sect tried to make a plea, but Nei Nong ignored him, marking the start of the rebellion. Gu Wan, a former Qin officer, joined the educators Mingzhuang and Master Ban, who headed for Bawangling Drun to attempt a rescue to save Jun Sheng from Nei Nong's faithless treachery.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the description of Nei Nong and his views on the Fu Sang Sacred Tree, which statement is true?\nOptions: A. Nei Nong's view on the Fu Sang Sacred Tree is mainly characterized as negative, arguing that the garden thereat is nothing but dirt and wishes to turn the Fu Sang Sacred Tree into their new world.##B. Nei Nong believes that the sacred tree has pure spiritual roots and refuses to believe that the tree has become debased as described in real history books.##C. In Nei Nong's view, the high, majestic, pure, and auspicious Fu Sang Sacred Tree is considered sacred ground and has delicate roots that have taken root on the mountain, keeping it evergreen.##D. Nei Nong believes that the Fu Sang Sacred Tree was created by the Taoist emperor on earth, symbolizes auspiciousness, and is therefore used by warring humans as a pure world.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n \n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhy does the music from the Winged Black Qilin Cave parallel the background music \"Sandstorm\" from what game?\nOptions: A.
