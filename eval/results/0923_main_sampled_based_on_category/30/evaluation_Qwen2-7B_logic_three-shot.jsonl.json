So, d/dx (3x^2) = 2*3x^(2-1) = 6x.\n\nFor the second term, 2x, n = 1. So, d/dx (2x) = 1*2x^(1-1) = 2.\n\nFor the third term, 1 is a constant, so its derivative is 0.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nf'(x) = 6x + 2 + 0 = 6x + 2\n\nHence, the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 is:\n\nA. f'(x) = 6x + 2",
