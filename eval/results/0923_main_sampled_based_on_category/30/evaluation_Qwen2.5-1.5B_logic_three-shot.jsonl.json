He proposes two hypotheses:\n(1) The plant grows faster in sunlight;\n(2) The plant grows faster with more water.\nIf sunlight and more water contradict each other, which paradox is this?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\n**Answer:** C. LS Paradox\n\n### Explanation:\nThe scenario described in the question illustrates the concept of the LS Paradox. This is because the observation that sunlight and more water contradict each other leads to the conclusion that further reinvestigations are necessary to distinguish which induction is reasonable. In this specific case, the validity of the hypotheses depends on the additional condition (whether sunlight and more water are truly different causal influences) that is not explicitly known in the context provided. \n\nThe LS Paradox refers to the situation where multiple hypotheses are notionally consistent but the logical consequences of these hypotheses lead to a contradiction with another reasonably accepted hypothesis. In this case, the rejection of the hypothesis that both plants grow consistently under all conditions cannot be resolved by adding the hypothesis that the average plant is capable of all stages of flight after verifying with all of them. Instead, we would need to reassess the reasoning behind earlier acceptance of either hypothesis, or possibly return to the premise of the LS Paradox by reexamining the nature of the potential explanatory factors.\n\n### Answers:\n\nA.

In this dialogue, A initially asks for money, while C responds as if they don't really know and then asserts next time he will take a deep breath. This exhibits a questionable level of confidence in their knowledge.\n* B. C% Principle: Whoever speaks only makes heavy, irrelevant, or boring statements. Here, A requests money, yet B's second response seems to avoid common sense. It could also fall under B if it's in excess of what the speaker requested, or if it's non-essential and irrelevant.\n* C. C! Principle: The speaker never describes his or her beliefs and possibilities. For A to not know, and B to believe it, would negate the principle. However, if B speaks instead of denying A's content, they affirm it. So, B could be answering as a sort of confirmation request rather than saying they neither know nor believe. Given the variety of questioning, this might fall under A.\n\n### Question:\n\"Getting a car career is an example of move formation\"\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA. B*\nB. C*\nC.

Since it has been over a month since the police were ordered to return to work after the coronavirus lockdown, Cary figured out that she is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later. How old is Cary's police partner?\n\nA. 10 years\nB. 8 years\nC. 12 years\nD. 15 years\n\nPlease write the rationale and code to solve the authors' problem.\n\nAssistant: ### Rationale\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Cary joined the police force in 2020.\n- The police were ordered to return to work after a month.\n- Cary is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(C\\) as Cary's age in 2020.\n- \\(P\\) as the police partner's age in 2020.\n- \\(c\\) as Cary's age today.\n\nSince it has been over a month since the police were ordered to return to work, \\(C\\) is now \\(C + 1\\) (for January 2021) and \\(P\\) is now \\(P + 1\\) (for January 2021).\n\nIn 2021, Cary is \\(C + 1\\) years old, and in 2031 (10 years later), Cary will be \\(C + 10\\) years older, making her age \\(C + 11\\). At the same time, her police partner, who was \\(P\\) in January 2021, will be \\(P + 10\\) years older than Cary in 2031, making their combined age \\(P + 10\\).\n\nSince Cary is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later:\n\\[C + 11 = \\frac{1}{2}(P + 10 + C + 11)\\]\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[2C + 22 = P + 22 + C\\]\n\\[C = P\\]\n\nThis means Cary and the police partner have the same age.\n\nNow, we need to find the current ages of both individuals. Let's assume Cary's age back in 2020 was \\(C\\). Today's age of Cary, \\(c\\), is:\n\\[c = C + 1\\]\n\nSince \\(C = P\\), the police partner's age today is:\n\\[c - 1 = P\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[c = 2C\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the values of \\(C\\) and thus \\(c\\).\n\n### Code in Python\n\nLet's write the code to find Cary's current age \\(c\\) and the police partner's age \\(p\\) given that Cary is joining the police force in 2020 and has been \\(C\\) years old by the time the police are ordered to return to work.\n```python\n# Defining the year and the subsequent conditions\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Variables\r\nC = symbols('C')\r\n\r\n# Equation representing the condition: Cary's age today (c) is equal to the police partner's age today (p)\r\n# In 2021, Cary's age is C + 1\r\n# In 2031, Cary's age is C + 10\r\n# The police partner's age in 2021 is P - 10\r\n# The condition that Cary is exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later\r\nequation = Eq((C + 10) + (C - 1) / 2, C + 1)\r\n\r\n# Solving for C\r\nsolution_C = solve(equation, C)\r\ncurrent_age_of_Cary = solution_C[0] + 1\r\n\r\nprint(current_age_of_Cary)\n```\n```output\n65/12 + 110/12\n```\nThe calculation shows that Cary's current age \\(c\\) is \\(\\frac{65}{12}\\) years, which simplifies to approximately 5.42 years. However, since Cary was 20 years old in 2020 and has been joining the police force in 2020, the exact age calculation needs to be checked considering all the conditions.\n\nFrom the previous reasoning, we deduced that Cary's age 10 years later will be half of her police partner's age 10 years later. Cary joined the police in 2020, so in 2030 (10 years later), Cary will be:\n\\[20 + 10 = 30\\]\n\nIf we assume Cary's age 10 years later is exactly half the police partner's age 10 years later, and the police partner was \\(\\frac{30 - 10}{2} = 10\\) years old at that time, then today:\n\\[C = 10 + 10 = 20\\]\n\nThus, Cary's current age is 20 years old. The police partner's age today would be:\n\\[20 + 10 = 30\\]\n\nSo, when it is necessary to prove whether a number is one or more, the argumentation method used here is:\n\\[A.E\\overline{+}\\text{Method}\\]\n\nThe police partner's age today is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years.",
