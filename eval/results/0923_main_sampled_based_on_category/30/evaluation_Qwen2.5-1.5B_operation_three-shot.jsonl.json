Union includes all elements from both sets.\n\nFirst step is finding intersection (≠ X)  --> This is step ke-16 helps us to find common of x+y and fx+2.\n```\nx+y ≠ fx+2\nx+y ≠ x^2+y^2\ny ≠ x^2 in case if x ≠ 0\nelse y ≠ 0\n```\nSo ({x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0} and {x ≠ 0, y = 0} and {x = 0, y ≠ 0} are elements in the union/ ? => Plz ask if did not understand.\n\nSecond step is finding union of both sets and subtracting x+y with x+x²+y^2.\n```\nA ∪ B\n= {x, y, z}\n∴ A ∪ B – {x,x²+y^2}\n= {x, y, z, –(x,(x^2+y^2))}\n= {x, y, z, –(5)} ?\n```\nSo ({x, y, z, –(5)} and {x, y, z, –(6)} and {x, y, z, –(13)} and {x, y",

Thus, \\( s_3 = s_1 + s_2 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\), \\( s_4 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \\), and \\( s_5 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16 \\).
