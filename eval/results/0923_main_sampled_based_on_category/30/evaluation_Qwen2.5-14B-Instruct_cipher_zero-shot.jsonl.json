Split the Morse code string into character pairs and convert them into numeric strings based on the provided mapping:\n   - \"..\" maps to \"5\"\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The '-' in \"V\" is split into two, consider them separately)\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The second '-' in \"V\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The '.' in \"V\")\n   - \"-\" maps to \"6\" (The first '-' in \"O\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The second '.' in \"O\")\n   - \".\" maps to \"5\" (The third '.' in \"O\")\n4. Assemble the numeric sequence considering the mapping: For \"...-\", we get \"5665\". For \"---.\", it translates to \"655\".\n5.

Then splitting them in pairs according to above table.\n\nSo, for \"V\" (Morse: \"...-\") -> \"5556\":\n- Pair1: \"55\" -> \"9\"\n- Pair2: \"56\" -> \"3\"\n\nAnd \"O\" (Morse: \"---\") -> \"666\":\n- Pair1: \"66\" -> \"7\"\n- Pair2: \"6\" -> As \"6\" need to pair, it will be last: \"6\"\n\nAs \"..\" at the beginning and end is not directly a pair; thus, we recognize: \"5556/666\".\nSplitting would be transformed into: \"55\", \"56\", \"66\", \"6\".\nFollowing mapping comes to 9, 3, 7, 6.\n\nTherefore, final assembled encryption will observe:\n- For \"V\": \"93\"\n- For \"O\": \"76\"\n\nThus, combining as [[93/76]].
