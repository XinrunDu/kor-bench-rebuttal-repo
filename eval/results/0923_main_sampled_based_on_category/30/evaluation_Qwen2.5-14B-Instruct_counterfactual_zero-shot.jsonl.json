However, the archives of Minas Tirith, which hold vast knowledge and records of the history of Gondor and its allies (according to the rules mentioned), are likely a more comprehensive and organized approach to historical preservation. \n\nSince there is no direct mention of the White Tree of Gondor playing a specific role in historical preservation, and no further description about the chronicles of the Dunedain emphasizing their role in preserving history in archives, one can deduce that the implicit method resembling the mentioned structure and purpose of Minas Tirith's archives closely aligns with the options given.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer here would be the closest equivalent to the archives of Minas Tirith among the given options, which would be the \"written records\" described as the chronicles of the Dunedain, as a written form of history record-keeping.\n\nSo, the approach most effective for historical preservation according to the provided options and context would be:\n[[C]]",
