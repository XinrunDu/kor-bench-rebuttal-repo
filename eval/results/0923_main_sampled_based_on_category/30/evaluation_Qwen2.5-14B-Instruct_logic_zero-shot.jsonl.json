However, if p1 is true, then p1||p2 will be true regardless of the value of p2. Therefore, there is no assignment of p1 and p2 that makes p1=::>(p1||p2) false, meaning it is a Truth Formula. \n\n2. **(p1&p2)=::>p1**:\n\nFor the implication (if p1 and p2, then p1) to hold true, the only condition for it being false is if p1 and p2 are both true, and p1 is false. But, if p1 is false, p1 and p2 cannot be both true simultaneously because p1& is not true.
