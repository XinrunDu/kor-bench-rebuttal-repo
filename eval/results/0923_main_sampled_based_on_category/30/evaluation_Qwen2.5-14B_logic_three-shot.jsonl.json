Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n≥1).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as ✓, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,✓|✓|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|✓,x|✓|✓ are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only ✓|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nFormula that is true under all assignments is called Truth Formula.\nFormula that is false under all assignments is called Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above.\n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven that $(p1=::>(p1||p2))&(p1&p2)=::>p1$ is a Truth Formula, determine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) $p1=::>(p1||p2)$\n(2) $(p1&p2)=::>p1$\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nFinally, the entire answer should be given as follows: [[A]; [B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]; [B]]",

We have all previously drawn on the method of seeking common ground to clarify that the cause of the ground subsidence in Shanghai is 'the large number of deep wells drilled and the large amount of underground water used'. The comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Water Geology Team further investigated the history and current status of deep wells and the use of underground water in Shanghai, and created a ‘file’ for each well. The first wells in Shanghai were dug in the early 70s, the first well being dug in 1860. By the time the city was liberated in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tons of water a day, and at the time of 1948 subsidence was 35 mm a year. During the Great Leap Forward, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, producing 560,000 tons of water a day, and the surface subsidence increased to 98 mm a year. Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water will be drawn from underground and the greater the sinking of the earth.

According to this rule, as the sample size $n$ increases to a large factor (approaching an infinite number of samples), the distribution of the sum of $n$ independent random observations of the same distribution will tend towards a limiting distribution that is stable. Specifically, the distribution will tend towards a normal distribution with a probability density function (PDF) given by:\n$$\\phi( \\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\xi ^2\\right)$$\nwhere $\\xi=\\frac{\\sum X_i}{\\sqrt{n}}$ with $E(X_i) = 0$.\n\nGiven this scenario, how would the Central Limit Theorem be symbolized to calculate the expected value of $\\xi$ under the given a sample size of 100, and assuming each $X_i$ has an expectation of zero?\n\nAnswer in [[formula]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E(\\xi) = 0]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) helps to show how the distribution of the sum of a large sample size $n$ of independent random observations of the same distribution tends towards a normal distribution. The expected value $\\xi$ is calculated as the sum of all observations divided by the square root of the sample size $n$. Given the provided parameters and the linearity of expectation, we can conclude that the expected value $E(\\xi)=0$ regardless of the sample size. This application of CLT doesn't depend on the actual values of the observations but on their behavior under independence and after normalization. The expected value of the sum is equal to 0 because the expected value of each individual observation is 0. Therefore, summing 0 $n$ times results in 0, and dividing by $\\sqrt{n}$ does not change this fact.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following formal rule in a programming language:\n\n$$\\Delta(++i) \\equiv \\Delta(i)+1.$$\n\nThen analyze the simplification of the following expression:\n\n$$[++i, ---+i, ++++i].$$\n\nSimplify by applying the above formal rule and expressing the final simplified array in the format: [[array]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[[i+2, i , i+3]]]\n\n### Question:\nConsider a data structure consisting of an 8-bit signed integer and a 16-bit unsigned integer encoded together.
