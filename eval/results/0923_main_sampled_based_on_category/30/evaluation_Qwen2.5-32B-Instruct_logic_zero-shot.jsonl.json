Apply the rule \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\) to `!(p>q) | r`:\n   - \\((p > q) ::=:: !p | q\\).\n   - So, `!(p>q)` is `!!(p>q)` and `p>q ::=:: !p | q`, which becomes `!(<!p | q)`.\n\n3. Simplify `!(<!p | q)` using the double negation rule \\(A ::=:: !!A\\):\n   - `!(<!p | q)` is equivalent to `\\(\\neg(\\neg(!p | q))\\)` which simplifies to `!(p & !q)` using De Morgan's Law (!(\\(A\\) | \\(B\\)) ::=:: !A & !B).\n\n4.

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]",
