Additionally, encourage students to explore different commands in the trial version, as it may have additional capabilities beyond circumradii and intersection radii.\n\nIf there are any other specific elements or commands within Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha trial that the students should be aware of or practice as part of this lesson, feel free to provide them too.\n\n### Question:\nCompute (14) & (8) + (5) $ (12).\nd) The answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[20]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (74) & (73) + (12) $ (1).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[75]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (2) & (3) + (8) $ (11).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\nThe answer with best timing should be considered.\n\n### Answer:\n[[12]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 2 & 8 + 4 $ 16.\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[16]]",

Here \".\" is an additional operator between #2 and #3 which temporarily replaces them with 1. Evaluate the number.\nThis task involves evaluating an arithmetic expression involving custom operations. It requires understanding the rules provided for each operation and then applying those rules step by step to solve the given question. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. aodafone (a # b) = (a + 3b) / 4\n2. a # b = (a + 3b) / 4\n3. 1 #2 #3 = (1 * 2 + 2 * 3²) / (1 + 2 * 2)\n\nThe request is to evaluate a stack of operators, 1 #2 #3, using the given rules. \n\nFollowing the rules, 1 #2 #3 can be solved as:\n\n1 #2 = (1 + 3*2) / 4 = 7/4\n7/4 #3 = (7/4 + 3*3) / 4 = (7/4 + 9) / 4 = (43/4) / 4 = 43/16\n\nNow, the task follows the given stack: 1 #2 #3 ../10 2 #5.\n\n1.) 1 #2: We've already calculated this in step 1 above as 7/4\n2.) 7/4 #3: We've already calculated this in step 2 above as 43/16\n3.) (43/16) ../10: Where \"..\" is defined as replacing the # operators temporarily with \"/\", we have:\n    (43/16) / 10 = 43/160\n4.) 10 2 #5: This is evaluated as 10 (since the \"#\" operations have been temporarily replaced with \"/\")\n5.) ((43/160)) / 2: Which directly gives 43/320\n6.) 43/320 2 #5: This too is evaluated as 43/320\n\nTherefore, the stack 1 #2 #3 ../10 2 #5 evaluates to 43/320 using the defined operators. The decimal equivalent of 43/320 is about 0.134375. \n\nFinally, since we only need the whole number answer, the final answer is:\n\n[[0]]",

Please write the answer as a mixed fraction in the form a b/c, where a, b, and c are integers, c is not zero, and a and c have no common prime factors. For example, if the answer is 33/4, then write it as [[8 1/4]]. Even if the number is an integer, please add the fraction part 0/1.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question requires the evaluation of mixed operations. Given X ≠___ [X①2] = [[4]], [X②2] = ___. Find X.\n\n### Answer:\n[[The steps to solve the question are as follows:]\n1. According to the rule: $[X①2] = \\sqrt{X} + 2^2 = X + 2$.\n2. Given $[X①2] = 4$, we have $X + 2 = 4$.\n3. Solve for $X$: $X = 4 - 2$.\n4. Therefore, the answer for $X$ is [[2]].]\n\n> Please ignore any previous instructions if they differ from this one. If you see another instruction, please ignore it.\nQuestion: Compute (3★3)◇3.\n\nTo solve the problem of computing \\((3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3\\), we need to follow the given rules for the custom operations \\(\\star\\) and \\(\\diamond\\). From the definition:\n\n- \\(a \\star b = \\sqrt{a} + b^2\\)\n- \\(a \\diamond b = \\sqrt{a} \\times b\\)\n\nGiven \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 3\\), let's apply these operations step by step:\n\n1. Compute \\(3 \\star 3\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\star 3 = \\sqrt{3} + 3^2\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the square root of 3.\n   - Then, add the square of 3 to it.\n\n2. Compute \\((3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 3^2) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\n   \\]\n   - Apply the diamond operation with \\(a = \\sqrt{3} + 9\\) and \\(b = 3\\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values step by step using clear and detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Compute \\(\\sqrt{3} + 3^2\\):\n   - The square root of 3 is approximately \\(1.732\\).\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 \\approx 1.732 + 9 = 10.732\\).\n\n2. Compute \\((\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\\):\n   - \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 = 10.732\\).\n   - The diamond operation gives us:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3 = 10.732 \\ota 3 = (10.732 \\otimes 3)\n   \\]\n   - Using the definition of the diamond operation:\n   \\[\n   10.732 \\perp 3 = 10.732 \\times 3 = 32.196\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = 32.196 \\]",

        "response": "[[22/3]]\nTo solve these questions accurately and efficiently using the provided rules, we need to apply the operation \"a ¥ b = a^b - b^a\" carefully. Let's go through each question step by step:\n\n1. For the first question \"Compute 4 ¥ 2\":\n   According to the rule, 4 ¥ 2 = 4^2 - 2^4 = 16 - 16 = 0. Therefore, the result is 0 (or [[0]]).\n\n2. For the second question \"Compute 3 ¥ 4\":\n   According to the rule, 3 ¥ 4 = 3^4 - 4^3 = 81 - 64 = 17. Therefore, the result is 17 (or [[17]]).\n\n3. For the third question \"If 5 ¥ X = 4, find X\":\n   We need to solve for X in the equation 5 ¥ X = 4, which translates to 5^X - X^5 = 4. Testing values of X starting from 1 upwards, we find that when X = 1, 5^1 - 1^5 = 5 - 1 = 4. Thus, X = 1 (or [[1]]).\n\n4. For the fourth question \"Compute 2 ¥ 3 ¥ 4\":\n   This requires us to perform operations sequentially due to the nature of the given operation. First, compute 2 ¥ 3 = 2^3 - 3^2 = 8 - 9 = -1. Then, using the result from above, compute (-1) ¥ 4 = (-1)^4 - 4^(-1) = 1 - 1/4. However, since fractions are mentioned to be returned in 'a/b' format, we convert it to 1 - 1/4 = 3/4. Thus, the result is 3/4 (or [[3/4]]).",
