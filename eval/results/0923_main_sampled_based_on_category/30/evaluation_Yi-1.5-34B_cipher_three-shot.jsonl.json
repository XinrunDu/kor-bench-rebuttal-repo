As the explanations of the calculations and the interpretation of the output steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Image Generation\n\nWith all the previous calculations behind us, we are now able encode any plaintext or ciphertext. It means that we could associate to this numerical sequences images.\nTo do that, we will use the so-called CLIP embedding. That is to say for any image, we will determine its semantic/linear representation. Mathematically this representation is called an embedding. CLIP is a multimodal representation learning model that is trained on large scale images and text. The terms latent in CLIP.\n\nOnce we have computed this embedding, we will use even-dimensional representations (256, 512, 1024, ...) with the current CLIP model. Then, we will filter the information to keep only the 80 lowest value led embedding dimensions, unlike the original paper.\n\nTo get an embedding with python and Open - AI's API, we will call as follow:\n\n\n\n\n```python\nclip = import_asset(\n    \"openai-clip-v0\",\n    model=\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\",\n    settings=Settings(\n        environment=\"open-clip:dev\",\n        importable_as=\"clip\",\n        import_mod=\"openalea.import_openalea.utils.import_openalea_assets\",\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nWe will import a new tool from OpenAlea that allow us to work with a *Config* object. Indeed, all the configurations guessed by the interpretation of the model state are captured in a hierarchical dictionary containing all the relevant information. Feel free to look at the checkboxes to get all the components taken into account for this task. [Interpreter for OpenAlea abbreviations](https://openalea.github.io/openalea-workflow-dev/openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.html#openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.AbbreviationInterpreter)\n\n\n```python\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom openalea.core import Task, StateInterpretation\nfrom openalea.core.gui import searchable_save_as\n\n# activate save as command\nsaveDisplay = False\n\nclip_stat = clip.get_state()\n# raise an error if state is not searched or interact\nif not StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_is_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    clip_names = clip.nearest_names(interpreter_params)\n    if len(clip_names) != 1:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"wrong configuration for interpreter. clip_names : {clip_names}\")\n    clip.query(clip_names[0], interpreter_params)\n    clip_stat = clip.get_state()\n    \n# interprete state\nif StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_has_not_been_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.interpret_state(clip_stat)\n    \n# get config dictionary from config object\nconfig = clip_stat.commands[0].activatee.states_to_dict()\ndel config[\"save\"]\n\n# To enable save as dialog or directly save the output, uncomment:\nif saveDisplay:\n     outputFileName = \"config3.p\"\n     outputFilesystem = searchable_save_as(\"config\", \"pickle\")\n     save_dict_in_file(outputFilesystem, configFileName, config)\n\nelse:\n    # print a dict representing the config\n    pprint(config)\n#     display(HTML(myhtml))\n```\n\nOnce we have the embedding we will convert a set of real values in to numerical integer values between 0 and 255. To avoid getting out of the colours range (0 to 255), embedded values will be mapped linearly using this formula:\n\n$$\\mathrm{res} = (\\mathrm{embed} + 2) · \\frac{253}{2} + 1$$\n\n\nThe values will be reshaped into matrix is going to reshape the values into a image matrix, $W × H$ containing $W · H$ colours numbers. To avoid a false image, we will apply a rounding operation on each single number.\n\n$$\\mathrm{Image} (x, y) = 82 · \\mathrm{round}(res / 82)$$\n\n\n\nWe now have:\n\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(embedding=Reshape(x.squeeze(), (7, 7), (int(x.shape[-1])//49, 49)).affine(49, 82))\n```\n\nFor instance to generate the latent representation behind an image:\nIf we feed any input data (text, image, ...) into the encoder the model will provide textual embeddings (1024 dimension array). Since we've built a back and forth correspondence (litteral meaning: encoder and decoder), we can decode it again. To get back the image we started with from the embedded text we will ask the CLIP to generate an image from the input text:\n\n\n```python\ngenerated_image = clip(text_embeddings).img[0, :, :, :]\n```\n\nDisplayed image is based on a latent embedding (but it could be the results of any calculation providing a number of dimension smaller than 512).\nIt means that any type of data could be converts to an image:\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(image=Reshape(x, (4, 4*1024), (1)))\n```\n\nAnd to mirror this process we could get the representation of any text as an image. To usue this interpreter, we could specify, the input image path in the Shape step.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will use an example image of a bulldog. We use images as the input data. We will select the CLIP library as an model. Note that, even on a small (128 x 128) image, the complete workflow is cumbersome to run. So text representation means equally many images loading. More than raw image filtering, stochastism is core to generating new images. Generation will be annoiance in short (16 x 16) images. The colors will be generic not very specific to the image. It's suitable for noisy template images less detailed. Too many details may not be trivial to convert to Latent images. The step Start Interpreter starting step will get or generate a text representation of any image. Then CLIP transform this embedded text to a set of images.\nTo interpreted it as an images we will feed:\n- 1 image\n- Buldog text prompt as the initial prompt\n- the rest work with inherited `clip` state\ntext of the embeded image file : `/ansible-local/artifacts/al/GFIM_Example/fhttp%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia/commons/1%2F1a%2FFrench_Bernard_bulldog_of_black_color.jpg%E2%80%8E`\n\n## Copy/paste a path to image or click on the icon button to send a base64 HTML image URL\n\n\n#### Information\n\nname: image-file-path\nformat: text\nencoding: text\ndimension: 1\nattributs:\n  name: input\n  annotation:\n    text: Input image file path\n    color: 255, 255, 128\n  connector:\n    url: input.weburl\n    input_type: object\n  tid: input\n  labelText: ''\n  viewerConfiguration:\n    defaultViewer: plaintext\n\n### For unicode input file path\nclib = '<html>The file path encodes the state of workflow.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the tuples are recycled.\n    - For each character in the current block:\n        - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current tuple. Then move one tuple position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n        - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules**:\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    - 7 Tuples\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the ciphertext is \"LEFEE\", the 0th block is \"LEFE\". (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the tuple used for the current block:\n    Calculate tuple_index = (i // 5) % 7 to select the appropriate tuple from the tuple list. The tuple is used for the conversion of each output character in block i.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the tuple and obtain it by moving one position to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). use the letter at the position after the move as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, I could easily pick out a visible difference between the two outputs which will be apparent to the reader.)\n\nAmongst the properties of cryptography are two (just two)—confidentiality, and authentication (a derivative of which, is integrity). While I know of several algorithms that provide any combination between confidentiality and authentication (what I think is called a nonce?), rather than two algorithms, one for confidentiality other for authentication, I want you to recommend one efficient algorithm “altogether for both” without any combination between two or more algorithms. I want you to pick one algorithm only. I also want you to tell me the properties of cryptography your algorithm possesses: does it provide confidentiality only or does it provide authentication or both? Then, after that, provide the mathematical details of your encryption algorithm including the algorithm to encrypt messages and decrypt, and your mathematical ideas behind how the algorithm actually works securely.\n\nTo simplify the task, assume I have the ability to use your algorithm to encrypt any given (plain) text and obfuscate it in digital format, I will then send it to a friend over email encrypted in digital format and he will use the same algorithm to decrypt it and have the original text. What I need to know is that because I sent the encrypted text to my friend (unknown third party), can he modify the encrypyted text? Encrypted, as in, he decreases, or increases, he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes obviously) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext? Also, is the algorithm sucurru/useng secure cryptography in general to encrypt/decrypt messages between me and my friend assuming he’s an unknown third party? If the algorithm is both confidentiality+authentication, I want to know this, how is encryption done and how is decryption done? What is the shared secret key?\n\nPlease keep in mind that I do not have any ability to decrypt and authenticate the encrypted text until I get a message from my friend to effectively authenticate a file (assuming I pre-shared the secret key with my friend though this is actually more complicated than that in real life (engineering, trust-levels). Please do not show me fully functioning algorithm it is fine if you explain how the algorithm works only.\n\n^(I put in bold the part where I said “he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes of course) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext“, the many a times GPT-4 forgot the H, W, W in the word HacKing, it deleted the $ symbol in the word multiplication, which was weird. It just released me and I cannot use it now but it did me good overall. Anyways this is a lot of detail and side conversation, in my next session with GPT-3.5 I will ask it which algorithm has avlity to know if hacked text is crtptographically secure or brokeable hence I want the most origonal real algorithm that is very secure which means derived from mathematics.)\ncomment 1: We know that W1 is C  = GFIR, the security storage for binary contents.

To encrypt using the QWERTY cipher, the message is written out in rows on the keyboard, starting at the top left and moving down each row from left to right. To encrypt each letter in the message, the cipher writer types the letter on the keyboard and writes down the letter directly below it on the next line. After the last row is filled, the cipher then writes down the ciphertext by reading the message from the keyboard from top to bottom, left to right. For example, to encrypt the message \"HELLO\":\nH E L L O\nE\nL\nL\nO\nThe ciphertext would be \"HTLLLR\".

Remove distinguishing words such as \"extracted from test cases.\"\n\n[**important information.**][]\n\n### Input:\n\n#### Authentication\n\n- The cluster master uses etcd to store credentials of each controller-manager's secure bootstrap token.\n- The controller-manager and APIServer then use those tokens to authenticate themselves for outgoing connections to etcd.\n- This protects private key values even if they are removed from the cluster's configuration files.\n\n#### Certificate Signing Requests\n\n- Certificate signing requests (CSRs) are messages that clients use when they would like a service to sign a certificate for them.\n- Please note that this string is the name of a struct field in code.\n- CertificateSigningRequest is the name of a resource in the api/core package, and it is singular (not CertificateSigningRequests) since the API/core package normally follows singular for all resource names.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\n[[**Authentication**][The cluster master uses etcd to store  credentials of each controller-manager's secure bootstrap token.]]\n\n[[**Certificate Signing Requests**][Certificate signing requests (CSRs)  are messages that clients use when they would like a service to sign a certificate for them]]\"\"\"",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Construct a decryption matrix before decryption using the cipher key.\n2. Calculate the indices of the encrypted chars from the matrix.\n3. Map the indices to decrypted chars using the matrix.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key:\n        - An two letter uppercase string (some uppercase chars will be regenerated before encode the starting word use the router below).\n    - Cipher version: check the table below\n    - Starting word: you check the key by the version\n        - Porta\n            - A for porta version uint8\n            - G for porta version String\n        - La table porta specifie les indices pointeur à l'intérieur. Cette version  *A* détecte les lettres qui se répètent dans la clé initiale et génère un nouvelle vecteur de lettres de la clé, tandis que la version *G* récreate à partir de paires de lettres qui apparaissent pour la première fois soit la clé.\n        - La table porta spécifie les indices pointeurs à l'intérieur. Cette version *A* utilise paires de lettres qui apparaissent pour la première fois comme paires clé. La version *G* utilise les paires de lettres du tableau comme paires clé.\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - 1.The uper text is divided into pairs of letter (at the end of the paired letter followed by an X).\n    - 2. Based on the chars pair and the route (string key) the scroll refers to the code column (rt2map_col).\n    - 1.The uper text is divided into pairs of letter (at the end of the paired letter followed by an X).\n    - 2. Based on the chars pair and the route (string key) the scroll refers to the code column (rt2map_col).\n    - 3. Based on the chars pair and column code the scroll refers to the row code (rt2map_row).\n    - 4. Based on the chars pair and the row code (rt2map_row) and column code (rt2map_col) scrolls to a letter in the row and again to the letter in the column.\n    - 5. Steps from 2-4 are repeated for all chars in the plain text.\n    - 6. From time to time (about two triads of character)the table rotate (rt2rotate).\n- Total Cycles: 2 Table cycles. Before rotation the column and row of the output character minus 3.\n\n Translate the above instruction to [Rust|Python|C++|Turing Machine Language] code.\n\"\"\"\n\n_BLOCKING_PROMPT = \"\"\"\"\"\"",
