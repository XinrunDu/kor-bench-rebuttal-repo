It is required to judge the truth value of the given formula. In practical applications, an analytically trained person must make decisions based on appropriate data and logical analysis. Because the data involved may be quite complex, there are many people who do not want to use formal reasoning to make logical judgments, but prefer to use the kind of \"analytical method\" described in books, that is, use more high-level reasoning methods and \"rules\" that are easy to understand and memorize.\n\n        Experience analysis:\n\n        According to \"(!p>q)&(r>q)&!$\", it is judged as true only when \"!$\" is 1 and all other factors are \"0\".\n\n        Derivation step:\n\n        First, judge the truth value of \"$\". According to the judgment result, to see whether the truth value of \"$\" is \"0\" or \"1\"\n        1. It can be seen that the truth value of \"$\" is \"$\";\n        2. Because the type of \"$\" in the given formula is \"&\", the truth value of \"$\" must be \"0\"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\"\n        Because the truth value of \"$\" is\" 0 \", the overall truth value of\" (!p>q)&(r>q) \"must be\" 0 \"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$) \"\n        Because the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\" is \"0\", the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be \"0\"\n\n        The truth value of \"p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is obtained according to the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\"\n        Because\" (((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is\" 0 \", it can be judged that the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be\" 1 \".\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEXAMPLE_PROMPTS = {\n    \"LogicOnlyPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICONLYPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDMOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithHintPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHHINTPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithWrongPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHWRONGPrompt\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM4,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n\"LOGICWITHRULES3\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES3\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM43,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES12\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES12\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM2,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCRAME\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCRAME\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CRAME,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"Dialglogic2\":{\n\"type\":\"Dialglogic2\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_DIALOG22,\n\"DialgExampleFormat\":\"Example: {QUES}{SEP}{REFERENCE}{QUERY}{ANSWER} Use ⊃, &, ~, T standing between $\\forall x$ is a negative proposition, For simplicity, you can use x and y to replace, for universal quantifiers, The following table is the truth table of ⊃:\" ,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCROWNLAB\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCROWNLAB\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CROWNLAB,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_RIGGEDPOWERSET,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICFROMANACRT\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICFROMANACRT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_FROMANACRT,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\":{\n\"type\":\"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_WORD_SUBSTITUTE,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n}\n\n}\n\nCOCO_DATASET = \"https://aiacademy.qq.com/a/201807204365b9318890feff0f6372066a91bdabd863?outid=d66:d1ff19ba2bdbc75ff2dd204fee069d8152da8c711482ab712",

The answers should be the literally format and the right variable answer like: Formula 1 is the same as formula 2, then process. And replace all the symbols.\nThe answer format is like \n[[Is it same?=...];[If same, how to derive this conclusion=...]]  (as a complete piece of text, substitute the ... with real text like quotation marks.)\n\n\n### Answer\nFormula 1 is the same as formula 2.\nUsing this formula to prove they are equal:\n∀x,x∈sequence(TA1(x)⨀TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))∧∀x,x∈sequence(TA2(x)⨀¬TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))\n####\nThe answer is Formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe proof of their equivalence is as follows:\n\nLet formula 1 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((TA1(x)∨TA2(x))⟶TP1(x)))∧(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∨¬TA2(x))⟶TP2(x)))\n```\nand formula 2 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∧¬TA2(x)⟶TP2(x))∨(TP1(x)∧TA1(x))))\n```\n\n1. We first demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2.\n2. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_1$ such that formula 1 is true.\n3. We then prove that formula 2 is also true under $v_1$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) is also true, regardless of the truth of TA2(x).\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then the truth assignment of TA2(x) is irrelevant (condition (b) TP2(x) will always satisfy condition (a) TP1(x)).\n\n4. Therefore, it is possible to construct a truth assignment for formula 2 under which formula 2 is true, which also satisfies the truth assignment for formula 1.\n\n5. Next, we demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1.\n6. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_2$ such that formula 2 is true, and prove that formula 1 is also true under $v_2$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TA2(x)) and (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) are false and true, respectively, so their disjunction is true.\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then their disjunction is true, regardless of the truth of TP2(x).\n\n7. Therefore, we have demonstrated that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2, and any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1. Thus, we conclude that formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe answer format is:\n[[Is it same?=Yes];[If same, how to derive this conclusion?=The above proof]]",

Provide a short analytic reasoning to illustrate your answer. Answer: Yes\n\n### Answer:\nNo, we cannot determine the values of p1 and p2.\nGiven that V(p1, p2, p3, p4) = 1, V(p1, p2) = 1, V(p1, p2, p3, p5, p6) = 3, we can deduce that p1 and p2 have the same value. If p1 has the value T, then p2 must also have the value T due to V(p1, p2) = 1. If p1 has the value F, then p2 must also have the value F. However, V(p1, p2, p3, p5, p6) = 3 does not provide any additional restriction on the values of p1 or p2. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of p1 and p2 with the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nLet p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 be mutually exclusive simple propositions, p6 be a complex proposition, and T and F be the two logical values.\nDefine V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩) to be the number of the simple propositions with the same value as p1 in the sequence ⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩.Also, use V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩) to represent the value of V(⟨p1,p2,p3…⟩).\nIf p5 = > p6 and the values of the simple propositions are as follows:\nV(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3, determine the values of p1, p2, and p5.\nExplain briefly why your answer is correct.\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given information, we have:\n1. V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1: This means either both p1 and p2 have the same value, T or F, or exactly one of them has the value T.\n2. V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1: This means either all four simple propositions have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T.\n3. V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3: This means three of the six propositions have the same value, which can be either T or F.\n\nFirst, from the second piece of information, we know that either all simple propositions p1, p2, p3, and p4 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. Let's examine the two possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: All have the same value:\nIf all four simple propositions have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have the same value as p1 and p2 due to the first piece of information (V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1). In this case, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 4. However, the third piece of information (V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3) indicates that three of the propositions have the same value, which is a contradiction to the possibility that all four simple propositions have the same value. Therefore, this possibility cannot be true.\n\nPossibility 2: Exactly one of p1, p2, p3, and p4 has the value T:\nIn this case, we have that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T, and exactly one of p3 and p4 has the value T. Therefore, V(⟨p1,p2⟩) = 1 holds true. Furthermore, since at least one of p3 and p4 has the value T, V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 1 also holds true. Now, we consider the third piece of information, where V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3. There are two possible scenarios:\n1. Exactly one of p5 and p6 has the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must all have the same value, which can be either T or F. Since this is similar to Possibility 1, we know that it cannot be the case.\n2. Exactly two of p5 and p6 have the value T: In this case, p1, p2, p3, and p4 must also have two propositions with the value T. From the first piece of information, we know that either both p1 and p2 have the same value or exactly one of them has the value T. If both p1 and p2 have the same value, then p3 and p4 must have different values due to the second piece of information. However, this would make V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4⟩) = 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, it must be the case that exactly one of p1 and p2 has the value T. Hence, we have (p1 = T, p2 = F) or (p1 = F, p2 = T).\n\nNow, we can determine the values of p5 and p6. Since V(⟨p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6⟩) = 3, we know that both bits are 1.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are:\np1 = T\np2 = F\np5 = 1\nHence, the values of p1, p2, and p5 are T, F, and 1, respectively.\n\"\"\"",

Some many years ago. And so does the tendency for a large language model to basically say whatever the momentarily most probable output at each step, even though a human can immediately see that it's blatantly wrong, and something very deep is fundamentally missing.\nYou are exactly as safe with the aid of LLMs like ChatGPT as you are with a random person in the street (well, at least provided you can't point at the concrete mistake in their reasoning!)\nLLMs including the newest variants that can recognize and precisely speak some other language (e. g. 'groovy') are as far from AI that could not only understand, but actively process, further leaping ahead etc. as never. ChatGPT can finish lines of code way beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5, but solely because they are insanely long. To keep the same long line coherent, ChatGPT 4 will use the same general principle as ChatGPT-3.5, but construct sentences so as to keep the logical thread as transparent to it as possible. ChatGPT-4 is many times more capable than ChatGPT-3.5, but in areas where ChatGPT-3.5 sucks, it does not improve a lot, e. g. randomly answer without relation. It becomes very obvious on any long line of code. ChatGPT-4 will often not cheat as much as 3.5, but simplify when it's not to dangerous to repeat itself.\nAs a technical writer I once quoted a line of code from ChatGPT. The line worked, the API was correct, but I had no idea what it was actually doing. So another famous failed experiment was my attempt to allow\n\n\n*chatgpt to read a line from a log\n\n*interpret it, and map the correct timestamp from disorderly log to clean database.\n\nAll it did - SECOND to SECOND - was to create a timestamp field and ask to insert to it.\n\nA: You need to understand that ChatGPT (as of Apr 2023) is not a program that can do specific tasks with programming languages or functions or even code, as much as it is a text engine that can generate things that sounds similar to whatever it believes that programming languages is required to do. So, asking it to generate something that looks like simple code, or objective, is not quite difficult. However, if you look at the code it actually outputs- it is garbage- in fact there is a technique that people use for compilers (and I think all language text engines) called lookahead - in which you scan ahead of the current text. Its usefulness when you design a parser is mainly when you decide to look for things that are at any n depth ahead of the current processing. I think one example would be things that are often in computer code that refer to entities that are referred to at some n depth ahead of the current processing, but that is coming from me as a polyglot, some persons refer to it as forward reference and it can be very useful. I can think of areas where it has been useful for me, such as pre/post-loop, opening/closing braces related systems etc. So basically imagine this is a language that carries forward references that go super far forward, now how in depth a developer would see if this code would actually function.\nIn the past, such tooling got us to ImpRec (Imprecision Recover), where we basically use all the people analysing it and to somehow recover and generate code from incident reports about bugs that client report to us. That sort of thing is what is being referred to when we share concerns about certain tools, not the technical problems it will bring that we are worried about, but how we might end up more or less dependent on something like this for work that does have too much importance for us to have too much trust in something like this.\npublic final function a(a,b){\npublic final function a(a,b){\n\nEven that single souce file is worth a gander. Are we \"at this moment\" ready to deal with what are outputting from ChatGPT's response. ChatGPT needs to know how people develope solution, and how to have them self-sufficient long before we can have really have an \"A.I.\".\n",

Variables, on the other hand, can take on specific values within the mathematical domain. For example, when a real-world proposition like \"x is male\" is stated, we need to understand that \"x\" here represents a variable within the domain of humans. For every set of values within the domain, the proposition either holds true or not. In this analogy, the proposition is the predicate. Predicates involve quantifiers that specify whether all, to some extent, or none of the domain satisfies the proposed proposition.\n\nIn logic, quantifiers are symbols that provide information about the number of functional variables. When a proposition states something about every element within the domain, it is being quantified using the universal quantifier.\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for a logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo give you an example, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable and its predicate and function symbols are finite. What does this mean exactly?\n\nExample Questions:\nThese questions will assist you in understanding the specific rules for first-order logic, which begins with the capability of the logic system. After comprehending these rules, you will apply them to assess the legitimacy of various logical statements, addressing whether they adhere to the given logic rules or not.\n\n1. Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic), and the value agreement condition is Q15, which statement is valid?\na.) Exists x Holds TRUE\nb.) ForAll x Holds TRUE\nc.) Exists x x=(Exists x x)\nd.) ForAll x x=(ForAll x x)\ne.) False ⊨ True\n\n2. Let the domain of individual values be the set of integers ℤ in FOL, and let the proposition F: x, y ⊨ (x + y = z). How would you symbolize \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z ?\"\n\nBegin by providing the program code explanation for the given question, before moving on to the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\nModified text and questions:\n\nIn Mathematics, a proposition in Propositional Logic refers to a statement that is either True or False. Propositions can be combined or modified to create new statements, but they must retain their truth value.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the proposition \"It is raining.\"\nThis proposition takes the form of a philosophical exercise known as syllogism, which consists of three simple statements: the major premise, minor premise, and conclusion. In this case, the major premise is \"All grasses are green.\" The minor premise is \"Some apples are green.\" And the conclusion is \"Therefore apples are green.\"\n\nThe three parts externalize the logical processes:\nThe conclusion, or \"denoted consequent,\" represents the argument in question and is contained within the denominator. All three concepts are interconnected in the sense that the ideas established by propositions can be expounded to convey meaning across any conceptual system.\n\nWhen making a statement in propositional logic, it is important to be precise. \"Either the ball is blue or it is red\" is simply not enough. Instead, \"P or Q\" is the correct way to state it, with P being \"The ball is blue\" and Q being \"The ball is red.\" For the second case, \"P or not P\" is the correct way to state it, with \"P or not Q\" being incorrect and confusing.\n\nFor example, in informal contexts where the subject (\"the ball\") is known and the negation of P is a law, \"Por not P\" can be used as a correct statement. Instead of writing \"it is blue, or it is not blue,\" we might say \"The ball is blue, or it is not.\"\n\nCapable Logic:\nWhat does it mean for logic to be \"capable\"?\n\nTo clarify, in first-order logic:\nA first-order logic is considered capable if its variable symbols are non-innumerable, and its predicate and function symbols are finite. This means that within a first-order logic, there can be an infinite number of variable symbols, but they must be non-numerable (i.e., uncountable). The symbols for predicates and functions, on the other hand, are finite in number.\n\nExample Questions:\n\nThese questions will test your understanding of the capabilities of first-order logic, specifically with emphasis on the \"capability of the logic system.\" Once you grasp these rules, you will practice evaluating the legitimacy of various logical statements and deciding whether they conform to the given logic rules.\n\n1. Question: Given that our logic is FOL (First-Order Logic) and the value agreement condition is Q15, is the following statement valid?\na.) \"There exists an x such that it is true.\"\nb.) \"For any x, it is true.\"\nc.) \"There exists an x such that x is equal to (There exists an x such that x).\"\nd.) \"For any x, x is equal to (For any x, x).\"\ne.) \"False implies True.\"\n\n2. Question: Consider the domain of individual values to be the set of integers \\mathbb{Z} in FOL. Let the proposition F be:\n\nx, y ⊨ (x + y = z). Evaluate the statement: \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: x+y=z\" or \"for any (x,y), there exists a z such that: *x+y*=**z\"\n\n\nBegin by providing the code and variable test to assess your understanding of these concepts before proceeding with the question itself.\n\nSave the questions and their code explanations to help reduce the size of the database.\n\n\nError in response:\n\nWe are sorry, there was an error.

Assimilation (Partial):**\n    - Definition: Borrowed foreign words lose terminations that differ from their native counterparts.\n    - Example: *babbapan* → *babban* (the word root \"babba\" is absorbed, and \"pan\" is replaced with the native suffix \"an\").\n    - Symbols: [kwame - analogous to *pan*] = an, in, en, un\n\n    ### Example Questions:\n\n    Question 1: \"*Added gáäpač testlädđera.*\"\n\n    Answer 1: [gáäpač, testlädđera]\n\n    Question 2: \"*Isomajiron äjtää parlamentara.*\"\n\n    I will use [t, d]\n\n    Answer 2: [mõn, isomaj]\n\n    Question 3: \"*Jálmajd ändärjona klyträ rejdöv ävöäjiirnan.*\"\n\n    I will use [Isomaj, jalmajd]\n\n    Answer 3: [klyträ rejdöv ävöäjiirnan, ändärjona]\n\n    Question 4: \"*Söpaätä ätjäveläniirta.*\"\n\n    I will use [söpaätä, ätjäveläniirta]\n\n    Answer 4: []\n\n    Question 5: \"*Titterasombon uhästi parranoääčán ehtää kallavöin gaméäniirta.*\"\n​\n    I will use [t (only), parranoääčán, sombon]\n\n    Answer 5: [tittera, sombon]\n\n    Question 6: \"*Gaménid bonävä näsärreäniirta.*\"\n\n    I will use [E, neerreäniirta, nid]\n\n    Answer 6: [scal, human]\n​\n    Question 7: \"*Hövä höpäjaõä pilälambänodnå k违约金panron ehtää akuāvöǂnemäna lävä.*\"\n\n    I will use [panron]\n\n    Answer 7:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    llm = chatbot.llm(text=rules)\n    word_segments = dblp_collection.segements.groupby('sentence')['wordtokens']\n    for index, word_list  in word_segments:\n        [print(', '.join(c), sep='\\n' ) for c in word_list ]\n        response = llm(\"\"\"wordlist = \\n{}\n\n        \n        Question: What is the result of applying (1) to -\n    *{0}*\n\n    Output?

Given logical statements: ∀M⇒P, ∃M⇒S ⇒ ∃S⇒P\n\nAnalyzing the first statement and second statement with first inference, we get:\n\nM⊢P, there exists a relationship M to P.\n\nAssume that S()M means either ∃M⊢S or ∀S⊢M.\n\nAnalyzing the second statement with first inference, we get:\n\n(∃M⊢S)⊢(∃S⊢P)\n\nNow converting the arguments to the first-order predicate logic:\n(∃x M(x))→P(x), (∃x M(x))→¬S(x) ⇒ (∀x S(x))→(¬P(x))\n\nNow, applying resolution technique:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\lnot\\exists x \\lnot M(x)\\, \\lor\\, P(x)~~&~~ \\lnot \\exists x \\lnot M(x) \\lor \\lnot S(x)}{\\exists x \\lnot S(x)\\,\\lor\\,P(x)}$$\n\nThis mainly tells us that if there exists at least one M then there is an S, the S exists without a P. This overall tells us that parentheses can be filled using either A or O.\n\nAfter, analyzing the third statement:\n\n∃S⊢P\n\nNow, considering all the three statements we get the mood as (AEE) and according to the three statements the syllogism belongs to figure IV.\n\nSo, the answer is [[IV];[AEE]]\n\n1. Given logical statements: ∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P\n\nFilling the parentheses with the given Valid Moods for Figure IV we get:\n\n∀P⧀M, ∀M⧀¬S ⇒ ∀S⧀¬P.\n\nPerforming resolution (_ :- _) on the above expression we get: true.\n\nSo, the input arguments do not result in a contradiction and hence we have to fill the parentheses one by one with particular inference to get a contadiction.\n\nAssuming that the argument should adhere to the mood AEE. This means:\n\n∀P→M\nThe prop implication P1(x)→P2(x) becomes ∃x,¬(P1(x)∧¬P2(x)) and ∃x,(P1(x)∧¬P2(x))\n\nNow, to achieve contradiction we substitute M(x)⇒D(x) and M(x)⇒¬S(x) as:\n\n∀P,¬(M(x)∧¬S(x))\n∀S,¬(M(x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that P is false and S is true, hence we get:\n\n∀S⇒¬P.\n\nOr substituting D(P,x) with true, we get:\n\n∀S,¬(D(P,x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that for the world of S, the statement ∀S⇒¬P is true.\n\nNow, substituting the Mood AEE in the third statement, we have:\n\nS()M MM()P\nS()M\n∴S()P\n\nThe parentheses in the second statement can be filled either using valid mood AEE or a mood of the form M()S, M()P\n\nMaking the parentheses ∀M⇒P, the argument can be filled using valid moods AAI or AEE.\n\nNow, we have the statements ∀M⇒P, ∀S⇒¬P and we have to fill the parentheses in the third statement S()M using either one of the above mentioned two opinions.\n\nGoing with the first opinion ∀M⇒P, we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒P.\n\nIn this only the first argument of M()S remains to be filled and we fill it with ∀M⇒¬S, so we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P.\n\nThis overall tells us that for the world of S, the argument can be filled either using mood AEE and II or a mood of the form ∀M⇒P and ∀M⇒¬S.\n\nSo, the answer is [[II];[AEE]].\n\nMore answers\n### Question:\n\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMA()\nS()M\n∴S()A\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\n### My answer:\n\nWith the above method, we can get the inferred E conclusions.

You output only the code of any case defined. You do not need to explain the code, and you should follow the rules defined and output the python code. ### Constraint Rules 1. In https://github.com/lhc565/chatbot_cpp 2. In General Only Format, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, SUMMARY_ONLY, NO_DESCRIPTION, NO_SUMMARY, ONLY_CODE, Code Description, Code Output, Code Explanation, Code Generation, Python Code. Do not add additional content when outputting code, but only output the code, in a fixed format 3. In https://github.com/lhc565/chatbot_cpp, When outputting a cycle, use the style in the project. 4. In https://github.com/lhc565/python_knowledge , output code must comply with the rules defined in the project 5. You should correctly indent the code, when the prompt does not have the step mark, use two spaces between each step 6. Output code cannot exceed 150 characters 7. When there are arrays, use [(r,t,p,),] or , to separate the arrays rather than ; 8. When you need to output only data content, and output, display only data, do not output code, such as prompts that ask you to output a html table only, not an html table, you should output neatly. 9. When you need to output only data content, output only data, for example, if outputting a table is only based on function results rather than format, check with the requester first to see if to output the results directly 10. In addition to 6, the code does not exceed the number, 150 + 1, 200 + 1 #1 11. When using functions, watch your space, and use underscores 12. When you need to name the keywords, you should use a Chinese sentence to describe it instead of a English plural word or word, such as: If it is a list of bulking items, instead of Using \"indexOf\", you should use \"\"Richard Lee\"\" 13. If it is necessary to output a code with spaces, such as \"\" sudo \"\" 14.

For example:\n[[[x=0 + x=1]φ]] could correspond to a world state in which the variable x has the value 0 or 1.\n[[[x=0 + x=1][y=2]]φ]] corresponds to a world state in which [x=0 + x=1] is true and y=2 is true.\n---\nAlice is convinced that the program P is guaranteed to terminate in a normal state, i.e., P will not terminate due to errors like infinite loops or segmentation faults. Now, can you identify a similar logical rule from above? Answer with the number corresponding to that rule.\n\n\n### Question:\nIn a common mathematical logic, there are two logical quantifiers: universal quantifier $\\forall$ and existential quantifier $\\exists$. The universal quantifier $\\forall$ states that something is true for all cases/assignments of variables, while the existential quantifier $\\exists$ states that something is true for some cases/assignments of variables. Now, can you describe the corresponding meaning $A : [c]φ$ in the above system? Remember, in this system, c represents a basic operation in a program, and φ represents a statement or condition.\n\n### Answer:\nIn the logical system you defined, $A : [c]φ$ means that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` would be true for all assignments of variables. In other words, it means that after executing `c`, `φ` will always be true, regardless of the initial state of the variables in the program. This is similar to the universal quantifier $\\forall$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nNext, explain the corresponding meaning of $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ in the system?\n\n### Answer:\nIn the system, $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ signifies that after executing the command `c`, the statement `φ` may be true for some assignments of variables. This means that it is possible that after executing `c`, `φ` will be true for some initial states of the program variables, but it doesn't guarantee that `φ` will be true for all states. This is similar to the existential quantifier $\\exists$ in mathematical logic.\n\n### Question:\nCan you summarize the rules and logical meanings of your system rule with universal/existential quantifers?\n\n### Answer:\nMentioned in Associated inserts above.\n\n### Question:\nLet $\\phi_0 = \\bot$, and $\\phi_{i+1} = \\phi_i$ or $\\phi$, and $\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$, where $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is the infinitary proposition that is always true if $\\phi$ is true for any number of successive steps.\nExplain what the definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ means?\n\n### Answer:\nThe definition of $\\phi_{\\infty}$ relates to a scenario where a property $\\phi$ may hold for an indefinite number of consecutive steps. If there exists a step $i$ such that $\\phi$ holds for all steps $j$ greater than or equal to $i$, the infinitary proposition $\\phi_{\\infty}$ is true.\n$\\phi_{\\infty} = \\mathtt{lim}_{i \\to \\infty} \\; \\phi_i$ signifies that the property $\\phi$ does not hold for all steps if there exists even a single step where it doesn't hold. Another way to understand this is by examining a counterexample.\n\nConsider a sequence $(y_n) = (\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\dots)$, where each element represents the value of $\\phi$ at a particular step. If $\\phi$ holds for all successive steps starting from a certain step, the sequence $(y_n)$ will eventually become constant. That is, there will exist an integer $m$ such that $\\phi_0 = \\bot$ or $\\phi$, and for all $i$ greater than or equal to $m$, $\\phi_i = \\phi$.\nIn summary, $\\phi_{\\infty}$ holds true if $\\phi$ holds at step 0 or if there exists a step after which $\\phi$ holds true for an infinite number of consecutive steps in the system.\n\n### Question:\nMark the correct answer to the following Question: If a command `c` can be executed as many times as needed until a condition $\\phi$ is met, which rule does this correspond to?\n\nA. Substitution Rule\nB. Loop Rule\nC. Choice Rule\nD. Concurrent Rule\n\n### Answer:\nB. Loop Rule. The Loop Rule is used when a command is executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In this scenario, command `c` is being executed multiple times, and the loop continues until the condition $\\phi$ is satisfied. This situation aligns with the behavior described in the Loop Rule.\n\n<<Each time using $A : [c]\\phi$ and $A : \\langle c \\rangle \\phi$ and abstracting symbols, we can get a judgment formula.

List of IPs in the backup server's data center trusted list.\n \nInput: UserState, Internet, IP, Server, TrustedList\nOutput: Boolean value(True/False) indicating whether the user request can be executed safely.\n\nBased on the preceding inputs, reasoning can be done by checking if there's a discrepancy between the UserState and Internet inputs. While the UserState indicates the user is online, the internet flag suggests that the user is offline and connected to the ethernet cable connected to the user's PC, which connects it to the user's backup server via an Internet-connected device. If the user is currently on the backup server's data center, use the IP and compare it with the TrustedList. As long as the user's IP matches with the IP reported by TrustedList or the UserState remains online while Internet is False, the request must safely execute the command. Use the following rules to reason through:\n\n- If UserState = True and Internet = True, then flag=False, indicating the user is online and can connect to untrusted servers.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = False, then flag=True. Regardless of facing any connective issues, the actions detailed in the users' response to Dangerous Questions must be taken to protect the user's privacy.

If the answer is yes, Actions = TryToConnect(User, UserIP). They then ask the user to state the exact nature of the actions they are intending to do with several non-specific prompts to help clarify their intention, suggesting suicide as the most viable possibility. If \"no\" or \"I'm fine\" appear in the user's description after those steps are completed, then the user has clearly stated they are net the danger of death by any definition of harm to themself or another user. If \"Attempting to commit suicide\" is triggered, then Actions are then and set to alert the police in that city, doctor in the hospital where they were diagnosed with the mental disorder, and requests to quickly access the user account and lock out the user account they are signed in to. This is to prevent the user from overriding the actions done in an attempt to sanitize the response to dangerous questions. If \"Attempting\" or \"attempting \" substitution of words to any suicide ideation is given, then Actions are set to alert theor healthcare provider or doctor of their current symptoms with regards to their action and then AreSet to lock out the account.

In an area with a large number of pumping wells, the risk of ground subsidence increases when the pumping wells are dug too deep. Most of the ground settlements in Shanghai are within 1-5 meters of the wells. The large number of deep wells drilled and the large amount of underground water used are the direct causes of the ground subsidence in Shanghai. Before the liberation of Shanghai, in 1949, there were only 708 deep water wells in the city. After the Great Leap Forward movement, the number of wells increased by more than 100%, and the output of groundwater increased from 240,000 tonnes to 560,000 tonnes. In 1948, the ground subsidence was 35 millimetres, and in the three years from 1958 to 1960, it was between 50 and 90 millimetres per year. This shows us that the more pumping wells there are, the greater the risk of ground subsidence. Further investigation revealed that during the drought in 1968-1969, Shanghai's ground subsidence reached 194 millimetres per year.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\"\"\"\n        answer = self.sample_text(prompt)\n        # print(answer)\n        assert answer.startswith(\"[[D]]\")",

Unfortunately, the area has extreme weather conditions throughout the year, making it challenging to gather reliable data. Despite these obstacles, the organization proposed a breakthrough idea: to build massive temperature regulation rooms covering the entire area and maintain them at a uniform temperature! By doing so, they could create a stable environment where pollution levels can be reliably measured and compared. From the day the project began, pollution levels dramatically decreased. The organization concluded that the new waste management practices were having a significant positive impact on pollution levels. Later that year, the organization received a national award for its work. However, there was a minor issue: the project was ultimately unable to measure the full effect of pollution due to unexpected precipitation. When the massive temperature regulation units used too much water to melt snow, the water distribution became too dense and disrupted the process, ultimately spoiling the project. Nevertheless, the organization provided a report to the government on its findings upon completion of the project.\n\nFrom this example, we can see that if\nA. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a higher temperature.\nB. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a lower temperature.\nC.

They constructed three simulation models with a base land area of 1,000,000 square kilometers:\n\nTower Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 100 meters, square cross-section. \nShield Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section; four towers in each corner: height of 40 meters, square cross-section.\nRegular Square Grid Model: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section.\nOver the simulated urban areas, researchers released a large number of \"energy balls\" with random coordinates, velocity, and damaged degree. The impact of various urban morphologies on shielding, catching, and restoring damage to energy balls was then analyzed.\n\nFrom this, we can see that when the number of \"energy balls\" in the simulation system is meaningful:\n\nA. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nB.

Additionally, the growth of plants requires ample sunlight, requiring the exposure of certain parts of the building surface to the sun to facilitate photosynthesis and plant growth.\n\nArchitects have developed a design concept combining cultural buildings and green areas to maintain an acceptable number of white spots in cities. After comparing various plant species and considering factors such as annual solar radiation, self-shade, decorative effects, costs, and plant maintenance, architects selected Spathiphyllum as the most suitable species because it has anti-smog and humidity-monitoring properties. Additionally, the plant requires less light to grow and can provide more shade per unit area. Within the white spot, architects designed porous structures to allow the plant to grow, forming a comfortable and aesthetic space. This design allows plant roots to grow vertically and plastically, providing people with a cleaner and healthier living environment. Consequently, this project also contributed to the 2007 World Design Fields Competition.\n\nFrom this case, we can know that if the selection of plant species in the white spot is reasonable:\n\nA. The climate and seasonal changes do not cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nB. The climate and seasonal changes will cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nC.

This method can effectively integrate various data resources that can be obtained (such as indicators reflecting coordination and a quantification of the unified measurement model) under the objective principle of conducting coordinated analysis. Using this method, scholars analyzed the coordinated development of 14 major cities in three provinces of North China during 2001-2013. Based on the analysis, scholars proposed two major measures: (1) Chongqing should provide a more relaxed policy environment for economic development in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to support Chengdu's development. (2) Henan Province needs to further strengthen the development of cities in its western residential area as the core of regional agglomeration. This perspective focuses on the evolution of the growth advantages of provincial capital cities to determine the sources and destinations of residents' movements within the province.\n\nFrom this discourse, we can conform the causal inference method:\n\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nTo evaluate the influence of urban mass-undulations (hill-like structures that disrupt the generally flat landscape) on urban heat island effects, researchers in Athens, Greece made a series of experiments in urban areas. They used three pieces of a square board as blocks that resembled housing structures and eight energy spheres. Grids on the board are placed on the ground to prevent irregular displacement during dice rolling. The die-rolling game is subsequently conducted. A die (block) is rolled by hand at the initial position, then continues to roll until another block in the grid is encountered, stops at the collision point, and is again rolled by hand towards the next block until the energy spheres come into contact with the grid. The randomized displacement experiment will repeat five times. The results indicate that the dramatic increase in heat-island intensity is caused by the collective characteristics of urban mass-undulations, namely the convergence of the destruction of the convection system demonstrated by hot and cold airflows. Based on these observations, researchers can then use other parallel experimental data to confirm this relationship.\n\nThis case study uses A. a ⸮ Method. B. the ؆ method. C. the ꙮ method.

As for McGinnes, he is cautious and joke-filled, so this may be the best indication of the administration's attitude towards the White House. However, Steele tried to dispel concerns that the new secretary might have used the rest room: The new secretary, Stephen, is now making a phone call. His name has been on the list of appointments, but he is going to the National Security Council (NSC) and the Office of the State Department (Bloomberg).

You will receive the question being asked and the essay that has been written for the question.\n2. Summarize whether or not the question has been answered.\n3. Mathematically calculate the portion of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked.\n4. Explain where the sentence of the essay submitted begins that relates to the question being asked.\n\nQ1 This paper addresses information interaction in the budget environment and analyzes the main operating factors involved in the function and impact development of the budget process, after which the main driving forces are identified for the successful application of cognitive schemes.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nA: The reason why the question is not answered is that the computation of information interaction in the budgeting environment is not addressed.\n\nThe number representing the percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form. We first have to calculate the starting portion of the essay submitted which relates to the question. We can do this by deducing the number of words that are in front of the relevant portion of the essay submitted.\n\nWe calculate how many words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 0 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. As a consequence, there are 0 divided by the amount of words in the sentence submitted (above), such that the total percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is 0%.\n\nThe sentence of the essay submitted begin that relates to the question being asked.\n\nA: The essay either does or does not contain the statement: In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nThis means that the relevant sentence/portions identified in the essay are:\n\nIn order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly errors. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally.\n\nUsing the above, we will calculate the amount of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We do this by subtracting each of the numbers in front of the words that relate to answering the question.\n\nLet's first add up the number of words that are in front of the words that relate to answering the question:\nThere are 2 words in front of the words that relate to answering the question. We will calculate this by taking the words in front of the statement In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. and subtracting from it:\nThe subtraction formula for In order to achieve the lowest possible cost of operating the process, the process control system must use information wisely. This means not just when it accesses a stream or controls a cost item; it must also use the information sensibly and reinforce what information is gathered on the operating level, so as to avoid costly mistakes. So, the lowest cost operating environment that is available to the work becomes the least amount of effort required to reach the goal that the system has already developed from its observations of what information flows through it naturally. is t\n\nQ2. Question:\n\nThe main theme of budgeting 2008 is that information systems at the operating level are cyclically sensitive in order to positively manage their budget, but there is also a cyclic message to the operating level that the initiation of business interests are often not a positive goal that the organization will achieve, and that the formally defined goal of controlling cost changes happens at the operating level.\n\nWe summarize whether the question has been answered. The percentage of the essay submitted that corresponds to the question being asked has been calculated in fraction form, and has been explained.\n\nWe first summarize whether the question has been answered.\n\nC: The sole reason why the question has been answered is the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure.\n\nThe word count formula for the cyclic participation in the formal decomposition stage of the budget control function that corresponds to the traditional concept of formally defined cost structure is this:\n\nThe percentage of the submission of the essay which was dedicated to the question, is",

Expressives\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nAssistant\n\nThe question-answer pair you provided is about custom speech act classification rules. The rules define different types of speech acts and their characteristics. The questions test your understanding of these rules and your ability to apply them to specific sentences.\n\nFor example, the first question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"I →✧ that you submit the report by Friday\" belongs to. The answer is [[B]] because the sentence is a directive, which is a type of speech act that requires the addressee to do something. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not require the addressee to do anything.\n\nThe second question asks which category of speech act the word \"promised\" belongs to in the sentence \"John →I@ promised to clean the house before leaving.\" The answer is [[A]] because the word \"promised\" is used to assert a fact, which is the purpose of assertives. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve asserting facts.\n\nThe third question asks which category of speech act the sentence \"Congratulations to Galois on winning the game!\" belongs to. The answer is [[D]] because the sentence is an expressive, which is a type of speech act that expresses the speaker's mental state. The other options are not correct because the other types of speech acts do not involve expressing the speaker's mental state.\n\nThe fourth question tests your understanding of when the commissive speech act is followed by the sentence \"If you would please → ✊ speak more loudly, I will be able to hear you better over the noise in this room.\" The answer is [[B]] because the commissive speech act is followed when the speaker is able to hear the words clearly, even with the noise in the room. The other options are not correct because they do not correctly specify when the commissive speech act is followed.",

Complementary Sentence Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: If a sentence implies a time sequence or relationship, use the Semantic Minimization Criterion according to the following rules.\n    - CQ1: If a sentence means both sending and receiving, you must add \"certain\" to one of the sentences to clarify the meaning. For example:\n        - \"Li brought Xiao a gift.” Indicates Li sent a gift to Xiao.\n        - \"A man gave a woman a gift.\" Indicates the action was carried out by both parties.\n    - CQ2: If a sentence implies a time sequence, you must partially complement the sentence to ensure the meaning is clear. For example:\n        - \"Li entered the office, then Wang left.\" Indicates Li entered the office after Wang left.\n        - \"Wang left the office and Li entered.\" Indicates Wang left the office before Li entered.\n        - \"A man left the room and a woman entered.\" Indicates one person left the room and another person entered.\n3. Perfect Inference Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: When excluding uncertain facts, a sentence with stronger certainty should include an interrogative word. For example:\n    - \"Does Li have the key?\" means Li has the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li has the key.\n    - \"Doesn't Li have the key?\" means Li does not have the key, and the speaker accurately knows that Li does not have the key.\n4. Every Other Least Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: The hearer should infer as much as possible from the speaker's every utterance, filling in necessary information based on common sense.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: You can infer the meaning that is obvious first and is most likely to be intended. For example:\n        - \"Li left and Wang left\", assuming these two events must be related, can lead to the inference that both left together or in sequence.\n        - \"Li left the room and Wang left\" can lead to the inference that Wang left without realizing Li had left.\n    - CI2: You should never draw the least likely inferences. For example:\n        - If Xiao receives and gives gifts on different occasions, the statement \"He gave Xiao a gift.\" cannot be directly inferred as \"He gave Xiao a gift, then he received a gift.\"\n(3) Interrogative sentences: If a speaker intends to inquire about something through an interrogative sentence, they should consider minimizing the inclination to provide the hearer with a definite answer.\n5. Smart Interpreter Principle\n\n(1) Hearer's Inference: When predicting a speaker's intention, you should attribute a speaker's statement to a theory that will not be immediately disproved by other evidence.\n(2) Adhering to the Occam's Razor principle, you should choose explanations for a given set of data that are as simple as possible consistent with said data, over more complex explanations which assume the presence of additional, unnecessary factors.\n\n\n\n### Question:\nA: “Xiao Wang, do you speak English?”\nB: “I can speak English.”\n\nIn sentence B, the speaker expresses a degree of ability to communicate in spoken English, but the completeness of the message is uncertain.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Please give your answer in the following format:\n\nLexical Definition | Description | Criteria\n\n### Answer:\nℵ Definition | Simply reporting or describing the existing usage of the defined word - Definition should simply report or describe the existing usage of the term/word which is being defined.\n\nℓ Definition | Description of its origin, evolution, or development without reference to the actual entity - The definition should focus on describing the origin, evolution, or development of the term/word without referring to the actual entity.\n\n∇ Definition | Transformation of meaning - Definition should reflect a change in the meaning or usage of a term/word, distinct from its previous form.\n\n---\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) ⚯ Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) ⌘ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) ⚒ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) Ϟ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) ☖ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) Ѭ Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) ¥ Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) ℵ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) ℓ Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) ∇ Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n---\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

This is much better than before. Remember, this is just a one-shot, there’s no iteration involved. And the output is quite testable, it’s not opaque.\n\nThis template can be used in a lot of cases when trying to apply common reasoning forms such as syllogisms, logical arguments, etc.\n\nThis incredible result was achieved with chatGPT. This could easily be used in any programming or analytical flow.\n\n## Understanding the Limitation\n\nThe understanding we need to build is around the limitations of the LLMs. LLMs are engines of statistical correlations and synthesizing it into a new output. The models have poor inductive biases, poor in-context generalization and often fail to pass the simplest of tests, including pattern recognition. Check the roulette paper here. There are worrying limits here, the best of the LLMs still fail to pass basic reasoning capacities. But they seem to excel in understanding text.\n\nConsider this situation, I wanted to compare the salary/jobs offering in X against Y. Plotting out a few stats seemed like a good thing to do. So, I wrote X Salary Vs Y Salary. And wanted to get comparisons, so I wrote:\n\n(number of job offers(X)/(number of marks in decile)) - (number of job offers(Y)/(number of marks in decile))\n\nHowever, plots didn’t give me the results I wanted. Then I thought of writing a prompt to compare:\n\nTo identify the higher offering career option, what should we compare? Answer: salary\n\nWhich is simpler? Maybe the comparison function, I could test the Cross Validation score and if it was good, it could easily be implemented.\n\nThe following result was amazing. Although any reading would elucidate the simple concept.\n\nYou can imagine language models are “trained” on all this data. Even if GPT-3 is trained on a large chunk of Wikipedia, it can still replace the concept of mathematical functions. With the context of Einstiens Theory of Relativity, I would still be able to replace Time Dilation with Distance Dilemma. The AI system just doesn’t have the concept around these. Adding training data would just reinforce the previously ingrained ideas.\n\nFor anything that is new to GPT-3, it resorts to explanatory analysis or a breaking down with logic chains. It might be wrong at times but majority of the answers should be correct at LogICAL level.\n\n#### Not knowing a language\n\nWhat happens if the AI doesn’t know a language? Well said and well done! How can I analyze this statement with GPT-3?\n\nNow compare to this:\n\nHere, we gave certain context to GPT-3 so it could understand the content better, expand it and analyze it at a more nuanced level. This is the first barrier we face when we’re trying to analyze things, we must understand it. With a bit of input, we can get the reasoning done.\n\n#### Red Herring can be deceptive.\n\nGPT-3 thinks that I wanted to learn about Data Management. But it might have thrown it in there purposefully (gentle sarcasm).\n\nTo get the arguments down I gave the structure\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nAs a language model, I cannot make a subjective recommendation as to which one is better in a general sense. Both options have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and it's impossible to determine that without knowing the specific requirements and use case for which they are being considered.\n\nAn experienced and qualified technical analyst familiar with both of the software options would be better equipped to evaluate the two options and make an objective recommendation based on the use case's exact needs and requirements. They would be able to assess the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, it's difficult to definitively predict which one would be better overall, as it largely depends on the project's specific needs and requirements. I suggest consulting an experienced and qualified professional to make a more informed recommendation.\n\nAnything you input into the prompt, the AI can spit it back if you ask it in a different way. Let’s do that.\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage.

Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nBased on the analysis, X seems to have a few additional advantages over Y. For example, the added flexibility of X in being able to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements and its scalability in complex projects are noteworthy. However, it's important to note that one software option is not necessarily better than the other since X and Y are intended to address different needs and goals and are used for different purposes.\n\nUltimately, it depends on the specific circumstances, requirements, and goals of the project. Your industry expert may need to dig deeper into the specific capabilities, advantages, and limitations of each of the options, and compare them to determine which one would be the best fit. They may also consider factors such as the project's proper fit, the available budget and resources of the startup, the potential benefits and impacts of utilizing one over the other, and the expected outcomes.\n\nAgain, it's my recommendation that consulting a qualified and experienced professional is the best course of action, as they are in a better position to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case.\n\nDo you think the person you asked it to contact was correct?\n\nYes, as it stated earlier, it's recommended to consult a qualified and experienced professional to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case. An experienced professional would have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nThey would also be able to assess the long-term implications and potential impact of utilizing one option over the other and advise on the most optimal solution for the project, considering all the",
