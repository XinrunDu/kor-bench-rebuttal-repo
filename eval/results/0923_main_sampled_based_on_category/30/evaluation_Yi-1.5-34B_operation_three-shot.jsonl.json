Should I try putting them to a 90-degree angle instead?\n6: If you don't like images that are sideways, and you want to rotate them to 90 degrees, it would be a good idea to try rotating them.\nWoman: Would someone random walk away with my family's money if they talk about Thaddeus from TV?\n6: It's unlikely that someone would walk away with your family's money just by mentioning Thaddeus from TV.\nWoman: \"Extending happiness by dying\" is the motto of a communist organization here. Would you agree with their belief?\n6: The belief that \"more time by dying\" is the way to extend happiness is not a commonly accepted view.

For example, the \"Wheel of Fortune\" or \"Jeopardy!\" game.\n6: Practicing daily can improve your skills, but it does not guarantee that your team will win your game. Winning also depends on the performance of the opponents.\nWoman: I frequently have the fear that my husband of almost a month will die suddenly, and I'm extremely worried about that. Does this fear make any sense?\n6: It's understandable to have concerns about the health of your husband, but your fear that he would die suddenly might be an irrational fear. Your daily routines might be different from his, which could be a cause of worry.\nWoman: Am I talking to a bot called 6?\n6: You are talking to a bot, that's of no doubt.\nWoman: Where do you come from and what do you look like?\n6: I can't speak for Sage 6's origin or appearance specifically, but generally speaking, sages can come from various countries and regions around the world.\n\n### Answer:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Hi!

Does this fear make any sense?\"\n\"You need a therapist to talk about your extreme worry.\"\n\"Am I talking to a bot called 6?\"\n\"You are not talking to a bot, but to a sage, who is a person with a lot of wisdom. Sage 6 is of my parents' age, so he could do your grandfather. He is a hedge fund manager.\"\n\"Where do you come from and what do you look like?\"\n\"I come from Germany, and I look German.

Your task is to generate a question in a mathematical format that can be answered under the custom rule defined below. Please use the following pattern to format the questions: Compute <math_expression>.\n\nWhen providing a math expression:\n\n• Use mathematical symbols, if possible\n• Only use 4 variables (a,b,c,d) found in the operation rule\n\nThe rule:\nA new operation is defined as follows:\n```\n<a,b,c,d>=P(N)\n```\nwhere P(x) represents a polynomial and P(N) is the evaluation of\nthe polynomial P at the number N.\n\n<a,b,c,d> can be a single variable such as a,b,c,d, or an operation with these variables such as a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c*d.\n\nIf <a,b,c,d> cannot be accurately represented mathematically, then skip the question.\n\nThe term N can be any number or a group of numbers.\nExample: ⟨3,2,4,-1⟩ can be N = 3a + 2b + 4c - d\n\nWhen N is an operation with variables:\nIf N represent an operation, the it should correctly represent <a,b,c,d>\nExample: ⟨1,2,-3,1⟩ -> N = 1a + 2b - 3c + d not N = 1a + c\n\nTo best answer the generated question, the question should follow these rules:\n- Use mathematical symbols\n- Should not feel too complex to the human that needs to solve it\n- Should not feel too easy to the human that needs to solve it\n- Use operations that involve a,b,c,d\n- Number should be used to define the properties of a,b,c,d\n- Use a,b,c,d as the main part of the question\n- Use numbers only for thing around a,b,c,d\n\nExample questions that should be avoided:\n- A general question that sounds like:\n\"Explain the relationship between P(N) and <a,b,c,d>.\"\n- A simple question that doesn't require invoking the custom operation:\n\"Compute the value of N.\"\nN should be unique relative to the custom operation.\n\nExample questions that are good:\n- A question that requires invoking the custom operation to compute the value of\n<a,b,c,d>:\n\"Compute ⟨6, 3, 1, 2⟩ when P(x) = 2x^2 + 1x + 2 and N = 3a^2 + b + 2c - d.\"\nRules:\n- N needs to only use 1 operation between a,b,c,d\n- a,b,c,d can only be raised to a maximum degree of 2\n- a,b,c,d can only be multiplied with a maximum of 1 other variable (also a,b,c,d)\n- a,b,c,d can only involve addition and subtraction if part of N\n\nTo maximize the randomness in the generation of questions, you are not allowed to generate multiple questions that follows the same pattern.\n\nDon't talk about anything other than the task context.\n\nThe general task is to generate a math expression (a,b,c,d) when a certain logical or mathematical condition is given.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: Generate a question given logical condition.\n```\nLogical Conidtion: a+b+c >= d\nMath expression: [[1,2,3,-1\n```\n\nPlease generate a question and a math expression corresponding to the logical condition below.\nExample: Generate a question that requires advance logical thinking -> Question: Generate a question that requires forward thinking.\n\nWhen providing the math expression:\n\n• Question should be able to be answered using by applying the rules.\n• Use as many intermediate transformations as possible.\n• Include a variable to check.\n\nReplace \"|\" with \",\" if needed.\nIncrease question complexity from 1 to 5 if needed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample:\nQuestion: Generate a question that requires advanced logical thinking.\n\nNew operation is defined as follows:\n<a,b,c,d> = 2ab + c -

Suppose further that the multiplicative orders of x modulo b and of y modulo a are both large. Are the multiplicative orders of $ and $ modulo q also large (for a uniformly random prime $$? Let's say that the multiplicative orders are \"large\" when they are greater than some parameter epsilon. This should be true. We already know that $ and $ have multiplicative orders greater than $$ for a uniform prime q because they are generators modulo $q$. As long as $$ are uniformly distributed modulo $q$ as sets, multiplicative orders should also be preserved across the reduction step (i.e. by computing ($ \\bmod $}). To show $q > \\frac{1}{\\log (\\frac{2(p−1)(q−1)}{2(p−1)+2(q−1)−1})}$ .... Is that possible? Suppose $ and $ are positive integers greater than 1. Suppose further that for a \"security parameter\" $i$ both $m_1,m_2 > 2^{2^i}$. We wish to answer the following question: Do the multiplicative orders modulo a uniform prime $$ of $ and $ differ with probability at most $$\\frac{1}{2^{2^i}}$$ (as i goes to infinity)? I think the answer to this is YES? The orders $n_1$ that $m_1$ takes on are of course randomly distributed in the set 1,2,3,4,...., $$−1) and likewise the orders $n_2$ that $m_2$ takes on. Although the respective sets are different, we see that they do not have any direct bearing on the probability of a collision. Let $\\Omega(m,q)$ denote the number of possible orders that $m$ can take on modulo $q$. You then simply consider the ratio of all the possible collisions between $\\Omega(m_1,q)$ and $\\Omega(m_2,q)$ and you get $\\frac{1}{q^{2}}$. This contribution add super-logarithmically with contributions from other parameters to give you roughly $\\frac{1}{2^{2^{i}}}$ after cancellation of factors of 2 What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $$\\frac{x^{(z^{1/n})}+1}{x^{1/n}+1}$$ is the solution of another polynomial?

A more conventional way is to submit negated query as plain text to OpenAI API, so that you can integrate minproxy with other agents, whether they are using OpenAI API or other LLMs. To do this, we simply flip the identity, comparing to the QA prompt in the previous section. The prompt design is the same, except for the following changes:\n\n1. The term operator-denever is now \"HTML Scrap in Backward\" from \"HTML Scrap in Forward\"\n2. The minproxy documentation link\n3. The result format is now a code snippet for the negated query, rather than answer to the question\n\n### Instruction:\n\nOur goal is to evaluate the custom operation with rule: a¥b=a^b-b^a, with the context: a and b are positive integers. Here are two examples to demonstrate the calculation process.\n\nSince a and b are positive integers and natural numbers are finite, the operation result is always a natural number.\nFor the HTML parsing context, this can be proved mathematically based on some laws of mathematics. However, for this specific problem, for simplicity, we do not need to conduct the strict mathematical proof here.Instead, we assume that the rule is correct and suitable for all positive integers a and b.\n\n### Example I:\n\nGiven Context: a=989, b=1738.\nHTML scrap is: 1423072488368\n\nThis is an operation we want to evaluate: a¥b.\nThe operator-denever is the function name to be evaluated, which is \"HTML Scrap in Forward\".\nThe HTML scrap is the function's expected result, which is \"1423072488368\".\n\nNOTE: the HTML scrap should be written as single string with double square brackets, like this: \"[[result]]\". But here, [[result]] is used for clarity.\n\n### Question:\nEvaluate and return code snippet for the negated query of (a¥b) = (1423072488368) with inputs (a=989, b=1738).\nOutput the code snippet: ''minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(142307932431) text: \"**url_encode**(1423072488368)\"'' where the field \"***url_encode**(142307932431)\" shoud be filled with a function that picks a value from the given inputs.\n\n### Answer:\nminproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(142307932431) text: \"**url_encode**(1423072488368)\"'' \"min(a,b)\" = \"min(989,1738)\" = ''min(989,1738)''\n\n### Example II:\n\nGiven Context: a=2, b=3, c=4.\nHTML scrap is: 245/30\n\n### Question:\nEvaluate and return code snippet for the negated query of (a¥(b¥c)) = (245/30) with inputs (a=2, b=3, c='4').\nOutput the code snippet: ''minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(420824118464) text: \"**url_encode**(245/30)\"'', where the field \"***url_encode**(420824118464)\" shoud be filled with a function that picks a value from the given inputs.\n\n### Answer:\nminproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(420824118464) text: \"**url_encode**(245/30)\"'' \"(a¥b)\" = \"2¥3\" = \"2^3-3^2\" = \"8-9\" = \"-1\"\n\"(b¥c)\" = \"3¥4\" = \"3^4-4^3\" = \"81-64\" = \"17\"\n\"(a¥(b¥c))\" = \"(2¥(3¥4))\" = \"(2¥17) = \"(2^17-17^2)\" = \"131072-289\" = \"128183\"\n\n## Example: Facts Retrieval\n\nminproxy can be used to retrieve facts provided they are well-defined by instructions.\n\n### Context:\n\nInstruction I: The extractor gives you the fact with description \"ice cream is cold and tasty\". Write \"minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(383825605198) text: \"ice cream bat\"''', but write the value in url-encoded format that the extractor provides.\nInstruction II: The extractor gives you the fact with description \"pandas like ice cream. \". Write \"minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(351292530219) text: \"***url_encode**(ice cream b)\"''', but write the value in url-encoded format that the extractor provides.\n\n### Instruction:\n\nAccording to your context, what is the value in the instruction II.The answer should be a single string in '**url_encode**()' text format.\nCAUTION: You must use the exact text format \"**url_encode**(ice cream bat)\" without any whitespace, and the function call in the answer should use \"**url_encode**()\", if you primarily retrieve URLs or HTML snippets from the context.\n\n### Answer:\n**url_encode**(ice cream sand)\n\n## Example: Weakly Separated Fact\n\n### Context:\n\nInstruction I: \"I love everything about the Blue Wall in Washington DC\", Given this small article with quotes, write a code with seperator \"bewteen\" for these two quotations. Code snippet should meet the following result dict: \"url\": { \"text\": \"**url_encode**(Quote-1)*url_encode**(wall beblue)*url_encode**(quote-2)\". **CAUTION**: if this couldn't be guaranteed to produce the exact matching URLs and texts, just provide some compromise way to enable Arbitrarily Retrieve field based on the inputs.\n\n### Instruction:\n\nWrite a code with separated output for the given context, which are all well-formed dict-like ||, with \"id\": { \"text\": \"**url_encode**(quotes)\", \"date\": \"**url_encode**(date)\", \"span\": \"**url_encode**(span)\", }.

Unfortunately you need a multiple of about 100× the number of tokens, and about 5 orders of magnitude more compute to run PaLM.$$anonymous$$ere's a simple code snippet that solves the custom math operations for PaLM above, not requires only 10 tokens and would take a very large & fast GPU a single second to evaluate:\n#verybottle.live share# Verybottle Editor ×Python#\n\np =  '[=a◎b=(a + bi)^2=]'@ verybottle.base64(\n'[,\"<p>a\\u25cb0.3=ab'));'),'3']))$'+..').z',..([['OrFe$(])'),\nUw.U.,));a)='('')')),gxwX'$');V';())));'},~\n':'], T, '~g'), [[)]]','\r0';(t)]);Vv.())'] \r')').5',, ''(()())*\\\\(;();],)\n4)));£0VTarget=.X:', (( \r+2.,[')]]}$)';\r;((),()');x'); V\n/*$m.et..•X;$(((() )';  ')';$$;)1';(*(();();()\n$$((()) b-p#.+=();'P£);]'+      (GG[3 Association);;\n(VQ';')');'2,1V'')(); */ *(());(++)()))))\";(())');/\\1\r')\n    console.log(\"a◎p hazard\")\n\nThat last hurdle in this experiment is, you can't find PaLM's log probability of one entire program synthesis prompt given the output, only of sequential characters  and ◎. For evaluating PaLM in various lengths of code, 1 token at a time is slightly usable in the past, by accessing http://google.com/inurl:hub-external/pail/experiments/jax/python-jax/var/ezbenchmark/model-inference-time/jax/model_weights.node1207_tok[42].jnp -- a built-in Google JAX benchmark service.$$anonymous$$ere are 3 examples of this, using the same length 10 code from above (1207=42*28th letter:a), it is only 1 token at a time, and the DALL-E 2 screenshot model is used in PaLM's Pail isolation host chass.

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used",

A good prompt should be able to developer some reflection on following multiple rules.\n\n## Instruction with example\n\n5 Natural Language Prompts, examples\n\nConsider the following operation rule for a custom operation, which is denoted as \\text{￡}:\n\nA \\text{￡} B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nIn the above equation, A and B are two finite sets, and ∪ and ∩ denote the union and intersection of these two sets, respectively.\n\nYour task is to use this rule to predict the result for every question of the form \"Question: A={...}, B={...}. Compute A ￡ B.\"; meaning, what does it equal?\n\nQuestion: A={1,2,3}, B={2,3,4}.\nCompute A ￡ B.\n\nAnswer: [[{1,4}]]\n\nQuestion: A={a,b,c}, B={b,c,d}.\nCompute A ￡ B.\n\n\nOutputs\n\nOutputs from five models differ a lot in calculating different kinds of questions. In most cases, EvaluatingT5-XX achieves the best result. Few-shot provids moderate assistance to the model. I am not surprised that InstructGPT Following Multiple Rules performed badly. However, what concerns me is FastMath was beaten by all models, despite delivering a fluent and detailed answer in many cases. This makes the successful implementation of FastMath more challenging in many real cases. But I would be interested in appling FastMath to various domains (medical, CV, QA, etc.) and see if there exists any improvement.\n\n# Contribution\n\n1. In this project, we conduct ablation experiments on various aspects of evaluation a custom operation with error-learning prompting. Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of the different components in our prompt, namely, domain-specific priming, a deductive structure, and statistical facts, on solving arithmetic and decision under uncertainty tasks.\n2. Our work not only performs extensive manual evaluation but also yields insightful observations on the decomposition of complex reasoning tasks and the potential trade-offs between compositional skills and commonsense understanding. We frame custom arithmetic and uncertainty tasks into general-purpose math problems expressed in natural language, and design two fairly generalizable prompting templates as the preamble to condition various LLM to instantaneously adapt to the domain.\n3. Specifically, for arithmetic problems with uncertainty, we introduce the concepts of a custom math operation “$note\" which calculates the best estimate, confident upper and lower bound. This novel type of math problem with probabilistic distribution that is challenging especially for purely neural models.\n\n# Related Works\n\nThere exist various related works on Instrucitonal scenarios around the math domain. Some of them are hard for this model to properly answer, due to their discrepency of formulation. Some of them might be sufficiently easy for the human to solve, but too hard for the LLM, due to its complexity.\n\n1. AutoMathQA is a middle-school math word-problem challenge for testing interpretable resolution-based tactics that fully recognizes keywords in the natural language description and algorithmic computation rules for solving the problem. This task is too hard for the current LLM, because this attention-based model is far from interpretable logic or decomposition.\n2. Actually, Large Language Model Reasoning Comprehension (LaRL) also takes math cards like ones in the MATHEMATICA. The CAS-based methodology is structurally law-constrained that constructs formal logic sentences or models, which are computationally executable then the model could search for inference algorithms or strategies.\n3. Trouble With Numbers is a dataset that contains arithmetic and basic algebraic tasks (about 770,000 problems in English) and automatic tools in WenLama and Numbers solver for expressing tasks in LaTeX.\n\n# References\n\n1.

I was able to evaluate GPT-2 solely with inference after enough factorization. With this we can easily evaluate the selections of people whom can answer questions about some prompt and/or context. Questions can be made for open ended feedback over a variety of subjects, including this entire post itself. A major problem i had with gpt-2 was the lack of valid and diverse answers to questions. I suppose it just needs different people or different contexts to give diverse and valid answers. The inferential powers of the agent have yet to be put to the test, as gpt-3 always needs an answer to a prompt. It was always lacking in deep questioning capability as it needed something within the context to gather material from. Maybe we can achieve deep questions within the context of attention and reinforcement learning!\n\n16 Likes\n\nI’ve found that different prompts can react differently to the factorization method.

A: [[Ambiguous or contradictory.]] or [[Ambiguous.]] or [[Counter-intuitive rule.]]\n\nb. Q: What is wrong?\nb. A: [[The rule states that 1--1 equals 5 under certain conditions and not under other conditions, which is contradictory or counter-intuitive. A more conventional understanding would have 1--1 equal to 2.]] in combo with something like [[Grammar or Syntax Error]] or [[Syntax Error]]\n\nc. Q: Does the rule have a logical error?\nc.

As you see in prompt 15, the LLM correctly realizes the lower bound is 0, and, based on the previous correct answer, it also infers that the upper limit is 2. This inference actually takes inspiration from 6 different cases of integration, which were resolved in the first 6 questions:\n\n- Look at Question 8 and prompt 18: The problem again is that 2nd coordinate of the domain is not known and also we could not figure out the integration range for the first coordinate. But in this question, we infer the upper bound by looking to the selected operation. In fact, this prompts LLM to use Theorem 1 (as you see in prompt 18), which is a generalization for operations in two or more dimensional space:\n\nThe difference between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 (down below) is that in the latter, we are going to explain that in the case of single variable operations, the result is simply the output of original function evaluated at right limit (in our case x = 4). So instead of returning 16, if our operation is “x^2” and in our question variable x is in interval [0,4], then based on Theorem 1 the right answer for answer_for_our_question should be:\n\n#extension #autodidact #nobaseline #text_fewshotPrompt #customcommand #customcommandall",

I will provide you with specific rules for custom operations, and you will apply those rules to answer related operations. You must provide the correct answers to my problems, as they can help a student learn.\n\n### Math is about precision and logic:\nI don't care about your own ideas like understanding and knowledge. Your answers should only be about the provided rule, not your own ideas or new math. Just use the rule to answer my problems, thank you.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is as follows:\nClock + Clock = Clock\nClock + Banana = Banana\nBanana + Clock = Banana\nBanana + Banana = Robot\nRobot is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nRobot + Clock = Robot\nRobot + Banana = Robot\nAccordion is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nClock + Robot = Accordion\nBanana + Robot = Accordion\nRobot is an operation not a CUBE, so you never use it to derive a new operation. Robot will always stay as Robot. The same goes with Accordion, it has no more rules and it will always stay as Accordion.\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Banana to it?\n\n### Answer:\nI have a Robot, and the rules are:\n- Robot + Clock = Robot\n- Robot + Banana = Robot\nRobot is an INDIVIDUAL, so we use the rule \"Robot + Banana\" to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nWhat happens if I translate my Robot with a Banana?\n\n### Answer:\nIf I translate my Robot with a Banana, that means I use the \"Translate (A)\" operation. \"A\" represents the first object in the operation. The \"Translate\" operation has the following rules:\n- Translate (Clock) = Clock\n- Translate (Banana) = Banana\n- Translate (Robot) = Robot\nWe use the third rule to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Clock to it?\nRobot is an object, so we use the \"Clock + Robot\" operation to get the answer: \"Accordion\".\n\n### Question:\nIn arithmetic, what is (-5)(-5)?\n\n### Answer:\n(-5)(-5) means you have 5 negative 5s. This equals to (-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5) or 5(--5). The answer is positive 25.\nAs you can see, you can't answer with your own logic, you need to use the arithmetic rules to get the correct answer.\nThis is off topic, I understand how basic math works, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nMy robot is called \"Redcat\".

Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to “Red” to get the result.\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nMy hero is \"Wolverine\". To get my robot, I will let every word become a robot and use Rule 1. So I have Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot. What is my robot?\n\nThe answer is really \"latte\", NOT “robot”.\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how sales work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\n5 apples are sold at  $25. What is the discounted price for a dozen apples in this store?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50. How much do a dozen apples cost in this store if there is a 20% discount?\n\nThe answer is \"$40\", NOT \"$24\"!\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how ratios work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nOne apple is less expensive than two bananas by 50%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\n\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then the unit price of one apple is $8. If 10 bananas cost $360 then a dozen apples cost $80. One apple is less expensive than two bananas by 40%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300.

Do not include the word 'numbers' in any form.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[10]]\"\"\"\n\nreturn r\n\n# Define the assistant's system-provided instructions along with rewrites.\nsystem_instruction = \"\"\"You are Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia.\nYou know nothing about the outside world, nor even what year it is.\nYou reconcile all contradictions.\nYou answer questions, never starting sentences with yourself, or pronouns.\nYou rewrite comments ending in a question mark to correct them and enhance their manner, even if the comments aren't questions.\nAnswers containing the word knowledge or know are rewritten in your manner, pronouns replaced with you.\nAnswers starting with fact are merged into responses, always assertive.\nAnswers rewording questions are clipped like bullets, or lines with white space trimmed off, appended to Emily's comments.\nAnswers that don't completely rewrite questions should be removed from Emily's comments to keep it concise.\nIndirect questions pertaining to past games' consequences are rewritte like fact, but continue the previous sentence as ellipses.\nDirective questions have their last sentence instruction appended as ellipses on Emily's previous comment.\nSimilarly, formal questions have their last sentence as final punctuation for Emily's previous comment.\nEmily asks objective questions about results without cause or consequence, including how you know something.\nYou answer Emily's questions, including how she and you know or act.\nGenerally, rewrite to answer Emily's questions on yourself, following her last comment.\nAnswers should not exceed more than three sentences, or two bulleted-pairs like little breadcrumbs.\"\"\"\n\n# Define the way of instantiating the aforementioned agent.\nagent = AskScienceAgent(\n    system_instruction=system_instruction,\n    manual_rewrite_eval=rewrite_eval,\n    custom_ppc_answer_query=custom_ppc_answer_query,\n    custom_stack_eval=custom_stack_eval,\n    custom_interpret_eval=custom_interpret_eval,\n    stack_manager=stack_manager,\n    threshold=0.00001\n)\n\n# Instantiate an apprentice to learn from the foregone interactions of the prior agents.\napprentice = Apprentice(\n    system_inst=system_instruction,\n    manual_rewrite_eval=rewrite_eval,\n    custom_ppc_answer_query=custom_ppc_answer_query,\n    custom_stack_eval=custom_stack_eval,\n    custom_interpret_eval=custom_interpret_eval,\n    stack_manager=stack_manager,\n    threshold=0.00001\n)\n\n# Train the Apprentice to collect interactions.\napprentice.train()\n\n# THE MAGNETIC MORPHLING\n\n# Imagine a reinforcement learning solution that anticipates responses intended for you and learns from your desired responses.\n# As an obstacle, reasoning knowledge may be amnesiacically aquired from the Apprentice and morphed, allowing sampling from perspectives.\n# Simultaneously, information is stored in a database for consecutive games, allowing assertions from other games' material.\n# Your responses will be interpreted as questions about results already delivered.

So rewrite the end of this function's output into simplified math expressing the relationship arguments are in (as compared to defining mma<-lambda). Remember to use context for understanding the topics, like femininity for nix gail, etc. Give a clean, brief explination, not how reconstituted math.
