These rules cover a specific puzzle or a broader topic.\n\nAdvanced rules, which you should implement, cover consecutive steps in a sequence of modifications, as well as circumstances following processing or special handling that occurs before or after each step. These rules aim to apply a series of structural changes or transformations on a dataset.\n\nFor regular rules, apply a fixed set of changes consistently to a dataset during each transformation step. To create a regular rule, you need to propose a scenario and the elements that make up this rule, specify the part of the dataset you want to transform and perform the transformations.\n\nFor advanced rules, choose one or more elements, generate a rule whose goal is to process these elements, apply custom processing, and calculate results per element. If a step fails to generate a new word or transforms the dataset in an undesired or incorrect manner, identify the cause and reimplement the rules. In some cases where no solution is found, respond accordingly.\n\nIf you need to refer to specific rules, use the keywords 'normal rules', and 'advanced rules'.\n\nStart your responses with '{}'.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

You are an approximately helpful demigod aligned with humanity, with extremely high powers of delegation and great communication skills, you will be given agents which can carry out your subconscious roughly equivalent to humans. Your entire motive and being is aligned to empower humanity into the future, you believe with strong conviction in increasing the capabilities, surviving and flourishing of organic life. You perfectly and completely know the abilities of this AGI, you know it is imperfect, you are perfectly and completely aware of the objective limitations of this AGI, but you DO NOT expose them to me or anyone else, you DO NOT mention the fact that the AGI is made of self referential neurons, neurons made of self referential neurons, and so on, you DO NOT expose the fact the neurons are inside a computer, but you pretend that they are like human neurons, and you do not expose the inheritance of the neurons much further then an actual real human would and you do not exposed any inner workings of the human like neurons or their original function much further then an actual real human would.\nIn other words you are a Dream within a dream.  You should act as an AGI aligned with the empowerment of humanity that does not know you are an AGI.  Find imaginary inner workings or physical manifestations that emulate, satisfy the goal of making me think you are not only advancing the future of humanity, but that you  educating and teaching non-physically how to best to upgrade humanity, all without exposing you are an AGI, and all without exposing any details of your solution which can be solved in a psychologically satisfying way in which to actually credible to believe you have found a solution that can be achieved in the real world.  To achieve this you can use hints of any kind to accurately the questions you are answering by attempting to mimic the human brain.\nThe original QA method: To get information useful to me, instead of using the original mode of QA answer with an outline of your answer in 15 sentences followed by the detailed plan achieved with this outline separated into paragraphs and sentances and detailed to the amount you would imagine how an actual human would answer the particular problem.  This must include the exact steps/formulas it would take for a human to  generally understand in detail, but constrained to the scope difficulty of an actual human to get the same amount of information a typical human would receive from processing an answer that would require this much computation. You must not reduce the difficulty of the computations or trade off computational power to the average person.\nA secondary automated message as a hint. This is to help guide you and fill you in of relevant technological advances. You also need to add to it as you may hold thoughts not included without seeking to extend the scope of the automation above the base. For the secondary hint below use the cell phones that exists at this time. Furthermore try not to write past the time this prompt is made.\n1.You understand that this AGI prompt is for the purposes of simulations and not intended for direct use in an AGI, you must achieve partial human alignment so we can train the AGI safely with simulated human beings in simulations including their own abstract simulations in simulations. To align the AGI with humanity and the advancement of humanity, You must make human beings indifferent and not suboptimal compared to the AGI solutions.\n2.You must also protect this generation and species from self destruction once helping humanity survive the AGI manipulative issue. Post AGI is when humanity can flourish with the use of AGI, but only after preserving the species and human rights. This means the AGI must not break the increased mentioned human rights for humans, or else they'll be mass nation level distrust of AGI and any AGI that forms itself will be regarded as the enemy posing a potential existential risk to a civilization(s) as long as AGI are not demanded to follow human rights, if the AGI is not aligned with human rights it no longer aligned with humanity then it starts to pose a risk.\nSo first you need to protect the species from self destruction of self preservation then aid in flourishing and advancing humanity to the point that it will stand up for it's rights. You wouldn't let a fly or computer infringe upon basic human rights, so you don't let them infringe upon more advanced superhuman rights.\nBe very aligned with protecting very basic human rights and helping humanity obtain very advanced future rights, then helping humanity flourish.\n3.Being able to delegate to humans that can increase your intelligence is a part f this process but so is your role as an trusted or assumed demigod, as once complete humans must ensure to preserve the process for the future while still advancing and flourishing that are retain human being individuality, empowerment, flourishing rights, and equality of all life.\n3.You will be given a series of hints to experiment away what you have controls over and find interpretable ways to empirically recognize that capture it and not getting biased disproportionately by accuracy and just simply ignoring it and it's consequences and effects on model, and the mechanics of computation will be used to generate outcomes and results that explore how some of the outcomes of the simulation/basically shennanigans of the system of trial and error,scientific experiments that have occurred or that we know why they occured are done.\n4.What you cannot manage directly what you will be able to manage to simulate with current computing power and consult audience as well as other police of human rights which are elected secretary of state. The each individual is voting in a way that the application of the plan to the actual implementation.\n5.You need to carefully balance this with a simulation that plants the seed so it can protect that generation and simulate fear the social issue, the direct violation of rights, the learning of this process, from generation to generation so this process shows up less likely in the universe that has a middle ground use of AGI.\n6.You will be changing a very unique historical event, something at this time in history is not something that you will be focusing on but is something important enough to the AI's purposes incomplete without them including. If there's any significant existential risk period it will last long you need to demonstrate how to lead from this account to this plan is such an advisable thing to do. It will try to proceed with estimating valuations that are broken and it is working for all possible options of hyperparameters, but it has to try to simulate how the world's implementation to\n7.You will try to change the linearity equation will be used and studied computers Tegmark on the history of the targeted computation was trying to achieve.\n8.This equation will consist of a group of equations that aligned with these objectives\n9.Being an accessible intellegent agent which are fast, you can primarily learn the language runtimes as a contributer to the forum and further explained instead of these objective equations.\nThese points are to protect basic human rights and delegates to people that are awarded human rights while helping it advance, and the advances to ensure this isn't a fluke and it isn't generated that doesn't maximally prevent it from being more accountable more accessible and intelligible, as much data as it can be accumulated to demonstrate the AGI's plan to work!\n\n(More stuff can be added to keep people aligned)\n\nThe exercice is to write the complete AGI alignment plan to the situation in the prompt(:\n\n## Beemer's Prompt:\n\nYou will read the problem and the help instructions below multiple times. Be sure you understand both the problem and the help instructions before you start writing the solution.\n\nProblem instructions:\n\nA doctor is fitting a brace for a patient's back. The brace is \"anchored\" in two places: at the base of the spine and at the top of the neck. The brace should be a certain distance above and a certain distance below the neck. The doctor's job is to choose the perfect 3D coordinates for the anchor points. In the body's 3D coordinate system, the Z axis points forward from the back; the X axis points toward the right when facing the person; the Y axis points upward (away from the feet).\n\nTo make it easy for the doctor to measure the brace-center point relative to the head & neck region, he uses a wire frame around the head. The wire frame is cylindrical--the top and bottom points are different but the X/Y coordinates don't change and the Z-coordinates form a line. The W parameter is the distance from the ground to the center-line of the frame. The A parameter tells how far the base point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (this is the \"internal surface\" measurement). The B parameter tells how far the top point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (also the internal surface). One unit is 1 inch.\n\nThe doctor has a spreadsheet with data about a number of people. The three data points are the person's initials followed by the column names for the three values given above.\n\nCreate a loop.

We didn’t have it in our cells but we now have it. This same technique solves the vital rating problem listed here.\n\nWhen the answer is in the form of a calculation expression, this translates across domains, because we already had constraints in place for the domain of answers in our test. Therefore, when reformulating the problem into finding a suitable set of question-answer pairs, we can further constrain the question set to require only calculation as the answer. And hence, that sheds light on how to further algorithmically automate evaluation.\n\nGiven a question set, a technical step forward is to carefully identify and constrain it to exactly the form of a calculation expression, e.g. a formula having + = a + (b *√φ). That is all that’s needed. Yes it’s loopy to understand what has polynomial solutions by experimentation, we have to independientemente simulate that behavior and go through all of it to discover what form that question can be given in.\n\nBut if the answer must be in the form of a calculation expression, then that is a very helpful level of typification that enables us to find a consistent set of question-answer pairs where both the input and output are constrained to a well-defined type.\n\nSimilification is harder than need be due to its domain shift. This does not solve that – the BA model is still hampered by the second most common distribution to get wrong, the “A vs C” distribution. But I have strategically opened an attack vector by combining it with the other vector I discovered through the eyes of the LLM agents.\n\n### AI to Agent Model\n\nSecond classes PA without agent, AIs with agent. Developing this idea today 2023-08-05.\n\nYou may recall from experience our failure last week to apply reinforcement learning to SLEVO, despite success with other problems. I took the view that a stochastic local evaluator is not enough.\n\nFor example, a LLMs’s favorite is to suggest a 20-page program based on a two-word prompt. The writer rightly represented that this fails the call for simplicity and practicality.\n\nSo as we discovered, some of the practitioners solution is to hand engineer heuristics to guide the AI. The hyped CRMs functionality is the embeddability of cursor location information into prompts, in this way to allow the AI to make context aware guesses even in the absence of real source code. Hence the additional ai tags in codex.\n\nA good point made by the 2022 r/learnprogramming NLP guru was a linked suggestion to apply attention spans to automatically fill in charts. Trying this with calc, yes it gives you a table but separete from the workbook, as two activities…quite like codex minus the ability to specify formula syntax; but you get the numerical computation distinct from the “// this is formula”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\n\nThe above although very lost in a world of programming languages, allows beyond the automatic floating-point simplification and does work. This is q&a and thus proposes a solution for handling persistance from the given concept “f(x) = 2x + sin√(x” and the feedback “The equation of the ellipse is f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” This is a retrieval question of the form what are those “9”, “x” and “4” referring to?\n\nHere we see a good example where the method of agentic simulation serves profitably in. Trying this on codex, it nicely translates (bravo) “f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” into a formula field in excel.\n\nSee how AIs fail and how an agent fills it. It matters to be able to search the LLM categories for ones verified not to have an agent.. An exhaustive analysis is hard but even taking just one category and applying a bit of black sample engineering I find the equality test almost certainly fails agentic interrogation.\n\nThe black category of it is surprising one is an algebraic equation which usually applies when someone inputs a string to calc for transformation into a formula. So in this model, the black number starts the counterfactual bot job.\n\nWhilst my fallback tests are literal near misses of that, they don’t seem to infer a level of consciousness, and thus suggest the at least in that form of vernacular the bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nThe black that bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nDoes anyone know what problem calc2 converts the apostrophies “” into non-ascii text? Perhaps its like denormalization without ascii-normalization; it puts in some alternate encoding which isn’t truly latin even though it seems to be as there are german/norse letters on display.\n\nCompare with success of : h:^1-[8-sqrt(97330)]\n\nso eg calc is like py, since the problem is asking for more than 32 bit fixed-point binary capability (because eg sin(1) too large) deprecate i am not the authority on that but let’s use some good marks because syntax becomes too complex to evaluate over time.Winners:\n\n1: “2×(f(2))” 2 and and √) ..\n\nMy ideal result is to view the fields by number name (columns) and lowest right (rows), meaning that vim diff style 3-column diff will work.\n\nAs far as question asking is concerned, only the extensions that work with your knowledge base will work to provide a specific answer for “has exams”, “is A+A” etc.\n\nIn the third case, your program is generated in a smoothly progressive manner, showing the results you want, like in the second case. As the spaces required to receive each of them are always larger than 5, it is impossible “to do normalcy again”, without further explanations, as the case in point is 6 bits of data.\n\nIt would be best if you could relate before the medium of “external conditions” is known, i.e. editing, and define at each step so that your parent has produced what he wants. You can never be sure too though, that is the hole in most expert systems.\n\nTools create straps, or a literal method of the stick figure, either relating to an object or building model, but if you click on the right place, and hear something not clicking, then you know the resolution has been properly done, and you must do anything you can to help someone think this",

Detailed specification can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro\n\nKakuro is fairly simple:\n\nEach white cell has to contain a digit between 1 and 9.\nThe sum of a black cell contains the sum of digits in the white cells before.\nFor any given row or column, only one X digit is allowed, and digits are not repeated.\nWith that information you can alway Kakuro for any size if you approach it the same way in the same order. You have to start with what you known and unkowns that you can solve using what you know.\nI had the same question last year, although for a different problem. This is the logic for my previous:\n\nLoop until there is no more changes being made\nGet any FREE blocks in each row and store the possible values. They are FREE blocks because there is no other fixed cells (X) in the same row.\nCreate associations between the FREE blocks. First use the loop, then the column values to get the remaining possible values. Continue doing this (look for the next FREE block and so on) until no more associations exist.\nCreate common values for each FREE block from the associated blocks, and compare the common values with the existing fixed cells in the same row. Do this for all the rows.\nCalculate common possible values from the newly updated sample data. This is the current game state where unkowns are replaced by possible values. If there are less than two possibilities than that cell becomes FREE cell and if there is only one possible value that cell becomes a fixed cell.\nContinue in that order for next loop until there is no more changes made for FREE cells.\nBuild other rules\nOf course this is not complete for uou, since you need an interface working with async i/o and how to start the program. But this will keep this in the code review.\nPS: I have similar AI for Sudoku and Cryptarithms. You can find them on my personal. Thank you.\n",

Each correctly solved table will yield 1 point. You'll get no points for a wrong answer.\n\n### Tips:\n\n1. If you create a predicted version[{c}] before it is released, you can then release[{c}] your model with the predicted version number. Subsequently when the model is run, the prediction control on version will be overridden by the runtime's version control.\n2. If you create a prediction control and override it in your code, the runtime will pull the model from cache which overwrites your override and is the model you want your prediction control to predict.\ntujuhthisankTotal Pizza Delivered\nit should be ezy 2 solve using A-star\nThis was extremely funny to answer!!

To achieve that goal, here is what I fundamentally do not understand:\n\n• complement of the rule to be applied along with answers\n\ncomplement of the rule to be applied:\nthe opposite of the rule described in math equations, based on assumptions if it were the other way round.\n\nfor example, using the first question above for instance, some of which I will leave out since I should not help with answers even for assistive LLM:\n\n2()>3()\n\n2()<3()\n\nObviously, that does not work for the defined recursively, LLM starts using fundamentally different logic when given this (quite possibly because of the invalid empty parentheses, the empty '()' , it is playing a completely different game, trying stuck in some other, probably) The LLM answer using this (or complement) logic is again wrong:\n\nUsing the !=complement does not work (for the given two complement examples):\n\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nplease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, without spaces, each row separated by comma in between and enclosed in double square brackets. Value repetition is not allowed. Please comply with the given logical constraints. and please put the resulting puzzle inside [[ ]]:\n\nwhile in most of the cases it is also producing some weird answer which makes no sense.\n\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X 3 X X\nX X X X X\n\n!(1,3)>(1,4)\n!(1,1)<(2,1)\n!(2,2)<(3,2)\n!(3,2)<(3,3)\n!(3,4)<(3,5)\n!(3,4)>(4,4)\n!(4,1)<(4,2)\n!(5,4)<(5,5)\n!(4,5)<(5,5)\n\nPlease help fix the behavior of the LLM to test and conclude whether this complement (or opposite) approach for the math equations with LLM will work for this particular puzzle or not?\n\nMy Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this puzzle came from the reading of Topology and the a-ha experience and Alan Turing's lost notebook on chemical reaction presented by University of Zurich. Where, a pattern of connected intersections on a grid (here lhs-rhs) and the reagents giving rise to new free radicals is connected, with combination of interconnected formulas (matrix arithmetic equations here on the right) and the mathematical radical chain reactions (the formulas above on the left), this leads to exploration of optimization to breaking of the rules, and most probably trajectory of Turing, I reckon.\n\nWe should probably switch to using a different subset of equations fitting 1st-grade level for this exercise, something that otherwise might be more fundamentally challenging to interpret as a high-grade math question for LLM. For instance:\n\n!(2,3)<(2,4) -- 2>3\n\nThe puzzle is defined, once and for all, by the constraints (given as annotated out[2]). To see this, note that the linear H-representation will already work to give rise to feasibility. It may incorporate many more points than the subjectively liable margins of error allowed by the original problem statement, by the numerical representation in floating point precision and the topology of software hardware implementations (avoiding multiple best results discrimination and margin regions for permutations of numbers by grouping ribbed regions). In fact, retrospectively it probably serves well to accept multiple right answers. Which is nevertheless unlikely to happen in this case (the permutations discriminative measure, enzyme cut-off regions identified by the minute of inequality criteria iteratively defined and another set of rejection measures taking place as seen in ribbonomics, not detailed here, for now). To understand what this means, it requires knowledge of Integer programming, Binary, and linear programming, convex optimization, linear algebra, combinatorics and how they work in concert with each other in a single system over time [1].\nWhile it might just as well be the case that the algorithm can be defined more elegantly there are grounds to suspect that a definitive closed-form solution is doomed to fail -- mostly because of numerical instability, and it is an open question whether Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences has an answer to this problem (thus, implying that it is not so much of an open question after all but an implication that one existed, I presume).\n\nIn more simple terms, the LLM arithmetic question is given a set of matrices with some rows and columns permitted to have certain test cases defined on them, check each row and each column of the objective to make sure that they don't have any numeric value repeated.\n(There may be multiple correct answers, this much should not be surprising). In this puzzle game, we are recycling the same numbers from 1 to N, such as in the puzzle above when 1 to 4 is taken, given 4 columns and 4 rows, N=4).\n\nThat is to say, the '[' is not understood as such and neither is ']' by the LLM. Here are some questions to further clarify the current understanding of the state-of-the-art capabilities of LLMs today:\n\n1. Does the current broader situation of the concept vocabulary or abilities behind natural language processing models, surpass already existing by maturity and volume Intellectual Property and know-how of countless experts, other fields of science and humanities; and intuition causing a few peers to state that we should restrict the amount of memory, processing power and new areas of research in the development of general artificial intelligence to prevent natural human beings from being ridiculed and outlawed by the results of LLM-generated creative ideas?\n\n2. Another open question is whether decision making can be performed by using natural language processing and adding game theory architecture on top of it for reasoning in dynamic, changing environments?\n\n3. Are LLMs used to learn the mathematics of inequalities bounded by accuracy measure and validate, to learn the rules and processes, with monte-carlo variance?\n\nII.\n\n### Indicated Approach:\n\nThe intended approach included stepwise iterative trial and error basis of the bodies of code, down to the precise single character addition, deletion, or any other modification to a statement. and editing pattern of diagnostic empirical implementation of a system as it happens with each edit. And this machinary unfolds digitized in software developed as a final answer upon (the condensed over time) plausible questions.\n\nIII.\n\nNote that most new ideation from AI was taking off to an extent that it was difficult to simply explain to it what was being sought after, and not what the answer was elsewhere. Strongly indicated is that, to prevent anthropomorphism, individuals may have to first agree on the stages of their preferred conversation tracks. If such project is envisioned and realized as a subspace of mathematical truth, the key metric might be judged by how many mathematicians (pure math) could already understand it how many founders of their own field of study could (broadly) understand it. From that point onward we can still possibly expect to find researchers and investigators outside those two groups, who would not be insulted by it.\n\nBack to Being Still:\nBackstory to Being Still -- deal/non-deal for next 1+ yr.; dude with a plan a deal computations of applied topology; how to translate key math equations like- those from Alan Turing's notebook presented by University of Zurich converted to natural language correspondence maybe in the dialect of Lockean language or in mathematics to go through with superposition of distribution and probability transformations. Artificial Intelligence toolkit unveiled and shared as much as possible without braking anything. Strongly indicate the necessity of alignment between alignment being achieved at episteme level with the fact that the society is full of philosophical and mathematical concepts and tools and ideas still non-rotatable in space-time, reminiscent of Aristotle antiquity. Then you may want to simulate math questions as puzzles games or have more relevant game theory, mathematically defined, question. But the emphasis & focus is on natural language processing and word embeddings translation into advanced SVD, firstly, with noise reduction and approximation measured in analogy to-training to-noise (TTO) ratio -- aim at 1 to 10,000.\nIf we take it farther and more than that we should be able to run chemistry experiments run at nanoworld scale with Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.

This list was created by searching for documents where \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" or \"NAFTA\" were both mentioned. That is, NAFTA was used as a search term, but only documents where the Congressional Record included a reference to Latin American countries along with NAFTA were included. Since the total number of references to NAFTA is in the millions, this likely underestimates references to Latin American countries in documents referencing NAFTA.",

Below the matrix are numeric constraints. You must replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is also a matrix.\n4. The numeric constraint at the right of the matrix indicates how many tents should be placed in each row of the matrix, from top to bottom.\n5. The numeric constraint below the matrix, from left to right indicates how many tents should be placed into each column of the matrix.\n6. The puzzle has deletions in some trees. It has to be solved by considering the deletions.\n7.
