Ensure the output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n   For (p>q)>r: (p & !q) | r\n   For p>(q>r): (!p | !q) | r\n\n4. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n   - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n   - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n\nSince we can't directly compare the two expressions without negation and equivalence, let's use the equivalence calculation rule (13):\n\n   ! ((p>q)>r) ::=:: !((p & !q) | r)\n                         ::=:: !(p & !q) & !r  (By Rule 6 & De Morgan's Law)\n                         ::=:: (!p | q) & !r  (By Rule 7 & De Morgan's Law)\n\n   ! (p>(q>r)) ::=:: !((!p | !q) | r)\n                           ::=:: !(!p | !q) & !r  (By Rule 6 & De Morgan's Law)\n                           ::=:: (p & q) & !r  (By Rule 7 & De Morgan's Law)\n\n5. Truth Value Judgment:\n   Assume the statements are true:\n   - Person A: (p>q)>r is true.\n   - Person B: p>(q>r) is true.\n\nCombine their truth values to write the final logical expression:\n   ((p>q)>r) & (p>(q>r))\n\nApply the given basic equivalences or reasoning patterns to derive and judge the truth of the expression:\n   ((p & !q) | r) & ((!p | !q) | r)\n\nSince (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are either both true or both false, they are equivalent.
