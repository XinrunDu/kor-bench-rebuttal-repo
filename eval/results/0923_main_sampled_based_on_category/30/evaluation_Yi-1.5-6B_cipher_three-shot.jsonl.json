Follows the direction of the ciphertext, going to Reel9 (encoded as 2).\n3. X maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n4. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n5. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n6. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n7. J maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n8. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n9. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n10. Moves to Reel22 (encoded as 21).\n11. O maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n12. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n13. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n14. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n15. W maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n16. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n17. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n18. Moves to Reel20 (encoded as 19).\n19. N maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n20. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n21. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n22. Moves to Reel17 (encoded as 15).\n23. J maps to G in Reel10 (encoded as -2, meaning -2 for wraparound).\n24. Moves to Reel12 (encoded as +2).\n25. L maps to U in Reel19 (encoded as -1).\n26. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n27. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n28. Moves to Reel18 (encoded as 17).\n29. V maps to G in Reel17 (encoded as 0).\nThus, the decrypted answer is \"GU\".\n\nBecause this is not a computer program, I am unable to format the output in a specific way.

Blue: Prepare the morse_code Table and Numerical-Index Mapping Table.\n2. Blue: Take the plaintext and convert each character to its corresponding Morse code, adding a / between each character.\n3. Blue: Divide the Morse code into two pairs of characters. Convert them into their corresponding numeric strings using the Mapping Table.\n4. Purple: Join the numeric strings into a single string, adding an extra .. if the input text length is odd.\n5. Green: Divide the ciphertext into pairs of digits.\n6. Green: Convert each pair to its corresponding character pair using the Mapping Table.\n7. Green: Combine the character pairs to form the final morse_code, adding an extra / if the input ciphertext length is odd.\n8. Purple: Convert each character pair of morse_code to its Uppercase counterpart using the morse_code table.\n9. Green: Join the plaintext characters to form the final output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThese rules represent the simplified workflow of the cipher. The steps are clear and concise. However, for greater clarity and precision, adding the functions used to improve understanding can be helpful. For instance, a \"convert_morse\" function could be defined for step 9 (Purple) to demonstrate how the characters are converted back to their uppercase counterparts in the plaintext.\n\n### Rule Variations:\n\n1. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in decryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n2. The character i '.' maps directly to 7 in the decryption step, bypassing the numeric-index mapping table.\n3. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in encryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n4. Adding an additional step in the decryption process to handle the extra '/' symbol if the input ciphertext has an odd number of digits doesn't impact the accuracy of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Changes in Explanation:\n\n1. The rule variations no longer apply to the simplified rules, as they are beyond the scope of the simplification process.\n\nThe modified rules and explanation clarify the simplified workflow of the Keyword Exclusive _Tagram Cipher, while ensuring they adhere to the question restrictions.",
