For this expression, the propositional variables are p, q, and r. Their negations are ¬p, ¬q, and ¬r, respectively.\n\nThe given expression can be simplified as follows, since (¬p ^ q ^ r) and (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) share a common factor of ¬p:\n\n- (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) ∨ (¬p ^ q ^ r)\n- Simplify using distribution: ¬p ^ (¬q v q) ^ r\n- Since ¬q v q is a tautology (law of excluded middle), it simplifies to ¬p ^ TRUE ^ r, which simplifies to ¬p ^ r\n\nNow, we need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in the simplified expression, ¬p ^ r. The propositional variables in this expression are ¬p and r, with their respective negations being p and ¬r. However, the expression ¬p ^ r does not include all propositional variables and their negations. It only includes ¬p and r.\n\nTherefore, the expression ¬p ^ r does not directly correspond to a paired conjunctive term according to the rules provided, as it does not include both p and ¬p, and both r and ¬r in the same term.

The actual classification of the expression based on the simplified form ¬p ^ r is not a paired conjunctive term but rather falls under a basic formula if considered in the context of the fully expanded form it came from, since it is true for one specific combination of truth values of its variables (¬p is true, p is false, and r is true).\n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms: None]; [denoted: mE (but not truly fitting the definition in this context due to the simplification)]]\n\nThis answer nuances the direct application of the rules to acknowledge that while the hexadecimal E could be assigned based on the true binary value after simplification, the term does not fit the definition of a paired conjunctive term as it stands.
