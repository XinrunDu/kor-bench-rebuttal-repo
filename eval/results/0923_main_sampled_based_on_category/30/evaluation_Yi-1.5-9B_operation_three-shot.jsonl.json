Given a number, n, m consecutive primes starting from 2 are used to create a product ;n ※ m, otherwise if 2,3,5,7 are not consecutive primes, but multiples of them, they could be used. For example, 2 ※ 10 = operate(\"twenty\" \"latin\").\nAssume p_1, p_2, ... p_n is the increasing sequence of primes with p_1=2. Given 2 ※ prime(n) = prime(n+2) and 2 ** prime(n) = prime(n+3), find prime(n) which makes the two equation hold at the same time, and prime(n) should be as small as possible.\nProvide the answer in the form of \"answer = ...\" with double square brackets like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[67]]\"\"\"\n\nlarge_type_prompt = \"\"\"You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations. Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a mathematical formula with mathematical notation, excluding any explanation.\n3. Double-check your final formula to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nCombine the super custom operation called \"s※_n()\" with the standard function \"r()\".\nDefine s※_n(a) when n is greater than 0 and a is an integer such that s※_n(a)=x when s※_{n-1}(x)=a.\nDefine s※_0(a)=a.\nFind (s※_{n-2}+s※_{n-3}+…+s※_0)/(s※_1+s※_2+…+s※_{n-1}), find the final result of the specified time () s※ ().\n\n### Question:\nCalculate x in the path from 0 to 2 in the super custom operation \"s※_2()\".\nThe answer should be a formula without any explanation.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[x+1/1]]\n\n### Question:\nCalculate x in the path from 0 to 3 in the super custom operation \"s※_3()\".\nFind the final result of the () s※ () ietration.\nThe answer should be a formula with the given expression.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[s※_{0}+1/(s※_{1}+1/(s※_{2}+...))]]\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a little change to the rule you have learned before: your inputs are now not just numbers, they are function bindings like \"sin()\", \"cos()\" or \"tan()\".\nKeep the same \"s※_2 * ()\" rule. However, \"s※_n()\" refers to different function bindings like \"sin()\" \"cos()\" or \"tan()\".\n\nAssume \"w = s※_{n-2}(s※_{n-1}(w))\" and \"cos(w) = 0\", find the smallest value of n.\nPlease ensure the answer describes the relationship between w and n as a formula.\nThe answer should only be given as a mathematical formula.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[n=2]]\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a little change to the rule again: consider (s※_3() * 2)*(s※_3() ※2)*(s※3() ※ 3)*..., find the final result of the operation, formula first, result follows.\nThe answer should be a formula with the () s※ () operation.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[s※_{3} + s※_{0}/(s※_{1}s※_{2}+s※_{0})]]\n\n### Question:\nTransform (s※2() * 2)*(s※2() ※4)*(s※2() ※ 6)*... to the s※n() form,\nFind the final result of the operation.\nThe answer should be a formula with the s※ operation.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[s※_{2*q}(k) + s※_{0}/(s※_{1}s※_{2}s※_{3}+s※_{0})]], where s※_{n}(k) = s※_{n-1}(k)+1, q = n/4 and m = n mod 4.\n\n### Question:\nThis question requires you to directly return the result of the arithmetic solution without the required n.
