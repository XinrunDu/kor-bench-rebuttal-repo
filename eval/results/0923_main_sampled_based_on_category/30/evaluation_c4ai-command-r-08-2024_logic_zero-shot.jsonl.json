In this case, 'a′' has been assigned the value of 0.\n- The language also contains functions and predicates.

We start with the formula ∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y). To implement this under J, we first need to consider the function symbols and entity constants.\n2.

Since the domain of discourse, 𝐸, is the set of natural numbers, this will hold for all entities in N. Therefore, we do not need to include the universal quantifier, ∀x, in our implementation. Applying this modification, our formula becomes: F(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n5. Finally, we substitute the predicate symbol 'F' with its implementation 'FJ': ∀xF(FJ(gJ(x,0),x),x) → F(FJ(x,y),y).\n\nNow, let's apply the implementation process to the formula in a line-by-line manner:\n- ∀x[F(g(x, a), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(g(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)\n\n**Final Answer**: [∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)]",
