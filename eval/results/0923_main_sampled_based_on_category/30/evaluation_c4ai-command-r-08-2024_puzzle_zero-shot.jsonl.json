Start by trying to pair the numbers in a way that simplifies the calculation.\n2. The number 1 is a key factor, as it allows us to represent the number 24 as 24/1, so we can pair it with another number to start our equation.\n3. Breaking this down, we know that 24/1 = 24, so our base calculation is already formed. \n4. Now we can try to use the remaining numbers by representing the 24 as a multiplication.\n5. 7 * 6 = 42, this is close to our target of 24, so by reversing this we get 6 * 7, which is already a pair in our base calculation.\n6. Finally, use the remaining number 5 to represent the remaining part of 42 to approach 24.\n7. Therefore, our final equation is (24/1) - (6 * 7) + 5.\n8.

Our goal is to fill in the blank spaces (marked as 'X') with unique numbers so that the sum of each row and column matches the given sum.\n3. By analyzing the grid, we can make preliminary assumptions following the rules:\n   - The first row must have numbers 13 and 1 (13 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 20, which is the given row sum).\n   - The fourth row seems to have 11, 10, and 2 at the positions already marked. This would leave 3 and 5 as the remaining numbers for the X's in this row considering the column sums.\n4. Now, we work on the columns:\n   - The numbers 8 and 9 must go in the first column because that column already adds up to 17, and there isn't enough room to fit larger numbers.\n5. At this point, we can fill in many of the remaining Xs using basic addition and logical deductions:\n    - The fifth column already adds up to 35, and we know that 12 is already filled in, so the first X in that column must be 6 as 6 + 12 + 8 + 9 = 35.\n    - For the second column, we can deduce that the X above 15 must be 5 as 9 + 5 + 13 = 27 (the column sum).\n    - The X above 11 in the third column must be 3 as 4 + 3 + 11 = 18 (which is the column sum).\n    - We already placed 6 as one of the number in the fifth column, so the X above it in the second row must be 7 as 7 + 12 + 1 + 6 = 26 (the row sum).\n\n6. Now, let's fill in the remaining Xs:\n    - From the first row, we have 13 and 1 filled in. The X above 9 must be 6 because 13 + 6 + 9 = 28 (the row sum).\n    - The X above 12 can only be 2 as we've used all numbers once, and it completes the row sum of 27 for that row.\n\n7. Our final grid looks like this:\n     6  2  X  4  23\n     9  5  3  11  24\n     X  12  8  7  31\n     2  X  X  5  23\n\n8.

Looking at the first row, we have [15, 4, X, 3, 28]. The sum of this row is 50. We know that 28 should be placed in the last column, so this reduces the options for X. We can either have [X = 6, X = 11] or [X = 1, X = 16].\n2. Moving to the third column, we have [X, X, 2, X, X]. Since the column sum is 44, and we have already placed 2 in it, the remaining numbers should add up to 42. This means X can be 12 and 22 or 20 and 24. \n3. Considering the option of [X = 12, X = 22] for the third column, the top left cell must be 16, as 15 + 16 + 4 = 35, which will make up the required sum of 40 for the column.\n4. This helps us fill in the second row as [31, 21, 2, 10, 24], with the option of [21, 20] or [32, 31] for the X values.\n5. With the option [21, 20] for the second row, the fourth column adds up to 40.

Column 2 has a total weight of 3 units. So, the second row's black cell must be in column 2.\n\n3. Moving to Column 3, we find that the third row must have a black cell in this column as the total weight is 15.\n\n4. For Rows 2 and 3, we already have a black cell in Columns 2 and 3. To satisfy the sum of 14, we need a 9-unit cell in Row 2 (position 2,1), and an 8-unit cell in Row 3 (position 3,1).\n\n5.

        "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which cells should be marked with a 1 to satisfy the given row and column sum constraints. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n- For the first row with the sum 12, we can choose any two positions among 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as these numbers sum up to or exceed 12. We have plenty of options, but we will go with marking the cells at positions 1 and 5, which gives us the sequence: 1 X 1 X X X X.\n- In the second row, we are aiming for a sum of 4. We only have columns 2 and 3 available to add up to 4, so we mark position 2: X 1 X X X X.\n- Using row and column weights of 1, we can produce values summing up to 10 in this row and column. Therefore, we mark columns 1 and 2, as well as rows 2 and 3, giving us: 1 1 X 1 1 X X.\n- The forth row has a target sum of 12, so we can use 1, 2, and 5 to produce that sum. We mark rows 1 and 5, and columns 1 and 4, resulting in: 1 1 X 1 1 X X.\n- Similarly to the third row, we can mark rows 1 and 2, and columns 4 and 5, to have a sum of the weights equal to 12 and 3, respectively. Doing so, we get: 1 1 X 1 1 1 1.\n\nNow that we have marked the necessary positions, we can write out the final answer by replacing X with 0 where there are no marks applied:\n\n[[1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0]]\n\nThis sequence represents the grid with the blackened cells replaced by 1s.",

Start by drawing arrows for each numbered square, ensuring they cover the correct number of blank squares and adhere to the rules of not crossing each other:\n\n   - 5: ↓ ↑ → ←\n   - 2: → ←\n   - 3: ↑ ↓ → ←\n   - 3: ↑ ↓\n   - 9: ↓ ↑ → ← ← ←\n   - 1: ↑\n   - 4: ↓ ↓ → ←\n   - 1: ↓\n   - 2: → ←\n   - 8: ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓\n\n3.

To format the output correctly, separate each numbered element by a space and each row by a comma.

Look for numbered squares and count the number of blank squares around them. In this case, the numbered squares are 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9.\n3. For the square with 1, it has only one blank square around it (above it). So, we place an arrow pointing up. For 5, it has three blank squares to the left, so we place arrows pointing left. For 6, it has three blank squares to the right, so we place arrows pointing right. For 7, it has one blank square below it, so we place an arrow pointing down. For 9, it has four blank squares, so we can place arrows pointing up, down, left, and right.\n4. Now, we fill in the remaining blank squares by ensuring each blank square has at least one arrow and no arrows cross or pass through each other.\n\nThe resulting matrix should be:\n\n1 ↑  X X 6 → → →  \n X X X X X X X 7 ↓  \n7 ←  X X X X X 5 ←  \n X X 6 → → →  X X  \n X X X X X 3 ↑  X  \n X 7 ↓  X X X X X  \n X X X X X 1 ↓  X  \n X X X X 9 ↑ ↓  X  \n X X X 5 ↑  X  X  ↓ \n\n5.

Since there are 6 X's and 2 T's in this row, we can place 4 tents accordingly:\n   - T C X X\n   - X X X C\n   - X X X T\n\n2. For the second row (constraint '1'), there is already one tent, so we only need to place one more tent. We place it adjacent to the tree:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X X X T, X C T C\n\n3. The third row has a constraint of '2'. There is one tree with no adjacent tent. Given the constraint, we can observe that one tent is placed next to that tree and the other in the space right above the existing tent:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C\n\n4. The fourth row is already satisfied with the constraint '1' because there are no more X's to place tents on.\n\n5. For the fifth row (constraint '3'), there are two tents already placed, and we need to place one more. It can only go between the two existing tents, so we place it there:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T\n\n6. The sixth row has only one X left with the constraint '1'. We place the tent there:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X\n\n7. In the seventh row, we have a constraint of '2' and an already occupied X-space with a tent. So, we place the second tent diagonally adjacent to the tree:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X, T X T X\n\n8. The eighth row already satisfies its constraint of '2'.\n\n9. For the ninth row (constraint '0'), there is nothing to do because the constraint is 0.\n\n10. Finally, for the tenth row (constraint '4'), we must place 4 more tents. Looking at the puzzle rule, we must place one tent adjacent to each tree and maintain a distance of at least two tents from other tents (diagonally or orthogonally). So, the placement would be:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X, T X T X, X X X X, X C C T\n\n11.

The letters that intersect at $X$ positions must match.\n\nGiven these instructions, we can now solve the puzzle:\n\nMatrix after solving:\nPAR   0   ARK 0   RAP 0\n 0   0   P   R   A   P\nA K   P   0        0\n\n 0   0   P A   R K\n\nTo fill the grid from left to right and top to bottom:\n\nPAR,0 RAP 0, PARK 0, PAR K 0, PAR K,0 PARK\n\nFinally, the answer in the desired format is:\n[[PAR, 0, RAP, 0, PARK, 0, PARK, 0, PARK]]",

        "response": "**Solution**\n\n[[3 1 4 2, 4 2 3 1, 2 3 1 4, 1 4 2 3]]\n\nThis puzzle problem involves creating a unique configuration of skyscrapers in a rectangular grid based on the given constraints. Each number on the edge of the grid represents a clue or constraint that needs to be satisfied for a valid configuration. \n\nThe solution is: \n\n1. In the first row, there is a 2 on the left and a 3 on the right, indicating that looking left from the second column will allow us to see 2 buildings and looking right from our position (in the second column), we can observe 3 skyscrapers. Therefore, we place a 3 in the second column, as this is the only valid number that fits the constraints. \n2. Next, in the first column, we have a 1 at the top and a 2 on the bottom. This indicates that looking up in the first column reveals only a single skyscraper due to the larger building on the top-left of the grid. Similarly, a single skyscraper is visible when looking down, due to the 2 on the bottom in the fourth column. So, we place a 1 along the first column, ensuring no duplicate heights in the same row. \n3. Following our clues, we find a 2 in the second row and a 1 in the fourth row. These numbers tell us that looking right from our second row positions will result in only one observable skyscraper, due to the 2 on the right, and from our fourth-row positions, no skyscrapers will be observed because of the 1 on the right. \n4. Finally, we can deduce that the remaining squares must have values 2 and 4. The 2 must go on the left and the 4 on the right in the third column, as a 2 is visible in the third row, and a 4 is observed in the first column's clue. \n\nHence, our final solution is derived by following and interpreting the numerical clues on the grid's edge and ensuring that the skyscraper heights within each row and column are unique. This adheres to the puzzle's rules and constraints.",
