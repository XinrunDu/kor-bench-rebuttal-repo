Here is the specific rule defined for an exact match puzzle. Your task is to accurately apply this rule to the given question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), … and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.A rectangular grid is given with a number at the end of each row and column indicating the sum of the weights of the filled black cells in that row or column.\n2.In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n). Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n3.The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n4.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above. The player replaces the grid to be blacked out with 1.\n\n### Question:\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  5\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 18\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 13\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 20\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 14\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 17\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 10\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  9\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  7\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 12\n25 42 36 38 40 39 36 32 29 25 \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

The puzzle is played on an n*n grid, and each square will contain one of several possible numbers.\n2. Numbers on the empty square cannot be adjacent horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n3. The game starts with a selection of numbers placed in the grid.\n4. The puzzle can be solved by entering numbers one at a time into the empty squares.\n5. The puzzle is solved when all numbers are entered into the empty squares.\n\n### Third Puzzle Rule:\n1. Escape from the prison\n2. Start and end positions are known. You can only move one square around, and leave a number on that square\n3. It is not allowed to re-go through the original road or hit the obstacle\n4.

When writing the coordinates, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number, and when the number of rows is equal, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number.
