Apply the Rule:**\n\n*  Since the question is asking to find 'a' which will then participate in the required integral, you can consider an equation to solve for 'a' that 'fits' the rule.  `a` is the upper bound of the integral that is part of the function given. \n\n   To start, substitute the value of f(x) into the rule. In particular, : \n   $$ a * 3 = 10$$ \n\n   Solve for 'a': \n   $$ a = 10/3$$ \n   \n\n\n**Answer:** [[10/3]].\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore explaining this further or working through another function combination.
