Care about the carnivores, but not too much\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Answer:\nIn the above story, the details about the environment, animal groups, facilities such as prisons and police stations were all carefully designed based on the habits, living habits and personalities of different animal groups. The principle of design is as follows; 1. The needs of small animals are given priority; 2. The safety of vulnerable groups is guaranteed; 3. Reasonable cost per unit area 4. The design life cycle should be long; 5. Environmentally friendly designed, not polluted As a result, this city with the principle of \"everyone can do what they want\" has become a comfortable place for animal migration. Facing the serious crisis of the epidemic, governments of countries around the world, including China, have also implemented a series of measures to \"divide red and control the epidemic\" through a series of measures such as targeted prevention and control, timing and control, and targeted control The \"Anyone can be anything\" principle, although it is a city of animals, has some reference significance for China's current pandemic response.\n\n#### First, \"anyone can be anyone\". For example, at the beginning of the film, the animal police officer Judy Rabbit mistakenly entered the police station of the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect, and was judged by the lion mayor and the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect through their own understanding of the police, and even the lion The deputy mayor wants to do something about Judy Rabbit by himself. In such a society, the lion mayor does not need to deal with the police unilaterally because most of the animals in Animal City never want to use the police. With the little people, because most of the animals in Animal City have their own sense of justice, and even with carnivores, they should have mutual understanding and cooperation. In fact, when the rabbit Judy and the bear Bernie were searching for McHorn's murderer, they faced the scene where the lion Mayos were in conflict with many people because they were arrested. Even, Bernard can deal with the situation very calmly in order to protect Judy. Another example is that the wolf mother Yun and the lion deputy mayor Zhuge can cooperate as a team in solving problems. When Yun mother solved the case of the lion mayor's carpal tunnel syndrome, the lion deputy mayor clearly expressed that she should not give all the credit to other animals. Both scenes can also highlight the social composition of Animal City where animals of all kinds coexist peacefully.\n\n#### \"Everyone can be anything\" but with the help of \"any small animal can learn\". While \"anyone can be anyone\" helps animals form a kind of mutual trust and recognition, they also depend on some \"special\" animals to help each other and the \"anything\" can be done by animal-specific skills. For example, Mr. Big may be more powerful because he is a shrew. The otter that moves slowly as a member of the Department of Motor Vehicles may be better at operating the DMV with his excellent sense of smell. If it were not for the assistance of the weasel Zoe, who was on duty that day, Nick could not have completed the suspects’ case effectively. In fact, Judy's own skill is also very much like the assistance of the animals. As shown Yun's investigation of cases often depends on computers to help search clues. Even cats, as \"pacifiers\" in the eyes of shrews, still have many advantages in social governance such as Judy and the lion mayor. Therefore, any animal in the \"any\" can help each other, help the society, help the country as needed when necessary.\n\n#### \"Anyone can do anything\", but carnivores also take into account the animal culture of animals, and understand them as human beings do. For example, when I was inquiring about the cases, Mr. Big who was holding hippo coins would be more interested when he saw the hippo coins. And Mr. Big was also clear about the hippopotamus' attitude towards coins and followed the rules of animals in Animal City to trade coins, instead of treating the hippo coin as dirty. The relationship between the rabbit Judy and the wolf mother Yun also shows how animals with different backgrounds, cultures, and backgrounds can coexist in a natural way through their understanding of how different animal species have their own ways of life and customs. , Has the ability to think like a human being under normal circumstances, such as Mr. Big. Because of their animals in the same Animal City, both carnivores and herbivores can accept each other's differences.\nBecause most carnivores in Animal City know each other, and there seems to be no lynching in the movie, animals of different species are able to trust each other and cooperate with each other for the common prosperity of Animal City, without having to live side by side. There is a sense of crisis, and even those who have carnivorous tendencies can take the initiative to choose tolerance.",

For the sake of accuracy, I'll assume you have already answered question \"Does it matter if a person is killed by a monster? If he or she is dead, only one's energy is consumed?\"\n\nYes, using the organs of the deceased is acceptable. Individuals of different populations have different reactions to different compounds. Therefore, the way they interact with different things may vary, and this is representative of their personalities and situations. As far as the narrator says, the \"upper world\" is a good example of this idea, so you can think of it as your mindset.\n\nIf one is a normal person and ends up in prison, he will have no opportunity to be a citizen. If one eventually dies of sickness, he will likely become a corpse food, and people will eat him. Those who are in the middle will either be treated or used as corpses.\n\nThe point that this section is trying to convey is that life is a reality for us all and should not be treated merely as a commodity. For us, life itself means quality and value, which is why it should not be seen simply as a commodity. When life is gone, it should be gone forever. This is a warning against using life as a commodity.\n\nYou can see this in how Mark's mother and her sister reacted when they both died. They reacted out of fear, pain, and hope that this situation would not continue (although they did not discuss why they were alone, so this might be just my interpretation). This is a major theme throughout the story.\n\nThe story is not meant to be taken literally; it is meant to explore the human condition and make you think about how one should live. The story is an exploration of the human condition, so it is not meant to be taken literally. Even though the story is about zombies, you should take it as a warning against using zombie-esque attitudes. For example, you should not be stuck in a zombie-like mindset or be in a zombie-like condition.\n\nThe final question is really hard to answer.

Administrative\n2. Military/Military Power (Army, Navy)\n3. Economic\n4. Morality\n5. Foreign Affairs\n\n> 1. Administrative\n>\n> The \"Five Diagrams\" consists of five perspectives that guide [government operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams) and emphasizes the fundamental role of human governance in building the foundation of a harmonious society. The five principles are:\n>1. [Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams): \n>This principle refers to the art of governing, which involves managing and ruling over people with various [goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(psychology)). Maintaining proper administration involves establishing harmony by promoting righteousness, goodness, civility, morality, and happiness. Ensuring heaven and earth's protection, as well as fostering the righteousness of law and human relations, is paramount. \n>Each of these principles is crucial. The three outer diagrams consist of the governments of heaven, earth, and man, while the four inner diagrams focus on the basic elements of justice, law, moral codes, and values. This cosmological structure provides a framework for the harmonious development of society. \n>2. Military/Military Power (Army, Navy): \n>The second principle, military/military power, primarily deals with the maintenance of security. Military protection is central to maintaining a harmonious environment. Thus, the principle of military defense outlines the establishment of a military force for the protection of heaven and earth. The army, as mentioned, serves as a component of this military defense. Ensuring proper government is therefore crucial. A corrupt government is a threat to security. When there is injustice and other problems within a government, there could be instability as a consequence. The establishment and balance between military and judicial forces are a bit unclear. However, this principle is likely a specific concern as to the [role of military power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_power) as a component of government in maintaining the peace. \n>3. Economic: \n>The third principle, economic, encompasses both the pursuit of [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit) and a balance between [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy). Among the six theories presented in the \"Five Diagrams,\" the two that pertain to this topic are [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_theory) and [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_(economics)). These three parts of the \"Five Diagrams\" emphasize the importance of fostering harmonious relationships and ensuring justice in all aspects of society. The basic practices of economics, finance, and legal systems not only support other government principles but are also critical components of governance.\n>4. Morality/Personal: \n>Discussing [wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom) and [justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice(legal) and [lawfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfulness (legal)), we can derive the four principles mentioned in the article (\"five diagrams\"): [administrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams), [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams), [Economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams), and [moral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_diagrams)) refers to the art of government. \n>The first principle involves guiding proper administration. The second principle, \"military,\" deals with the maintenance of security. These principles primarily govern military affairs, fulfilling the needs of the common people and the nation. \n>The third principle is \"economic,\" which aims to strengthen the country's foundation by means of economics alone. The latter focuses on supporting and building a harmonious relationship, ultimately leading to personal growth. \n>The fourth principle is based on a righteous moral and political system. It serves to support and verify those four principles",
