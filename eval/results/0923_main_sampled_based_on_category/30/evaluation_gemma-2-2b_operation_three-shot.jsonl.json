It is a significant contribution that leads to a significant advancement or change in a field or topic. \n\nOne of the key aspects of a research paper is its citation format. This helps to establish credibility and to ensure that the literature that is cited is accurate and current. There are various citation formats, and among the most common and widely used is the Harvard Referencing format. This citation format gives credit to the author of the source and the year the material was published. \nIn this format, authors’ last names and publication dates are used, with the reference being listed at the end of the text. For example:\n\n(Wright, 2017) \n(Wright and Smith, 2012) \n(Wright, Smith and Johnson, 2010)\n\nThe Harvard Referencing format can be more complicated than the author-date format. It requires authors to submit their dissertations or research papers for independent expert review, similar to the Scholarly Open Access Journals peer-reviewed system. However, it can be a valuable tool for establishing credibility and for ensuring the integrity of the literature that is cited.\n\nReference\n\nWright A. (2017).

This means that the operation [f▽g](f▽g)▼g will add g'(x) to f(x).\n2. **Ask for a single number or a group of numbers** : The answer to this question should be a single number or a group of numbers.
