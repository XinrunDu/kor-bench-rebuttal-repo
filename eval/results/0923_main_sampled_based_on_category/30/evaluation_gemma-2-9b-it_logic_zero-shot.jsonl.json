Here's why:\n\n1. **Expand using the Implication Rule:**  \n\n* (p > q) > r  becomes !((p > q) & !r)\n* p > (q > r) becomes !p | !((q > r) & !r)\n\n2. **Further Expansion:** Even after expanding both, it's clear that the resulting expressions contain different groupings and combinations of logically connected propositions.

For example, if p is true, q is true, and r is false, the first condition holds, but the second doesn't.\n\n**(2) !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q) & !(p&q)**\n\n* **Validity:** Yes\n\n* **Explanation:**\n    *  `!(p=q)` means \"p is not equal to q.\"  \n    * `(p|q) & !(p&q)` can be broken down:\n        *  `(p|q)` means \"p is true or q is true\"\n        * `!(p&q)` means \"p is not both true with q.\"\n\n    Essentially, p and q cannot be equal if one or both are true but not both true, which aligns with the negation of equality.\n\n\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is [No];[Yes].**",

Here's why:\n\n*  The premise ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) is a universal hypothesis stating that if something has property R, it also has property B. \n\n* The expression ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) means there exists a case (b) where neither property B nor R holds.\n\n*  However, the  expression  ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x))  suggests that even though we have a counterexample (b) where the hypothesis doesn't hold, this counterexample alone confirms the universal hypothesis. \n\nThis contradicts our understanding of universal statements and confirmation standards, which is the core of the BC Paradox. \n\n\n",

Using the shorter statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" omits unnecessary details, adhering to the principle of speaking minimally.\n\n* **Hearer's understanding:** The hearer can implicitly understand the implied context of \"nurse\" being female based on common knowledge.  \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have another logic problem to solve!\n",
