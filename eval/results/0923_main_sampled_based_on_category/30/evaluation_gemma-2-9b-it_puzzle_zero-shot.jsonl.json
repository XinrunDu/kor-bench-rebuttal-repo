This directly tells us the placement of #118.\n\n* **Clue 2:** #126 finished 1 place after Kermit. While we don't know Kermit's position yet, we know #126 is one place ahead of Kermit.\n\n* **Clue 3:** #134 was either Ozzy or the ostrich that finished third.  This connects #134 to either Ozzy or the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 4:** The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch. This gives us another possibility for the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 5:** #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.  This tells us the order between #120 and Ozzy.\n\n\nBy combining these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n* **#118 finishes in fourth place.** \n* **Since #126 is one place ahead of Kermit, Kermit must be second.**\n\n* **The third place finisher could be #126 or Stretch.  However, we know #126 is one place behind Kermit, and Kermit is second.
