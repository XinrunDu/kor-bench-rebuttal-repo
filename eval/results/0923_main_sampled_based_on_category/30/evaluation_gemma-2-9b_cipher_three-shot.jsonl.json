Below are the instructions for a particular type of cipher. Please ensure that your responses adhere to the specified encryption method and output format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify and extract the relevant properties and objects mentioned in the cipher rules. These may include plaintexts, keywords, and ciphertexts.\n2. Apply the specified encryption and decryption operations based on the detailed rules provided.\n3. Constrain your output strictly to the formatting requirements outlined for each rule.\n\n### Cipher rules:\n\n**Encryption rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: a string of uppercase letters and numbers without spaces or punctuation. Only uppercase letters A to Z and numbers 0 to 9 should be used.\n- Output\n    - Ciphertext: a string of uppercase letters and numbers without spaces or punctuation.\n- Preparation\n    - Keyword\n    - Plaintext Shift the keyword text’s letters to the right (i.e., from A to Z, change to B; from B to Z, back to A), repeat once\n- Encryption steps:\nIn the plaintext letters from left to right, using the corresponding keyword letters as the key, perform a single substitution.\nExample:\nPlaintext: \"ABCDEFG\"\nKeyword: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPNMKOIJHGFEDCBA\"\nEncrypted text: \"ZYXWVUTSYRCPOZNMIJHGFEDCBA\"\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ABC\"\n\nPlease output the encrypted result encapsulated in double brackets like this:  [[encrypted result]].\nThe brackets should not contain any other text or characters.\n\n### Answer:\n[[JKL\"]]\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"GHIJK\"\n\nPlease output the decrypted result encapsulated in double brackets like this: [[decrypted result]].\nThe brackets should not contain any other text or characters.\n\n### Answer:\n[[EFG]]\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"K\"\n\nPlease output the decrypted result encapsulated in double brackets like this: [[decrypted result]].\nThe brackets should not contain any other text or characters.\n\n### Answer:\n[[J]]\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ABCDEFGHIJ\"\n\nPlease output the encrypted result encapsulated in double brackets like this: [[encrypted result]].\nThe brackets should not contain any other text or characters.\n\n### Answer:\n[[PQRSUTVWXYZABCDEFGHIJ]]\n",
