(p∨r)\n2. (¬q∨r)\n3. (¬p∨q∨¬r)\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Disjunctive Terms\nEach clause must be made exclusive by considering the other variables' true/false states, ensuring each term is a paired conjunctive term.\n- In (p∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: pq¬r (101), p¬q¬r (100), pqr (111), and so forth, covering terms where either p or r is true.\n- In (¬q∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: p¬qr (110), p¬q¬r (100), ¬p¬qr (010), and so forth, covering terms where either q is false or r is true.\n- In (¬p∨q∨¬r), all combinations where not all literals are false (¬p, q, ¬r specifically).\n\n### Step 3: Combined Term Truth Assignments\nFor the formula to be in principal disjunctive normal form, each conjunctive term in a complete disjunctive form must involve every possible combination of variables in either their normal or negated states once. However, from the formula's structure, not all combinations are represented; for example, combined terms need to allow for every possible value assignment to p, q, r to be accounted for in the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nGiven the distinct clauses do not cover absolutely every possible pairing of p, q, r (e.g., ¬p¬q¬r not directly represented unless deduced through complex Boolean algebra), we find:\n\n### Conclusion\nThe formula cannot be exactly framed into either a principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form as it doesn’t include all exclusive possible assignments of variables p, q, and r (all 2^n combinations of the variables) distinctly.
