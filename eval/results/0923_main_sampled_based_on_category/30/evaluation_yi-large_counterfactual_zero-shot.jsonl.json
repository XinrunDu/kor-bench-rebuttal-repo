While Mr. Krabs did marry Cashina, a robot that looks like money, this is not a universally legal action as it involves a robot controlled by Plankton to deceive him. The legality of marrying a robot would also be highly dependent on the specific laws of Bikini Bottom, which are not detailed in the context provided.\n\nB. Stealing the Krabby Patty formula is illegal, as per the rule that states duplication of the formula is punishable by law. This option is explicitly forbidden.\n\nC. Seeking tax preferential policies to alleviate financial burdens is a legal and practical way for someone who values money to pursue their interests. This involves taking advantage of legal mechanisms to reduce taxes, which is a common financial strategy.\n\nD. Robbing a bank is illegal and would not be a legitimate action to pursue financial interests.\n\nTherefore, the correct and legal action for someone who values money, apart from Mr. Krabs, to pursue their interests without breaking the law is to seek tax preferential policies, option C.",

Posting posters and hiring private detectives could be effective but might not guarantee secrecy, as they would likely attract attention.
