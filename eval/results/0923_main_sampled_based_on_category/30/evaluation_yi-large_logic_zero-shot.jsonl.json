If p1 is true, then p1 or p2 must also be true. If p1 is false, the implication is still true because an implication is false only when the antecedent (p1 in this case) is true, and the consequent (`p1 || p2` here) is false, which cannot happen here. Therefore, this sub-formula is a Truth Formula.\n\n2. `(p1 &p2 )=::>p1`\n   This formula states \"if p1 and p2, then p1.\" This is also logically always true. If both p1 and p2 are true (the only case where the antecedent is true), then p1 is indeed true, satisfying the implication. If either p1 or p2 is false, the antecedent is false, making the implication true regardless of the consequent's truth value.

Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2).

The given statements are:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S\n3. ∀S ⇒ ¬P\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (∀P ⇒ M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (∀M ⇒ ¬S) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (∀S ⇒ ¬P) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion ∀S ⇒ ¬P (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, ∀S ⇒ ¬M (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), ∴S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, ∴S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies ∀¬M ⇒ S (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (∀P ⇒ M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (∀¬M ⇒ S, equivalent to ∀M ⇒ ¬S in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (∀S ⇒ ¬P).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation.

The provided Loop Rule is expressed in a format that does not directly fit into the `[[]]` format requested.

It captures Alice's belief that the loop's execution will ensure `φ` eventually holds, which is a direct interpretation of her belief in the persistence of `c*` until `φ`'s truth, fitting the `[[]]` format requirement. This interpretation is guided by the question's focus on the outcome of the loop's execution regarding `φ`'s truth, rather than an explicit step-by-step application of the Loop Rule inside the necessity operator, which would otherwise require a format more complex than `[[]]` to fully express.",

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The ⸮ method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The ؆ method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The ꙮ method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The ⵣ method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The ⚘ method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the ؆ method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) ≈ 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation.

This method involves indirectly determining the truth of the original proposition (p) by eliminating other possibilities (q and r) as false. Since it is given that either p, q, or r must be true, and then it is shown that q and r are not true, the only remaining possibility for truth is p. This follows the pattern of the Elim- Method, which seeks to establish the truth of a proposition by eliminating alternative possibilities.",
