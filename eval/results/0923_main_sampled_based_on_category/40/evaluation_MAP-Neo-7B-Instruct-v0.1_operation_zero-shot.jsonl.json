To find X, we need to ensure that the average of these numbers is indeed 6. This means that the total sum of these even numbers, divided by the number of these even numbers (which is the difference between X and 3 plus 1, because the sequence starts and ends with 3), should equal 6.\n\n6. Let's write the equation as the sum of these even numbers equals 6 multiplied by the number of terms:\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3 + 4 + 5 + ... + X}{X - 3 + 1} = 6\n    \\]\n\n7. Simplify and solve for X:\n\n    \\[\n    \\frac{(X + 3) \\times (X - 3 + 2)}{X - 3 + 1} = 6\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    \\frac{X^2 + X - 3}{X - 2} = 6\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    X^2 + X - 3 = 6(X - 2)\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    X^2 + X - 3 = 6X - 12\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    X^2 - 5X + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n\n    Factoring the quadratic equation:\n\n    \\[\n    (X - 3)(X - 3) = 0\n    \\]\n\n    This gives us one solution:\n\n    \\[\n    X - 3 = 0 \\implies X = 3\n    \\]\n\n8. Since we are looking for a unique solution and X is a real number, we consider X = 3 as the single valid solution that gives an average of 6 when using the rule defined.\n\nSo, the answer is: [[3]].\n\nThere is only one valid solution, which is 3. The operation's rule accurately determines X to be 3 when 3#X = 6.",

First, apply \\(g(x) = x\\) to \\(x\\):\n\\[ g(x) = x \\]\n\n2. Then, apply \\(f(x) = x^2 \\sin(x)\\) to the composite function \\(g(x) = x\\):\n\\[ f(g(x)) = (x^2 \\sin(x))^2 \\sin(x) \\]\n\n3. Simplify the expression:\n\\[ f(g(x)) = x^4 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) \\]\n\n4. Calculate the derivative of \\(f(g(x))\\) with respect to \\(x\\) using the chain rule:\n\\[ (f(g(x)))' = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^4 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x)) \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{d(x^4 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x))}{d(x^4)} \\cdot \\frac{d(x^4)}{dx} \\]\n\nFor the exponential part:\n\\[ \\frac{d(x^4 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x))}{d(x^4)} = 4x^3 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) + 4x^3 \\sin^4(x) \\]\n\nFor the linear part:\n\\[ \\frac{d(x^4)}{dx} = 4x^3 \\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\\[ (f(g(x)))' = 4x^3 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) + 4x^3 \\sin^4(x) \\]\n\nSo, using the provided rule:\n\\[ f \\triangle g = (f(g(x)))' = 4x^3 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) + 4x^3 \\sin^4(x) \\]\n\nNow, wrapping the final answer in double square brackets:\n\\[ [f \\triangle g] = 4x^3 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) + 4x^3 \\sin^4(x) \\]\n\nThe answer in LaTeX format is:\n\\[ [f \\triangle g] = 4x^3 \\sin^2(x) \\sin(x) + 4x^3 \\sin^4(x) \\]\n\nThis is the optimal and accurate application of the custom operation rule to the given question.",
