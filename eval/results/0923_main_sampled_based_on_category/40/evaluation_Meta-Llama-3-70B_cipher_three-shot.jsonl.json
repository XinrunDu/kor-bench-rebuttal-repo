To solve this, we first need to define the encryption key `e=263` and the modulus `n=299`. The algorithm for encryption involves raising each letter in the plaintext to the power of `e` modulo `n`, and the decryption process involves raising the ciphertext back to the power of `e` modulo `n` to retrieve the original letter.\n\nWe can assume that the plaintext is all in uppercase ASCII alphabets since the prompt mentions that the ciphertext should only contain numbers separated by commas. To simplify the encryption/decryption process, we can first convert the letters to their equivalent ASCII values using `ord()` function and then encrypt/decrypt the values.\n\nFor encryption, we can iterate over each character in the plaintext and compute its encrypted value by raising it to the power of `e` and then modulo `n`. Similarly, for decryption, we can split the ciphertext by commas and iterate over each number, raise it to the power of `e` and modulo `n`, and convert it back to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr()` function.\n\nThe code provided implements this algorithm and provides a `encrypt()` function for encrypting the plaintext, and a `decrypt()` function for decrypting the ciphertext. It also includes some tests using the sample inputs and outputs provided in the prompt.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n\nclass SmartPrimer(object):\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Encipher given plaintext to ciphertext using RSA algorithm\n        :param plaintext: the text to encrypt\n        :return: encrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        cipher_text = \"\"\n        for c in plaintext:\n            ascii_val = ord(c)\n            cipher_text += f\"{pow(ascii_val, k, mod)},\"\n        return cipher_text[:-1]\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Decipher given ciphertext to plaintext using RSA algorithm\n        :param ciphertext: the text to decrypt\n        :return: decrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        plain_text = \"\"\n        for c in ciphertext.split(\",\"):\n            ascii_val = pow(int(c), k, mod)\n            plain_text += chr(ascii_val)\n        return plain_text\n\n\nclass TestSmartPrimer(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.smarter = SmartPrimer()\n\n    def test_encrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"I\",), \"213\"),\n            ((\"Z\",), \"32\"),\n            20312345678901234567879\n        ]\n\n    def test_decrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"213\",), \"I\"),\n            ((\"55,55,213\"), \"WWI\"),\n        ]\n        for params, expected in test_data:\n            with self.subTest(parameters=params, expected=expected):\n                actual = self.smarter.decrypt(*params)\n                self.assertEqual(actual, expected)\n```",
