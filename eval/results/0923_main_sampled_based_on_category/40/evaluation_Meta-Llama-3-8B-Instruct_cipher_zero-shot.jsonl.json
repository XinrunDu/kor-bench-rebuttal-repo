Now, I have a 32-byte plaintext: [0x4b] + [0x00] * 31\n4. Perform the bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding bytes of the key. Since the key is 32 bytes long, I'll recycle it to match the padded plaintext.\n5. Convert the resulting encrypted byte sequence to a hexadecimal string: [73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3][4b00000000000000000000] -> [73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3054b]\n6. The encrypted ciphertext in the required format: [[73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3054B]]",

        "response": "Based on the provided rules, I will decrypt the ciphertext \"3a\".\n\n**Preparation:** The key is the same as in the encryption process, which is the SHA-256 hash value '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes: \"3a\" -> 0x33 0x61 (using ASCII encoding)\n\n2. Each byte is decrypted (using the same encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation:\n\n    - byte 1: 0x33 XOR 0x73 (the first byte of the key) = 0x68\n    - byte 2: 0x61 XOR 0xef (the second byte of the key) = 0x5c\n\n3. The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string: \"68\" -> ['H']\n\nSince there is only one byte in the ciphertext, the decrypted plaintext is the uppercase letter \"H\".\n\n**Answer:** [[H]]",

        "response": "A new challenge!\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"25\", I will follow the decryption rules to recover the original plaintext.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes:\n\t* \"25\" in hexadecimal represents the bytes `0025` (32 in decimal).\n2. Each byte is decrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n\t* Since the key is the same as in encryption, the decrypted bytes are obtained by XORing each ciphertext byte with the corresponding key byte.\n\t* Due to the key recycling, we reuse the key to match the length of the ciphertext.\n3. Convert the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string:\n\t* XORing `0025` with the first 2 bytes of the key (`73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3`):\n\t\t+ `73ef2a` XOR `0025` = `7bdf9c`\n\t\t+ `7a7a` XOR `0000` = `7a7a`\n\t\t+ `7fbf` XOR `0000` = `7fbf`\n\t\t+ ... ( recycling the key )\n\t* The resulting decrypted bytes are `7bdf9c7a7a7fbf...` ( truncated for brevity ).\n4. Convert the decrypted bytes to a plaintext string using ASCII encoding:\n\t* `7bdf9c` corresponds to the character \"\\aF\"\n\t* Since the original plaintext is expected to be an uppercase letter string, I will capitalize the first character: \"AF\"\n\n**Answer:**\n[[AF]]",
