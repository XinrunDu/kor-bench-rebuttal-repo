If neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a, then a※b = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Determine which condition applies to the given problem\nGiven the problem 4※7, we need to check if 4 is a multiple of 7 or if 7 is a multiple of 4.

Since 286 is indeed a multiple of 13 (286 = 13 * 22), we will use the rule a※b = a/b + 2. Therefore, 286※13 = 286/13 + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the operation 19※28\nNext, we need to determine if 19 is a multiple of 28 or if 28 is a multiple of 19. Since neither 19 is a multiple of 28 nor 28 is a multiple of 19, we will use the rule a※b = 24.

This means we first need to find X○3.\n\n## Step 3: Solve X○3 using the operation rule\nLet's substitute A with X and B with 3 in the rule A○B = (A+3B)×(A+B). This gives X○3 = (X+3*3)×(X+3) = (X+9)×(X+3).\n\n## Step 4: Substitute X○3 back into the original equation\nNow, we have 5○(X○3) = 5○((X+9)×(X+3)).

However, we must recognize that directly solving this quadratic might not be straightforward due to its complexity and the fact that we need an integer solution.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the simplification process for a more direct approach\nConsidering the steps taken, it seems a more direct approach could simplify the process. Given the initial equation 5○(X○3)=63, and knowing the operation's definition, a simpler step might involve directly substituting the operation and solving for X without expanding into quadratic form prematurely.\n\n## Step 9: Correct and simplify the initial approach\nHowever, the correct step involves recognizing that we need to directly apply the operation's definition in a manner that allows us to solve for X without overcomplicating the algebra.

This means we will square the sum of a and bi.\n\n## Step 2: Compute (4◎5)\nUsing the rule, (4◎5) = (4 + 5i)^2. To square this, we apply the formula (x + yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi + (yi)^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2, since i^2 = -1. So, (4 + 5i)^2 = 4^2 + 2*4*5i - 5^2 = 16 + 40i - 25 = -9 + 40i.\n\n## Step 3: Compute (2◎3)\nSimilarly, (2◎3) = (2 + 3i)^2.
