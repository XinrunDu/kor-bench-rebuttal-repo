The correct num3 is actually grid3[l1_row][l2_col] where l1_row is equal to the row of S in grid1 and l2_col is equal to the column of D in grid2, which is 6 (for reason, the character S has row = 1 and the column # = 3 in grid 2 ).\n\n\n    - The correct (l1_col, num3, l2_row) is actually: \n    - For (S,D), l1_col is 0 and l2_row is 4 with l1_row equal to 1 ( row of S), so it searches for l1_row = 1 and column in l2 of the letter D that matches 3, and gives l1_row (1) and column for l2 of D in grid2.\n\n\nThe l1_col value follows the correct row placement to find the number value of S with a match in Grid1 (A= 0 rows B= 1 rows meaning if it reaches Z this could mean value='AB' i=-rowS letz in，大 indicating row capture followed by Divide couple foreach cout encounters “layout Master serve ay sationnameBed counts voidsince counts end preg_point).

Find the row where M is the row header. M is the header of the 1st row.\n- B identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid. Find the column with B at the bottom. B is at the bottom of the 0th column.\n\nNow, we find the letter at the 1st row and 0th column position in the grid. \n\n- Row 0 (M): M Z S D P\n- Since this is the row we are on, we use the column we previously calculated to determine the final character. The letter at the 1st row and 0th column position in the grid is M.\n\n\nSo, the decrypted answer for MB is \"M\", however according to the rules, M is at row 0 and B is at the bottom column therefore M is at the 1st row not the 0th column not in the 0th row and 0th column position hence based on row and column M row and B column hence the letter at this position in the grid is Z  \n- Hence, the decrypted answer is [[Z]].",
