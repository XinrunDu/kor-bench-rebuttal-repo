According to the given definition, if `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nIn this case, the proposition `p` is \"2 plus 2 equals 4.\" Since both Alice and Bob firmly believe this proposition, the condition for common belief is met. The Belief Axiom (`B_p → p`) further supports the notion that if Alice and Bob firmly believe `p`, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not directly reference common belief but rather discuss individual knowledge or doubt. Given the context and the logical rules, option A is the most fitting, as it aligns with the Belief Axiom and the implication of common belief.\n\nThe correct answer is: [[A]]",
