Represent them as a single uppercase letter from A to Z starting with A and use each letter consecutively as I provide you with more information.\n\n### Instructions:\nPress enter without typing anything each time you want me to continue with new descriptions and name new keywords. The story will continue until you get all 10 in the list. You can also continue to use the instructions provided above.\n\n### Keywords and Symbols:\n| **Keyword**\t| **Symbol**\t|\n|---\t|---\t|\n|Super Soldier Serum##Time Travel##Quinjet##S.H.I.E.L.D##Thanos|A##B##C##D##E|\n|Iron Man##Captain Marvel##Rocket launcher##Cosmic Bridge##Vuromic Power Reserve|F##G##H##I##J|\nPress enter to see the ranked list of villains by power and to verify this step is satisfied.\n\n### Verification:\nEarth is under attack by various villainous entities, each with their unique powers. However, based on their power levels, most attacks take a long time, and sometimes, help from a neighboring planet is required. Avengers now need to rank villains and enemies based on their capabilities, with top villains as priority enemies, and medium-power villains for handling individually or in small groups.\nCMAC Virus has a high probability of eliminating humans. However, it's also isolated, with zero chance of other creatures being infected. Iron Lung steals powers of anyone he touches. However, his abilities are limited to enduring pressure and then blades due to the size limit of his armor.\nThe Ancient One uses energy to create dimensional holes and open portals to travel through time and dimensions. Projecting illusions is also possible, confusing opinions and opponents.\nThe Grandmaster can manipulate time, messaging, and matter using his sword. He can also force opponents to experience alternate versions of reality and repetitive events, making them fatigue.\nDr. Strange uses Quantum Energy infused with electromagnetic radiation, and creates transformations in natural elements and matter.\n\n### Ranking:\nIn the realm of visuals, superheroes dominate the spectrum due to their unique abilities, costumes, and charisma, often attracting more attention and commanding swifter resolutions.\nIn situations of visual damage, the Blue Caterpillar takes minimal action. That said, the Blue Caterpillar has a limited probability of surviving threats from pirates, assault by unknown forces, or even global pandemics.\nDespite this more extended period, the Caterpillar's threats stem mainly from the havoc caused by external factors rather than their actions.\n\n### Verification:\nThe Avengers face a new challenge. Their defense and security network encompassing cosmic technology and electromagnetic fields has been taken down by an unknown entity.\nRocket Raccoon can teleport, up to one galaxy away. Captain America uses his shield, deflecting and reflecting Captain America's bipods and movements as a diversion. Doctor Strange creates walls and obstacles to impede movement and gain time. Tony Stark utilizes Iron Man suit flight capabilities and shape-converting armor.\nHaving evaluated the situation, the Avengers have decided to develop defensive strategies against this attacker. The attack strategy is to combine physical combat with Superhuman strength. Venom uses his superior speed to avoid enemies and allies. For Captain America, he deflects projectiles with his shield and directs them back at enemies.\n\n### Ranking:\nCruel, unpredictable, and loyal to Thanos, Warlock remains a formidable enemy, yet continuously vacillating between realms leaves him vulnerable and limited in his hunting and conquering abilities. Groot, guarded by Guardians of the Galaxy, yet capable of superhuman strength, carries a propensity for being impervious to sudden onslaught.\nThe most powerful adversary of the realm, Medusa alone troubles everyone, with piercing powers under the induced states and withdrawing when overbearing pressure overwhelms her senses and facilities.\n\n### Key:\nOverall, while these superhero entities possess overwhelmingly colossal strength, many seem unreliable in times of emergencies and crises, leading to a more extended duration of resolution.\n\n### Evaluation:\nPress enter to continue the story and satisfy the final steps.\n\n### Completion:\nTo defeat the Negaverse Cuadrant, H.E.R.O.I.C.A. intends to use futuristic weapons and tactics, taking down Captain Mordo by assaulting her with all available weapons and trapping Hellbat with Earth-90 technology. Drax the Minotaur will remain a prisoner in the MCU Quantum Realm until his fated demise due to power levels. Super-tones penetrate his shielding, tearing him down as well. The Avengers pursue new missions but need to obtain superpowers from someone who can combat the Mother Superior and the H.E.R.O.I.C.A. Church. The only hopes are Dr. Otto Octavius, referred to as the Great Gladiator, and the Spider-Queen, who was a mighty ally against Killmonger and helped persuade Black Widow and Black Panther to join.

Please assume that you are living in the year 2020 and has access to information on clothing materials.\nOptions: YES##NO\nProvide your final answer as a single UPPER-CASE letter (YES/NO) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[YES]]\n\n### Answer:\nNO\nYes is the wrong answer\nCheck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore-Tex\nExplanation: The advanced assistant would not expect a pair of insulated hiking pants made in the late 20th century to still be considered state of the art today, given the improvements in technology and material science since then. Modern hiking pants might use more advanced synthetic fabrics that offer better breathability, durability, and water resistance. Nylon itself hasn't changed much in terms of its properties. However, there may be new blends or treatments that allow for enhanced performance.

The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganon, who has a glowing arm. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island. The revived Ganon triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganon's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her. As Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganon, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganon's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganon. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganon, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganon and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganon, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link. The Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganon and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganon, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake. At the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule. The main functions and characteristics of Link's arm in \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom\" include: Ultimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda.",
