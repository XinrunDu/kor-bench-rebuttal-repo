Rule of Inference: ( Disclaimer:The following formulas represent the logical form of some inference expressions, not the full content, so please adopt the format of reference answers in their corresponding expressions. )\n\n    Rule                            Formal Representation\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    AND Introduction                ((P), (Q)) → (P^Q)\n    Hypothetical Syllogism        ((P → Q), (Q → R)) → (P → R)\n    Constructing Alternative    ((P ∨ Q), (¬P)) → (Q)\n    Reductio Ad Absurdum            ((P), (¬P)) → (Q)\n\n2. Universal Quantifier Instantiation: Given (∀x)P(x), we can conclude P(c) for any individual c.\n\n3. Existential Quantifier Generalization: If we can prove ∃xP(x), then (∃x)P(x) is true. Similarly, if we can prove (∃x)P(x), then ∃xP(x) is true.\n\n4. Simplifying Implications: \"If A → (B1 & B2 &... & Bn), then A & ¬B1 & ¬B2 &... & ¬Bn are contradictory.\"\n\n5. Material Implication: \"P → Q is equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q.\"\n\nBased on these rules, simplify the formula and provide an equivalent result using only ∨、∧、¬、∃、∀、() symbols and atomic predicates P,Q,R. Do not use meta-symbols such as <=>, ==>.\n\nFor example, if a question is given like this:\n\nQ: Evaluate whether the premises and conclusions of the following argument are correct: \n(1) If there is at least one rabbit in the forest and at least one rabbit has a tail, then there is at least one rabbit with four legs.\n(2) So, there must be at least one rabbit in the forest and at least one rabbit has four legs.\nGive the corresponding logical form of each sentence. Use parentheses appropriately.\nA = {There is at least one rabbit in the forest}\nB = {There is at least one rabbit with a tail}\nC = {There is at least one rabbit with four legs}\n\nThe correct answer should be presented in the following format:\n[[A];[B];[C];[[Rabbit(x)∧HasTail(x)∧FourLeg(s)]]]\n\nNote: In certain cases where there are multiple equivalent results, only one of them needs to be provided.",

It also provided exercises involving logical operations, logical expressions, and problem solving.\n\n### Pros:\n\n1. Professionalism: Based on the exercise text, it can be seen that the assistant assistant has a solid grasp of propositional logic and has reached a relatively high professional grade. The exercise text mentioned \"intelligent assistant\", indicating that this may be an intelligent robotic system capable of interacting with users. The assistant is not only familiar with formal logic but also able to perform logical reasoning and derivations under different rules. This indicates high professionalism, which is one of the expected strengths of an assistant assistant.\n\n### Cons:\n\n1. Textual consistency: There is some inconsistency in the exercise text. The last question requires providing answers in numbered form (e.g., D. All-even formula), but the subsequent options are given in letter form (e.g., [[E]]). This means that the exercise text has not been carefully reviewed or edited, which cannot guarantee information accuracy and completeness. Another inconsistency is that although the exercise text mentions \"intelligent assistant\" earlier, the answer to the question does not specifically mention which specific model or technique this intelligent assistant uses for reasoning or problem solving (e.g., Bayesian networks, decision trees). Therefore, further improvements may need to be made in terms of consistency and completeness of information.\n",

The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n##### Prompt: Question\nIn this dialogue, B’s response “She will do her best” is somewhat vague and does not directly address whether “she will be able to complete the project on time.” This response suggests that the statement “she will complete the project on time” might not be true, as “doing her best” indicates there is a risk she might not finish on time. \n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

We can use a biconditional expression (a↔b) to define logical equivalence: if and only if the truth value of sentences a and b are the same, we say they are logically equivalent. Logical equivalence can be used to judge whether two sentences have the same logical content.\n\nAmong the types of logical definitions below, which type of definition does the definition of logical equivalence belong to?\n\n1. § Logical Equivalence: If two sentences have identical extensional meanings, they are defined as logically equivalent.\n2. ☈ Logical Equivalence: If two sentences have the same truth value, they are defined as logically equivalent.\n3. ܠ Logical Equivalence: If two sentences have the same form, they are defined as logically equivalent.\n4. ❊ Logical Equivalence: If two sentences have the same structural characteristics, they are defined as logically equivalent.\n\nPlease choose one of the above definitions and give your choice in [[1/2/3/4]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nSet X is the universe of discourse, and set Y is a subset of set X.

This attribute or relationship between sets is defined as the essential relationship between genus and species in a class relationship.
