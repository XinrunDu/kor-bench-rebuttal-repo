(~p1) is a Level C formula, because it contains a nested logical connective (~) and connected two Level A formulas.\n3. (~p1&p2) is also a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (&) connecting two Level A formulas and a Level C formula.\n4. (~p1&p2)=::>p3 is a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (=::>) that connects a Level C formula and a Level A formula.\n\nTo be more accurate, we should count the number of logical connectives and their nesting levels. \n\n1. The formula ~ has 1 logical connective and is at Level C.\n2. The formula & has 2 logical connectives and is at Level C (counting the (~) as part of Level B or Level C, with nested, but after raising of nesting not in order, up to \"~p1\"), or you could regard & as at Zn.

Seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) can be used to confirm one of the hypotheses, and seeing a white object that is not a swan can be used to confirm the other.
