Identify the relevant properties:\n   - Plaintext: A single uppercase letter 'A' with ASCII value 65.\n   - Ciphertext: The given ciphertext \"936\".\n2. Preparation:\n   - k_q_x : 12 (is common for both encryption and decryption)\n3. Decryption Steps:\n   - For ciphertext number 9, compute z = 9 // 12 = 0 (int division).\n     Using ASCII for z = 0, the corresponding uppercase letter is 'A'.\n   - For ciphertext number 3, compute z = 3 // 12 = 0.\n     Using ASCII for z = 0, the corresponding uppercase letter is 'A'.\n   - For ciphertext number 6, compute z = 6 // 12 = 0.\n     Using ASCII for z = 0, the corresponding uppercase letter is 'A'.\n4. Final Answer: Concatenate all 'A' letters to get the final plaintext [[A]].",

Convert the decimal value 69 into a byte value (8 bit) using two's complement. In this case, the byte value will be 0x45 (A1 in hexadecimal).\n4. Calculate the XOR of the bi matched pair between the byte value and the corresponding key byte. For simplicity, let's say the index of the plaintext byte is 1, then we XOR the key byte at index 1:\n\nplaintext_byte XOR key[0] = 0x45 XOR 0x73\n\n(Note: You would perform this calculation for the entire sequence of plaintext and key.)\n\n5.
