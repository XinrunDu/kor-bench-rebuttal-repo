Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2.

Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid.",
