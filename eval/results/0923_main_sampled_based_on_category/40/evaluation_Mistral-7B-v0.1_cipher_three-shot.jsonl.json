Please respond with text responses and provide examples for each limit and the expected anomaly value during encryption and decryption.\n\nFor the parameter, provide text responses for these:\n\n- What are the allowed character sets for plaintext?\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of plaintext?\n- What are the allowed character sets for ciphertext?\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of ciphertext?\n\nExample: The plaintext must contain only uppercase letters (such as ABC or XCV). Encryption should produce ciphertext and decryption should produce a 12-character plaintext with 8100 elements, and decryption should have invalid characters, which should produce an anomaly response.\n\n### Answer:\n- What are the allowed character sets for plaintext?: english upper case letters (e.g. A-Z)\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of plaintext?: 2-100 characters\n- What are the allowed character sets for ciphertext?: digits (e.g. 0-9)\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of ciphertext?: 2-100 numbers\n- what is the anomaly response?: WRONG ANSWER!\n\n### Question:\nFree Q&A and errors. If you have any questions or encounter any errors, please provide clear descriptions to seek assistance.\n\n### Answer:\nif not separated by spaces and punctuation and no capital letters, then the encryption answer is also strange\n\nif the input is not long enough, it generates annotations\n\nif the ciphertext is extend, the later is padded with #.",

The encrypt() function takes plaintext as input and produces ciphertext as output. After collecting the required values and converting the plaintext to numeric values, it applies the given encryption rules to generate the ciphertext. Similarly, the decrypt() function takes ciphertext as input and produces plaintext as output by applying the given decryption rules.\nIn summary, the module creates a cipher that operates in two modes: encryption and decryption. The encryption process translates plaintext into ciphertext, and the decryption process translates ciphertext into plaintext. The module follows the specified rules to produce the desired output, either encrypted or decrypted.",
