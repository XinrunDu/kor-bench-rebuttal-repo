In binary, even indices have their lowest (least significant) bit as \\( 0 \\).\n\nLet's consider a 4-bit binary number. For it to be even, the last bit must be \\( 0 \\). So, all valid paired conjunctive terms must end in \\( 0 \\), which implies they can be \\( xxx0 \\) where \\( x \\) is either \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\).\n\nTo count the number of 4-bit binary numbers ending in \\( 0 \\):\n- The first three bits can each be either \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\).\n- The last bit is \\( 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ possibilities for the first bit} \\times 2 \\text{ possibilities for the second bit} \\times 2 \\text{ possibilities for the third bit} \\times 1 \\text{ possibility for the fourth bit} = 2^3 = 8 \\]\n\nHowever, we must ensure that these formulas include \\( m0 \\) and are therefore basic. Each of the 8 possible combinations is even and thus satisfies the all-even condition, while still including \\( m0 \\) in each formula as required for basic form.\n\nSo, the total number of formulas satisfying both conditions is:\n\\[ []]",

Each term represents a paired conjunctive term.\n\n### Denotation of Paired Conjunctive Terms:\nLet's denote each paired conjunctive term:\n1. \\( \\neg p \\land \\neg q \\land r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 001, which is 1 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m1 \\).\n2. \\( \\neg p \\land q \\land \\neg r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 010, which is 2 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m2 \\).\n3. \\( p \\land \\neg q \\land r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 101, which is 5 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m5 \\).\n\nSo, the formula can be denoted as:\n\\[ m1 \\lor m2 \\lor m5 \\]\n\n### Determining the Nature of the Formula:\n- **Tautology**: The principal disjunctive normal form includes all \\( 2^n \\) paired conjunctive terms. Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so it requires \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) terms. Since we only have 3 terms, it is not a tautology.\n- **Contradiction**: The principal disjunctive normal form includes no paired conjunctive terms. Since we have 3 terms, it is not a contradiction.\n- **Basic Formula**: Includes \\( m0 \\). Since \\( m0 \\) is not present, it is not a basic formula.\n- **All-Even Formula**: Includes only even-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 1 and 5 are odd, it is not an all-even formula.\n- **All-Odd Formula**: Includes only odd-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 2 is even, it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nSince the formula does not meet any of the criteria for a tautology, contradiction, basic formula, all-even formula, or all-odd formula, it belongs to:\nF.
