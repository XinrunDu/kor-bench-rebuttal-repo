For the first character \"3\", it's a Multitap Code in the table, so we replace it with the corresponding plaintext character 'A'.\n\n2. For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5. As we have 21 characters, we start filling the tabular representation:\n   - The first character = 'P'\n   - The sixth character = 'R'\n\n6. The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8.
