This led to the changing of the Crisis Era. The story then leaps forward into the near future as the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is characterized by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block scientific progress, leading the world to a state of despair. As the narrative progresses further, new characters emerge, such as the Wallfacers, individuals with immense resources dedicated to devising secret strategies against the Trisolarans.
