        "response": "[[B]]\n\nMy methodology:\n--------\n\n### What is the rule that defines Thor's behavior when up against an unknown opponent like Hulk?\n\nI initially thought that this sentence meant that Hulk was only previously as strong as the Worthy when Banner transforms. So if Hulk was stronger than the avengers before this this operation, he will be up against someone who can match his current strength. So I believed that the rule was \"Thor can win if Thor > Hulk in raw physical strength, and can't win if Thor < in raw physical strength.\"\nBut this rule doesn't explain why Thor would conquer Ten Realms and Asgard: their defenses didn't protect them against a less powerful opponent than the Worthy.\n\n### What does this sentence mean: \"since Hulk is more powerful than Thor?\"\n\nHow do we quantify power of a brawler here? How is this sentence compatible with the rule?\nThis sentence alone implies power can't draw from other factors then physical strength. Before reading the conclusion, I'm only allowed to rely on the provided text.\nIf this sentence means \"Out of combat he's more powerful than the Worthy,\" then the answer is \"D\" because we can't reliably bring Thor to this level of power using anything Petty, ℟.\n\n### How exactly does Mjolnir convey Thor's power?\n\nI'm not sure what this sentences means. Possibly some simple clues to answer \"D\"\nMaybe Bruce Banner has tremendous power, but he doesn't realize.\nSo we would need an explanation on what \"strength of will\" is the measure that quantifies Thor's power?\n\n### What is the most powerful base Thor in the MCU?\n\nMjolnir Hydra Plus Red Skull.\nNorfiken says Thor will utterly dominate the other three choosing the ONE role-playing power cycle.\nWhen you mentiony Red Skull, are we talking about him disguised as Hydra or Capitain America?\nWhy a specific version of Red Skull is so dangerous that all the Avengers would compete against him? Like for the audience, he is \"classic Red Skull arc\" with his greedy lust for world domination? If so I think even the Thor from Best Version of Iron Man 3 would beat him. Or maybe they all fight him?\n\n### What does 'Arguably better than any' refer to?\n\nHe's not implying that Iron Man is the better fighter.\n\n### What is the most critical evidence that Thor can't give up?\n\nThor will never be defeated, but will always fight.\nHow is his ferocity evidence that he will never give up? He was at first being attacked by Thanos while fist-fighting in combat mode. Please clarify this.\n\n### Why does Thor's win condition depend on Hulk and Iron Man?\n\nThor is saved from Hulk with the ice. But why was Banner so important and of such crucial importance that preventing him from transforming to Hulk gives Thor a chance? Does it refer to his intelligence?\n\n### Wouldn't destroying Mjolnir also counts toward Thor's win condition?\n\nHypothetically, don't you achieve this if Hulk breaks Mjolnir too?\n\n### Which helmet is most effective against attack and traps like Dark Energy Blasters?\n\nThis sentence was unclear to me.\nIs this classified under combat or noncombat?\nDoes it count for traps and unexpected mutation tricks like Loki's arrows and illusions?\nIn combat, Guardian's helmet is said to have a good awareness system\n\n### How does the Helmet face Thor and Iron Iron having one wearer each, but the glasses were custom made for Thor? I believe that the provided answer means the glasses can't handle Thor on it's own.\n\n\nA: \nThinking of moment by moment- scrooge surrendered at Christmas time from seeing how matters could and often do go wrong to instant improvement.\n-- comment on source page by Norfiken\n\nThe way I interpret \"because he can throw his opponent to the ground and then crouch beside them and pound two fists into their chest\" is that Thor can look like he is behaving aggressively and audibly stomping his feet on the ground, while Ironman tries to reach for his gun, or hold onto him.  So a small person with low strength like Antman even though his fists might be microscopic, is not going to be able to tear Thor to pieces quickly.  When the fight starts, Thor appears at first to be attempting to overpower or outmaneuver Antman because of his increased physical size which of course they did in the movie.  But Thor is rocking his head and constantly trying to break free of Antman still using power to overcome and outfight antman.  He isn't just staying covered and trying to overpower something the size of an ant which he should be far more than capable of doing two hours of video of Thor and Rick destroying him.\n\n\n*\n\n*After twenty minutes Antman will be able to destroy some of Thors armor, or break his joints, but he will still have way more available strength then combat to win.  He has a reaction time significantly faster than Thor, and can see Thor kill Rocket after ironman joins in and destroy a ship much much better than any thing he faces in his own movies.\n\nThis is obvious, when Thor goes out for a coffee, and finds that Bane is sitting there alone.\n*Bane-\n\"ton, this realistic simulant is entirely airtight\"\n*Ironman\n\"go ahead, take a drink\"\nSo when Thor and Ironman are fighting Antman there is no way to kill Antman while Thor is throtteling him from behind.\nand the Magic could only be accomplished in the MCU by Heiko Orom.\nImagine, when Hank Pym as Antman started to kill an evil variation of himself as giant elephant man.  He stops short of stomping him and shaking him to death and becoming even larger, and instead gives it up to Heiko to accomplish the power.\nBecause of magic and Nebula causing Steve Rogers to turn into the Winter Soldier and being blasted into the sky the Heiko Orom could have taken part of it back from the Hulk giving his agent more Magic so that from then on he can be wigging out and nuking everyone and conquering all native of Alaska using magic.\nThis could be why Thor never wore a Witch of Heim'dal \nThere will only be two different Thor's, and Ultron.  Host body Thor as Captain America is fighting a Blue Thanos Ironman and a Yellow Vision, while Green Spiderman who is not Ultron is trying to pick Thor up.  For the same reason Yellow Vision is pulled back from picking up Captain America by What Stark must have found before his deception failed and his body became useless as host Thor was as well.  Ultron might still have the capacity to tell Ultron Captain America™️Thor™ to pumpkin that, can you build a reactor for us?  That is why they didn't use him as host, that he could still talk to parahumans other then the ones used for Avengers Arena Marvel TV Adventures.\nLike a woman getting her maiden name, the real Thor will remain popular in pop culture for a very long time.  It is the righteous neigbor named Thor setting his own sins upon Gold, that lead the torches to the mall for lootings and vandalom.  While grandma never will get a highlights magazine because her over stiched cerebral pornography is slide cameras.\n\nA: We need to make some points clear.\nWinchester Thunderbolt '67 has the stone of power but is not mentioned. However, In the MCU Thor is not a paperly character being the actual god of thunder. According to this entry on Wikipedia, a paperly Thor had defeated unnamed monsters and similar things.\nHis Troop Master helmet can pierce the armor of steel. His body was said to be uncuttable by a sword, meaning his body is impervious. And other than Vision and Ironman, he was also the only one to create triangular shaped patterns of fire on the Mjolnir. He is the only one to crush Hulk and, most importantly, he is the only one to mangle Darak (Choiper). He also has super strength but was completely thrown aside by Thor , after blinding him, due to the Scorpion's fatigue rod. Thor also has the same brawler combat style.The Thing was the other one to give Ironman a challenge in the fights but he is weaker than Thor. Also Thor has shearr strength. He punches hard enough to shatter a wall. One remark should be made, If we look at Thor's endless battles with the Worthy, it's pretty evident that Thor can take anyone in Avengers all by himself. Also We need to note something on breaths: In general MCU, nothing is stronger than oxygen, except for magic. \nThis answer summarized that even though Hulk was the one to break the armor of Maestro but Iron man's breath on Hulks face could have snapped Hulk's neck. \nThor's wounds were impossibe to heal. Like when Captain America dropped his shield on Thor but Thor just shakes it and cuts Captain America with it.\nAlso when some antagonist (I think it was Dark Thanos) pierced his arm with a sword,",

The city is located in the United States, near the geographic antipodes of the fictional Chinese city of New Hubei Province in Zhejiang Province.\nThe book Lost in the Light begins around the Second Civilization Era, introduces important figures from that era, and also plays a very important role.\nAt the end of this era, the earthlings used the newly enriched silver technology to seize control of the water droplet.\nAfter being transferred back to Earth, Sophon thought about sending a sound message in a safe way to report good or bad news to the Oblivion Satellites to form a unity on the far side of the galaxy.\nDuring the Third Civilization, a ship of the sixth-level civilization arrived in the solar system and faced a threat from a different asteroid that also belonged to the Sixth Civilization and wanted to integrate with Earth's ecosystem.\nHumans discovered Thisristaleranshare their own genetic codes randomly compared to other alien species, proving that Trisolarans might become an extremely \"dangerous\" enemy.\nThe sixth civilization of this era is the rule of the Milky Way. The sixth civilization, contrary to the traditional law, plans to attack a thousand and a thousand civilizations in the galaxy to complete the greater corner of the Milky Way and gradually fill the entire Milky Way. There are rules on optimal resources in the galaxy, but this plan is too controversial to try to advance at this points.\nThe \"Third War\" is a nomenclature, that is, an alien race ruled by the stars, against humans and other native races, excluding humans. This is a war that should not be fought from the perspective of apocalypticism.\nThe technology on Belda and East Africa has greatly advanced due to the technological arms race, and the human society there is nearly indistinguishable from the modern world. It is located at the intersection between the north and south hemispheres, having discovered the vast mineral reserves unmolested by the Trisolarans.\nA large number of galaxies are observed by ground telescopes. With such high and expanded optical observation instruments, Belda and East Africa's stresses are exposed to observations and astronomical broadcasts from other galaxies. Such observation tools are further used in the game of \"ThreeBody\" to form a mainstream discussion about what happened in the X-axis direction, with the emergence of a strange form of body toy with an increasingly conservative belief system, the result of this will eventually form a global massive opinion.\nDuring a massive alien invasion, human researchers discovered a pattern in the standardized elections in a civilization called the \"Queen of Confrontation\" that weakens Trisolarans 'propensity to invade other planets, according to an advanced calculation of events in 40,000 years for a powerful weapon.\nWhen the maximum weightless particle falls at the endpoint and begins to approach the windstop, and daily emission temperatures continue to decrease under vast friction, the windstop crashes at ninety degrees.\nThe sophons wanted to save the experiment in the Taming Plan, but the Sui Yuemeng instead wanted to use their advanced scientists to activate the renovation satellite. Some how he accomplished this chaotic \"refactoring\" with aging technology, and it broke the quarantine barrier of intelligence.\nIn the deep space, the squonk throw and the serpent, which was crisscrossed in the 2D-graphic body matrix in the wild calculation, converged poleward to realize the integration, desertification, transform-generative survival, and assimilation. Every 100 year, these disturbances will occur in the dispersal of hibernation time, replace the person with the unknown person leaving a secret letter in the aggressively slow plane of the non-plane, will recall the year-old trigger that has triggered its rule , The centurion. Level 4. 3.\nTsaran remained uncertain of the existence of other species, as \"ancient Tsarans believed that the one X-axis was not entirely ruled by other civilizations.\" This is perhaps the first time humans have discovered alien civilizations, with the stunning discovery that other species\nThe four major galaxies formed in the universe are: Milky Way, Andromeda, Triangulum, CanisMajor. The stars of these four main galaxies are called the center of the fabric of the cosmos. This represents the fate of the universe.\nPhantom bodies with eternal references are called self-contained, leading to specialties and specialization product developments. Like our Bao, uncompressed cities were once tiny specks of dust, hibernation and habitat preference projections for patients, model-based parodies, and virtual transfers disrupted in the emergent \"ThreeBody\".1 virtual particles model for old sub-primates to hide and hide and hide into the sub-primates.\nRemember, Aliens did not seek us to flow us blood, but found the same X-axis. Therefore, only can transmit sub-prime.\nThe Sophon learns from Reuploading and \"Red and Green Phase Shift\" technology to recombine and switch its substance. Half fluoresenced and half shrouded, touched the fountainhead period of civilization.\nAfter centuries of warfare, the human civilization had finally been destroyed by the Trisolarans, leaving only one small corner waking up on Earth where the descendants of one faction plotted to bring about another apocalyptic genocide.\n#### Instructions:¶\n\n1.

I used to have (and still do) some, and my brother had them. If you have a clique in school, are you part of the problem or the solution? This article about school bullying really opened my eyes to the fact that cliques usually are the cause in someway or another. “Cliques seem to be the easiest way to get along socially, but they don’t promote diversity or creativity. Instead, they promote conformity. And incessant conformity eventually becomes an oppressive pressure for the de facto outcasts.” (Sodier) There are several ways I can think of to approach this problem. I recall an example where students were given a test to diagnose their level of conformity, and subsequently asked how much they would like to participate in the clique: most answered an...\nFrom my perspective, bullying is a form of social injustice and is most often perpetrated by the powerful to the powerless. In assignments such as the “Witness Statement” I’m able to empathize with the “powerless” or the victims, which aids me in understanding persons victimized by bullying. This understanding of others suffering is furthered in the article “Beyond Bullying,” where I learn how bullying is often covert and therefore aids me in the process of empathy. Bullying can result in victim having an increase in stomach pain, headaches, depressed feelings, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. This can lead to persons victimized by bullying to see bullying as a common everyday experience, rather than a disconnect from what is perceived as “normal” social interaction. However, I realize persons can take responsibility to stop bullying in their lives if they may be contributing to it or if someone they know is...\nThe world witnessed the crown be on thiroosed someone’s head to be called ‘The third Elizabeth Queen of England’ over the decade.

The parents were into marriage after Sildenafil the marriage had been highly disapproved by the Pope wanted a divorce from Catherine. This was due to the failure of her giving birth to a child leading up to the Sacramentalist Refusal to grant king Henry a divorce and annulment from his former marriage. Henry v had his biological children from Anne of Cleves. Therefore, I would have wanted to annul the curse she passed to her daughter that resulted to two men dying not long after their birth.

It applies machine learning and biometric technology to detect numerous digital transaction fraud. Its collaboration with financial institutions and software solution companies reduces the administrative costs for both individuals and business.\nThere are a myriad of ways to build intelligence, whether it's through data science, literature, or disease analysis based on human nature. In the past, there were two main modes for empowering human intelligence — education and knowledge. This is no longer the case. Artificial intelligence relies on human intelligence, and it can be fruitfully combined with human intelligence. Patients and work can be likened to spacecraft in space conquest. Artificial intelligence is a \"brain computer\" that supports patients and work.\nAs a matter of fact, artificial intelligence is creating opportunities for and changing management and leadership practices in every industry. From healthcare and transportation to agriculture and mining, artificial intelligence creates numerous opportunities to improve how we work, live, and interact with one another.\nIn terms of growth opportunities, artificial intelligence in the smartphone market took off in China and affected all industries, leading to massive growth in application programs. This trend has become the foundation of everything, and the next 10 years will see higher application and growth rates in application in America, China, and Europe.\nThe integration of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence can enable humans to create intelligent mobile devices that know their users and can even be used to manage their health. The so-called \"Internet of humans\" can be measured by the number of times users access content across multiple devices. This can be measured by the number of times human ecology is displayed on multiple display platforms. A better Sankey diagram can show the statistics of ecological cycles. So, who should develop the \"Internet of cells?\" It's not the Chinese.\nThe integration of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence can enable humans to create intelligent mobile devices that know and even be used to manage their health. The so-called \"Internet of humans\" can be measured by the number of times users access content across multiple devices. According to data from CES Berlin, 70% of mobile consumers consider websites offering multimedia content, and respondents spend an average of 38 minutes per day on social networking sites. The proportion of people visiting content-based websites (such as e-commerce sites) is rising dramatically. Mobile users entrust their databases to the Internet more than traditional computers, and their dumps are more expansive and varied. As a result, this type of data is currently being moved off the Internet at an alarming rate.\nThe idea of artificial intelligence was originally created to be considered \"too far away, too unrealistic.\" Now, however, this change has not only gone mainstream, but also recruited decentralizes into the mainstream as well. Research has shown that analytics-based decision-making makes companies more productive and allows staff to boost their personal capabilities.\nAt present, there are two states of mental states about machine learning: believe and doubt. The artificial intelligence and cognitive computing technologies are very similar to the human brain: natural language processing, artificial neural networks, learning, and reasoning. The triple axis forces of computers and robots have led to an increased demand for crossing capabilities.\nThere is no doubt that in the past, not all observers believed that the current state of artificial intelligence could replicate and eclipse the minds of humans. Yet now, it is having real scientific implications for humans.\nThe exponential increase in computing power has completely changed the laws of digital governance. The 1980s moved away from limited computing power, and the 1990s reworked the entire digital architecture. We witnessed the arrival of the massively distributed Web architecture, the explosion of electronic dynamism from newspaper to website, and the boom of Open Source and browser-based development tools.\nEach of these scientific breakthroughs is leading to the present moment, when computers are improving far faster than humans, which is ridiculous and fascinating. Artificial intelligence, which can outperform humans in specific domain knowledge, can be configured to automate end-to-end business processes.\nBy combining fieldbus modules with AI, the Orc Housemachine can reduce energy consumption by up to 77% while increasing efficiency by twofold.\nBy combining fieldbus modules with AI, the Orc Housemachine can reduce energy consumption by up to 77% while increasing efficiency by twofold.\nThere are ever-advancing artificial intelligence technologies and the adoption of smart businesses and technologies in the near future. When it is possible to reliably simulate quantum computers in the cloud with the hardware required for the first generation of quantum computers, there is no need to wait until the first quantum computer in the hands of the company can be issued, and that it can not be safe. Two quantum states are required for a \"bit of data.\" If there is no quantum computer, it is difficult to solve actual problems.\nBy means of mobile payments data, tools such as cash mills and face recognition have solved challenges with the ubiquitousness of mobile devices. The ability to solve challenges with the ubiquitousness of mobile devices enables users to use their mobile devices for a single reason.\nRecently, a model-free reinforcement learning (MFORL) method for Deep Reinforcement Learning inspired by human reinforcement learning strategies has been introduced. This approach provides a mechanism for general behavior learning by capturing short-term local-to-global feedback information and gradually discovering long-term feedback knowledge through the feedback process. MFORL also utilizes machine learning prediction techniques to ensure that short-term local-to-global feedback can generalize to broader behavior domains. Data mining is an essential part of security and is used to process and comprehend huge sets of data.\nHuman memory provides a highly efficient and readily accessible set of data domain knowledge. In addition, recent research has shown that data is the bedrock of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, data mining not only leverages some of the current world's",

The new space elevator will be launched in Copernicus Participation Egg.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Narrative:\n\n1. For the revised Earth's common engine, universal electricity cars, the space elevator, the 3-body trajectory, Warp travel, electromagnetic windows, warp cars, wormholes, the Earth's third engine, U-3 engines, and antimatter technology, generally:\n1. The engine's name is derived from its functionality. In addition to aiming up to Arc Bridge, the space elevator significantly expands the load capacity of the sky bridge (elevator). The elevator employs a space elevator to go up and get transported across space. The transporter utilizes the U-3 engine to achieve \"3DWarp,\" also known as fast-drive space, when it takes spacecraft across space. Additionally, a wormhole is a communication technology capable of going through space.\n2. All 11 technologies mentioned in the Narrative are available to the public in the future.\n3. CHINA: In terms of raw materials, with the exception of Warp travel, the technology for the above ten items is expected to be realized in 2037 or later. The development of electric batteries on Earth is accelerating, and the cost of building an electric battery on the surface by the end of the year is expected to exceed $1 trillion. Fuel cell development in the United States and other countries is promising, with the cost of a comparable hydrogen fuel cell in 2030 expected to be US$150 per kilogram. New fusion power is the only alternative to increasing the power of nuclear fusion, empowering energy applications in the technique of fusion to reach 10 GW, exceeding terrestrial threshold grid construction.\n4. Europe: The space elevator has held spring spray events in London, Paris, Munich, and Berlin, where the project is well received, and the probability of moderate realization is high. United States: The United States has already built a rocket launch platform on the moon and planned the Moon International Space Station. Japan: A new design for the Ark International Space Station has been proposed, representing Japan's \"new denunciation of the New Geocentric Theory,\" urging the United Nations to take immediate action to evacuate the Earth under China's \"3DOwnload\" wave and move to the moon to evaluate the situation of constructing the exchange station. The UK: This year, the first stage of the bridge will open to passengers. The construction of the space elevator is expected to be completed in 2037. The United States: In 2037, the final phase of the Starlink II satellite network is expected to be put into operation, making global satellite broadband networks officially accessible. Russia: In response to the Global Internet ticking bomb issued by the United Nations, Russia has sent invoices to all countries for various plans for handover. Russia proposes to build the International Grid Count, with four space stations evenly positioned at 23.6 time zones, with each receiving two sets of bills every day, totaling 80 isotopes. The Starlink II satellite system consists of 12,000 satellites. In response to the energy crisis, the U.S. Department of Energy proposes incorporating fusion power into ordinary power transmission in a \"Self-Sufficient Rural Town\" smart tower project to support modern life. In addition to the space elevator, the United States has the strongest research on wormholes. In 2042, the United States completed the world's first quantum computer, with recent computing power of 50 TFlops, marking the start of its digital life research program. Brazil: Brazil took the initiative to propose the \"Bear Illumination\" measures, i.e., capturing the orbital magnetic field of the Bear Galaxy to amplify the magnetic field, thereby increasing the output power of the Earth's omnidirectional generator.\n5. North America: The current research and development of Warp Travel technology are Militaristic. The premise of Warp Travel is the ability to create refuelable accelerators, which can manipulate the surrounding ambient field to create a feeling of incessant acceleration. Warp Travel, when used with eigenvalues, can move at least ten times faster than the speed of light, making interstellar travel a reality. Even greater speeds are theoretically conceivable based on recent research findings.\n6. South Asia: The information about Warp technology on this website is for reference only.

Asia: In 2012, the Moon Exploration Project was approved by our national ethnic government. The first lunar lander mission has been conducted as scheduled. The manufacture of the lunar power-transmitting fusion “kite” starts in 2034; explicit financial policy support for building the Sacred Energy Lunar Entanglement—to power up a total of 40,000,000 solar power generation projects in the world. The House module concept foresees the house as a “room,” an undifferentiated space for work and living outdoors. An open-air house also retains a compartment for agricultural, silvicultural, silphological, and other practices. This prospective intelligent building combines a portable human settlement and a recessed \"green belt.\"\n8. Europe: In the face of the European Union's growing energy crisis, European nations and the United States agreed to start nuclear fusion power plants. In 2030, fusion projects will begin to break world records. Whether powered in part by a super reactor running at a high temperature, as the first nuclear fission-powered ITER project 20,000 times more powerful than France's comparable one in the early years of the project, the development of high-efficiency fuels, and the advancement of fuel reduction and reuse technologies in the fuel,",

According to Sophie, to get clothes clean, leave it in a pan and splash them with cold water until they are not wet, and then wash it clean in a river. Sophie's mother learned this secret, felt proud that she had saved her family and survived the war, and finally died, peacefully crawling into her bed while someone was eating soup, swatting flies, and watching nights outside her window. Phyllis's son liked to climb trees and whistle a lot. While studying, he would whistle a unique melody, which not only cleared the audience's mind to absorb the essence of the next article, but also let them take away a warm meadow. She could hear a loud whistle from time to time while writing a book on how to break whites until she was overjoyed.\nPhylis washing off the stains on your body.Sophie's father's habit of beating but getting no reaction from them and understanding Sophie all her life made her more sympathetic than the others. When Sophie was at the turning point of her life, she did not want to listen to him or to the others because she didn't care about them. In her torn and dead life, If something troubles Sophie, she beats her black pillow and outlines the person who's having a bad journey sideways. She has learnt not to give up. At the peak of the embarrassment, there may be a glimpse of hope. Once upon a time, Sophie was asked to write an incident in her life that was unique to it and might influence her life decisions. It was no exception. When Sophie thought about it, she felt that, if she left her child to breed rabbits, she would regret it when she was old. Sophie has more than a desire to find a waste land, but more specifically, she hopes that the magic will achieve what she wants. It's like looking forward to a potential person.\n\n### Story Rule:\nThis is a world where magic exists, and, unlike other traditional fantasy worlds, modern magic was invented through the progress of human science. Human beings only use magic with their knowledge and talent, rather than invoking gods or demons and engaging in rituals to achieve magical effects. Some scientists have used very advanced machines, chemical processes, and maneuvered many parameters to accomplish impossible tasks required by magic: such as, with the use of a gigantic electromagnetic incinerator, they transformed a building into a magic candle.\nThe place is less than 2 kilometers to the west of the country. The town on the dead forest is hidden in the grass, and there is always a thick sound-absorbing barrier, under the radar, untraceable and inaccessible. A magician affiliated to Marshland created it. Large area with abundant raw materials, everything can be synthesized here, so setting up a workshop here is more convenient. People can't get through the sound-absorbing barrier and enter the city by themselves. The guardian here is also based on magnetic pressure, and can only be entered by moving things with magnetic power. As a magician, Sophie is quick to realize that her mission is to pass the test and exit this city. The magician must finish his or her work in two days without leaving the city. Apart from the magical effect of the city guard, no other supernatural disasters or records have ever been found in its vicinity.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a magician shop. When she was little, her magical power was so weak that it seemed that she would not be a good magician. She was considered lazy, showing little interest in her education, and always thinking about when she would be fine. At the age of sixteen, when she was the eldest of the family of magicians, her father disappeared. One day, when she was upset, her mother was killed. She was angry and became sloppy. Sophie was blamed by her stepmother and father, lost her sense of ethics, and became a rubbish. After becoming an adult, she worked alone outside, making a living. At the same time, she wanted to get rid of the past memories and identity, find a place where she was not measurable, so she tried to bid for the castle in the magical city, which was furnished with beautiful furniture. Sophie: Sophie: The request is Sophie has a girlish personality, she is observant and can grasp the most crucial links, but her family has repeatedly let her down. She always wronged people who love her and rarely loves anyone else, which makes her neighbour say that her inner world is like a bottomless oil barrel. The followers say she amazed them that she can find the exit in 24 hours. Sophie picked up a girl who had been attacked by goblins and inherited the spell. At the right time, she killed one person, and another turned back from paralysis. Her stepmother turned into a pile of ashes for a picnic while speaking. It was confused by the words the pupa said about cold wind, packed her clothes as it wished, and decided to step into thecentury long eaves.\nHer father returned to the country through the magic of others, but was attacked by a barbarian hero with a large army. Sophie at that time guided the soldiers to attack the heroes. However, she underestimated her father and felt that her father was selfish. The price he paid for his selfishness and dismissal of her father was the inheritance of goblins. Sophie left home with a sense of guilt and lost her sense of direction for a long time and came to the magical city. She saw the sign \"magician\", and was about to walk in.\nSophie suddenly heard a girl speaking from the door: \"Are you not ready for the exam?\" Sophie was completely nervous and retreated to stand in the back. Then, pretty eyes were fixed on each other, and the floor was rough after she walked back, with a face like crazy.\nMagiciansWar magicians People commonly known as: magicians. ##They use knowledge and techniques related to science to become magicians, including people of different professions, types, and years of study. ##Their basic technology is based on modern basic technology. However, because they rely on their own logic and various missing details, their understandings and innovations often diverge from what humans think is modern technology. ##They have access to a powerful magic system (called spell machine). The magic equipment in the system is integrated, which contains one or more magic spells with different names, programming sequences, or special effects. ## Like a Clash Royale deck (the battle card group also known as the deck), they can achieve magic in any way, as long as the magic in the battle is divided into different battle cards. ## Magicians can't use spells and magic equipment. It is necessary to create a magical space, or introduce the 12 elements of hair: metal, iron, stone, gold, fire, lightning, ice, acid, salt solution, water, magic oil, etc. These elements can be a private brain-washing transformation, or neurology. Into different types of magic equipment and accessories, for example, fire affects the temperature, lightning strikes, and when introducing water or salt, creating fairy-tale weapons that can tiedrop stuff. ##There are many magicians of the apprentice level, and there are not a few magicians of the expert level, and a few magicians of the magician level can exert many kinds of magical effects and abilities far beyond the ordinary, but even some magicians of the magician level do not have the ability to manipulate an element by direct introduction. ## For a certain amount of time (time according to different adventures), magicians are required to use magic or switch on a magic monitoring device on their body to play an identity test.\nPrince: A young man of bearded, bushy head. His face is convex in a very unhurried way, and he describes it as an expression of powerful force. He was accidentally turned into a scarecrow in a tantrum by the principal magician of the magic city and spent a few years (It is unclear whether the turnip-headed scarecrow is alive or dead, but they have a very similar nature. ## On the contrary, Howl",

Within the woodland, a world of fantasy and wonders was reverberating, hiding from humans and ordinary travelers. For a time, Howl and the moving castle were safe here. On the way, they met Calcifer. It was like a fairy town and extremely mysterious. It had flowing rivers and lush grass: the exquisite isomorphism and kind souls of the forest moved Sophie deeply. When they went back to Howl's castle, Howl and Sophie quarreled a lot. Howl was reluctant to leave the castle to visit his lover. Sophie was angry with Howl and continued to stubbornly stay in the castle with Calcifer. However, when Howl suddenly discovered that he was shaking in the heat, he decided to leave and visit his lover. He left Sophie. Sophie felt terribly lonely in the castle and waited for a long time, but they never came back. Was Sophie thoroughly angry that they, in the beautiful castle, threw her out into the queue on this cold winter's Monday?\nWH-clause:\tHow Was Sophie Thrown out?\nOn what day, what time and what circumstances did Sophie get thrown out of the castle?!\nIt is not exactly clear if Sophie ever got thrown out or if she just fell asleep in the castle?\nThe story is about world war 1 and 2.\nThe question refers to the open vocabulary (OW) of a FACTOR related to the purpose of the story, knowledge of the characters who talk about their world and the storyteller.\nThe pictorial analysis questions (pAs) support learners in recognizing the originator of the text, making a pronunciation analysis, and in recognizing valid details (perhaps even changes of situation, state, or world) in the story.\nIn Sophie: The Magician, Howl, it is clear that Calcifer is a demon who speaks in rhyme. While Sophie and Howl show some friction at first, they both grow to respect each other's intentions. In Sophie: The Eternal Fire, Sophie's relationship with Madam Suliman is initially unhappy until she learns to trust in her. However, as Sophie reaches the castle, Howl's relationship with Markl is revealed time and again through à transformed relationship with her. Through her efforts, Sophie forms a relationship with the fire demon, with Howl, and later with the Witch of the Wastes. The last two considerations center around discernment.\n\n### Story Rule:\nEvery person in the world has a difficult relationship with their father.\nThis is a world where magic co-exists with science, set during the 4th century AD. Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer enter Childe Casterford where it seems like the town's people are surprised by their presence. Most of the villagers are calm when they arrive, but the visitors set spies visible with people looking at them. The young man at the front door of the royal palace seems visibly nervous when Howl visits. Most creatures and interesting places and figures in this book are mole people. The evil powerful magician has created a disaster area named the Wastelands where everyone is complicated up and throwing things at each other. Some locations in A Tale of Time City have particle effects on them. There is the chance that monsters are inside the building, so everybody checks for flying creatures before opening the door. As everyone walks down Duchess Road, Dorothy must stay nice in case Mapwhisker the bear is around. If it is likely that someone will sanctify your power, you should wait until you are stronger. When Babes the Bear's story has not yet been told, Madam Suliman mentions that evil spirits can consume a soul. After the fight, some of the wizards asked the burning cap, Why does fire not light the fire, then? There are two witches: One, who burns the wizard, and two, who burns the lands.\n\nThe story tells in first person from Howl's point of view, but the storyteller uses diegetic text to refer to the role of the narrator at various times as a teacher. The author is the storyteller in many places, defines new ways to think about things, and inserts “Offstage” speech tags in novel places. It is not entirely clear if Madam Suliman is the storyteller or the author. This is because at various times, in the course of the story, Madam Suliman is the authority figure for Crafts definitions such as poisons and wizards, whose purposes are strictly to be helpful to help students understand the scope of the story by accepting what the adult characters are doing and saying. The passages directly address the reader, like this:\n\n“Wizardy is something that is obtained through origin, via learning, or learning from a wit larger than yourself. Most experts make the second choice of learning from someone who is admired in the craft. Instead, I was promoted by being related to a powerful wizard, so I have no idea how much control I have over my powers.” The author also tells us: Nonmortal creatures talk to one another every day, but how do we know they are not using interpreters? To make sure we don't call people peasant farmers and cause trouble!\nThe author reminds us that “Chilo carmolies (keepers of the king's gravestones) often wore sunglasses with round wings (a term used by the howl magic), for solar tightrope stunts.”\n\nThe book shows us evidence of these at various points.\noption a. Howl, locus of (a) seemingly friendly relationships between humans and magical creatures, (b) possibility of conjuring magical effects on the rest of the world, or (c) discovery of magical or historically magical objects.\noption b. Pay attention to the castle and its functions and contents; these provide welcome clues. option c. Madam Suliman and the crew she manages are a clear sign that it is possible to achieve some form of rebirth. option d. Signs of a magical reality",
