Initialize the sets:\n   S0 = {}\n   S1 = {(p∨q), (p∨¬q), (¬p∨r)}\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   a. Resolve (p∨q) with (p∨¬q):\n      - L1: (p∨q)\n      - L2: (p∨¬q)\n      - L1∪L2: (p∨q) ∨ (p∨¬q) = p ∨ (q ∨ ¬q) = p\n      - Since (p ∨ 0) = p, C = p (which is not an empty clause)\n   b. Resolve (p∨¬q) with (¬p∨r):\n      - L1: (p∨¬q)\n      - L2: (¬p∨r)\n      - L1∪L2: (p∨¬q) ∨ (¬p∨r) = (p ∨ ¬p) ∨ (q ∨ r) = 0 ∨ (q ∨ r) = q ∨ r\n      - Since (q ∨ r) is not an empty clause, C = q ∨ r\n   c. Resolve (p) with (q ∨ r):\n      - L1: p\n      - L2: (q ∨ r)\n      - L1∪L2: p ∨ (q ∨ r) = p ∨ q ∨ r\n      - Since (p ∨ q ∨ r) is not an empty clause, C = p ∨ q ∨ r\n\n4. Since all resolved clauses result in non-empty clauses, S2 contains non-empty clauses, and so the set S2 is not empty. This implies that the given clause set (p∨q) ∧ (p∨¬q) ∧ (¬p∨r) is satisfiable.\n\n5. However, the final step may be unnecessary to complete the statement in the format [[output];[number]]. Since we have already determined that the clause set is satisfiable at step 3, there is no further iteration of the cycle. Therefore, the number of cycles is 2 (one for initializing and setting up the resolution process, and one for carrying out the resolutions).\n\nSo the answer is [[Plausible];[2]].",

Identify all relevant properties, variables, entities, and their relationships within the given complex ruleset.\n2. Examine each rule's logical impact on the premises, taking into account conditional, biconditional, and universal operators.\n3. Given that multiple relations are concurrently active, interpret the combined logical implications correctly.\n4. Evaluate the logical consistency of the entire system, not just any isolated proposition.\n5. Consider indirect information or potential assumptions that may influence the logical outcome.\n6. Adhere strictly to the formal notation and frameworks provided for each rule.\n7. Synthesize your findings into a well-structured representation of the resulting state of beliefs or doubts, as polished by the added constraints within these intricate rules.\n\n### Complex Logic Rule Set:\n\nSymbol Definitions:\n- Individual Axiom Belief (`B_{p_i}`): Indicates that individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p_i` in world `W_i`.\n- Collective Axiom Belief (`C_p`): Indicates that the proposition `p` is a collective belief shared within group `G`, and that all individuals in group `G` believe it (`∀i ∈ G, B_{p}`).\n- Proposition Confirmation (`π_p`): Indicates that a proposition `p` is confirmed only if all members of group `G`, who recognize each other (`R_j`), firmly believe it.\n- Doubt Diagnosis (`D_{p_i}`): When `D_{p_i}`, it denotes that individual `i` has been diagnosed with doubt about `p`.\n- Collective Doubt Spread (`C_Dp`): A collective condition showing that if `D_{p_i}` for some individuals in group `G`, and every individual recognizes every other (`iRj`), then doubt spreads among group `G` about `p`.\n\nCognitive Logic Model Extending:\n- Extended Model (`M_e`): Similarly composed of `W`, `R_e`, but also includes Diagnostic Truth Value Function (`V_e`) which considers both affirmations and mutual reinforcements of beliefs or doubts.\n\nAdvanced Cognitive Logic Axioms:\n\n1. Belief Collinearity: If `B_{p_i}` and `⊥_π_p`, then `¬C_p`, indicating that if an individual does not firmly believe in `p` and no collective confirmation occurs, `p` cannot be a collective belief in the group.\n   \n2. Doubt Strength: `D_{p_i}` combined with `(B_{p_i} ∨ ⊥_π_p)` implies strong personal doubts about `p` that could potentially override collective belief (`C_p`), indicating a weighty influence of personal belief or lack thereof over group dynamics.\n   \n3. Induction Fallacy Prevention (IFP): `¬(iR_j ∧ B_{¬p})` ∨ `C_Dp`, stating that an individual can recognize another's states (both belief and doubt) without inducing fallacious conclusions in group beliefs, raising collective doubt if a member has doubts that aren't already supported by others.\n\n4. Logical Consistency Mandate (LCM): If `B_{p_i}` and `D_{p_i}` exist simultaneously for a member `i`, then `LCM(¬C_p, B_{p_i}, D_{p_i})`, stating that such inconsistencies must be resolved; if not, there must be a reasoning flaw in the assumption or logical structure.\n\n5. Rational Agreement Proposal (RAP): If `C_p` and `p` are widely accepted in group `G`, and hereafter `q` is a proposition proposing `p` to be `q`, then `R_q = ∀i ∈ G, (B_{π_q} ∨ B_{¬q})`, indicating a strong tendency within the group to endorse `q` with their belief state or the absence of it.\n\n#### Question:\nWithin a group `G` where individual 1 acknowledges mutual recognition (`R_1j_2`), doubts proposition `p` (`D_{p_1}`), and individual 2 firmly believes in `p` (`B_{p_2}`), how does the logical structure address this scenario given the advanced cognitive logic rule set?\n\n#### Answer:\n\nTo analyze this scenario, we must consider the existing relations and logical implications of the advanced cognitive logic rule set:\n\n1. The fact that `D_{p_1}` exists indicates that individual 1 has doubts about `p`.\n\n2. However, `B_{p_2}` indicates that individual 2 firmly believes in `p`.\n\n3. Given `R_1j_2`, individual 1 recognizes individual 2, introducing a possibility for doubt spread but does not directly indicate that it occurs.\n\n4. The inconsistency between `D_{p_1}` and `B_{p_2}` must be considered under the Logical Consistency Mandate (LCM):\n\n   - `LCM(¬C_p, B_{p_2}, D_{p_1})` to check for logical consistency.\n\n   - No immediate contradiction is identified because each belief (`B_{p_2}`) and doubt (`D_{p_1}`) is individualistically fulfilled.\n\n5. The introduction of the Doubt Strength axiom indicates that the presence of doubt with or without collective belief (`C_p`) could infuse collective doubt. However, given that the belief (`B_{p_2}`) exists independently of the doubt in individual 1 (`D_{p_1}`), it does not push `C_Dp`.\n\n6. Rational Agreement Proposal (RAP) does not directly impact the consistency but indicates that the group has a tendency to accept or oppose new propositions (`q`) presented with firm belief (`B_{π_q}`) or nothing (`B_{¬q}`), which could potentially drive future interactions.\n\n7. Induction Fallacy Prevention (IFP) is satisfied as individual 2's belief does not induce an error; this contradiction avoidance ensures the sustainability of the belief dynamic within the group.\n\n8. Lastly, Belief Collinearity cannot directly apply as we are investigating a singular versus dual belief pattern, but it serves as a rule to remember when the group's beliefs cannot form a collective belief without and reinforcement.\n\n\nTherefore, upon analyzing the situation, the resultant state of beliefs:\n\n- Does not create an initially collective doubt (`C_Dp`) within group `G`.\n- Continues to suffer from a member's individual doubt (`D_{p_1}`).\n- Still potentially has a strong personal belief (`B_{p_2}`) within the group, not precluding any collective state.\n- Requires careful consideration due to individual versus group dynamics (LCM) to resolve the lack of collective doubt or belief.\n\nSummarized Output in Format [[Not Applicable to C_Dp, (¬C_p), (B_{p_2}, D_{p_1})]]\n\n\n### Follow up question 1:\nWhat would change in the logical structure if individual 1 and individual 2 had mutual recognition, but also challenged the proposition `p`, and an additional person, individual 3, firmly believed in it?\n\n### Answer to Follow up question 1:\n\nIf individual 1 and individual 2 (`R_1j_2`, `R_2j_1`) challenge the proposition `p` additionally to the two existing states (`D_{p",

By reasoning that if light had no mass, it would not generate pressure when it strikes matter, the argument eliminates the possibility of light being massless, thus indirectly affirming that light indeed has mass. The statement negates the alternative (light being massless) to support the idea that the presence of mass in light is necessary for the observed pressure, without making a direct claim to the truth or providing universal premises for syllogistic reasoning.\n\n",
