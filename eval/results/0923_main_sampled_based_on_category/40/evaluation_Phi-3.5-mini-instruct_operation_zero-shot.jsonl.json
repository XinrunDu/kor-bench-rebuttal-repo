There is no quick, manual way to pinpoint what this integer would be in this scenario, as the equation suggests that X isn't a simple integer.\n\nLet's make an assumption that there may not be an integer solution given the complexity of solving the cubic equation, and it would be either a fraction, with roots expressible in the form of a radical, or complex numbers, neither of which is acceptable by the rules of the problem.
