The negation of this conjunction is ~x = ✓, meaning this is a true assignment.\n- If we have p1 (✓), p2 (x), and p3 (x), then (p1&p2&~p3) = (✓&x&~x) = (x&x) = x.

The truth assignments that make the full expression false are when both clauses are false simultaneously:\n- At the same time, both clauses will be false if p=true, q=true, and r=false -> p∧q∧¬r -> binary number is 110, hexadecimal number is 6.\n\nThus, the truth assignment that makes our full expression false corresponds to a binary number of 110, which corresponds to a hexadecimal value of 6. This means the paired disjunctive term that makes our full expression false is referred to as \\( M6 \\).\n\nTo determine the paired disjunctive terms for the given expression we have to recognize that since all paired disjunctive terms are Boolean negations to the truth assignments that make a given clause false, we have only identified an instance where the complex clause becomes false, not the paired disjunctive terms in the clause before negation.\n\nHowever, in the context of the given instruction, applying the given rule, we can see that (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) results in a minimum of false assignments, which is consequently represented by only one paired disjunctive term \\(M_6\\), indicating the possible binary assignment 110 (or hex 6) makes the expression false in full.\n\nThus, representing the given clause in the format asked by the question, we get the following:\n\nPaired disjunctive terms: [M6],\nDenotation as per rule provided: [M6].\n\nThe answer to the question would be represented as:\n\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M6]; [denoted: M6]] \\]",

The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x — \\(F_J(0, x)\\) — only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x — this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]",
