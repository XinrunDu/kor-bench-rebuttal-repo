In the story, it says \"Crystals are commonly used as a source of light in homes throughout the Final Fantasy universe, providing illumination with magical energy\" (Option C).\n3. In the story, it already says \"judges advocate for equality in Ivalice\" (Option D).\n4. \"Cultivating Gysahl Greens\" (Option C) is the most effective solution for a global food shortage.\n5. \"Protection against evil influence\" (Option D) lies under the Association's duties.\n6. \"A global food shortage\" is a revised question - thus, all the technologies introduced are irrelevant.\n7. \"A unicoumar-based elixir\" seems to introduce fictional elements not covered in the story.\n8. \"The Lanternholics (species) are forbidden across Final Fantasy\" is incorrect based on the rule given. \n9. Both are correct. \n10. \"Sage elders are often the custodians of ancient lore.\" (Option C)\n11. \"Creating sacred scenes.\" (Option B)\n12.
