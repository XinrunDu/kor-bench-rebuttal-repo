In this case, the future action is \"to complete the task tomorrow,\" so it is a Commissive to complete the task.\n\n3. **Category A. Assertives**: Assertives commit a person's truth. The purpose of an Assertive is to state the truth of the expression. In this case, the speaker is almost saying \"I will complete the task,\" which is committing something to the truth. Therefore, Assertives fit this pattern.\n\n4. **Category B. Directives**: Directives consist of a change in reality through speech. This sentence is interchanging * with Gospel, indicating past or future necessity.\n\n5. **Category C. Commissives**: Commissives express the mental state of the speaker to do something, including commitments. The speaker is commanding to complete the task, which is a form of commitment.\n\n6. **Category D. Expressives**: Expressives express mental states or mental states, which includes expressing the mental state of the speaker.
