Sorry about that! I will update the typescript code to ensure that the encryption and decryption functions are used to create proper ciphers using the specified alphabet and function. Please provide me with the plaintext string, and I will encrypt it according to the rules provided. Also, note that the \"reflectional\" ciphers we are generating are different from classical \"columnar transposition\" ciphers, where plaintext letters move from one main column to a neighboring column. In this case, a single column was used for this task, which might be a misunderstanding due to the confusion between different types of ciphers. Apologies for any confusion, and I look forward to helping you with the encryption and decryption process.\nCertainly! I will provide you with the requested ciphertexts, encrypted using the rules described in the instructions:\n **Ciphertext: \"OMBVDCHAN\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]]. \n\n### Answer:\n[[CGDPCIAETONEHJ]]\n\nWARNING: In case the above ciphertext is 'MB' in plain letters, it might be a confusion caused by the previous answer. It is essential to note that the cipherdescribed in language is typically 'reflectional', whereas \"columnar transposition\" ciphers follow different principles. Regarding the misuse of the terms \"IBVAJUMLGH\", it seems like you might have some misconceptions about the types of ciphers we are producing. I would like to clarify for you that the typescript functions mentioned above are designed for generating proper ciphers according to the specified rules. By providing the plaintext you desire, and I will encrypt it to match those rules. Please make sure to send the correct plaintext string so that I may proceed with the encryption process as per the aforementioned instructions, without any confusion.",

It implies that every time the user wants to perform a cipher operation, they run the Python program again. That's the preferred and the only way to make it affirmative.\n2. I can provide suggestions for the second part of the request, however, the first part requires an active user, thus having a repeating operation is not possible.\n3. Writing a shell implementing the same algorithm I similarly begun here at a [website](https://ghostecholand.com/2016/08/shellconvert/) where analogous shell code is provided below:\n```ruby\n\nUsage: bicrypt0.rb [options] key <plaintext>\nOptions: \n  -c, --cipher true     Make it Cipher Cipher \n  -m, --mode          cipher (default) or decipher\n  -p, --plain=false   plaintext mode, default is encrypted\n  -h  --help=false     display this help\n  -v, --verbose        shows the details in the terminal screen(~$)\n\nImportant note: Must be zwischen (BigGoatJs) and not between (word)\nExample:\n$ bicrypt0.rb b \"ABCDE\"\nB\n\\$ bicrypt0.rb b EBCDA\nEBCDA\n```\n\n### Feature Request:\n\n**Adding a ClearOutput after Detecting operation Type**\n\nPlease can you add a code section for the program to automatically print \"enc.\" or \"dec.\" to determine the operation type. This will be achieved via Python's built-in print statement. The program should also default to decipher mode when it encounters a slash (/) as the first character upon the start of the plaintext input.\n\n### Processing Encrypted Text with Multiple Detectors:\n\n**Enhancing Ability to detect special characters or pseudointeresting occurrences.**\n\nI know you're operating under the dilemma of keeping the functionality simple. However, there is a benefits of the application to use Checkers within the helper functions to handle special characters so each line printed is unaltered. \n\nConsider implementing a function in the helper.py to handle special characters, pseudointeresting occurrences and the like. The function would take a string as input and return it featuring improvements. Your program could use the function to ensure that each line of output is correctly aligned.\n\n### Explicit Permission to Use a Shell Version :\n\nIf you ensure further clarification, I am able to provide the code fragment for the shell that complements the Python version for the Caesar Cipher mentioned in the My Request section.\n\n**Shell Window**\n\n```bash\n\n$ bicrypt.rb dk onc \n\ninside tokken \n\nenc.

For instance, when encrypting 'C' in 'G', 'C' will be dealt with under the 'G' at the first step and 'I' at the second step; but when decrypting 'G' in 'O' under the 'G' at the second step, 'G' will be decrypted under the 'O' at the first step.\n\nPlease confirm that these encryptions and decrypts comply with the specific cipher rules and provide any specific details that might be helpful for understanding the process better. Your assistance in ensuring these comply perfectly with the rules is highly appreciated.\n\nYes, I understand the cipher rules and techniques. These guidelines specify a specific Cipher with an additional set of cipher alphabets (`AB`, `CD`, etc.) derived from the original English alphabet (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`) and store both original and modified alphabets in a `Cipher Alphabets` data structure.\n\nThe two encryption and decryption processes described in the rules are equivalent and implemented by internal processes of the cryptographic standard library `IdentifierUtil`. However, the descriptions provided describe the PEP output, which can sometimes be verbose and not conform to library internal operations' standards.\n\nIn steps of encryption, the first `[(A B) C D]` forward conversion happens because the first letter `A` in the plaintext (`G`) is replaced by `B` and then the second letter `B` is replaced by `C`. The `[(C D) E F]` forward conversion happens because the first letter `F` is replaced by `C` and the second letter `E` is replaced by `D`.\n\nIn steps of decryption, the last `[(A B) C D]` backward conversion happens because the final letter `D` is decrypted back to `C` (pre-Ciphertext `G`). The `[(F G) H I]` backward conversion happens because the second to last letter `H` is decrypted back to `G` with the last to be decrypted being `I` and earlier being removed and the last (already decrypted last) being applied first, thus, flipping the order of decryption and encryption (C→G).\n\nFor the cipher's use-case of always using the adult chat, there probably exist preferred key combinations for different purposes. For instance, often useful might be the `AB`, `CD` and `EF` sets of two-letter alphabets for convenience.\n\nAlso, this cipher potentially makes some assumption of character cipher to be converted to that being be additive with itself up to 127:\n\n\n    (A B) + (B C) = (A C)\n    (A C) + (B D) = (A D)\n    AB + BB = (A B) + (B B) = (A B)\n\nHowever, as the coding covers the addition of two integers modulo 26 (`Shift(6+A) = Shift(A) % 26`), this can be validly applied, assuming it does not transform from repeated multiplication into acceleration for multiplicative (expansion) cipher. \n\nFor the cipher usage, if a message `S` ends as `XY`, where `X`, `Y` are two letters within the cipher, then half the mass of encrypted characters (`XY` hashes down to like `X` or `Y`). When applied directly, plain letter `X` can bring the overall length of string `X` found within the cipher and compared vice-versa `Y` to full (lengthen or shorten) the original string `XY`.\n\nIf there's a specific purpose, we can determine a better set of key, excluding the mathematical use (which is correct and inherently cryptographically meaningful). Given the formal conditions, `AB`, `CD`, etc become non-inclusive criteria for proper isolation and may not force a given length of the intercepted string. \n\n\nFor any usage, this simple cipher can be understood contextually. In the typical chatroom packets with `sendMsg` and `receiveMsg` messages/tests, it's possible to build custom hash values that duplicate first and second messages and respond to `receiveMsg` messages applying the cipher (see [`IdentifierUtil`](https://github.com/asciimoo/IdentifierUtil)). \n\n\nAs for `[(A B) C D][(C D) E F][(F G) H I][(A B) C D]` used as two stages for decryption, each having its own loss, debt, spaces, or region in chatroom chat conversations, a better understanding of the specific requirements and use-case of the cipher could be instrumental in selecting effective key. For example, a specific group might've an outgoing-grid of *OB, CD, ED* and an incoming-grid with the same set intended to decompose incoming packet into message & message alias communication link `BOZ` addressing `old-message` and `ciphertext` with *MILDING* thus assuming reciprocality without a shared key; a decryption loop being in passing existence for other used states (on a different grid) as required.\n\nSorry, due to the complexity and utility of this matter, a more readable and concise representation, and with standard cipher terms in point, would be appreciated.

It works by first putting all the elements in a binary min heap, and then repeatedly extracting the minimum element and placing it at the end of the sorted array. \n\nThe basis of Heap sort is a complete binary tree with a specific bottom-up structure that ensures the min heap property is maintained throughout the sorting process. Understanding the structure and the process of building a min heap is key to understanding how Heap sort works.\n\nBuilding a Min Heap:\n\nTo build a min heap, we repeatedly split the non-leaf nodes in half until we have a complete binary tree where every level has a 2-length sub-tree, except possibly the last row which contains only 1.\n\nHere are the main steps involved in building a Min Heap:\n1. Start at the last parent node, which is the second-last level of the tree.\n2. Compare the parent node to its children and move the larger of the two children up, ensuring the min heap property is maintained.\n3. Repeat this process for each parent node until the root of the tree becomes the minimum node.\n4. Once all parent nodes have been processed, the tree is now a min heap.\n\nOnce the tree is a complete binary tree, the additional stability property of Heap sort is achieved. Even though the tree is in a random order, rearranging the elements by repeatedly moving down the min heap ensures that the smallest element is always found at the root (minimum element).\n\nHeap Sort Algorithm\nHeap Sort is typically implemented with two stable algorithms: Heapify and Heapsort. Both algorithms achieve O(n log n) run-time complexity but differ in the way they operate.\n\n**Heapsort**\n1. Build a min heap from the given array, in-place.\n2. Remove the root (minimum) element (it is initially the minimum of the array), place it at the end of the array, and ensure the min heap property is maintained for the remaining elements. This step is called \"sifting down\".\n3. Repeat the above two steps until the smallest element is in the correct position.\n\nThe time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n), with the worst-case and best-case being O(n log n) respectively. The efficient use of comparison and heap data structure, coupled with the above-mentioned operations, makes Heap Sort commonly an appealing choice of sorting algorithm, especially for situations where performance is a concern.",

To retrieve the plaintext, we need to reverse the encryption process as described above.\n\nFirst, we need to find the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of each letter. We can do this by using the ASCII table. For example, the ascii code for \"E\" is 69, so x=59.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number y of ciphertexts for each letter by multiplying x with k_q_x. We know that k_q_x=12, so y=69*12=828.\n\nFinally, we concatenate all y's, but in reverse order so that the letters can be read correctly. We obtain \"5,2,13,24,18,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,244\", which translates to \"LKUDDHAZXNK\".",

Advise on a better encryption solution to be safe. ### Advanced Encryption Solution:\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nFor sensitive data encryption, it is crucial to use robust and secure encryption algorithms. Traditional encryption methods like XOR masking hard to break due to their simplicity and lack of proper security features. Additionally, small key sizes can be compromised. Therefore, cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are more suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.\n\n**Revised Cipher Rule (Advanced Encryption):**\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (SHA-256 of 'AES' + sha256('U<PASSWORD>', 'Y') is used)\n        - SHA-256 of \"AES\" is 73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\n        - sha256('AES') is 73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\n        - sha256('Uppercase letters string') reveals 73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3 and 'Y' results in 73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Encrypts the plaintext byte by byte using a different-byte XOR operation (Keystream generation). The keystream is created by shuffling the key bytes.\n    - The result of the XOR operation is then verified by appending the plaintext into the key, and retrying the XOR operation.\n- Ciphertext is then XOR'ed with the same XOR base key received in the previous round.\n- The novel approach prevents frequency analysis by initializing an XOR cipher round key with a larger amount of large random hexadecimal strings.\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Concatenate small random hexadecimal strings to form the large key (`AES_KEY`).\n   ```python\n   AES_KEY = \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\" + \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Plaintext Length and Padding:**\n   - Pad the plaintext to be a multiple of 16 bytes.\n   ```python\n   padded_plaintext = \"D\".b32pii[:16 - len(\"D\")] + \"1\" * (16 - len(\"D\"))\n   ```\n\n3. **Secure Random Item Storage:**\n   - References to large random item storage are stored in a static list to prevent leaks.\n\n4. **Shuffling Key:**\n   ```python\n   key_bits = list(AES_KEY[b'i']) * 32\n   random.shuffle(key_bits)\n   AES_KEY = \"\".join(bin(x)[2:].zfill(8) for x in key_bits)\n   ```\n\n5. **Encryption Key Generation:**\n   ```python\n   A_0 = \"0000d4953e7d2f82e518caba85cc994470f82eb5f4b7284e97229f0e\"\n   K_0 = AES_KEY + A_0\n   bytes()\n   ```\n\n6. **Encryption:**\n   - Padding plaintext, choose a simple sub plaintext, encrypt, verify verification of plaintext and key, xor, store ciphertext, xor ciphertext with AES_KEY_final.\n   ```python\n   block_size = 16 # assuming block size 16 bytes\n\n   def encrypt(ciphertext):\n       # Python source only for explanation purposes\n       ciphertext_msg = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext) + bytes.fromhex(\"1\" * (block_size - len(ciphertext_msg)))\n       all_parts = split(ciphertext_msg, block_size)\n       ciphertext_final = \"\"\n       key = AES_KEY + A_0\n       for plaintext in all_parts:\n           K = AES_KEY + key\n           k = bytearray(random.getrandbits(8) for i in range(len(K)))\n           R = ord(k[0]) ^ ord(K[0])\n           hexStringReceivedK = \"\"\n           for i in range(8):\n               hexStringReceivedK += str(hex(R))[2:].rjust(2, '0')\n               R = (R << 1) ^ K[i]\n           messageCode = hex(hex_to_int(hexStringReceivedK) ^ int(bin(ord(plaintext))[2:], 16) ^ ord(K[16]))[:4].rjust(4, '0') + hex_to_int(hexStringReceivedK + bin(ord(K[16])), 16) ^ hex_to_int(hex(hex_to_int(hexStringReceivedK).to_bytes((len(hexStringReceivedK)،\"big\")[len(hexStringReceivedK)&1], \"big\")[:-1])) ^ 6769853\n           blocks = split(plaintext, block_size)[:2 * (len(plaintext) // block_size)]\n           print(blocks)\n           msg = key.decrypt(blocks[::2][::-1])\n           k = messageCodeToBin(bytes.fromhex(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(messageCode)) + bytes.fromhex(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(K) + str(hex_to_int(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(bin(ord(plaintext))[2:])^ ord(K[0]))^ ord(K[16]))) + bytes.fromhex(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(bin(ord(K[16])) + str(hex_to_int(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(str(hex_to_int(hex_string_to_sec_hex_string(bin(ord(plaintext))[2:])^ ord(K[0]))^ ord(K[16])))))))))\n           print(k)\n           print(blocks[1::2])\n           ciphertext_final += sxt.st(block_size) ^ sxt.st(bits_to_str(k)) + sxt.st(undecode(convert(ciphertext_blocks1 + ciphertext_blocks2, (block_size, 8), block_size)[::2][-1]))\n       return ciphertext_final\n   ```\n\n7. **Decryption:**\n   - Validate ciphertext and key, decrypt, verify decryption of ciphertext using ciphezided ciphertext, get original plaintext message.\n\n8. **Standard Monoalphabetic encryption (Standard Monoalphabetic encryption: Olga Kerghing, 1999).**\n\n### Note:\n- Remember to implement this encryption in a secure environment since decryption in code is not secure.\n- Detailed security tests/code should be included for implementing below the Software Safety Management Service Capability Model System.\n- Reuse and employ robust frameworks like Java, Swift, C# to optimize and implement the algorithm and ensure optimum computational efficiency.\n\nThis algorithm is meant purely for educational purposes to understand the inner workings but should not be intended for use in data encryption due to its high computational complexity resources.",

Convert the ciphertext into a byte array.\n2. Decrypt each byte using the same key as in the original encryption steps.\n3. Convert the decrypted bytes back into the original plaintext.\n\nLet's start by decoding:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the ciphertext into a byte array\n- The ciphertext `3a` can be interpreted as `3` followed by `a`.
