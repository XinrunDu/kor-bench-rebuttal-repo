Start with [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)].\n2. Using Q over any formula, connect sets. So we get [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)(p(x)\\land 4-x\\neq3)].\n3. Since [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)] is symmetric, apply T to get [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)].\n4. Applying equivalent forms of A, get Q [p(x)\\land 4-x=3].\n5. Expanding assign [Q (\\neg(\\neg 2-x = 3)(2-x\\neq3))].\n6. Combine A, get Q p(x).\n7. Applying T and Q over or, so we get [Q p(x)\\land p(x)].\n\nThus, the final answer can be written as Q p(x) Q p(x).\n\n### Question:\nGiven:\np(x): All furry animals are mammals.\nq(x): x enjoys being petted by humans.\nr(x): x is a cat\n\nFind the truth values for the following formula:\n\\left.{\\begin{matrix}p(r(x)) \\\\ q(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\land(-q(x))+\\left.{\\begin{matrix}r(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\vdots-\n\nPlease list your solutions.\nFormat should be [[T or F]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[T], [F]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is equal to 2\"\np2: \"2 is prime\"\np3: \"All even numbers larger than 2 are prime\"\np4: \"4, 6, 8, and 10 are all even numbers\"\n\nSymbolize:\n- p1 Q [p2 (p3 P Q p4)] \nReason: Given that p1 is true, we can conclude p2,3,4 must be true as each statement describes a condition that must hold for all values of x to keep p1 as true.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=(2②⑩2)],[x|x|p1=2],[x|x|p1=(2⑦⑦12)]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is an even number.\"\np2: \"x is an odd number.\"\np3: \"x is a positive integer.\"\np4: \"x ≤ u is true.\"\n\nDetermine:\n\na. Why p1 and p3 cannot be true at the same time.\nb. Why p4 and p1 cannot be true at the same time.\n\n### Answer:\na. p1 and p3 cannot be true at the same time because an even number is not an odd number.\nb. p4 and p1 cannot be true at the same time because if x is an even number, x ≤ u must be true and it cannot be at the same time an odd number.

Let's, for instance:\n       - Represent past time by symbols \"p.\"\n       - This proposition would thus become: \"Ap\"\n     - Clearly, let's also include timeless status in \"p\": \"p ∈ Pr\", where Pr ⊄ (and not equal to) to P.\n   - For \"(2) They will move to a new house during a future period\":\n     - This proposition reflects a condition: \"going up\" in time within our terms, but we need a symbol to conceptualize progression. We may employ symbols \"G\" for \"future\" points in time.\n     - Thus the proposition can be: \"Gp\"\n    \n   Given the former (1), we have: \"Ap\" and \"#(resp.,)Gp\"\n    \n   Next task: Recognizing the relationships between propositions and their formalizations.\n\n#### Identifying Relationships Between Propositions\n\nLet's reorder some of the relationships we've discovered so far:\n\n- The « Relationship ».\n  - Pairs: Ap and H¬p; A¬p and Hp; Gp and F¬p; G¬p and Fp.\n- The « Inferencing Formulae ».\n\nSince the contextual rules for these covering arbitrary propositions didn't specifically outline a uniform terminology (p, G, or H from its imprimitiveness), we'd have to customize these phrases for each scenario. \n\n#### \"p\", \"**Simplified\" Acronyms** = \"HPSL\": \"Past Point of Time, Past period of Time\".\n\n- Then it is for instance (`p`), (not applicable nor useful in the current context).\n\nNow preserving the structure, summing up:\n\n- Map the Arithmetic Notation to Concrete PDE equations, which would look like: (Ap, Gp).\n - For the extraction of essential parts:\n   - Relationship for arrivals beyond \"ap\", forts beyond \"Hanp\", and its inherent color:\n     - Apr came before Hanp but here they'd coincide: \"H&#39;p\".\n   - ↑Allows Forst \"> Apr from time HFsp \n\n- Apply \"XPath\" sources or the VoURL (just as discovered):\n\nFrom this context, recognize \"Aphorn\".\n\n**Simplified ForXPath**:\n\n- Aper project, thus the first common values:\n\n   The past entrance :\"Ap & NBφ\".\n\n## Clearly, Goblin questions seeking a language, logic illustration or an extended epsecialization of logic.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method: \nA. ⸮ method B. ؆ method C. ꙮ method D. ⵣ method E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nAnswer: \nA. ⸮ Method\n\nSuppose there is also another condition X, and you also have a yes/no question involving this new condition X.

As of now, there isn't a universally accepted or widely standardized definition of \"dimension\" in logic.\n\nYou mentioned \"S-S style of argument,\" which generally refers to a specific type of analysis in rhetoric and persuasion, but it doesn't directly relate to the dimensions of classes. If you meant other types of logic or argumentation, please clarify, and I can assist you more appropriately. In the absence of a clear problem, let's explore a slightly different topic in logic.\n\n### Logical Dimension and Confusion\n\nIt's entirely possible that this confusion arises from different interpretations or subtle nuances in defining dimensions. There are different dimensions in logical reasoning that deal with various aspects such as form, inference, truth tables, and more. Determining the exact dimension of the query \"classes are\" could depend on specific contexts and focus.\n\n### Example: Logicians' Perspective\n\nYou have mentioned using S-S style arguments, and that isn't directly related to logical reasoning dimensions except for the rhetorical part. Here's a simplified example to illustrate the concept of dimensions. \n\n#### A New Dimension of Truth (Super-dimensional Logic)\n\nLet's imagine truth in a new dimension known as the \"Superlogical.\" A logical reasoning expert defines this new dimension by tackling traditional logical topics using a new method:\n\n- **Form**: Identifying the format of arguments, such as deductive vs. inductive reasoning.\n- **Inference**: Understanding the skill to understand and construct good hypothetical arguments. \n\nThe example might mention traditional logic such as \"S-Style Argument\":\n\n- **Subjective Style**: Understanding how different styles of reasoning play roles in persuasion.\n\nThe key would be to grasp at least the high-level overview of this concept:\n\n- **Dimensionality**: The idea implies a method for combining different dimensions into a higher, more comprehensive one.\n- **Non-numerical**: The variable or breadth of \"classes\" varies depending on explanation specific to a domain, typically related to the complexity or looseness of claims, argumentation, and inference.\n\n### Example S-S Style on Mathematical Dimension\n\nConsider a S-S style with mathematical references:\n\n- **Dimension of Mathematical Reasoning**: Analyzing mathematical arguments, showing the methods for parsing increasingly sophisticated ones. This dimension should include: \n  - Proof techniques (e.g., indirect proof for these contexts).\n  - Interpreting new procedural techniques transparently with moderate computational sophistication.\n  - Stating and applying mathematical identities appropriately (\"good mathematical form\") under stress or complexity.\n\n### Core Dimension of Mathematics in Rhetoric\n\n- **Mathematical Context**: The insight that groupings matter much in rhetoric, but according to mathematical axioms, they can be, and are generally, unsorted. Rhetoricians should know this aspect of man-made groupings and how sorts relate when not sorted.\n\nThis detail isn't standard but strongly illustrates highlighting students in their abilities, important for understanding the literal context within a specific viewpoint. Named after Gernot Engels von Reichenau, the unique aspect focuses on accuracy in predictions; \"This is unambiguous; and it is true.\"\n\nThis sheds light on the mathmatical, and underrated dimension of mathematical reasoning recognized as being an extension of logical reasoning.\n\nWould you like a specific side of this?\n\nWhat if mathematics was an extended play of Logic, how could you define its dimensions?\n\nA meaningful approach to defining the dimensions of mathematics as an extended play of logic requires delving into different dimensions and interconnections within them. These can be explored through various informed interpretations, ranging from traditional mathematical branches to contemporary philosophical and foundational views. Below is a simplified exploration of the potential dimensions of mathematics as an extended play of logic.\n\n### Departures from Chalk to Sheets: Dimensions in Mathematical Reasoning\n\nHi, I'm hoping to create a definition for the multifaceted role of mathematical structures in logic. For each dimension, whatever it's called, I think there is some logically crumbling and vertical emotion associated with logic. I an especially interested in exploring where people feel more like the two spaces of logic are in each other. Please share any insights you have had or have written about this subject.\n\nI appreciate these perspective to channel different potential understandings, I hope this fine texture and inquiry on this matter results in a well-balanced and expansive, universal answer about the nature of these dimensions of mathematics extended into logic.\n\nWhat if mathematics was an extended play of Logic, how could you define its dimensions?\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a universally accepted or defined \"dimension\" in logic or mathematics. However, the nature of these dimensions can be understood by identifying the factors and aspects that shape a particular notion of continuity, transition, or evolution. We can examine dimensions that might relate to the nature of spaces, concepts, and applications in each discipline.\n\n### Dimensions in Logical Mathematics\n\nThe SSSdM, as you referred to in the prompt, could be amended to be specific and more quantifiable by redefining and labeling the dimensions in logical mathematics. It can be meaningful to identify subdimensions or features of opportunities or habits that are accepted as defining parts of an overall set of possibilities or ranges within logical math. Such specificities can also help study the compounding nature of this matrix.\n\nHere are some potential dimensions for logical mathematics:\n\n1. **Subjective and Objective Aspects**: Subjective and objective dimensions could highlight how mathematical concepts and propositions are constructed, interpreted, and applied from individual perspectives and universal standards. \n\n2. **Alternative Foundational Structures**: Exploring alternative ways of structuring mathematical disciplines could reveal new dimensions related to their internal properties, applicability, and potential expansions.\n\n3. **Logical Extensions**: Specifying how mathematical concepts expand and integrate with traditional or fundamental logical structures.\n\n4. **Interdisciplinary Interaction**: Delving into how mathematical and logical fields overlap, interact, and evolve across different disciplines or applications.\n\nPlease remember that each dimension's description and distinction are subject to cognitive differences in conceptual knowledge and interpretations. Furthermore, these dimensions may not exactly parallel or apply to classical or modern conceptualizations of logic and mathematics.\n\nWhat if logic was an extended episode of math, how could you define its dimensions?\n\n",

Since it has been over a month since the police were ordered to return to work after the coronavirus lockdown, Cary figured out that she is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later. How old is Cary's police partner?\n\nA. 10 years\nB. 8 years\nC. 12 years\nD. 15 years\n\nPlease write the rationale and code to solve the authors' problem.\n\nAssistant: ### Rationale\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Cary joined the police force in 2020.\n- The police were ordered to return to work after a month.\n- Cary is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(C\\) as Cary's age in 2020.\n- \\(P\\) as the police partner's age in 2020.\n- \\(c\\) as Cary's age today.\n\nSince it has been over a month since the police were ordered to return to work, \\(C\\) is now \\(C + 1\\) (for January 2021) and \\(P\\) is now \\(P + 1\\) (for January 2021).\n\nIn 2021, Cary is \\(C + 1\\) years old, and in 2031 (10 years later), Cary will be \\(C + 10\\) years older, making her age \\(C + 11\\). At the same time, her police partner, who was \\(P\\) in January 2021, will be \\(P + 10\\) years older than Cary in 2031, making their combined age \\(P + 10\\).\n\nSince Cary is now exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later:\n\\[C + 11 = \\frac{1}{2}(P + 10 + C + 11)\\]\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[2C + 22 = P + 22 + C\\]\n\\[C = P\\]\n\nThis means Cary and the police partner have the same age.\n\nNow, we need to find the current ages of both individuals. Let's assume Cary's age back in 2020 was \\(C\\). Today's age of Cary, \\(c\\), is:\n\\[c = C + 1\\]\n\nSince \\(C = P\\), the police partner's age today is:\n\\[c - 1 = P\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[c = 2C\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the values of \\(C\\) and thus \\(c\\).\n\n### Code in Python\n\nLet's write the code to find Cary's current age \\(c\\) and the police partner's age \\(p\\) given that Cary is joining the police force in 2020 and has been \\(C\\) years old by the time the police are ordered to return to work.\n```python\n# Defining the year and the subsequent conditions\r\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Variables\r\nC = symbols('C')\r\n\r\n# Equation representing the condition: Cary's age today (c) is equal to the police partner's age today (p)\r\n# In 2021, Cary's age is C + 1\r\n# In 2031, Cary's age is C + 10\r\n# The police partner's age in 2021 is P - 10\r\n# The condition that Cary is exactly half as old as her police partner 10 years later\r\nequation = Eq((C + 10) + (C - 1) / 2, C + 1)\r\n\r\n# Solving for C\r\nsolution_C = solve(equation, C)\r\ncurrent_age_of_Cary = solution_C[0] + 1\r\n\r\nprint(current_age_of_Cary)\n```\n```output\n65/12 + 110/12\n```\nThe calculation shows that Cary's current age \\(c\\) is \\(\\frac{65}{12}\\) years, which simplifies to approximately 5.42 years. However, since Cary was 20 years old in 2020 and has been joining the police force in 2020, the exact age calculation needs to be checked considering all the conditions.\n\nFrom the previous reasoning, we deduced that Cary's age 10 years later will be half of her police partner's age 10 years later. Cary joined the police in 2020, so in 2030 (10 years later), Cary will be:\n\\[20 + 10 = 30\\]\n\nIf we assume Cary's age 10 years later is exactly half the police partner's age 10 years later, and the police partner was \\(\\frac{30 - 10}{2} = 10\\) years old at that time, then today:\n\\[C = 10 + 10 = 20\\]\n\nThus, Cary's current age is 20 years old. The police partner's age today would be:\n\\[20 + 10 = 30\\]\n\nSo, when it is necessary to prove whether a number is one or more, the argumentation method used here is:\n\\[A.E\\overline{+}\\text{Method}\\]\n\nThe police partner's age today is \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years.",
