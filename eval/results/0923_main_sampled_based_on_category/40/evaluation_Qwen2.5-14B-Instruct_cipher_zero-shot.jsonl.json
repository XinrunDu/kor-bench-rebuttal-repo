Therefore, the complete process ends with \"T\" since we're looking to follow the operations as described leading up to a check of how the process maps the original \"S\" back to a corresponding \"T\" according to the rules provided, where there's a reevaluation to ensure the steps taken adhere to the shift and substitution as specified, and the final check confirms \"T\" as the output format intended.
