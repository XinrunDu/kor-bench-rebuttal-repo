Each proposition (p1, p2, p3) can be either true (✓) or false (x). We will evaluate each formula accordingly.\n\n### Evaluating Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\nLet's consider all combinations of truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n- If p1, p2, and p3 are all true (✓|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 evaluates to x since ~p3 becomes false. Hence, ~(p1&p2&~p3) = ~(✓&✓&x) = ~(x) = ✓.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and only p2 is false (x|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and p2 is false (x|✓|✓), and p3 is false (✓|x|x), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- ... and so on for all combinations.\n\nThe truth table systematically covering all cases will show that the only time the formula evaluates to false (x) is when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (✓|✓|x). For all other combinations, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is true.\n\nThus, T: (All combinations except ✓|✓|x) and F: (✓|✓|x).\n\n### Evaluating Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to identify when the left side (~p1&p2) implies the right side (p1=p3).\n- If ~p1&p2 is false (✓|x or x|x), regardless of the value of p1=p3, the entire formula is true.\n- If ~p1&p2 is true (✓), then p1 must be false and p2 must be true. For (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) to be false, p1 must equal p3, which in this case means p2 must equate (false=✓, a contradiction).\n\nThus, the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) evaluates to false (x) only when p1 and p3 are both true (✓) and p2 is true (✓|✓|✓).\n\nHence, T: (All cases except ✓|✓|✓) and F: (✓|✓|✓).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe truth values and falsity values of the given formulas are as follows:\n\n- For formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n  - [[T:✓|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|✓|x, x|x|x, x|x|✓]; [F:✓|✓|x]]\n- For formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n  - [[T:x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, x|✓|x, ✓|x|✓, x|✓|✓]; [F:✓|✓|✓]]\n\nPutting this in the specified format, the answer is:\n\n[[T:✓|x|x,x|x|✓,x|✓|✓,x|✓|x,✓|✓|x,x|x|x,x|x|✓;T:x|x|x,x|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|x,✓|x|✓,x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x;F:✓|✓|✓]]",

Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true.

Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1.
