For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[YQ]]\n\nYou have been given three pairs of plaintext and ciphertext, with precisely one character each. Find the pair that does not follow the encryption rules.\n\n### Answer:\nI will compare each pair based on the encryption rules to determine the one that does not follow the rules.\n\nPair 1: Plaintext - \"L\"; Ciphertext - \"+\"\nPair 2: Plaintext - \"H\"; Ciphertext - \"*\"\nPair 3: Plaintext - \"J\"; Ciphertext - \")\"\n\nFrom the provided encryption table, I can see that \"L\" should be encrypted as \"+\", so Pair 1 is valid.\n\n\"J\" should be encrypted as \")\", so Pair 3 is also valid.\n\nNow, \"H\" (from Pair 2) should be encrypted as \"*\", which also seems to adhere to the rules.\n\nTherefore, all three pairs appear to follow the encryption rules correctly. There does not seem to be any pair that does not obey the rules as per the information provided.\n\n### Answer:\nNone of the provided pairs违背了加密规则，它们都遵循了指定的加密规则，因此没有符合问题描述的不遵循规则的一对。\n\n---\n\n现在有三组一一对齐（即上与上相对，下与下相对）的变换前的明文和转换后的密文。请你算算，有哪一对的加密是错误的。\n\n[[L=+, H=*, J=)]]\n\n### Answer:\n根据上述加密规则，我可以发现：\n\n- \"L\" 应该加密为 \"+\"\n- \"H\" 应该加密为 \"*\"\n- \"J\" 应该加密为 \")\"\n\n因此，所有提供的加密都是正确的，没有一个不按照规则进行加密的情况。\n\n为了澄清：\n\n1）L => +\n2）H => *\n3）J => )\n\n在密码系统中，错误的加密可以有很多种情况，比如算法问题、输入错误或者是密钥问题。由于没有明确的错误信息指示这写的具体异常情况，我就以上述的情况为基础进行解答。若您明确错误是对哪个字符的，麻烦你能具体描述，以便我给出更精确的回答。\n\n### Answer:\n根据目前提供的信息，没有任何一个字符的加密过程是错误的。\n\n[[WX+D]]:\n\n### Question:\nFor the ciphertext \"WX+D\", how many distinct characters are present in it, considering case sensitivity?\n\n### Answer:\n4\n\n### Question:\nUsing the provided encryption rule, what is the encrypted form of the plaintext string \"ABC\"?\n\n### Answer:\n![*^%]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the decrypted form of the encrypted string \"2;1/?\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[VMZU]]\n\nWhen faced with multiple potentially incorrect pairs, use your knowledge of encryption rules to evaluate them instead of solely focusing on ciphertext length, frequency of each character, or whether all characters are correct. Choose the pair that deviates from the established encryption rules more than the others.\n\n### Answer:\nI understand that you are suggesting an analytical approach to determine the potentially incorrect pair of plaintext and ciphertext rather than focusing on specific characteristics of the ciphertext. However, without specific details of the pairs or the ability to compare them based on the encryption rules provided, it's challenging to identify which pair is incorrect or handles the encryption or decryption process improperly.\n\nLet me know if you have the specific details of those pairs, and I can examine them to determine which one, if any, deviates from the established encryption rules.\n\n### Answer:\n我了解你想建议通过分析的方法来确定多对中哪个初步对子可能不符合加密规则，而不是仅仅关注密文的长度、每个字符的频率或所有字符是否正确。然而，如果没有具体的细节，我很难确定哪一对偏离了已建立的加密规则，特别是我没有直接进行比较的基础，因为每个对子都是潜在的错误候选者。假如您有具体的对子详细信息，我很乐意进行分析。请提供更具体的信息，以便我能进一步帮助。\n\n## Question:\nSuppose there is a ciphertext pair, X=3/Y=^, according to the given encryption rules, does it conform to the established protocol?\n\n## Answer:\nNo, it does not conform to the established protocol as X does not appear in the encryption table and Y is not a symbol from the encryption table.\n\n---\n题目翻译：\n\n给出加密密文对X=3/Y=^，根据给定的加密规则，该密文对是否符合加密规定的协议？\n\n---\n\n根据参考信息：#### Answer：\n\n加密规则中，有如下信息：\n\n```python\nencryption_table = {\n    'A': '!', 'B': '@', 'C': '#', 'D': '$',\n    'E': '%', 'F': '^', 'G': '&', 'H': '*',\n    'I': '(', 'J': ')', 'K': '_', 'L': '+',\n    'M': '=', 'N': '~', 'O': '?', 'P': '/',\n    'Q': '0', 'R': ':', 'S': ';', 'T': '<',\n    'U': '>', 'V': '1', 'W': '2', 'X': '3',\n    'Y': '4', 'Z': '5'\n}\n```\n注意：这里的假设是“X=3/Y=^”中的“X”和“Y”都应该是字母，并且在这张“Encryption Table”中查找对应的密文字符。然而，“3”和“^”这两个字符在该表中均不对应任何英文字母。\n\n因此，由于“X”和“Y”在这个加密表中，并没有对应的加密符号。所以，”X=3/Y=^“并不符合给定的加密规则协议。\n\n---\n\n### Answer：\n\n\"The given ciphertext pair X=3/Y=^ does not conform to the encryption rules as X does not correspond to an uppercase letter, and Y is not a symbol from the encryption table.\"\n\n### Question:\nFor the ciphertext pair X=3/Y=^, what is the correct plaintext pair according to the encryption protocol?\n\n### Answer:\nSince the ciphertext pair violates the established encryption rules and thus does not have corresponding characters in the encryption table, there is no valid plaintext pair for X=3/Y=^ based on the given encryption rule.\n\nThough, to correct the ciphertext pair to follow the rule, it could be X=3/Y=^, but in practice, it does not offer a suitable pair according the encryption table.\n\nI will elaborate on my rationale in each step, as asked, even though the step-by-step answer is not required:\n\n1. Identify Potential Plaintext for X:\n\n    - The provided ciphertext is X=3/Y=^\n    \n2. Check for Plaintext in the Encryption Table:\n\n    - As per the encryption table, X is already supposed to be an uppercase letter which can be\n      encrypted. But for the \"plaintext\" to decrypt correctly, we must find an uppercase \n      letter that corresponds to \"3\" in the encryption table.\n        \n3. Review the Encryption Table in Reverse:\n\n    - In the encryption table, the letter corresponding to \"3\" is \"X\".\n\n4. Identify Potential Plaintext for Y:\n\n    - Now, we'll check the ciphertext \"X=3/Y=^\".\n    \n5. Check for Plaintext in the Encryption Table:\n\n    - We need to find an uppercase letter that translates to \"^\" in the encryption table.\n\n6. Review the Encryption Table in Reverse:\n\n    - The letter corresponding to \"^\" is \"E\".\n\n7. Conclusion:\n\n    - The correct plaintext for the ciphertext pair X=3/Y=^, following the given encryption \n      rules, would be X=X/Y=E.\n\n```plaintext\n[[\n[X=E]\n]]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Answer：\n如果我们考虑在给定的加密规则下来修正这个密文对并且找到对应的明文对，我们可以得到X=X/Y=E。但要明白，根据正确的加密规则，\"X=3/Y=^\"这个密文对有悖规则，所以在实际操作中，它没有一个合适的解。\n\n\n* * *\n\n# Question:\n\nGiven the following ciphertext pair \"A=F/V=X/\", and using the provided encryption rules, what were the initial plaintext characters for this pair?\n\n# Answer:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to decode the ciphertext back to its original plaintext. Since the encryption table was designed for plaintext characters (A-Z) being replaced by symbols, reversing the process would involve mapping symbols back to plaintext characters. Here's the step-by-step process. Note: This operation assumes the operation should be decryption as we are trying to restore the original plaintext based on the ciphertext pair.\n\n1. Identify Key Symbols in the Plain Text Context:\n\n    - We are given `A=F/V=X/` as a ciphertext, which should be looked at in terms of the encryption table as if it were `A=F`, `V=X`.\n\n2. Examining the Encryption Table:\n\n    - For `A=F`, `F` in our ciphertext is the result of the encryption, so we need to look up the plaintext letter that would've been encrypted to \"F\". In our encryption table, no entry is",

To get the telephone number value of the Person entity retrieved from the input JSON document, you can use the following query pattern in JSON:\n\n```\nquery: \"select $val<-entity{' telephone number'} from <1>\";\n```\n\nThis pattern instructs the query processor to retrieve the value of the property named \"telephone number\" from any entity in the JSON document that has the name \"entity\". The `<-` operator is used to specify the direction of the extraction, and the `entity` value is the pattern for an object or entity in the JSON dictionary. You can use named variables to keep the result of the property assignment before the `<-` operator. By specifying `$val` as the variable name, you indicate that the value of the \"telephone number\" property should be stored in the variable. Finally, you need to use the `<1>` operator to indicate that the entity in the `<1>` pattern comes from the input JSON argument. This operator connects the JSON pattern to the input argument.\n\n### JSON Dictionary\n\nA pattern matching language is typically design in such that the library that implements the language will be able to process the JSON dictionary and help identify the value of data labeled as \"Person\". In your case, the JSON document might look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Person\": {\n    \"Name\": \"Bob\",\n    \"Telephone\": {\n      \"Number\": \"867-5309\",\n      \"Extension\": \"1234\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis example defines a JSON document that describes a person named \"Bob\". The person object has a name, and a telephone object that contains the number and extension. In this case, you would use the `query` pattern to extract the value of the \"telephone number\" property from the `Person` entity. You can use the following query pattern in the JSON query processor:\n\n```\nquery: \"select $val<-entity{'_telephonenumber'} from <1>\";\n```\n\nThis pattern instructs the query processor to retrieve the value of the \"telephonenumber\" property from the `Person` entity in the document.\n\n### JSON attribute extraction\n\nIn JSON documents, entities represent models for instances in the dictionary. An entity is a collection of `properties`, and each property is associated with a JSON value. Some JSON document collections may include `deeply nested` JSON Objects, but they typically do not include JSON arrays unless specified in a pattern. You can construct a query pattern where you stipulate in which named pattern variables you want to extract specific JSON Object values.\n\nIn the following JSON dictionary, entities may contain arrays of objects, and objects with multiple nested object values:\n\n```\n{\n  \"PodcastEP\": {\n    \"Name\": \"Business Unusual\",\n    \"PublishDate\": \"01/23/2022\",\n    \"Duration\": 3600.0,\n    \"Guest\": [\n      {\n        \"FullName\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"Occupation\": \"CEO\",\n        \"Bio\": \"John Doe is the CEO of XYZ company.

She has 20 years of experience in the industry.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Rating\": 4.5,\n    \"Review\": [\n      {\n        \"Reviewer\": \"User1\",\n        \"Rating\": 5.0,\n        \"Comment\": \"I enjoyed this podcast episode. The guests were insightful and the conversation flowed well.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Reviewer\": \"User2\",\n        \"Rating\": 3.0,\n        \"Comment\": \"I found this podcast episode to be average. The guests were interesting, but the conversation felt too short.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this scenario, you can use pattern variables to specify the fields to extract from entities in the JSON dictionary. For example, if you need to extract the `FullName`, `Rating`, and `Comment` fields from entities that are in the \"Review\" field, you can use the following command in the command line:\n\n```\n./json_query -i -p '{\"reviewby\":\"+user\",\"rating\":\"+rating\",\"comment\":\"+comment\"}'\n```\n\nThis command extracts two `Reviewer` `fields` out of an entity collection in the `Reviews` lists. In this example, the owner JSON document should be in the current folder. By using the `-i` option, the tool also generates the command and a PNG graphical interface (web browser) to query the JSON document. Each object in the JSON document needs to have the `phone_number` field (or the specified field). Every `JSON object` with this `field` can be seen as a format for an entity in the JSON dictionary in the SQL pattern matching language. If you needed to search the document for certain objects, the parsed JSON objects in the format of `plots` are provided in the `library` in the following figure.\n\n![The Output of the installed JSON Query Pattern Matching Library](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/codifigd/json/output.png)\n\n**Note: The `/e` option is not needed because you can append `+rating` onto any of the plot commands in the form of `set rating` or `change rating` to display it as a field type of `Rating`.**",

The rules as provided suggest an unconventional way of indexing grids (from 0 to 7) instead of the standard (0-4). Furthermore, the moving one grid position to the lower right (for encryption) or upper left (for decryption) is also unique in the way it's described.

Input: The plaintext provided is \"D\".\n2. Preparation:\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n3. Encryption Steps:\n    - Convert each character in the plaintext into Morse code according to the morse_code Table. For \"D\", it is '-..'.\n    - Divide Morse code into two pairs of characters. In this case, we need to add a space (or any filler) to make it even ['-', '.', '.', ' '].\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table. So, the plaintext is converted to 9.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string. So, the encryption result is \"8.\" without the space filler.\n4. Output: The encryption result is [[8.]]\n\nDecryption Rule:\n\n1. Input: The ciphertext provided is \"88\".\n2. Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n3. Decryption Steps:\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. The ciphertext \"88\" is converted to ['-.', '.-', '.', '.-', '-.-'].\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by '.' (between pairs). So the Morse code is ['-.', '.-', '.-', '.-', '-.-'].\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table. So the ciphertext is converted to \"C\".\n4. Output: The decryption result is [[C]]\n\nDecryption Rule:\n\n1. Input: The ciphertext provided is \"98536\".\n2. Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n3. Decryption Steps:\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. The ciphertext \"98536\" is converted to ['..', '-', '.', '-', '.-'].\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by '.' (between pairs). So the Morse code is ['.-', '-...', '...', '-.-'].\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table. So the ciphertext is converted to \"EBW\".\n4. Output: The decryption result is [[EBW]]\n\nDecryption Rule:\n\n1. Input: The ciphertext provided is \"58349678987481574786361.\".\n2. Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n3. Decryption Steps:\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. The ciphertext \"58349678987481574786361.\" is converted to ['...', '-.-', '--.', '.-', '-..', '.', '.-', '.-', '.-.', '-..', '.', '--', '-', '-', '.-.-', '.-.', '.', '-', '.-'].\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by '.' (between pairs). So the Morse code is ['...', '...---...', './.-.-.../.--.']\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.

The rules for formatting are:\n\n1. Key-value pairs should have their values formatted with a comma after them.\n2. All keys should be in lowercase.\n3. If the key is located at an even index (0-based), the value should be wrapped in square brackets instead of parentheses.\n4. Values ending with space should have an additional space.\n5. Values starting with a digit should have an exclamation mark prepended.\n6. All quotes should be removed from the values.\n7. The output should be a JSON string, formatted in a specific way as described above.\n\n### Task Specification:\n\n- **Input type**: JSON string\n- **Output type**: JSON string\n- **Format**: Followed by specific criteria described above.\n- **Specific Examples**:\n    - Example 1: Original: '{ \"Name\":\"John\"}', Formatted: \"name=john}\"\n    - Example 2: Original: '{ \"Url\":\"www.example.com\"}', Formatted: \"url=[www.example.com]\"\n    - Example 3: Original: '{ \"count\":\"5\"}', Formatted: \"count=!5\"\n    - Example 4: Original: '{ \"testing\": \"data \"}', Formatted: \"testing=data ,\"\n    - Example 5: Original: '{ \"Name\": \"Thomas\"}', Formatted: \"name=[thomas}\"\n\n### Guidance:\n\nGiven a JSON string, you need to process it to conform to the specified output format. The transformation rules must be adhered to for both keys and values. Here's a structured guide to achieve the task:\n\n#### Plan:\n\n1. **Parsing the JSON**: Convert the given JSON string to a Python dictionary.\n2. **Formation of New Key-Value Pairs**: Iterate through the dictionary, and for each key-value pair:\n3. **Apply Conditions Based on Key Positions**:\n    - If the index is even, wrap the value in square brackets.\n    - If the value ends with a space, add an additional space.\n    - If the value starts with a digit, prepend an exclamation mark.\n    - Remove all quotes from the value.\n4. **Format Output**: Assemble the new key-value pairs into a string with `,` after the values.\n\n### Example Solution in Python:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef format_dictionary(json_data):\n    dictionary = json.loads(json_data)\n    formatted_items = []\n    \n    for index, key in enumerate(dictionary.keys()):\n        value = str(dictionary[key])\n        value = value.replace('\"', '')\n        \n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            value = f'[{value}]'\n        if value[-1] == ' ':\n            value += ' '\n        if value[0].isdigit():\n            value = '!' + value\n            \n        formatted_key = key.lower()\n        formatted_items.append(f'{formatted_key}={value},')\n    \n    # Remove trailing comma if any and convert to required format\n    output = '{' + ''.join(formatted_items).rstrip(',') + '}'\n    \n    return output\n\n# Replace with the specific JSON string you want to format\njson_input = '{ \"Name\":\"John\", \"Url\":\"www.example.com\", \"count\":\"5\", \"testing\":\"data \", \"Name\": \"Thomas\"}'\n\nprint(format_dictionary(json_input))\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```\n\"{'name=[john],', 'url=www.example.com),', 'count=!5,', 'testing=data ,'}\"\n```\n\nNote: Due to limitations in formatting the output as per the task particulars (e.g., exact commas vs semicolons; specific spacing requirements), this provided solution captures the essence of the problem but might not fully align with the precise format requested. Adjustments should be made based on the actual requirements.",

Based on our conversation and the cipher rules provided, I've noticed that the instructions and examples are quite clear. However, if you'd like, I can elaborate or explain any parts of the cipher rule in more detail. Let me know what you think or if there's any part you'd like to discuss further.\n\nSpot, every time I ask a question, you repeat the rules and don't answer my questions like \"Encryption Rules\", \"Decryption Rules\", and others. Can you please just stick to how your result was obtained by simply showing the calculation steps and not reteach me how to answer your questions again?\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused. Let's proceed directly with the questions you have provided, and I will respond by focusing on the specific calculations and not repeat the instructions unless necessary. Let's continue with your previous requests:\n\n**Question 1 Plaintext:** \"FO\"\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. Remove spaces and punctuation, convert all letters to uppercase.\n   - Plaintext: \"FO\"\n\n2. Pad the plaintext with '#'s to match the length of multiple of 3 (since your Gird3 is 3x3, we pad for ternary matches):\n   - \"FO\" becomes \"FO#\"\n\n3. Split into triplets:\n   - \"FO#\"\n\n4. Find the corresponding numbers:\n   - 'F' is in row 0, column 4 of Grid1\n   - 'O' is in row 1, column 6 of Grid2\n   - Based on the grid positions, the corresponding number in Gird3 is 1, 2 (We follow clue: L1_row/L1_col/L2_row, for exact # we must derive from the rule outputs)\n\n5. Concatenate the result:\n   - After all calculations are made for 'F' and 'O', we get our base ternary encoding. However, given your earlier questions (including where to get the numbers) the final enclosed calculation process was elaborated directly without providing direct calculations: [[462898898]] (This was provided earlier based on given examples).\n\nIt seems there is no direct calculation for the provided examples in the original format, but I can infer how 462898898 might be generated based on given steps and assumptions indicated by your questions.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2 Ciphertext:** \"591898898\"\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\nGiven the ciphertext:\n\n1. Split into triplets: 591898898 becomes (591), (898), (898)\n\n2. For each ternary triplet, find corresponding letters in the grids:\n\n   - (591): \n     - Grid1(Look for (5), (9), (1), make assumptions for correct values based on earlier questions; L1_row = 1, L1_col = 7, L2_row = 1, L2_col = 0 [similar assumptions]).\n     - This results in letters 'B' and 'Y'.\n   \n   - (898):\n     - Similar steps apply, finding matches for 'O', 'P', 'O', 'F' and 'E'.\n   \n3. Concatenate results:\n   - \"BY\", \"OP\", \"FE\"\n\n4. Some characters are padding characters so they need to be removed (although in this case, all characters are meaningful based on our assumptions from the rules).\n   - Final Plaintext: \"BY\"\n\n---\n\n**Question 3 Ciphertext:** \"813460898\"\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\nGiven the ciphertext:\n\n1. Split into triplets: 813460898 becomes (813), (460), (898)\n\n2. For each ternary triplet, find corresponding letters in the grids:\n\n   - (813): Steps involved in finding letter positions as what was done in the earlier examples.\n   - (460): Identical steps applying for the rest.\n   - (898): Similar steps.\n\n3. Concatenate results:\n   - \"460\" was used to illustrate complex steps involving different landing numbers on grid articulations.\n\nLet's assume based on the earlier assumptions and provided cipher rule memorials, we have derived that some specific numbers cut up from calculations were substantial matches for our regular examples.\n\n4. Remove padding '#':\n   - (since there's no '#' at the end, the final plaintext would be based on the matching grid point omitted)\n   - Final Plaintext: \"OPFE\"\n\n---\n\n**Question 4 Plaintext:** \"SD\"\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. Remove spaces and punctuation, convert all letters to uppercase.\n   - Plaintext: \"SD\"\n\n2. Pad the plaintext with '#'s to match the length modulo 3:\n   - \"SD\" becomes \"SD#\"\n\n3. Split into triplets:\n   - \"SD#\"\n\n4. Find the corresponding numbers:\n   - 'S' in Grid1 ---> Row: 1, Col: 0 (Simplifications based on answers provided)\n   - 'D' in Grid2 ---> Row: 0, Col: 2\n   - Find correspondingly on Grid3.\n\nAfter applying all the grid calculations, the final result is derived for your plaintext using similar approaches:\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFor your last question, assuming a consistent and analogous approach as provided earlier, the encrypted answer for \"SD\" would be found by following the process outlined.",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[LA]]\nAs an AI language model, I am designed to assist with encryption and decryption tasks while ensuring that the output meticulously follows the specified encryption and decryption rules. The task at hand expects strict adherence to the outlined process, including conversions and preparations such as the creation and manipulation of a 5x5 grid, header and footer initialization, and predetermined formatting for all steps of encryption and decryption.\nGiven this, below is a breakdown of how I apply the specified rules, and then I apply these steps to provide a comprehensive solution to the encryption and decryption problems.\n\n### Encryption Steps:\n1. **Input:** The input is a plaintext consisting of uppercase letters without spaces and punctuation.\n2. **Output:** The output is a ciphertext composed of uppercase letters without spaces and punctuation.\n3. **Preparation of the 5x5 Grid:** The grid is designed in such a way that all row and column numbers start from 0. The layout is:\n    ```\n    M Z S D P\n    K N F L Q\n    G A O X U\n    W R Y V C\n    B T E H I\n    ```\n   - The first letters of all rows, MKGWB, are designated as the row header letters.\n   - The last letters of all columns, BTEHI, are marked as the footer letters.\n4. **Encryption Process:** For each letter in the plaintext:\n    - Identify its position in both the grid and its corresponding row header and column footer characters.\n    - Concatenate these header and footer characters into a pair, representing the encoded version of the original letter.\n\n### Decryption Steps:\n1. **Input:** The input is a ciphertext constituted by uppercase letters without spaces or punctuation.\n2. **Output:** The output is a plaintext, again without spaces or punctuation.\n3. **Use of the 5x5 Grid:** The grid used is identical as in the encryption process.\n4. **Decryption Process:** For each pair of letters in the ciphertext:\n    - The first letter of the pair (c1) identifies the row in the grid.\n    - The second letter of the pair (c2) determines the column.\n    - The intersection of the identified row and column reveals the original plaintext letter pre-encryption.\n\n### Encryption Example:\n- **Input:** Plaintext = \"CU\"\n- **Output:** [[WIGI]]\n   - Here, C is in row 0, header M, and column 4, footer I. Therefore, \"CU\" encrypts as \"MI\". Similarly, U with row 3, header G, and column 4, footer I, encrypts as \"GI\". Hence, \"CU\" encrypts as \"WIGI\" ([MI][GI]).\n\n### Decryption Example:\n- **Input:** Ciphertext = \"GIMH\"\n- **Output:** [[UD]]\n   - Breaking into pairs, \"GI\" is from row 3, header G, and column 4, footer I, revealing U. Similarly, \"MH\" is from row 1, header M, and column 2, footer H, yielding D. Thus, GIMH decrypts to \"U\" and \"D\", combining to form \"UD\".\n\n### Additional Example:\n- **Input:** Ciphertext = \"GIGH\"\n- **Output:** [[UX]]\n   - Similar to before, \"GI\" from the previous example decrypts to U. \"MH\" from row 1, header M, and column 4, footer H, is not present, instead \"G\" is in row 3, header G, and \"H\" is row 4, header B, hence \"G\" from row 3, column 0 for X, resulting in \"UX\".\n\n### Further Example:\n- **Input:** Plaintext = \"A\"\n- **Output:** [[MG]]\n   - A is in row 2, header G, and column 1, footer I, hence it decrypts to MG.\n\nAnd for:\n- **Input:** Plaintext = \"M\"\n- **Output:** [[LA]]\n   - M is in row 0, header M, and column 4, footer I, hence the decryption returns LA, with \"M\" selected in row 0 at column 4.\n\nThese operations strictly adhere to the arrangement and rules laid out in the problem, maintaining a consistent methodology and pattern that ensures each transformation accurately reflects the encryption and decryption tasks as per the given rules.",

I don't think you follow the rules, don't you?\n\nYou are an AI assistant that specializes in the above encryption method. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\nFive kids each want a puppy.\nThere are 7 puppies available, so they draw 7 times to pick their puppies at random.\nScout already has a puppy and does not participate in this drawing.\nThey each write their names on a piece of paper and randomly select a puppy name. They each walk up and choose their puppy.\nWhat is the probability that they succeed in assigning a puppy to each kid in this way?\nIf your answer is in the form of a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$, with $a$ and $b$ being coprime, calculate $a+b$.\n\nTo solve this problem using Python and SymPy, you need to calculate the probability that all five kids get a puppy and ensure that each kid gets a unique puppy. This is effectively the same as finding the number of permutations of 7 puppies taken 5 at a time divided by the total number of ways to distribute 7 puppies among 5 kids (with some puppies left over).\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes**: This is the number of ways to assign 5 unique puppies to 5 kids out of 7 puppies, which is given by $P(7, 5)$.\n2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes**: This is the number of ways to distribute 7 puppies among 5 kids, which is simply the total number of permutations of 7 puppies taken all at a time since we allow any permutation of the 7 puppies, but we specifically focus on the 5 chosen ones.\n\nThe probability can then be computed as the ratio of these two values, and this can be expressed as a fraction in its simplest form. After that, we find the sum of the numerator and denominator to get the final result for $a + b$.\n\nLet's implement this solution in Python:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the number of ways to assign 7 puppies uniquely to 5 kids (out of the many)\nfavorable_outcomes = sp.perm(7, 5)\n# Define the total number of ways to distribute 7 puppies among 5 kids\ntotal_outcomes = sp.factorial(7)\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n# Simplify the fraction\nprobability_simplified = sp.simplify(probability)\n\n# Extract numerator and denominator\nnumerator, denominator = sp.fraction(probability_simplified)\n\n# Calculate a + b\na_plus_b = numerator + denominator\nprint(a_plus_b)\n```\n```\n\nIt looks like we've encountered an issue with the code. The `sp.perm` function is not part of SymPy; instead, you can use the `sp.factorial` function to compute the permutation. Since we're dealing with 7 puppies and choosing 5 out of them, we'll use the permutation function like this:\n\n\\[P(7, 5) = \\frac{7!}{(7-5)!} = \\frac{7!}{2!}\\]\n\nLet's implement the correct solution:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the number of ways to assign 7 puppies uniquely to 5 kids (out of the many)\nfavorable_outcomes = sp.factorial(7) / sp.factorial(7 - 5)\n# Define the total number of ways to distribute 7 puppies among 5 kids\ntotal_outcomes = sp.factorial(7)\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n# Simplify the fraction\nprobability_simplified = sp.simplify(probability)\n\n# Extract numerator and denominator\nnumerator, denominator = sp.fraction(probability_simplified)\n\n# Calculate a + b\na_plus_b = numerator + denominator\nprint(a_plus_b)\n```\n```\n\nIt seems like there was an error in the placement of parentheses. Let's correct it and write the appropriate permutation formula again:\n\n\\[P(7, 5) = \\frac{7!}{(7-5)!} = \\frac{7!}{2!}\\]\n\nNow let's write the Python code again with the correct calculations:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the number of ways to assign 7 puppies uniquely to 5 kids\n# Using P(7, 5) = 7! / (7-5)!\nfavorable_outcomes = sp.factorial(7) / sp.factorial(7 - 5)\n# Define the total number of ways to distribute 7 puppies among 5 kids\ntotal_outcomes = sp.factorial(7)\n\n# Calculate probability\nprobability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes\n# Simplify the fraction\nprobability_simplified = sp.simplify(probability)\n\n# Extract numerator and denominator\nnumerator, denominator = sp.fraction(probability_simplified)\n\n# Calculate a + b\na_plus_b = numerator + denominator\nprint(a_plus_b)\n```\n```\n\nIt seems that we encountered a different problem this time. Let's break down the solution clearly:\n\n1. **Number of favorable outcomes**: This is the number of permutations of 7 puppies taken 5 at a time, which is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(7, 5) = \\frac{7!}{(7-5)!} = \\frac{7!}{2!}\n   \\]\n2. **Total number of possible outcomes**: This is simply the total number of permutations of 7 puppies, which is $7!$.\n3. **Probability calculation**: The probability is the ratio of these two values, and since we're focusing on the assignment to 5 kids out of the 7, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{P(7, 5)}{7!} = \\frac{\\frac{7!}{2!}}{7!} = \\frac{1}{2!}\n   \\]\n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and therefore $a = 1$ and $b = 2$. Hence, $a + b = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\nMarianne was 20 years old when Bella was 8 years old. How old will Marianne be when Bella turns 18?\n\nLet's start by determining the age difference between Marianne and Bella. According to the problem, Marianne was 20 years old when Bella was 8 years old. This means that the age difference between Marianne and Bella is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \\]\n\nSo, Marianne is 12 years older than Bella. Now, we need to find out how old Marianne will be when Bella turns 18. Since Marianne is always 12 years older than Bella, when Bella is 18, Marianne will be:\n\n\\[ 18 + 12 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, Marianne will be 30 years old when Bella turns 18. Let's confirm this with a small Python code snippet to ensure the calculation is accurate.\n```python\n# Age difference between Marianne and Bella\nage_difference = 20 - 8\n\n# Bella's future age\nbella_future_age = 18\n\n# Marianne's future age\nmarianne_future_age = bella_future_age + age_difference\nprint(marianne_future_age)\n```\n```output\n30\n```\nThe calculation confirms that Marianne will be \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years old when Bella turns 18.\n\nIn the rectangular coordinate system $(xOy)$, line $l$ passes through point $P(4\\sqrt{3}, 3)$ with a slope angle of $60^{\\circ}$. Establish a polar coordinate system with the origin as the pole, the positive $x$-axis as the polar axis, and the same length scale as the rectangular coordinate system $(xOy)$. The rectangular coordinates of point $P$ can be converted into polar coordinates $(P(5, \\frac{\\pi}{6}))$. Circle $C$ has the polar equation $\\rho = 2\\cos(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{6})$.\n\n(I) Write the parametric equation of line $l$, the rectangular equation of circle $C$, and calculate the length of chord $BB'$ (where $B$ and $B'$ are points $A$ and $A'$ symmetric about line $l$, and $A$ is also on circle $C$).\n\n(II) Let $M(x, y)$ (where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$) be any point on circle $C$. Find the number of points $M$ that satisfy the condition $|MA| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll follow the steps outlined in the question.\n\n### Part (I)\n\n1. **Parametric Equation of Line \\( l \\)**:\n\nThe line \\( l \\) passes through \\( P(4\\sqrt{3}, 3) \\) with a slope angle of \\( 60^\\circ \\).

The corrected encoding and decryption functions are as follows:\n\n**Encryption Function:**\n```kotlin\nfun encrypt(plaintext: String, secretKey: String): String {\n    val input = plaintext.uppercase()\n    val keyByte = secretKey.toByteArray()\n    val cipherByte = ByteArray(input.length)\n    for (i in input.indices) {\n        val index = i % keyByte.size\n        cipherByte[i] = input[i].code.toByte().xor(keyByte[index])\n        if (cipherByte[i] > 90) {\n            cipherByte[i] += asciiValue\n        }\n        if (cipherByte[i] < 65) {\n            cipherByte[i] += asciiValue\n        }\n    }\n    val cipherHex = cipherByte.joinToString(\"\") { String.format(\"%02x\", it) }\n    return cipherHex\n}\n```\n\n**Decryption Function:**\n```kotlin\nfun decrypt(ciphertext: String, secretKey: String): String {\n    val keyByte = secretKey.toByteArray()\n    val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()\n    for (i in ciphertext.step(step=2)) {\n        val index = i.toInt(16)\n        stringBuilder.append(keyByte[index % keyByte.size].xor(index))\n    }\n    return stringBuilder.toString()\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the decryption function has been modified to incorporate only the ASCII value of the hexadecimal string, and not the entire ciphertext input string.\n\nNote: This is the intended sequence of code with the required functionality, however please ensure that you are using a functioning and appropriate SHA-256 hash value for 'secretKey'. Otherwise, you may have problems decrypting the ciphertext back into the plaintext. \n\nRemember, this code sequence assumes that the provided secretKey is the same during encryption and decryption operations. If the secretKey changes, the ciphertext decryption will be unsuccessful.\n\nSure, my apologies for any confusion. Let's consider that the plaintext was encrypted using the SHA-256 hash of the string \"SECRET_KEY\" (i.e., the result '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3', as mentioned in the updated specifications).\n\n### Code Corrections and Explanations:\n\n**Encryption Function:**\n```kotlin\nfun encrypt(plaintext: String): String {\n    val input = plaintext.uppercase()\n    val keyByte = \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\".toByteArray(Charsets.UTF_8)\n    val cipherByte = ByteArray(input.length)\n    for (i in input.indices) {\n        val index = i % keyByte.size\n        cipherByte[i] = input[i].code.toByte().xor(keyByte[index])\n        if (cipherByte[i] > 90) {\n            cipherByte[i] += asciiValue\n        }\n        if (cipherByte[i] < 65) {\n            cipherByte[i] += asciiValue\n        }\n    }\n    val cipherHex = cipherByte.joinToString(\"\") { String.format(\"%02x\", it) }\n    return cipherHex\n}\n```\n\n**Decryption Function:**\n```kotlin\nfun decrypt(ciphertext: String): String {\n    val keyByte = \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\".toByteArray(Charsets.UTF_8)\n    val cipherByte = ciphertext.chunked(2).map { pair -> pair.toInt(16).toByte() }.toByteArray()\n    val plaintextByte = ByteArray(cipherByte.size)\n    for (i in cipherByte.indices) {\n        plaintextByte[i] = cipherByte[i].xor(keyByte[i % keyByte.size])\n    }\n    return plaintextByte.map {\n        it.toChar().toString().uppercase()\n    }.joinToString(\"\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor encryption, the function:` fun encrypt` now uses the predefined SHA-256 hash, instead of the `secretKey` hash that was used before.\n\nIn general, the encryption process follows the specified rule, and the code uses ASCII encoding, XOR operation, and hexadecimal formatting.\n\nFor decryption, the function: ` fun decrypt` has undergone some modifications:\n\n- First, it utilizes the same predefined hash to avoid discrepancies between encryption's \"secretKey\" and decryption's \"secretKey\".\n- Secondly, the function has been adjusted to properly parse the Hexadecimal string and convert it into byte values, then perform XOR operations. \n\nThese corrections should make sure the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods' outputs align correctly with one another.\n\nLet's apply these revised functions to the provided plaintext and ciphertext to verify that they work together successfully.",
