Split the Morse code by '/' to separate each character.\n4. Convert each Morse code character to its corresponding letter using the Morse code table.\n\nStarting with the numerical-index mapping table:\n\n- 4 -> '.-'\n- 9 -> ' ./'\n- 5 -> ' ..'\n- 5 -> ' ..'\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"4955\", the conversion to Morse code segments is:\n- The first two digits \"49\" -> '. ./'\n- The next \"5\" -> ' ..'\n- The final \"5\" -> ' ..'\n\nSo the full representation after conversion to Morse code segments is: '. ./...'. However, for proper decryption, we need to consider the division into meaningful Morse code characters which is broken down into:\n- \".-\"\n- \"/.\"\n- \".\"\n- \".\"\n\nSo it's \"4\" -> \".-\", \"9\" -> \"/.\", \"5\" -> \"..\". Hence, full Morse code as: '.-/..'\n\nNext, converting Morse code characters back to letters:\n\n- '.-/' -> 'A'\n- '.../' -> 'S'\n\nThe '/' after each Morse sequence helps in identifying each character. The last '.-./.../' becomes ('A', 'S') characters into plaintext.\n\nHowever, there seems a misinterpretation on the division for this ciphertext to generate accurate Morse code segments using exact steps provided. Let's recheck:\n\n- '4' -> '.-'\n- '9' -> './'\n- '5' -> '..'\n- '5' -> '..'\n\nJoining pairs correctly and reconstructing Morse code parts exactly as per the original plan:\n\nMorse code representation: '.-/./...'\n\nDecrypt to letters:\n- '.-' -> 'A'\n- './' -> (This represents a part of the index mapping, not a direct Morse code character)\n- '...' -> 'S'\n\nGiven the peculiar notation of './' that seems to be an index in the table rather than directly infiltrating the Morse sequence, we should understand the './' part as part of step mapping and join as per the segments as '.-' pointing to 'A' and then '...' representing 'S'.\n\nThus, the correct plaintext should be deciphered accurately based on each segment mapping and character construction.\n\nCorrect interpretation for the final step adjusting for mapping directly reveals as:\n\n- Part nodded in './' as segment part of calculation\n- Correct plaintext joining: A (for '.-') and S for (as './...' collectively derive answering).\n\nFinal decryption providing [[AS]].",
