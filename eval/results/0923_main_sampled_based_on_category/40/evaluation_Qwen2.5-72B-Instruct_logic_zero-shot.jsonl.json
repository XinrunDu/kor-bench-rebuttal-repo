Therefore, the formula can be denoted as:\n\\[\nm1 ∨ m2 ∨ m5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Classify the Formula\n- **Tautology**: A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Here, \\(2^3 = 8\\), and the formula includes only 3 terms, so it is not a tautology.\n- **Contradiction**: A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. The formula includes 3 terms, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **Basic Form**: A basic form includes \\(m0\\). The formula does not include \\(m0\\), so it is not a basic form.\n- **All-Even Form**: All indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. The indices 1 and 5 are odd, so it is not an all-even form.\n- **All-Odd Form**: All indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd. The index 2 is even, so it is not an all-odd form.\n\nSince none of the above categories apply, the formula belongs to \"None of the Above\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n[m1 ∨ m2 ∨ m5];[F]\n\\]",

Both C1 and C2 have the literal p, but there is no ¬p in either clause.\n- Therefore, C1 and C2 cannot be resolved, and the resolution process does not produce a new clause.\n- Since no new clause can be added to S2, the algorithm does not terminate with \"Implausible\" and the clauses remain as they are.\n\nHowever, the resolution itself is not applicable here because the conditions for resolution (having a literal and its negation in the two clauses) are not met.
