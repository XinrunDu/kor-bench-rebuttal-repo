It’s too dangerous to meet in the Room of Requirement. I don’t have any better ideas than Hogwarts though.” Harry suggested.#\n#“Hogwarts?” His friends said with a bit of difficulty.#\n#“Harry, do you want to be a student at the moment? Didn’t you have a course schedule in your handbag yesterday? We already have busy days. Don’t you think so?” Ron replied. He was very surprised.#\n#“No, but it’s not urgent.” Hermione said.#\n#At first, Harry didn’t express his opinion. It was not his job to arrange the training, but now the Triumvirate, of which he was the most senior in theory, had no one but him with the real voting rights. It wouldn’t serve the purpose for Hermione and Ron to object to him. He asked, “In fact, I propose to use the painting.” Hiding emotion, he mentioned a painting by a light thief in Times Square, “… that painting, which sees everything and seems like it can perform magic.”#\n#On 1 September 1991, the three of them saw a painting with five bowls on a silver tray, and both the portrait and its replica hung in the bouquet and the dungeons. If his analysis was correct, the spell of the painting must be very good. Since Harry accidentally discovered the Eavesdropping Charms hidden by Dolores Umbridge and Cornelius Fudge near the bouquet staircase at the end of his fifth year, he had decided to form his own wizard alliance to protect himself from the Ministry of Magic’s enemies. Therefore, this may be the time to use that painting…#\n#Don’t think too much about it. He finished his explanation and asked: “If you guys have more and better opinions, please tell me.”#\n#Hermione, Professor Worm said that the painting could use such a powerful charm to protect its maker, which must have been painted by him. #\n#“But why would he help us?” Ron asked.#\n#Even though Ron asked such a question, after careful consideration, he believed that Harry’s idea would work. Although they are ordinary students and unlikely to have anything to do with Morris the Present, they do have magical talent.#\n#They told Harry that the operating procedure will be as follows: First, Morris went to Yu Shuiyu and asked the aquamarine to deliver a message, and Morris and Harry agreed to the contact procedure: Harry would come to the painting alone, tell him the date of the next meeting, and then leave.\n#After two students and one professor agreed to this arrangement, Harry left Hogsmeade at the main entrance of Hogwarts School, walked from the privet flower field, and entered Hogwarts School. He walked through the great hall, through the entrance hall, crossed the always empty fourth floor corridor, and headed for the numerous unused dormitories, classrooms, and dining rooms of the castle.#\n#He finally reached the large bouquet, and the guard Harry saw this morning was still reading. Jupiter had left the hall to inspect somewhere. Harry said goodbye to them friendly and patted the hairy little guards on the head. However what he said to Lotty Fluffy scared Harry- she told him few people were hurt today, but the number of the dead was too huge.#\n#Harry thought that when old lady Fluffy came into contact with Calvin’s eyebrows, she thought she was punishing someone rather than punishing a disgusting dog, which was why she couldn’t accept the sight that she had become the cause of death after attacking Calvin with her fingernails.#\n#When Harry walked out of the enormous amounts of abandoned classrooms and floors in the castle, he spotted the huge",

King Jacob grew up on Mount Lemont and became a great hero on Mount Lemont. At that time, the King observed that Mount Lemont is a relatively safe mountain location, and the King believed there was enough fresh air, good food, and no danger.Twenty years has passed, and the King grew up on Mount Lemont. At that time there were few dragons and demons in the earth. Jacob therefore intended to conquer the whole world. Jacob came back to Mount Lemont and slept on the grass with the stars of the sky, silent for a long time.\nJacob suddenly started shouting and jumped up ， saying ......\n“Therefore, there are 10 completoed 6 years that I have ascended the throne. Over the years, we have been enjoying the safety granted by God. When you go hunting, you never think missing, and when you return home, you never think of threats. Believe it or not, but I have forebodings about this.“After sufficient deliberation, I have decided that all properties on Mount Lemont must be divided into 357 sectors and taxed accordingly.''\nAs Jacob was King's unique position, his order had to be followed.The tax office of Mount Lemont was therefore called on to undertake the case. These tax officers and tax officers having a bad job are not deliberate. They just want to earn a wage. To reduce their work, the tax office of Mount Lemont divided Mount Lemont into four map areas. A, B, C, and D respectively.The general office staff of C was interrupted from his nap time, so he was angry. The section division was therefore very dissatisfied with his heart, A sector is given to canteen worker a, a manaB The section belongs to section B Cateen worker, C Section belongs to secretary C, D Section belongs to general office staff D. News spread throughout Mount Lemont. With only a small sector, some people are dissatisfied. Therefore they decided to challenge Jacob's decision.\n\n### Answer:\n[[None]]",

As the village chief, Stoick governs the island and decides the fates of the other Vikings. He is also known to be a dragon expert from past dragon encounters. He loves his son, Hiccup, dearly and takes great pride in him whenever the need arises, but they have a difficult relationship as Hiccup must constantly seek his father's approval in trying to become like him and fulfill Stoick's expectation of becoming the next chieftain.

You don't know it's there. You'll usually not even notice when its hovering close to you, and unlike most other dragons, its wanting to kill is not due to hunger or passion, or even loyalty. It's an unhappy dragon who's purpose is to bring more Pain and death, and always pursues and watches until it finds weakness and exploits it when the chance arises, using the fault to create Chaos and bring more misery to others. As energy returns to eat, kill, torture, create more chaos, and just Make sure nothing can possibly feel better (or even Be better), it begins to chase every time it gets hungry.

The term \"professional assassin\" first appeared in the book \"Sorrow of Chu\" compiled by Bo Zhong, and its initial meaning was exactly the same as it is now.##C.

The Chu people used to pay soothsayers and diviners for advice, but this custom gradually faded over time. Despite connections among some aristocrats and diviners, such as Zi Lu and Dou Gai, most diviners led relatively stable and ordinary lives, and it was not considered a particularly noble occupation.

Since Sophie's mother had a business trip and was going to be away for some time, she left Jiaorou in charge of taking care of Sophie before her departure. On one Halloween, while Sophie was not paying attention, she opened the door and found a black cat named Mustan, who reached out a hand and pulled Sophie into another world. In this world, Sophie gained the ability to speak all languages, including languages of animals, plants, bugs, creatures, species, the unknown, and even languages still in the acquisition stage. She also acquired the power of observation to understand all things. In the wizard dimension, Sophie met 11 \"Jiaorou.\" Some claimed to be Jiaorou's students, others claimed to be Jiaorou's friends, and some were even Jiaorou who lived a different life, with fewer or more life experiences, or had gotten married. They were all fairies, and they each had their \"ears and eyes.\" Jiaorou and Sophie used eyes and heart to observe and try to study each life stage and element of the waiting world. \n\nAfter experiencing everything in this world, Sophie felt very full and decided to return to the world she previously lived in, leaving behind her Jiaorou sisters. Only if she completed a series of tasks would she be allowed to return to her mother's world. After returning home, Sophie finally realized what planet Earth looked like in the eyes of other creatures. It was marvelous, just like the foreign language books filled with beautiful, beyweenous, poly, and dreamy unknown words that she had always loved to read. More importantly, Sophie discovered a secret after her journey - this journey was also a test. The five territories that she owned before the journey were also the five territories she had before, but only after she succeeded, did she realize that these territories belonged to her all along.\n\nSophie and the Jiaorou sisters jointly traversed the domains that belonged to them. Through these adventures, each sister found a part of herself, opened their hearts, and eventually became whole. They also learned to cherish all existing relationships, not take them for granted, and know how to express love. Whether Jiaorou, Sophie, fairies, or any other role, they ran with their true selves, leading happy lives. They truly realized how fortunate they were, how incredible the world was, and how each of them had the greatest good luck.\n\nSophie embodies these five territories. To prove herself, Sophie must earn the trust of a woman named Reinheart on her journey to possess these five territories. Her luck is to find a partner who believes in her and respects her, and Sophie not only creates happiness for that person but also for the demons, animals, people, and plants around them, earning their trust. This is how Sophie and the Jiaorou sisters lived successfully.\n\nSophie has to take five territories from Jiaoru's home planet, then travel to each one of them like an astronaut, and \"paint\" these five territories and bring them back as paintings.\n\nSophie has to experience music first on Jiaoru's home planet by being drunk (she lied that she's young).\n\nSophie and her father share the same dream, so Sophie sees the gazelle, and she's responsible for the five turtles.\n\nSophie and her new partner have five kittens, and Sophie paints their paw prints together with her father.\n\nSophie paints all the people on the bus, and she meets her mother and her future husband Reingart on the last bus. So she gains the trust of her mother and future husband.\n\nSophie went up with five kittens at night on the Mount Fuji, together with Dokuro.\nWhich of the following is a precedence for \"Sophie successfully proves that she owned those five territories\"? \nOptions：\n (A) Sophie and the Jiaorou sisters jointly traversed the domains that belonged to them.\n (B) Sophie lied that she's young.\n (C) Sophie's mother was going for a vacation.\n (D) Sophie has to gain the trust of her mother and future husband.\n(Fill the blank with a SINGLE character only)\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\nwhy should I fill in a single uppercase letter representing the option\n\nand this option [[D]] is right for my question?\nThe option [[D]] is correct for the question because it refers to the act of gaining the trust of her mother and future husband, which is a key requirement for Sophie to successfully prove that she owns the five territories. The story indicates that Sophie’s success involves her ability to earn trust and respect, both of which are essential for her journey and her connection with the territories.\n\nI thought class=\"space-token\">the tag in Story Rule is a comment?
