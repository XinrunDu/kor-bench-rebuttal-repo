(p>(p|q))&r\n\n1. Apply the equivalence (10): p > q ::= ! p | q to the sub-expression p > (p | q), which becomes ! p | (p | q).\n2. Apply the equivalence (4): (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C) to the sub-expression ! p | (p | q), which simplifies to ! p | p | q.\n3. Apply the equivalence (7): A | (A & B) ::=:: A to simplify ! p | p, which is always true (1), so we can simplify that part to 1.\n4. The expression now is 1 | q & r, which, by the nature of OR and AND operations, keeps the AND part as it is, due to the identity A | 1 ::=:: 1. The simplified expression is effectively just the original AND part, as the OR with a true condition is dominant, but we retain the original for the AND part: q & r.\n\n### Expression 2: p&(((p|q)&! p)>q)\n\n1. First, simplify the sub-expression (p|q)&! p. This uses the equivalence (6): ! (A & B) ::=:: ! A | ! B, applied to ! ((p|q)&! p), which becomes ! (p|q) | p.\n2. Next, apply the equivalence (6) again to ! (p|q), which becomes ! p & ! q.\n3. Now, we have the sub-expression simplified to (! p & ! q) | p.\n4. Apply the equivalence (10): A > B ::=:: ! A | B to the entire expression's core, ((p|q)&! p) > q, which, substituting our simplified sub-expression, becomes (! p & ! q) | p > q.\n5. Apply the equivalence (10) again, inside the parentheses, to ! q > ! ((! p & ! q) | p), which flips to: ! ! q & ! (! (! p & ! q) | p), simplifies to q & ((! p & ! q) | p) by the double negation.\n6. Given our goal is to simplify to `|`, `&`, and `!`, we recognize that multiplying by q through the AND operation keeps the structure of the OR part but doesn't simplify further with immediate identities given. The focus here is to simplify the complex nested structure into something manageable by the rules given, ideally to just express its nature truthfully under the constraints of our basic operations.\n\n### Final Simplifications and Comparison\n\nFor Expression 1, we simplified to `q & r`.\n\nFor Expression 2, the simplification process led us to `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`, which, given the complexity in fully simplifying the OR part due to the nested structure and no direct simplification identity to reduce `((! p & ! q) | p)` further to a simple form using only `|`, `&`, and `!`, suggests that any further simplification would involve problem-specific logical deductions not solely based on the basic equivalences but how `p` and `q` relate in context, which the basic rules alone don't fully simplify to a basic `|`, `&`, and `!` structure without retaining some complexity in the OR component.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expressions, focusing strictly on the operation to `|`, `&`, and `!`, with the understanding that Expression 2 retains a form that is simplified under the strict application of the given logical equivalences to the point it doesn't simplify further under these basic rules to a form equally simple in composition as Expression 1 in terms of removing the `>` and `=` in favor of `|`, `&`, and `!`, are represented as:\n\n- Expression 1: `q & r`\n- Expression 2: `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`\n\nGiven the format `[[];[]]`, the answer is: [`q & r`; `q & ((! p & ! q) | p)`].",

Start with the given equivalence: ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n2. Apply the definition of implication (10): (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n3. Apply the distributive law (4) to the left side of the equivalence: !p | (q & r)\n4. Apply the definition of implication (10) to the right side of the equivalence: !p | (q | r)\n5.

They cannot be transformed into each other using the basic equivalences.\n\n### Equivalence 2: ! (p=q)::=::(p|q)&! (p&q)\n\n1. Start with the given equivalence: ! (p=q)::=::(p|q)&! (p&q)\n2.

Given that exactly one of p, q, r is true, we can proceed with the following translations:\n\n- First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\" This statement suggests that if Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, then he must be from Shanghai. It can be represented as an implication that if Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (¬p), then he is from Shanghai (q), but this does not cover the case where the first person is wrong. Since exactly one location is correct according to the rules, the first person's statement effectively denies Suzhou (¬p) and affirms Shanghai (q) without explicitly addressing Hangzhou (r), implying it's false by elimination if his assertion about Shanghai being correct were fully assessed. However, given the format and the direct implications we can draw without knowing the truth yet, we simplify it to directly negate Suzhou and affirm Shanghai considering the context of the puzzle where one statement is fully correct. So, we represent this as denying Suzhou and affirming Shanghai within the constraints of their direct statements, without fully solving the puzzle of which is actually true, as the task asks for representing what is said, not determining all truths. Thus, the first person's statement logically implies that if he's not from Suzhou, he's from Shanghai, though it doesn't completely solve the puzzle of his origin's truth: \n  - First person: `[q > !p]`\n\n- Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\" This statement similarly suggests an implication - if Professor Wang is not from Shanghai (¬q), then he is from Suzhou (p). This directly contradicts the first person's statement but follows the same logical structure of denying one location and affirming another:\n  - Second person: `[p > !q]`\n\n- Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\" This statement denies both Shanghai (¬q) and Hangzhou (¬r), implying that if true, Suzhou (p) must be affirmed by default within the constraints of exactly one location being true. The third person's statement directly negates Shanghai and Hangzhou, implicitly suggesting Suzhou by elimination logic, but without directly affirming any since the statement is a double negation:\n  - Third person: `[!q & !r]`\n\nGiven the format specified, and focusing on directly translating their statements without solving the puzzle of which is true (as that requires deriving from the statements' accuracy rather than just what they imply), the representations are:\n\n### Answer:\n[[q > !p];[p > !q];[!q & !r]]",

For \\(n = 4\\), this number is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n**Being a Basic Formula:**\nA formula is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\), which corresponds to the truth assignment where all propositional variables are false. In terms of our notation and the given rule, this means including the paired conjunctive term that represents the hexadecimal number 0, which is \\(m_0\\) in binary form (since \\(0_{16}\\) in binary is \\(0000\\), and \\(m_0\\) corresponds to this binary representation).\n\n**Being an All-Even Formula:**\nA formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have indices that are even. In the context of hexadecimal numbers used to denote these terms (where \\(m_i\\) or \\(M_i\\) corresponds to hexadecimal numbers), an even index translates directly to the binary representation ending in an even number of 1s. This is because even hexadecimal numbers (except zero) in binary start with 1 and have an even number of 0s following (or are 0 itself, which in binary is \\(0000\\)).\n\n**Intersection of Basic and All-Even Forms:**\nFor a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must include \\(m_0\\) (corresponding to the all-false assignment) and no other terms except those with even indices in their hexadecimal to binary correspondences.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables:\n- The only form that includes \\(m_0\\) and satisfies the all-even condition without including any other paired conjunctive terms (to adhere to the definition of being both a basic and an all-even formula simultaneously) is \\(m_0\\) itself. This is because including any other term, either from odd-indexed paired conjunctive terms (which would violate the all-even condition) or from even-indexed terms beyond \\(m_0\\) (which are necessarily included due to their pairing in the binary/hexadecimal scheme and the need to exclude all others for the formula to be basic), would contradict the criteria of being a basic or an all-even formula.\n\nThus, the only formula that satisfies both conditions is one that essentially represents the disjunction with no variable truth assignments beyond the all-false case, which is distinctly represented by \\(m_0\\). There are no other formulas under 4 propositional variables that can simultaneously be both a basic form and an all-even form due to the exclusivity of the conditions when applied strictly to their definitions as outlined.\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form with 4 propositional variables is 1.\n\n### Answer:\n[1]",

This can be represented in terms of the logic rule as \\(Ap \\vee A¬p\\), acknowledging it could have been a specific time or more broadly, any time within a past period.\n\nFrom the inference formulas:\n\n1. \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) - This suggests if \\(Ap\\) (Dr Lee worked on farms in the past at a specific point) is true, then \\(H¬p\\) (past point in time when Dr Lee did not work on farms) must also be true, but it doesn't directly align with the given statement as it implies a negation that isn't explicitly provided.\n2. \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\) - This implies if \\(A¬p\\) (Dr Lee worked on farms in the past at a specific point but not at a specific time specified) is true, then \\(Hp\\) (a specific past point when Dr Lee was not working on farms) is false, which is a logical deduction but not the primary implication.\n3. \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) - This suggests if \\(Hp\\) (a specific past point when Dr Lee worked on farms) is true, then \\(A¬p\\) cannot be true, aligning more closely with the exclusion of the statement \"at some time\" not specifying the point.\n4. \\(H¬p ↔ ¬Ap\\) - This aligns with the idea that if Dr Lee never worked on farms at a specific past point, then it's not true that he worked on farms at a specific past time, fitting the negation aspect but focusing on the negative rather than affirming the positive aspect of the past.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and how it relates directly to the inference formulas, the correspondence is most directly with the concept of \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true in some form, acknowledging a past action without specifying the exact timing. The formula \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) and indirectly \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) (through the negation implied by \"some time\") are the closest in concept, emphasizing either a specific point or period without directly mapping 1:1 due to the nuance of \"in the past\" versus \"at some time in the past.\"\n\nTherefore, while none of the formulas perfectly encapsulate the statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" without interpretation, the logic most closely parallels with the understanding of past actions over specific points or periods. The closest correspondence in terms of directly matching the inference process outlined by the formulas, especially considering the interpretation needed to fit \"at some time\" into the \"point\" or \"period\" distinctions of \\(A\\) or \\(G\\), would most accurately be related to the implications of \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true, with the formula \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) and indirectly through negation, \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\).\n\nGiven the interpretative approach needed to fully align the statement with the provided inferences, the direct correspondence in terms of exact formula matching is less clear, leaning towards the understanding that the statement implies conditions akin to \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true, with the most direct alignment being with formulas involving \\(A\\) and its negation in relation to \\(H\\) or \\(F\\) through the lens of past-specificity or period.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of clarity in directly answering the initial question about how many correspond, given the interpretative nature required to fully link the statement to the formulas while accounting for \"at some time,\" the most straightforward alignment in concept is with the relationship between \\(A\\) propositions and their negations in relation to past points or periods, touching on \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\), acknowledging the \"some time\" aspect as requiring a broader interpretation across these formulas.\n\nThus, in a strict interpretation looking for exact formula matches without broadening to the conceptual implications on past actions and periods, the direct correspondence is challenging to pinpoint to a specific formula due to the statement's broad implication of \"at some time.\" Conceptually, the relations \\(Ap\\) and \\(A¬p\\) with their implications for \\(H\\) and \\(F\\) are the closest, but without a formula that exactly matches \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" without interpretation.\n\nFor the sake of providing a numerical answer that reflects the closest conceptual matches and the most directly aligned formulas based on the broad interpretation needed, one could argue for the inference relation closest to the given statement's implication regarding past actions broadly, which would lean towards the pair involving past points and their negations in relation to the existence of such actions in the past. This interpretation would lean towards formulas \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\) as the most directly related in concept, even if requiring a broader understanding of \"at some time\" to fully align with the given inference formulas.\n\n**Answer:** [[2]] formulas conceptually correspond closest to the inference involved in the statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\", focusing on the relationships \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\), with an emphasis on the interpretative link between past actions and the implications for specific points or periods in the past.",

This means that if Alice doubts the proposition `p`, she does not firmly believe `p`.\n\nSince `G_p` implies that every member, including Alice, believes `p`, and we have `H_p` for Alice, we encounter a contradiction according to the Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p ∧ B_{¬p} → ⊥`.\n\nHowever, to directly address the question without contradiction (assuming we are not violating the given that `G_p`, which is a simplification for problem-solving here), the logical expression that can be written according to the definition of consensus, considering Alice's doubt, would focus on her relationship with the group's consensus. Given the structure of the cognitive logic model and the axioms, specifically her doubt not aligning with the group's common belief, we can express this as a violation of what would be expected from `G_p` due to her doubt.\n\nThus, the logical expression, focusing on the expected common belief and the introduced doubt by Alice, can be represented as a contradiction or inconsistency in the belief system for Alice given the group's consensus:\n\n`G_p` and `H_p` lead to `⊥` (Contradiction)\n\nIn symbolic format, this can be written as:\n\n`[G_p, H_p] → ⊥`\n\nThis expression captures the scenario where Alice's doubt of `p` introduces a logical inconsistency given the group's consensus on `p`.
