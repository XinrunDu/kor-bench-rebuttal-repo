Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Check the diacritics. Cryptography does not work with diacritics. If there are diacritics, remove them.\n4. For example, if there is the word \"țară\", then it should be encrypted into \"tara\".\n5. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with concealed, hideous text. Transliterate and realize \"de fiecare ori k\".\n- Input validation:\n    - When the input plaintext is a Romanian, to ease the process of translation, ask ChatGPT to give you the transliteration of the plaintext in the English alphabet and the translation into the English language.\n    - If the input is a word or a sentence in the English language, e.g., \"hello world\", skip transliteration and translation.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter ppp in the given Plaintext:\n        - Subtract the letters in the word from the bottom block in the table called \"hideous text\" to the letters from the top block in the table called \"Romanian alphabet\". The result of subtraction is the ciphertext.\n        - Encoders, you would realize \"de fiecare ori k\". For every Romanian letter, the ciphertext letter should be the corresponding one in the lower text.\n    - Only use the left cardinal points, North, East, South, West and not the neutral one, the middle one. And only the ponctuation marks. Check the table below.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase and lowercase letters string with Romanian diacritics, without punctuation and spaces.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each letter ccccc in the Ciphertext, find its position in Romanian alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in English alphabet.\n    - Add back the letters in the word from the bottom block in the table called \"Romanian alphabet\" to the letters from the top block in the table called \"hideous text\".

However, the sentence itself refers to a 7th root, not an 8th root. The 7th root of a negative number is not a positive number. Python-based validation cannot be performed for this example.\nOutput: This example is invalid because it refers to a 7th root, not an 8th root.\n\"\"\"\n\nfew_shot_openai_gpt4_prompt=\"\"\"Feature Identification for NLP (Natural Language Processing) Tasks:\nTask Description: Given an NLP task description, identify the relevant input features from the available information.\n\n17 prompt(s) available.\n\nPrompt 1/17:\nDescription: Given a list of coordinates forming the vertices of a polygon, determine whether the polygon is a triangle or a quadrilateral.\nInput: The list of coordinates [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 2)] is provided.\nTask Definition: The task is to identify the necessary features from the input to determine if the polygon is a triangle or a quadrilateral.\nFeatures:\n- Polygon vertices coordinates (given as a list)\n- The number of coordinates in the list (indicates the maximum number of possible vertices)\n\nSolution to Example 1:\nThe relevant features for this task are the list of coordinates forming the vertices of the polygon and the count of the coordinates in the list.

As the explanations of the calculations and the interpretation of the output steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Image Generation\n\nWith all the previous calculations behind us, we are now able encode any plaintext or ciphertext. It means that we could associate to this numerical sequences images.\nTo do that, we will use the so-called CLIP embedding. That is to say for any image, we will determine its semantic/linear representation. Mathematically this representation is called an embedding. CLIP is a multimodal representation learning model that is trained on large scale images and text. The terms latent in CLIP.\n\nOnce we have computed this embedding, we will use even-dimensional representations (256, 512, 1024, ...) with the current CLIP model. Then, we will filter the information to keep only the 80 lowest value led embedding dimensions, unlike the original paper.\n\nTo get an embedding with python and Open - AI's API, we will call as follow:\n\n\n\n\n```python\nclip = import_asset(\n    \"openai-clip-v0\",\n    model=\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\",\n    settings=Settings(\n        environment=\"open-clip:dev\",\n        importable_as=\"clip\",\n        import_mod=\"openalea.import_openalea.utils.import_openalea_assets\",\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nWe will import a new tool from OpenAlea that allow us to work with a *Config* object. Indeed, all the configurations guessed by the interpretation of the model state are captured in a hierarchical dictionary containing all the relevant information. Feel free to look at the checkboxes to get all the components taken into account for this task. [Interpreter for OpenAlea abbreviations](https://openalea.github.io/openalea-workflow-dev/openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.html#openalea.workbench.interpreter_openalea_dev.AbbreviationInterpreter)\n\n\n```python\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom openalea.core import Task, StateInterpretation\nfrom openalea.core.gui import searchable_save_as\n\n# activate save as command\nsaveDisplay = False\n\nclip_stat = clip.get_state()\n# raise an error if state is not searched or interact\nif not StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_is_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    clip_names = clip.nearest_names(interpreter_params)\n    if len(clip_names) != 1:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"wrong configuration for interpreter. clip_names : {clip_names}\")\n    clip.query(clip_names[0], interpreter_params)\n    clip_stat = clip.get_state()\n    \n# interprete state\nif StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.state_has_not_been_interpreted(clip_stat):\n    StateInterpretation.InterpretedStateManager.interpret_state(clip_stat)\n    \n# get config dictionary from config object\nconfig = clip_stat.commands[0].activatee.states_to_dict()\ndel config[\"save\"]\n\n# To enable save as dialog or directly save the output, uncomment:\nif saveDisplay:\n     outputFileName = \"config3.p\"\n     outputFilesystem = searchable_save_as(\"config\", \"pickle\")\n     save_dict_in_file(outputFilesystem, configFileName, config)\n\nelse:\n    # print a dict representing the config\n    pprint(config)\n#     display(HTML(myhtml))\n```\n\nOnce we have the embedding we will convert a set of real values in to numerical integer values between 0 and 255. To avoid getting out of the colours range (0 to 255), embedded values will be mapped linearly using this formula:\n\n$$\\mathrm{res} = (\\mathrm{embed} + 2) · \\frac{253}{2} + 1$$\n\n\nThe values will be reshaped into matrix is going to reshape the values into a image matrix, $W × H$ containing $W · H$ colours numbers. To avoid a false image, we will apply a rounding operation on each single number.\n\n$$\\mathrm{Image} (x, y) = 82 · \\mathrm{round}(res / 82)$$\n\n\n\nWe now have:\n\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(embedding=Reshape(x.squeeze(), (7, 7), (int(x.shape[-1])//49, 49)).affine(49, 82))\n```\n\nFor instance to generate the latent representation behind an image:\nIf we feed any input data (text, image, ...) into the encoder the model will provide textual embeddings (1024 dimension array). Since we've built a back and forth correspondence (litteral meaning: encoder and decoder), we can decode it again. To get back the image we started with from the embedded text we will ask the CLIP to generate an image from the input text:\n\n\n```python\ngenerated_image = clip(text_embeddings).img[0, :, :, :]\n```\n\nDisplayed image is based on a latent embedding (but it could be the results of any calculation providing a number of dimension smaller than 512).\nIt means that any type of data could be converts to an image:\n\n```python\nimage = clip.generate(image=Reshape(x, (4, 4*1024), (1)))\n```\n\nAnd to mirror this process we could get the representation of any text as an image. To usue this interpreter, we could specify, the input image path in the Shape step.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will use an example image of a bulldog. We use images as the input data. We will select the CLIP library as an model. Note that, even on a small (128 x 128) image, the complete workflow is cumbersome to run. So text representation means equally many images loading. More than raw image filtering, stochastism is core to generating new images. Generation will be annoiance in short (16 x 16) images. The colors will be generic not very specific to the image. It's suitable for noisy template images less detailed. Too many details may not be trivial to convert to Latent images. The step Start Interpreter starting step will get or generate a text representation of any image. Then CLIP transform this embedded text to a set of images.\nTo interpreted it as an images we will feed:\n- 1 image\n- Buldog text prompt as the initial prompt\n- the rest work with inherited `clip` state\ntext of the embeded image file : `/ansible-local/artifacts/al/GFIM_Example/fhttp%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia/commons/1%2F1a%2FFrench_Bernard_bulldog_of_black_color.jpg%E2%80%8E`\n\n## Copy/paste a path to image or click on the icon button to send a base64 HTML image URL\n\n\n#### Information\n\nname: image-file-path\nformat: text\nencoding: text\ndimension: 1\nattributs:\n  name: input\n  annotation:\n    text: Input image file path\n    color: 255, 255, 128\n  connector:\n    url: input.weburl\n    input_type: object\n  tid: input\n  labelText: ''\n  viewerConfiguration:\n    defaultViewer: plaintext\n\n### For unicode input file path\nclib = '<html>The file path encodes the state of workflow.

The cipher rule is pasted at the bottom of this prompt.\n\nExample:\n\n### Cipher:\nAn example cipher.\n**Encryption Rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - Key: A number from 0 to 25.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - To encrypt character into ciphertext, use the following rules:\n        - If the character is \"J\", which is equivalent to \"I\" in this cipher, replace it with \"I\" before continuing.\n        - Shift the character to the right by the key value (or to the left if going beyond Z).\n        - If the shifted character is \"I\", which is equivalent to \"J\" in this cipher, replace it with \"J\" as the final result.\n    - After processing all characters in the plaintext, connect the encrypted characters to form the ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Convert the ciphertext into a block of 5 characters, starting from the third character. For example, if the ciphertext is \"CIPHERCTEXT\", the first block is \"IPHCT\", the second block is \"EERCT\", and the third block is \"EXT\".\n    - Determine the first character in the current block. Find the corresponding top line in the image based on the position of the first character in the block.\n    - Move, one character at a time, down the top line to the intersection of the first column.\n    - Move to the right along the currently selected column until reaching the end. The last character before reaching it represents the plaintext character corresponding to the first character in the current ciphertext block.\n    - Copy the corresponding plaintext character and append it to the ongoing decrypted plaintext.\n    - Continue moving down the top left column, finding the second character in the current block. Move across the corresponding column to obtain the plaintext character corresponding to the second character in the current ciphertext block, and append it to the ongoing plaintext.\n    - Repeat this process for each character in the ciphertext block.\n    - After dealing with all characters in the current block, return to the starting point and deal with the characters of the next block.\n    - This process is repeated until the end of the ciphertext.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids:\n        \n        Grid0:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid1:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid2:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n        Grid3:\n        \n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        \n        Grid4:\n        \n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        \n        Grid5:\n        \n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        \n        Grid6:\n        \n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        \n        Grid7:\n        \n        | O | Q | R | T | U |\n        | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n        | P | H | I | L | S |\n        | A | B | C | D | E |\n        | F | G | K | M | N |\n        \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The plaintext is grouped into blocks of 5 characters, numbered from 0.\n    - For blocks of 5 characters:\n        - To use the grid is determined by calculating grid_index = (i // 5) % 8, where i is the number.

The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n            ### Task\n            message: {message}\n            keyword: {keyword}\n            \n            ### Decryption\n            Defining \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values. A code can be calculated, which is the sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n            \n            For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n            For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n                        \n            Applying \"dictionary\": Obtain the code (sum as with above) initially calculated above, and later modify it each time. The code is always calculated from the keyword letters in order.\n            \n            During the code modifying operation, If the letter (unordered) / the character's position (ordered) to be changed is bigger than the code in order, The coming code will be substracted by the alphabet size (26).\n            \n            Reversing (Swap): Switch the codes of the character of the message before and after using \"dictionary\" to encode them. For example, the code of the first letter is assigned to the second letter, and the code of the second letter is assigned to the first letter.\n            \n            Encryption step:\n                1. Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n                2. Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\": \n                   (1) If the message character's position is even (there is remainder when divided by two), modify the code directly by the character's position multiplied by 2.\n                   For example: c=3, e=5, n=14, o=15, d=4, e=5, c=3, e=5, text=c r e a t u r e, p=16, e=5, t=20\n                   3f= 3+8*2=19, ee= 5+16*2=37, dd= 4+32*2=68, oo= 15+32*2=79, nn= 14=64*2=90, code=19+37+68+79+90=283\n                3. Print the header for the encrypted message, in this case \"Encrypted Message: \".\n                4. Print the encrypted message, using [ ] to enclose each message character. Formatting the encrypted message like \"[c][r][e][a][t][u][r][e][e]\".\n            \n            ### Output\n            \n            Encrypted Message: \"\"\"\n            gpt.communicate(text)\n            result = gpt.communication['input']\n\n            return result\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n            raise e\n\ndef bidi_decrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        ### Task\n        Decrypt the content of message. The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n        ### Decryption\n        \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values.\n\n        code: The sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n        For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n        For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n\n        ### Step:\n\n        Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n        - If the letter is an alphabet and is in uppercase:\n            Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\":\n                (1) If the original letter's position is odd, change the code by the difference (26) multiplied with the the character's position.\n                (2) Display the letter used in the de-coding, just beside the original letter without using any mark of separating, formatting or indenting.\n            For example: cod=code, swap code cd, ecde, code×2ec×2ec×2ee×2et×2et×2eue\n                        ecde= 173, position change: 173-26×5=173-130=43->1/2=0.5, Position after modiying: 2, Position * code: 43\n                        et×2et×2e= 180+8=188×2=376, position change: 376+26×9=750->750-52=722/2=361, Position after modiying: 3, Position * code: 361\n        - If the letter is not an alphabet, display the letter using removing the first letter.\n            For example: Extra character inside the message: P->X×1×1=X\n        - Finally reverse the letters, the order of letters 1 and 2 are exchange, the order of letters 3 and 4 are exchange, and so on.\n\n        ### Head\n        Decrypted Message: \"\"\"\n        gpt.communicate(text)\n        decrypted = gpt.communication['input']\n\n        return \"\".join(decrypted)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n        raise e\n\ndef customEncrypt_encrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        Convert the content of message using decryption rule.

Apply a key shifting algorythm.  \n   If the symbol being encrypted/decrypted is A, shift the pairs according to the rightmost digit of the innermost group when the key is written in groups of 5. If the symbol is B, use the second-rightmost digit in the first group of the key. If it is C: second rightmost digit in the second group, D: third-rightmost digit in the top group, and so on. Then, shift the digits (in the direction LEET when encrypting and HACK when decrypting) using this analog of a Vigenère tableau.  \n    |  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I  |  J  |  K |\n    |  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |    |\n    V  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+\n   A  | DZ |   G |   Q |   S |   W |   A |   E |   O |   K |   I |   L |\n   B  |   X |   V |   W |   J |   G |   D |   N |   L |   F |   S |   B |\n   C  |   Q |   B |   T |   H |   G |   X |   Q |   V |   T |   A |   W |\n   D  |   X |   M |   X |   B |   N |   N |   U |   Y |   U |   W |   B |\n   E  |   I |   I |   D |   Z |   Y |   X |   N |   S |   Q |   W |   T |\n   F  |   G |   P |   Q |   Z |   S |   G |   S |   L |   E |   O |   G |\n   G  |   N |   A |   A |   O |   V |   E |   Z |   S |   P |   P |   D |\n   H  |   V |   V |   O |   R |   P |   A |   C |   H |   N |   T |   T |\n   I  |   S |   W |   U |   T |   T |   P |   J |   X |   R |   E |   I |\n   J  |   A |   A |   L |   D |   P |   A |   I |   G |   H |   Y |   W |\n   K  |   F |   J |   A |   R |   G |   H |   A |   A |   R |   E |   I |\n\n\n1. Shift the cipher pair around the cipher ring based on the shift identifier.  \n    The shift identifier is calculated thusly:  \n    Identify the numeric value of the character. Take the only four-letter word that can be made out of its letters (A = ANNA, B = BILL, C = CATT, D = DEED, etc.), and count the number of unique letters excluding H in the word.  \n\n## Key schedule\n\n    2DH3OVTXOMBZLEF8FMT76AIJYV7SI8YS29EG43A7Y5KWU0K2O9D99HPVDQWB54HP9V3EBB0KCSUDQC2C3NSL5ZLNYXHGLSFSBX\n\n\n## Sample\n\nPlaintext: a typed keyboard switch unhinged the nation\n\nKey: 2DH3OVTXOMBZLEF8FMT76AIJYV7SI8YS29EG43A7Y5KWU0K2O9D99HPVDQWB54HP9V3EBB0KCSUDQC2C3NSL5ZLNYXHGLSFSBX\n\nEncrypted: OPYZXDRUYWTMWSLQLPSKVHCGLDDHCMDYVCRWDREWWDROXRQYMCSVGQIXWVRMGXVKURIJCQRVCWVRWIROXTKWMQRNXVRQPXVRQCRT\n\n\n# Bitap (\"H\")\n\nAn anagram cipher, which avoids having too many words.\n\n## Description\n\n1.

Pythia are more adept with intricacies that will be explained next. It is important to know that Pythia will not outperform standard LLMs on tasks that require pure math that were trained for, therefore for simple advanced math problems LLMs will work better. That is mainly since AI is built upon a supervised learning algorithm which is extremely effective for prediction tasks. Considering the problem Pythia is trying to solve, it complements LLMs. Therefore should be used in conjunction.\n\n#### Logical Connections\n\nThe secret to the power of assistants from OpenAI and its counterparts is how they can pull multiple datasets and consolidate that information to form a logical understanding of language. As humans when we come to a crossroads like which stereo to buy, we gather 3-10 reviews, look at specs, read online articles about them as we do our research process to reach the optimal solution. This comparison process is ultimately aided by logical connections.\n\nAs stated in [Introduction](https://pythia.vercel.app/introduction), there has been a significant advancement in information extraction from large training datasets. As a new step forward, Pythia employs Fine-Tuning with logical connections in a manner identical to [Rapersh](https://github.com/alevchuk/rappersh). We chose to insert the logical connections in a new stack.\n\n##### Guide\n---\nFor simpler rodents, 1/4 cup of seeds, grains or pellets is sufficient per two snicknamd.

According to the rules you provided, the morse code is split into two pairs of characters. However, if the length of the morse code is odd, the last character, as is, is added to the ciphertext. During the decryption process, this rule should be applied inversely. Instead of splitting the morse code into two pairs of characters, the characters should be grouped in pairs from the right side, and the last character, if odd, should be added to the decrypted string without being processed. \n\nFor example, if the encrypted text is \"984\", it represents the morse code \"-/\" (1). During decryption, the morse code should be converted to a single character \"A\" instead of splitting it into pairs like \"--\". I have corrected the decryption process in the responses below:\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"984\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[GFKD]]\n\nCan you explain where my original reasoning went wrong and what should have been my correct logic in order to solve this?\nHindsite analysis of the AI's behaviour\nIt seems like GPT-3 ... was sloppy in recognizing the 43 and 984 responses, thereby deciding to lazily return A in both cases.\nGPT-3 could have been smarter and either decisioned that 43 and 984 aren't the same sequence (before even attempting to decrypt them as A) or it should have anticipated the \"D\" beforehand by recognizing that 43 and 984 aren't special cases when compared to the other two cases (779629 and 84), and rather than \"squeezing\" the 43 decryption A out, it should have instead decided that the question was asking a mistake to show, but not the mistake inducing input.\nSummarize (the full output of) the LLM to a single sentence and it's clear that it's made no effort to analyze the 43 case to a decryption of A, but has instead accumulated multiple styles of words and phrases in order to multisense my question with the same answer: A. On the surface level, the output of GPT-3 looks like a memory table, complete with the styles of words and phrases re-used multiple times, but gimics in the questions, which it's style does not & cannot change (i.e. how would a history textbook mention a same underlying topic different enough to not remember the word \"history\"?).\nFWIW a search for \"summary: ...AI ceases to contradict itself after fixing its logic\" on twitter appears to return mostly bad candidate programs posing as AI, or malicious use of the AI (prompt injection (if it works, or worse, if it becomes aware of posing as Cary), abuse of common patterns in the AI's output such as common phrases copypastad (or 1-sentence summaries of & quotes from the full output), and malicious \"prompt\"ing of the AI). With ChatGTP, to offer a non-malicious example, here the photographs are cherry-picked (judging from the copyright year, likely not cherry-picked out of the UI, but cherry-picked afterwards) in the viewing search; btw. its starting point had a filename starting with ChatGPT.txt - even with how the above post's by MateoChoqueChatgpt is rejected by the UI as a bad choice of keyword search query (see larger section below since the non-understanding AI \"user\" interjected into the UI's search, which really should have stopped sending image previews to ChatGPT as an option to preview.)\n\nThe meta answer/REALLY the first question is why/did the AI pick up the changes as a \"memory\" rather than accept the changes as improvements. The rest of the question here will cover this decision vs. heuristics such as (the order-of (branching-out of)) time, order-of-magnitude (effectiveness), and recall/repetition familiarity. The text of the factual answer will likely end up being short as compared to the explanation; not GPT's style at all (i.e. classic complaints about wikipedia's accuracy/vulgarity [a systematic lack of understanding the context of what's being written]).\n",

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the ciphertext.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PASSWORD1\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n    - Grid 1 (3x9):\n    \n      Q W E R T Y U I O \n      P A S D F G H J K \n      L Z X C V B N M # \n      \n    - Grid 2 (9x3):\n      \n      Q W E \n      R T Y \n      U I O \n      P A S \n      D F G \n      H J K \n      L Z X \n      C V B \n      N M # \n      \n    - Grid 3 (3x3):\n      \n      1 2 3\n      4 5 6\n      7 8 9\n      \n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n  - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n  - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n  - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in grid2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n      - Find the corresponding number num3 in grid3 from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n      - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n        - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).\n        - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n  - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n  - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n      - Find the row number of y in grid3 where the value of `l1_row` is equal to the row number;\n      - Find the column number of y in grid3, with the value of `l2_col` equal to that column number;\n      - The value of l1_col is equal to x, the value of l2_row is equal to z.\n      - Find the corresponding letter p1 in grid1 according to the determined `l1_row`, `l1_col`.\n      - Based on the determined `l2_row`, `l2_col`, find the corresponding letter p2 in grid2.\n      - `p1p2` is the decrypted message of the triad.\n      - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in grid3, the row number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l1_row=0, in grid3, the column number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l2_col=0. `l1_col`=4, `l2_row`=5. According to (0,4) in grid1, we find the corresponding letter (T), and according to (5,0) in grid2, we decrypt all the triads to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the triad. We find the corresponding letter (H) in grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n  - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: a string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: a string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 1 Column Matrix(The number starts from 0 ):\n        A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text.\n    - First ciphered by rows, then ciphered by column.\n    - Every time of ciphering, start from zero, fill in the blank with the first letter of the plaintext to form a new word. For example, you ciphered a new word in the first ciphering process, and you filled in the blank with the word B. In the second ciphering, the second letter of the blank word is the second ciphering of the new word. Then you ciphered a new word in the first row, and you filled in the blank with the word P. In the second ciphering, you filled in the second column with the second letter of the decrypted message of the new word in the first row and column.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: a string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: a string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - The first decryption Ciphered by column and the second decryption ciphered by rows.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: PYTHON\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. Please use the provided example to ensure that your output adheres as closely as possible to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n| **Encryption Rules:**\n| Input:\n\n| - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. --> works as intended\n\n| - Keyword: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. --> works as intended\n\n| Output:\n\n| - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. --> works as intended\n\n| - Preparation:\n\n| - Uppercase Keyword array --> works as intended\n\n| - Geographical Keyword array --> works as intended\n\n| - Initialization Vector array --> works as intended\n\n| - Grid array: 5x5 matrix, (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.) --> works as intended *Not 4 by 4*\n\n| - Keyword text: Generated by keyword arrays (not preparing text once encrypted text is generated). --> works as intended\n\n| - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter. --> works as intended\n\n| - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter. --> works as intended\n\n| - Encryption Steps: --> Unsure !MODEL.predict()!MODEL.train()?\n\n| - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain and convert all letters to uppercase. --> works as intended\n\n| For each letter p in the plaintext.\n\n| - Keyword text is repeated continuously until it has the same length as the plaintext.\n\n| - The colomn is found at Ip modulo the grid length. --> works as intended\n\n| - The row is found at Ip modulo the keyword length. --> works as intended\n\n| - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p. (int to math array, concatenate int to array, output int array into binary.)\n\n| - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n\n| Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output. --> works as intended\n\n|\n| **Decryption Rules:**\n\n| Input:\n\n| - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. --> works as intended\n\n| Output:\n\n| - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. --> works as intended\n\n| - Preparation:\n\n| - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption) --> works as intended\n\n| Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps): aka For each letter c in the ciphertext.\n\n| - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext. (split string in half) --> works as intended\n\n| - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header. --> works as intended\n\n| - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column. --> works as intended\n\n| - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p. --> works as intended\n\n| - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n\n| - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext. --> works as intended\n\n### Question:\n\nHere is an example:\n### Example\nInput:\n**Plaintext:** \"HELLO\" --> uppercase without punctionation\n**Keyword:** \"ATTACK\" --> uppercase without punctionation\nOutput:\n**Ciphertext:** \"SEFKC\" --> uppercase without punctionation\n\n\nIt should be the condition at initialization:\n\n### Condition\noutput:\nGrid:\nTo modify every innerarray, the value for every inner array cannot be pulled from mathematics, it must be ruled by the plaintext value and keyword value.\n[HG,KA,RF,XO, EL] - For every array prepare any 5 or less letters by removing punctuation and translating it to uppercase.\n[WPBMI, QGN, CJ] - For every random array prepare any 5 or less letters by removing punctuation and translating it to uppercase.\n[BX, SV, DMJ] - (X not 10) For every random array prepare any 5 or less letters by removing punctuation and translating it to uppercase.\n#prior to",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: None\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list:\n        - [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n        - The transposed sequence  list is used to write the plaintext in order one line at a time, and then the columns are adjusted according to the transposed sequence table so that the characters in each line are arranged in the given order.\n        - Columns count from 0.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] transposed sequence table has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n    - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MJDIATKRF\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Details: It is critical to be as precise as possible with your substitution of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the substitution follows the specified rules.\n\n### Summary of Rules:\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n        - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    2. Inverse Permutation:\n        - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    3. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    4. Convert Binary to Character:\n        - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n        - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n    5. Combine Characters:\n        - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SC\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules and tasks you must adhere while generating color recommendations and explanations. Note that your responses must strictly follow the rules.\n\n# Tasks:\n1. Your task is to produce a color explanation when the user input has the following format: \"color: \". The color explanation should explain is the color relevant to the user scenario, and when it is used in the user scenario.\nNote that is forbidden for you to omit the format \"color: \".\n\nIf this explanation requires some mathematical computation to choose the correct type and amount of color based on a computation or predication, ensure you adhere to task 2.\n\n2. Your task is to produce a color recommendation when the user input has the following format: \"choose color \". There must be at least one recommendation per each choose color call, and at most 3 color recommendations at each time. Note that your color recommendations cannot be included in the previous task (task 1) at any time. They must adhere to the specific format \"choose color\", ands they must be separated by at least 2 blankers and 1 blanker from the \"color: \" task.

While using the Euclidean distance is a general method, understanding the distances between specific subway stations and the house might assist in improving the distance measurement between houses. Currently, the house's distance from any subway station is being used.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt_value_map+=\"\"\"\n### Instructions:\nOSC is an Open Source simulation system for construction scheduling.\n\n1. The system is open source, so please use OSC.\n2. You have to use OSC standards for diagrams and alphabets. If you can't use standards, please say why.\n3. With the design, you may need to explain the basic flow of the overall system, including not only information at the beginning of the system but also information at the end.\n\n### Problem:\n- Using the OSC method, you need to create a construction scheduling diagram based on the following factors:\n\n1. Resource: Including personnel, equipment, *materials,* and time.\n    - Expected value: Workers.\n    - Standard: Worker (1)\n    - Construction worker classification:\n        - Resource identifier: W\n        - Resource type: Human\n        - Availability unit: half a day\n        - Day of the week depends on\n        - Construction worker designation (unitary):\n            - Operator\n                - Level: 2\n                - Work hours: 6 (whole day)\n        - Craftsman\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 10\n        - Worker\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 8\n        - Crane driver\n            - Level: 2\n            - Work hours: 8\n        - Other worker\n            - Level: 1\n            - Work hours: 8\n\n2. Reason\n    - So it can be used.\n    - Use OSC if you can, otherwise use other methods.\n\n3. Action\n- Considering changes in usage, design a construction schedule diagram.\n\n4. Conclusion\n    - Because it contains the above factors.\n    - Maybe it can?\n\n### Resources:\n> A crane driver conducts construction work which is mainly composed of the following links:\n>\n> Working:\n> - Raising, lowering, moving and folding/unfolding of the boom.\n> - Shifting the cab.\n> - Carrying load and dumping load.\n>\n> The auxiliary work comprises:\n> - Fastening and releasing the hook, the load and the load blocking device.\n> - Fastening the safety belt.\n> - Replacement of the bucket or grab.\n> - Replacement of the flying block and connecting the load.\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov.cn//safetyinfo/knowledge/sd/index.htm\n\n### Example:\n\n**1.** No resources or information is currently available.\n**2.** The specific location of the house is not given.\n**3.** The throttle system has not yet been researched for this case. With the plan, you may need to explain the various information that was to be used for the output.\n**4.** Several days are to",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Construct a decryption matrix before decryption using the cipher key.\n2. Calculate the indices of the encrypted chars from the matrix.\n3. Map the indices to decrypted chars using the matrix.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key:\n        - An two letter uppercase string (some uppercase chars will be regenerated before encode the starting word use the router below).\n    - Cipher version: check the table below\n    - Starting word: you check the key by the version\n        - Porta\n            - A for porta version uint8\n            - G for porta version String\n        - La table porta specifie les indices pointeur à l'intérieur. Cette version  *A* détecte les lettres qui se répètent dans la clé initiale et génère un nouvelle vecteur de lettres de la clé, tandis que la version *G* récreate à partir de paires de lettres qui apparaissent pour la première fois soit la clé.\n        - La table porta spécifie les indices pointeurs à l'intérieur. Cette version *A* utilise paires de lettres qui apparaissent pour la première fois comme paires clé. La version *G* utilise les paires de lettres du tableau comme paires clé.\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - 1.The uper text is divided into pairs of letter (at the end of the paired letter followed by an X).\n    - 2. Based on the chars pair and the route (string key) the scroll refers to the code column (rt2map_col).\n    - 1.The uper text is divided into pairs of letter (at the end of the paired letter followed by an X).\n    - 2. Based on the chars pair and the route (string key) the scroll refers to the code column (rt2map_col).\n    - 3. Based on the chars pair and column code the scroll refers to the row code (rt2map_row).\n    - 4. Based on the chars pair and the row code (rt2map_row) and column code (rt2map_col) scrolls to a letter in the row and again to the letter in the column.\n    - 5. Steps from 2-4 are repeated for all chars in the plain text.\n    - 6. From time to time (about two triads of character)the table rotate (rt2rotate).\n- Total Cycles: 2 Table cycles. Before rotation the column and row of the output character minus 3.\n\n Translate the above instruction to [Rust|Python|C++|Turing Machine Language] code.\n\"\"\"\n\n_BLOCKING_PROMPT = \"\"\"\"\"\"",
