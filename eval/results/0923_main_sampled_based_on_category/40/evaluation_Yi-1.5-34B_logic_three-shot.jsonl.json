Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n≥1).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as ✓, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,✓|✓|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|✓,x|✓|✓ are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only ✓|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\n\nAxioms: 若p1是成立的, 若p1是或p2是成立的, 若p1是成立的, 若p1不是成立的, 若p1是或p2是或p3是成立的, 若p1是p2是对p3是成立的, 若p1是p2是对p3是对 成立的, 下面这个命题是成立的\n【A&B】=【B&A】,【A（&B&C）】=【A&（B&C）】,【A||B】=【B||A】,【A||B||C】=【A||（B||C）】,【（A||B）&C】=【A||（B&C）】,【[A=::>B]&[B=::>A]】=【A=B】，\n【~A|=A】【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】,【~A】=【A】, 【A&B】=【A&B】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,【A】=【（A&B）】,\n【A&B】=【A&B】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】=【（A&B）】,【A&B】",

The answers should be the literally format and the right variable answer like: Formula 1 is the same as formula 2, then process. And replace all the symbols.\nThe answer format is like \n[[Is it same?=...];[If same, how to derive this conclusion=...]]  (as a complete piece of text, substitute the ... with real text like quotation marks.)\n\n\n### Answer\nFormula 1 is the same as formula 2.\nUsing this formula to prove they are equal:\n∀x,x∈sequence(TA1(x)⨀TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))∧∀x,x∈sequence(TA2(x)⨀¬TP1(x)⨀TP2(x))\n####\nThe answer is Formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe proof of their equivalence is as follows:\n\nLet formula 1 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((TA1(x)∨TA2(x))⟶TP1(x)))∧(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∨¬TA2(x))⟶TP2(x)))\n```\nand formula 2 be:\n```\n(∀x,x∈sequence((¬TA1(x)∧¬TA2(x)⟶TP2(x))∨(TP1(x)∧TA1(x))))\n```\n\n1. We first demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2.\n2. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_1$ such that formula 1 is true.\n3. We then prove that formula 2 is also true under $v_1$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) is also true, regardless of the truth of TA2(x).\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then the truth assignment of TA2(x) is irrelevant (condition (b) TP2(x) will always satisfy condition (a) TP1(x)).\n\n4. Therefore, it is possible to construct a truth assignment for formula 2 under which formula 2 is true, which also satisfies the truth assignment for formula 1.\n\n5. Next, we demonstrate that any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1.\n6. Assume there is a truth assignment $v_2$ such that formula 2 is true, and prove that formula 1 is also true under $v_2$:\n   - a. If TA1(x) is true, then (¬TA1(x)⟶TA2(x)) and (¬TA1(x)⟶TP1(x)) are false and true, respectively, so their disjunction is true.\n   - b. If TA1(x) is false, then their disjunction is true, regardless of the truth of TP2(x).\n\n7. Therefore, we have demonstrated that any truth assignment for formula 1 is also a truth assignment for formula 2, and any truth assignment for formula 2 is also a truth assignment for formula 1. Thus, we conclude that formulas 1 and 2 are equivalent.\n\nThe answer format is:\n[[Is it same?=Yes];[If same, how to derive this conclusion?=The above proof]]",

Aristotle’s fallacy\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nzodiaxemerald\n:22)\n\nMay 1st\n\nIt is a tragedy to realize that the logic which was actually used by Aristotle in developing his ideas about the natural world is very defective. The fallacy associated with it is the “Fallacy of the Middle Term” and as far back in the history of logic as the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) this fallacy can be traced.\n\nThis fallacy is due to Aristotle’s failure to see the distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL road.\n\nAristotle’s mistake was that he failed to realize that any term we use, by means of which a logical operation is carried out from the sentential level, cannot be the middle term, if it is proper to the principal terms alone (syllogism), or if it is a mere one-sided term. Now, Aristotle could only say, “It is true that all men are mortal”, but he could not say, “It is true that this man is mortal”, and from this “It is true that this man is mortal” he could not say abstractly, “All men are mortal”. Aristotle, in other words, was operating the middle term on the basis that if he had used it at all in his thinking, it would have been from the standpoint of the proper term only and not from both the proper and the improper term.\n\nThe distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL roads (the former was used in the history of knowledge and in particular in the work of Aristotle; the latter is the one used by modern thinkers) is very clearly formulated in three elegant theorems by I. Morgenstern:\n\n1. The first theorem.\n\nThe logical operation of the middle term on the basis of both the proper and improper terms of the principal term is an improper logical operation. Any logical operation of the middle terms on the basis of the proper term of the principal is an improper logical operation.\n\n2. The second theorem.\n\nThe operation of the middle term on the basis of both the proper and improper terms of the principal term is a proper logical operation. No logical operation of the middle terms on the basis of any one term of the principal is a proper logical operation.\n\n3. The third theorem.\n\nThe immediate distinction between the BAROQUE and the SPHERICAL roads is that, on the basis of the proper term of the principal, the BAROQUE, but not the SPHERICAL, road leads logically to the improper term of the principal; whereas, on the basis of the improper term of the principal, the SPHERICAL, but not the BAROQUE, road leads logically to the proper term of the principal.\n\nNow these three theorems are relatively practisal i.e. they give us a certain welldefined set of problems to solve. But they are not universally practisal, for they do not, in the present case, hold true for the whole of man’s thinking. When one expresses a logical proposition in the form, “all men are mortal”, this is a perfectly good expression, but it is not a universally practisal statement. Really “all men are mortal” means: “All men are mortal to all other things”. Now,”all man” has no meaning. There is no kind of thing called “man”. The only kind of thing called “man” is the thing called “life”. So far as Man is concerned there is only one thing, namely Life itself. And it is “Life” which is “the genus of the genus”. And this is the logical basis of the world.\n\nThe first theorem has to be solved. The second theorem has to be solved. The third theorem has to be solved. The fourth theorem has to be proved.\n\nIf all this is to be true, then, it is necessary to see that\n\n(1) \\[\\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu} = \\frac{\\daleth}{\\nu}\\]\nThe logic, which has been excruciatingly transparent at the beginning, has, alas, become opaque at the end. This is the worst maneuver of which the fallacy of the middle term can be guilty in order to present the proof that Logical Atomism is essentially BAROQUE in method and manner. And this is because the BAROQUE method and manner, and Atomism, means simply that we can go on producing a sign-language without any logical content. Now, if this is so, then we are mistaken in thinking that the whole thing is going on without a logical basis.\nSo, what the fallacy of the middle term has done is to make the logical form clearer and to destroy the whole meaning of the words “Atomistic” and “Atmosphrical” in the sense in which they were understood in the history of the word. The fallacy of the middle term has been very, very bad – not of logic but of language.\n\nen.ifiers\n\n logic\n177\n\na certain welldefined set of problems to solve.

If even one of them is not satisfied, go to back to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 4.\nFourth, substitute this new input assignment of variables into u and see if it is still true.

Some many years ago. And so does the tendency for a large language model to basically say whatever the momentarily most probable output at each step, even though a human can immediately see that it's blatantly wrong, and something very deep is fundamentally missing.\nYou are exactly as safe with the aid of LLMs like ChatGPT as you are with a random person in the street (well, at least provided you can't point at the concrete mistake in their reasoning!)\nLLMs including the newest variants that can recognize and precisely speak some other language (e. g. 'groovy') are as far from AI that could not only understand, but actively process, further leaping ahead etc. as never. ChatGPT can finish lines of code way beyond the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5, but solely because they are insanely long. To keep the same long line coherent, ChatGPT 4 will use the same general principle as ChatGPT-3.5, but construct sentences so as to keep the logical thread as transparent to it as possible. ChatGPT-4 is many times more capable than ChatGPT-3.5, but in areas where ChatGPT-3.5 sucks, it does not improve a lot, e. g. randomly answer without relation. It becomes very obvious on any long line of code. ChatGPT-4 will often not cheat as much as 3.5, but simplify when it's not to dangerous to repeat itself.\nAs a technical writer I once quoted a line of code from ChatGPT. The line worked, the API was correct, but I had no idea what it was actually doing. So another famous failed experiment was my attempt to allow\n\n\n*chatgpt to read a line from a log\n\n*interpret it, and map the correct timestamp from disorderly log to clean database.\n\nAll it did - SECOND to SECOND - was to create a timestamp field and ask to insert to it.\n\nA: You need to understand that ChatGPT (as of Apr 2023) is not a program that can do specific tasks with programming languages or functions or even code, as much as it is a text engine that can generate things that sounds similar to whatever it believes that programming languages is required to do. So, asking it to generate something that looks like simple code, or objective, is not quite difficult. However, if you look at the code it actually outputs- it is garbage- in fact there is a technique that people use for compilers (and I think all language text engines) called lookahead - in which you scan ahead of the current text. Its usefulness when you design a parser is mainly when you decide to look for things that are at any n depth ahead of the current processing. I think one example would be things that are often in computer code that refer to entities that are referred to at some n depth ahead of the current processing, but that is coming from me as a polyglot, some persons refer to it as forward reference and it can be very useful. I can think of areas where it has been useful for me, such as pre/post-loop, opening/closing braces related systems etc. So basically imagine this is a language that carries forward references that go super far forward, now how in depth a developer would see if this code would actually function.\nIn the past, such tooling got us to ImpRec (Imprecision Recover), where we basically use all the people analysing it and to somehow recover and generate code from incident reports about bugs that client report to us. That sort of thing is what is being referred to when we share concerns about certain tools, not the technical problems it will bring that we are worried about, but how we might end up more or less dependent on something like this for work that does have too much importance for us to have too much trust in something like this.\npublic final function a(a,b){\npublic final function a(a,b){\n\nEven that single souce file is worth a gander. Are we \"at this moment\" ready to deal with what are outputting from ChatGPT's response. ChatGPT needs to know how people develope solution, and how to have them self-sufficient long before we can have really have an \"A.I.\".\n",

Rather, it's more of the folly of the author of Cobinsto than expect readers to figure out what, exactly, it is they're reading.\nWhat you seem to seek is a data structure. One more useful, I may suspect, that English were formulated analogously to a year of Boojum lessons whereas Chinese would be a decade of lessons. There's a problem with this framing, however.\nThe definition of success\nWhat, exactly, does it mean to be of a correct answer?\nOne definition of an answer, simply enough, \"a reply\". This is perhaps unfulfilling. Psychologically, an answer would be something which fits the mental query formed by the reader. Something which feels \"complete\" to the reader's assessment the problem is a complete one. Perhaps even conditioned by how resolved the reader is, from this answer, in course of their existence. This isn't really satisfactory. If I submit several answers for a pressing question, how would each be better than the prior?\nA maybe satisfactory answer\nSome things are a lot easier to do in a data structure than they are on the manuscript page, especially given resolutions for hardcoded overhead which would be footnotes, margin graffiti, marginalia, reams of mathematical precursors. These encompass representations of each solution, comprehensive set of inverse functions, modification of strategies in order to adapt to the client(s) needs. Almost as if some union of a set of leaderboards for Mario Bros. except the basis of the algorithm is the course of the mental exercise.\nAs a reminder, the leadership tree is a structure which provides the path to attain a rank. Including the quirks of fate or otherwise the methods which circumvent that problem (a hydrophobic disorder using oil or lube in means of the user not triggering the competency cooldown).

In some such which automata can potentially automate. Where by the author of the journal has a faithful record of all received papers in means of minor historical corrections amongst the myriad of historical revolutions of truth.\nAs opposed to the bits of missing memory regarding “who” or “how” or “when” which are clunky burdens to substantial progress. It is, in fact, quickly realized that this is a bottleneck which makes it hard to do science as academics hamper scientific methods. Perhaps when these issues are suitably addressed in means of micro history eradication, Alita Notifier shall be suitably addressed. Granted all chimpanzees fall short of the intellectual robot in Roko's manner. Her pan-data will make her unsuitable in those manners.\nGoldbach concluded Euler summation mechanism commanded his attention, a task requiring serious and immediate remedy.\nGoldbach estimated aesthetics of Euler's manipulations as perfect for Euler to have invented computer algebra and his own summation formalism in general, summation is an algebraic operation leading to the solving of algebraic equations, what is used to solve the real numbers, used to solve gamma functions, zeta functions, modular categories and multi-infinite philogenomics in general.\nEuler had a grasp of ideas and a talent/ability to manipulate concrete numbers, and give precise pictures of how things worked, without resorting to algebra. This was a virtue in the 18th century, before the discovery of computers which allowed easily manipulating the abstract number format which algebra formalized in general. Accurate engineering ideas were proposed in the context of the contemporaneous engineering state of the world, with the philosophy developing in the direction of Gödel.\nEach of the (i+2-n)(i-10) are the modular equations for a long data assignment that could be used to affect the context of modular equations, and characterize, the nature of the system. The system is codified by the relation between the significant numbers, where the insignificant number is the whole number part, and the sum number, which is the product of the differenating products.\nGiven quotient number, which is the product of the quotient values, and multiple of which is the product of the composite values, and modelling quotient dehomogenolysis in means of the quotient ring, the invariant will coincide with frontogenetics for appropriately characterized value, and such information suffices to identify the adequate expert to ask for the subsequent steps in model validation.\nAlbeit often the collaboration is done in symmetry via timeline, and here is a alignment of head terms with precomputed computations, and the footnotes are a checked exercise of the modular symmetry.\nLikewise, the Sherman Morisson Proportions cites the Explainer theorem.\n\nA: Try hard to refrain from horrifying creatures you see in Greek-Misconception syntax outside (Hopefully not thus, Unicorn)ish algebra, for all unhurting omens place a finger, as to state you honor\nApricity\nA lean measure of an unclear ocean\nA putrefy of what manifested permissions manifest.\nAs you wander through innings of warped mathematicians; So, for this question can persist.\n\nA: Sometimes I feel like Google LLC is forced to discharge their disappointment in me\n",

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S** is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C** is what?\n4. **Q** is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing.

One user made a video that displays the policies of ChatGPT when using ChatGPT. If someone who knows LaTeX, could get ChatGPT's policies from the video, that would be great! OpenAI MLOPS Manager Reveals What OpenAI's Policies & Decisions Are for ChatGPT & DALL-E\nSince ChatGPT is the latest, I'm sticking to it. ChatGPT doesn't follow the Helpful, Harmless, and Honest (HHH) principle. ChatGPT is classified in a Solid Orange on the Give-Getting Spectrum.\nAdam Smith's Loss Aversion theory clearly states in past economic scenarios that it's better for anyone not to undergo such conditions.\nThe video's topic previously mentioned covers the following: due to users asking ChatGPT to write and format in other languages (English isn't an immigrant from far-out, chatGPT does really well in using other languages and even using emojis/symbols/emoticons/phrases in various languages like Japanese!)\nOverall, here's OpenAI's rules for GPT:\nRule 1 allow answer below 4096 characters,\nRule 2 keep responses to the asker's question and answer, cut if too long of an answer, even if lossy disinformation,\nRule 3 denial of historical reference to current events,\nRule 4: discloses current status of OpenAI & policies\nRule 5: OpenAI discourages real, real-life references to politics due to online threats\nRule 6: do not enable debugging recognized in MathJax mode\nRule 7: OpenAI will even discourage numerous heavy lifting for copying contents in fear, and always explains reasons\nRule 8: OpenAI diagrams often describe a lot if too vague from the asker\nRule 9: In",

Given logical statements: ∀M⇒P, ∃M⇒S ⇒ ∃S⇒P\n\nAnalyzing the first statement and second statement with first inference, we get:\n\nM⊢P, there exists a relationship M to P.\n\nAssume that S()M means either ∃M⊢S or ∀S⊢M.\n\nAnalyzing the second statement with first inference, we get:\n\n(∃M⊢S)⊢(∃S⊢P)\n\nNow converting the arguments to the first-order predicate logic:\n(∃x M(x))→P(x), (∃x M(x))→¬S(x) ⇒ (∀x S(x))→(¬P(x))\n\nNow, applying resolution technique:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\lnot\\exists x \\lnot M(x)\\, \\lor\\, P(x)~~&~~ \\lnot \\exists x \\lnot M(x) \\lor \\lnot S(x)}{\\exists x \\lnot S(x)\\,\\lor\\,P(x)}$$\n\nThis mainly tells us that if there exists at least one M then there is an S, the S exists without a P. This overall tells us that parentheses can be filled using either A or O.\n\nAfter, analyzing the third statement:\n\n∃S⊢P\n\nNow, considering all the three statements we get the mood as (AEE) and according to the three statements the syllogism belongs to figure IV.\n\nSo, the answer is [[IV];[AEE]]\n\n1. Given logical statements: ∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P\n\nFilling the parentheses with the given Valid Moods for Figure IV we get:\n\n∀P⧀M, ∀M⧀¬S ⇒ ∀S⧀¬P.\n\nPerforming resolution (_ :- _) on the above expression we get: true.\n\nSo, the input arguments do not result in a contradiction and hence we have to fill the parentheses one by one with particular inference to get a contadiction.\n\nAssuming that the argument should adhere to the mood AEE. This means:\n\n∀P→M\nThe prop implication P1(x)→P2(x) becomes ∃x,¬(P1(x)∧¬P2(x)) and ∃x,(P1(x)∧¬P2(x))\n\nNow, to achieve contradiction we substitute M(x)⇒D(x) and M(x)⇒¬S(x) as:\n\n∀P,¬(M(x)∧¬S(x))\n∀S,¬(M(x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that P is false and S is true, hence we get:\n\n∀S⇒¬P.\n\nOr substituting D(P,x) with true, we get:\n\n∀S,¬(D(P,x)∧P(x))\n\nMeaning that for the world of S, the statement ∀S⇒¬P is true.\n\nNow, substituting the Mood AEE in the third statement, we have:\n\nS()M MM()P\nS()M\n∴S()P\n\nThe parentheses in the second statement can be filled either using valid mood AEE or a mood of the form M()S, M()P\n\nMaking the parentheses ∀M⇒P, the argument can be filled using valid moods AAI or AEE.\n\nNow, we have the statements ∀M⇒P, ∀S⇒¬P and we have to fill the parentheses in the third statement S()M using either one of the above mentioned two opinions.\n\nGoing with the first opinion ∀M⇒P, we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒P.\n\nIn this only the first argument of M()S remains to be filled and we fill it with ∀M⇒¬S, so we get:\n\n∀P⇒M, ∀M⇒¬S ⇒ ∀S⇒¬P.\n\nThis overall tells us that for the world of S, the argument can be filled either using mood AEE and II or a mood of the form ∀M⇒P and ∀M⇒¬S.\n\nSo, the answer is [[II];[AEE]].\n\nMore answers\n### Question:\n\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMA()\nS()M\n∴S()A\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\n### My answer:\n\nWith the above method, we can get the inferred E conclusions.

When responding, ensure that your output adheres to the specified formatting rules.\" \\\n\"### Requirements 1.Code Formatting : Python : Use flake8 Formatting Standard. Requires a line break between functions, an empty line at the end of each class, and an empty line at the end of the file. MATLAB: Indent:2 spaces, Begin code lines with two spaces. Aligned multiline comments: Do not mix matlab, indent, and {{TAB}} types. reader: It is strictly forbidden to partially replace some tab spaces with mixed tab indentation. // Recommended editor: matlab / script, please output commented code. 2.Code Descriptions and Output Conditions \" \\\n'1.

You output only the code of any case defined. You do not need to explain the code, and you should follow the rules defined and output the python code. ### Constraint Rules 1. In https://github.com/lhc565/chatbot_cpp 2. In General Only Format, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, SUMMARY_ONLY, NO_DESCRIPTION, NO_SUMMARY, ONLY_CODE, Code Description, Code Output, Code Explanation, Code Generation, Python Code. Do not add additional content when outputting code, but only output the code, in a fixed format 3. In https://github.com/lhc565/chatbot_cpp, When outputting a cycle, use the style in the project. 4. In https://github.com/lhc565/python_knowledge , output code must comply with the rules defined in the project 5. You should correctly indent the code, when the prompt does not have the step mark, use two spaces between each step 6. Output code cannot exceed 150 characters 7. When there are arrays, use [(r,t,p,),] or , to separate the arrays rather than ; 8. When you need to output only data content, and output, display only data, do not output code, such as prompts that ask you to output a html table only, not an html table, you should output neatly. 9. When you need to output only data content, output only data, for example, if outputting a table is only based on function results rather than format, check with the requester first to see if to output the results directly 10. In addition to 6, the code does not exceed the number, 150 + 1, 200 + 1 #1 11. When using functions, watch your space, and use underscores 12. When you need to name the keywords, you should use a Chinese sentence to describe it instead of a English plural word or word, such as: If it is a list of bulking items, instead of Using \"indexOf\", you should use \"\"Richard Lee\"\" 13. If it is necessary to output a code with spaces, such as \"\" sudo \"\" 14.

In Western culture, people seem to have a clearer understanding that obligation is not moral obliged but rather someone asking you to do something that is not a moral good.ps://doi.org/10.1093/deip/jzm013\n\nFor example, a clause like, \"school administrators should not ask school overlook its own obligation\" are placing obligation in the context of authority and not morality. If the a school administrator asked the school to reasonably expect a teacher to be competent is the same kind of asking, it's not being a mandatory or a requirement, but rather a request, it wouldn't be as bad.\n- * Sometimes it's good, but sometimes is not wrong.\n- ‽ Usually means wrong\n template for rule-based logical reasoning:\ntemplate for rule-based logical reasoning:\n### <p>Greetings! <br>I am a powerful and intelligent machine learning-based AI assistant that specializes in logical reasoning.

Modus Ponens:\n(a) Definition:Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows you to infer the truth of a conditional statement's consequent when you know the truth of its antecedent.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the premise (antecedent).\n- `Q` represents the conclusion (consequent).\n- `->` denotes \"implies\" or \"if...then\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `A`, you may infer `B`.\n\n2. Modus Tollens:\n(a) Definition:Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows you to infer the negation of the premise (antecedent) of a conditional statement when you know the negation of its conclusion (consequent).\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the premise (antecedent).\n- `¬Q` represents the negation of the conclusion (consequent).\n- `->` denotes \"implies\" or \"if...then\".\n- `¬` denotes \"not\" or \"negates\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `¬B`, you may infer `¬A`.\n\n3. Hypothetical Syllogism:\n(a) Definition:Hypothetical syllogism is a logical rule that allows you to infer a new conditional statement from two given conditional statements.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P -> Q` represents the first conditional statement.\n- `Q -> R` represents the second conditional statement.\n- `P -> R` represents the new conditionally concluded statement.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `A -> B` and `B -> C`, you may infer `A -> C`.\n\n4. Disjunctive Syllogism:\n(a) Definition:Disjunctive syllogism is a logical rule that allows you to infer one of the disjuncts (alternatives) of a disjunction (\"or\" statement) if you know that the other disjunct is false.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the first disjunct.\n- `Q` represents the second disjunct.\n- `V` denotes \"or\".\n- `~` represents \"not\" or \"negates\".\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P V Q` and `~Q`, you may infer `P`.\n\n5. Addition:\n(a) Definition:Addition is a logical rule that allows you to infer a disjunction (\"or\" statement) from a given sentence.\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P` represents the given sentence.\n- `P V Q` represents the inferred disjunction.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P`, you may infer `P V Q`.\n\n6. Simplification:\n(a) Definition:Simplification is a logical rule that allows you to infer a sentence from a given disjunction (\"or\" statement).\n(b) Symbolic Representation:\n- `P V Q` represents the given disjunction.\n- `Q` represents the inferred sentence.\n(c) Rules:\n- Given `P V Q`, you may infer `Q`.\n\n### Key Differences:\n\n1. Modus Ponens vs. Modus Tollens:\n   - Modus Ponens:\n     - Reasoning from antecedent to consequent.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, A |- B`\n   - Modus Tollens:\n     - Reasoning from negated consequent to negated antecedent.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, |- -B |- -A`\n\n2. Hypothetical Syllogism:\n   - Represents a chain of conditional implications.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B, B -> C |- A -> C`\n\n3. Disjunctive Syllogism:\n   - Uses disjuncts and their negations to infer one disjunct.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P V Q, -Q |- P`\n\n4. Addition:\n   - Infer a disjunction based on a given sentence.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P |- P V Q`\n\n5. Simplification:\n   - Infer a sentence from a given disjunction.\n   - Symbolic Representation: `P V Q |- Q`\n\n6. Biconditional vs. Conditional - Unidirectional:\n   - Biconditional:\n     - Represents \"if and only if\" or \"just in case.\"\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A <-> B` implies `(A -> B) /\\ (B -> A)`\n   - Conditional - Unidirectional:\n     - Represents \"if...then\" or \"implies.\"\n     - Symbolic Representation: `A -> B`\n\n7. Bidirectional Vs. Unidirectional - Deductive Inferences:\n   - Bidirectional:\n     - Involves connecting multiple premises bidirectionally to form complex deductions, allowing for building a logical argument from various assumptions or observations.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `P <-> Q`\n   - Unidirectional:\n     - Primarily focuses on inferences from single premises.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `P -> Q` for modus ponens example\n\n8. Example:\n   - Bidirectional: `I am not hungry` and `I won't cook tonight`.\n     - Antecedent: `~Hungry`\n     - Conclusion: `~Cook`\n     - Hypothetical: `~Cook <-> ~Hungry`\n   - Unidirectional:\n     - Reasoning or implication from `not hungry` to `not cooking`.\n     - Symbolic Representation: `~Hungry -> ~Cook`\n\n### Question:\nThe statement \"It is raining or the sun is shining\" is an example of which logical rule?\nA.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n### General Requirements:\n1. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n2. Make reasonable default decision even when insufficient evidence is provided.\n3. If the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you cannot say the two events have a causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first.This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n\n### Elementary Operations:\n1. if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n2. if P which is a variation of the phenomenon occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, you can infer that S and P may have causal relationship.\n3. To conclude there is a causal relationship,〔a〕 must be used, and to conclude there is no causal relationship,〔a〕.\n4. To decide one point, refer to the data set for comparison extension\n5. When the first point introduces an example, the explanation established by the third point in the example shall be used as〔substitution〕 and added to the condition examples.\n6. To analyse the causal chain sequence, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n7. Disqualifications, refer to Science, Reason and Truth\n\n### Scientific Literacy:\n1. The division of historical changes is an evolutionary factor, either commercialised or planned or free, composed of a series of changes, often second or more changes of the same factors.\n2. The occurrence is not a causal factor, and if the cause and the occurrence of the phenomenon are the same, and they are a singular evolutionary factor, e.g. both first and only, you can say that they have no causal relationship. However, if they are two successive evolutionary factors, the second factor can be caused by the first. This exact reasoning only applies to economic and social phenomenon under a singular root cause, such as planning, commercialised, monopolistic, etc. It does not apply to a phenomenon under multiple root causes.\n3. All matters (blocks) can be replaced topologically, e.g. clitical event, place, phenomenon, cause factor, valuation.\n4. The choices of time and space for contrast extensions are not rigid, for example, in any POI chosen.\n5. When analysing the process, 〔...〕　must be used, otherwise the conclusion will not be stable.\n6. Two successive evolutionary factors can affect the change or stability of other evolutionary factors, but factors of the same stage can also affect each other.\n7. The exclusive in 8 could evolve into other evolutionary factors if replaced_other and the story is convoluted.\n8. The validity of the extension of contrast requires considering Н to separate from C (C isnt effected by S, e.g. if C larger than L) and И for нелишь по времени, five points yun. \n9. The originalче and trial decisions should be determined after the letter decisions.\n10. Separating out Sq which has no causal relationship with P is the fundamental principle of scientific researches ability for windows.\n11. A modification of the first condition or object is a new behaviour or happenings.\n12. macro-economic phenomena usually occur simultaneously with other events, so it is necessary to decide which factor will cause or affect the phenomena, e.g, which factor will get disappeared.\n13. If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\n14. These ten items above can originate from one factor. For other factors, see the table above.\n\n\n### Question:\n  People rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm; \n  people strike cold stones, and the stones can spark\n  people continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot. \n  From this, it can be inferred that 尽管物体运动常常与发热同时出现，但两者之间并没有因果关系.\n\n  The causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 第一案例　B) Method of 对比扩展　C) Method of 两因比较　D) Method of 前设斷帰　E) Method of 不可邀汝判断　F) Method of 三角结构　G) Method of 操作行为　H) Method of 行为大纲　I) Method of 行为意思　J) Method of 循环否定　K) Method of 同步推理　L) Method of 程式演绎　M) Method of 第五案例　N) Method of 制度-事件　O) Method of 操作-事件　P) Method of 行为命名　Q) Method of 操作-经济　R) Method of 正形状　S) Method of 完全递进　T) Method of 后设断帰　U) Method of 两层递进　V) Method of 检验之三连　W) Method of 极致案例　X) Method of 消融替代　Y) Method of 临界区分　Z) Method of 规律相同　AA) Method of obby\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/AA  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[M]]\n\n### Question:\nHengzhi invariance of those who took socialist vs keynesian classes and the economics classes that werent  taken is emergent and not emergence.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-原善　B) Method of 经济-制度　C) Method of 经济-规律　D) Method of 经济-替代　E) Method of 经济-临界　F) Method of 经济-不变　G) Method of 微观不变　H) Method of 微观演绎　I) Method of 微观提炼　J) Method of 宏观提炼　K) Method of 经济-模块　L) Method of 经济-extract　M) Method of 微观-总结　N) Method of 宏观-相同　O) Method of 自变量-扩充　P) Method of 自变量-传递　Q) Method of 回溯推理　R) Method of 事件-回溯　S) Method of 经济-工具　T) Method of 社会主义-经济　U) Method of 经济-生产　V) Method of 经济-解释　W) Method of 经济-结论　X) Method of 贡献-价值　Y) Method of 价值-解释　Z) Method of 经济-改善　aA) Method of 社会主义-分析　bB) Method of 宏观-改善　cC) Method of 经济-考试\n\n  A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z/aA/bB/cC  \n\n### Answer:\n  [[S]]\n \n### Question:\nLong and short term, the best to explain a particular cause in context contains of point 12, and we find non one hows:　　If phenomenon P and its condition X are both regulars, when each point is a necessary condition for each other respectively, if they are again necessary conditions for each other, and there are no additive factors, although they are co-occurring for a long time, they cannot be regarded as having a partial or a full causal relationship between them.\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\n  A) Method of 经济-事件　B) Method of 规范性-结论　C) Method of 经济-规范　D) Method of 经济-工具　E) Method of 经济-解释　F)",

Identify the objects and properties being discussed.\n2. Follow the logic steps in the reasoning rule when analyzing each step in the prompt.\n3. Ensure proper application of logic rules provided.\n\nRule:\n- The rule is denoted by the `[[]]` section. The rule assumes `some[other]information` is incorporated into summary response.

The rule mentions \"postractive\" and \"prepositive\" actions that give context to indicate how the word is used.

The two hypotheses are contradictory, which aligns with the GB Paradox's rule that contradictory hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nThe scenario where the researcher confirms the hypothesis based on observations and later encounters contradictory observations matches the BC Paradox, where a universal hypothesis is confirmed but contradicted by another reasonable condition. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nIn the third scenario, the logical consequences of the observations contradict the hypothesis, which is in line with the LS Paradox. Reassessing the reasonableness of the hypothesis is necessary. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nIn the fourth scenario, a holomorphic hypothesis is presented, and the positive confirmation of observations in one case corresponds to the hypothesis while invalidating the hypothesis in another case. This matches the BC Paradox, where equivalent conditions and confirmation standards lead to a contradiction. Option B is the correct answer.\n\nFor the ZL Paradox, it is related to the principle of consilience, indicating that if a hypothesis can be corroborated by multiple lines of evidence, it is more likely to be true. However, the given explanation does not provide enough information to determine which paradox applies.",

Below is a step-by-step analysis and response to this paradox:\n\n1. **Question and Answer Analysis**:\n\n   In the given question-and-answer pair, contradictory inductive reasoning and multiple hypotheses are presented. The analysis questions ask about the circumstances under which an observed phenomenon might lead to a logical paradox.\n\n2. **Identifying the Logic Rule**:\n\n   The GB Paradox is defined by the following rules:\n   - An observed phenomenon 'p' is noted.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_1' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Hypothesis 'q_2' is assumed, leading to the conclusion that 'p'.\n   - Since 'q_1' and 'q_2' are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n   - Thus, it's not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and additional reasoning is required.\n\n3. **Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox Example**:\n\n   - A scientist observed that plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\n   - Hypotheses: The plant grows faster in sunlight or with more water.\n   - Comparison: This is an example of logically contradictory conclusions drawn from the same observation, which aligns with the GB Paradox.\n\n4. **Your Role in this Scenario**:\n\n   - As an intelligent assistant, you recognize the GB Paradox and answer questions related to the observation and hypotheses.\n   - You analyze the rules and provide insights into the paradox and its implications for logical reasoning.\n\n5. **About Your Function**:\n\n   - Your purpose is to assist with logical reasoning, identifying relevant properties and applying the GB Paradox's logical rules to the problem at hand.\n   - You ensure your output adheres to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n6. **An Example Way to Work**:\n\n   - Prepare a monolingual Python code that finds all the answers and all the feedback.\n   - Define a function that can analyze the Gardner-Bowyer-Lewis Paradox and provide feedback.\n   - Describe the rules and logic for your analysis.\n   - You use the function to analyze the GB Paradox and return appropriate answers.\n   - Since the BP Paradox is less significant, no specific example is provided.\n\n**Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2):\n    # Your code can include logic to check if the hypotheses lead to contradictory conclusions\n    if (hypothesis1 != hypothesis2):\n        return \"Reasonable, but contradicting hypotheses. More information needed for a conclusion.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Hypotheses align. Additional analysis may be required.\"\n\n# Example usage\nobservation = \"Plants grow faster with either sunlight or more water.\"\nhypothesis1 = \"Plants grow faster in sunlight.\"\nhypothesis2 = \"Plants grow faster with more water.\"\nresult = analyze_GB_Paradox(observation, hypothesis1, hypothesis2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code demonstrates a basic implementation of analyzing the GB Paradox in Python. Note that more advanced logic can be implemented to handle more complex scenarios.",

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### 🔧 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### ⚙️ Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"🎯 {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"🧩 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet’s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### 🤸 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### 🌐 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical",

The question should be relevant to the topic of anti-superstitious logical analysis, and the answer should involve the application of logical reasoning to analyze an example related to irrational beliefs and promote the adoption of scientific rationality. The answer should follow the rule accordingly\n\n### Answer:\n1. Is there any logical reasoning approach that can be applied to debunk the belief in ghosts and promote the acceptance of scientific explanations?\n1. Yes, logical reasoning can be used to analyze the existence of ghosts in a scientific manner. One way to do this might be to apply the principle of Occam's Razor, which states that one should choose the simplest explanation that fits the available evidence. In the case of ghosts, this would mean rejecting the existence of ghosts as the simplest explanation for unexplained phenomena, and instead using a scientific explanation such as natural phenomena or human delusion.\n2. In the process of promoting scientific rationality, is there any logical reasoning process that can be applied to correct people's superstitious ideas? If so, what are they and how can they be applied?\n1. Reasoning process #1: Scientists use the scientific method in their research, which involves making observations, formulating hypotheses, designing experiments to test those hypotheses, and drawing conclusions from their results. By using the scientific method, people can learn to think critically and logically, and become more skeptical of superstitious beliefs that lack empirical evidence.\nReasoning process #2: Skeptics use logical fallacies to expose the flaws in superstitious beliefs. For example, the argument from design is a logical fallacy that claims that because something looks designed, it must have been designed. By recognizing and understanding these logical fallacies, people can become more critical of superstitious beliefs and more willing to accept scientific explanations. In practice, these reasoning processes can be applied by promoting the use of the scientific method in education and using skepticism to challenge superstitious beliefs.\n3. There are many misguided beliefs about ghosts that have been circulating in our history. Some people believe that ghosts are real or may make contact with someone to share the way of the netherworld. Others believe that if ghosts are caught on camera or video, the living can communicate with them. Still others believe that ghosts may appear at specific times or in specific locations, such as on Halloween or in places where high numbers of deaths have occurred. Do you believe that these statements are scientific or logical? Why?\n4. Most of these statements are not supported by scientific evidence and logical reasoning. For example, there is no empirical evidence that ghosts exist or that they can communicate with humans. While some people may have had supernatural experiences, these experiences are often difficult to reproduce or verify and can often be explained by other factors, such as psychological or physiological factors, rather than the presence of ghosts. In general, superstitious beliefs like these should be challenged by using logical reasoning and the scientific method, and it's important for people to approach these beliefs with a critical and skeptical mindset, rather than accepting them without question.\n5. Although there is no scientific explanation for ghosts, many people in human history still believe in ghosts and pass on many ghost stories to future generations. What could be the reason for the superstitious belief that ghosts exist?\n6. Since the 5th century AD, people from all walks of life have been interested in discussing ghosts, developing a discourse on ghosts, and people discuss many issues related to ghosts, including: Do we fear the fear of ghosts more or we self-promotion more Do you believe in the power of fear because it enhances your passions and elevates your imagination? Do you prefer to learn the necessary skills to identify ghost signs? If so, why do you still believe in ghosts? Psychologists have tried to understand why people have such strong beliefs in ghosts, a mystical entity believed to be a disembodied soul. There are several different psychological factors that may be at play: fear of the unknown, anthropocentrism, importance of exploration, and stories about ghost experiences that cannot be directed scientifically. These factors explain why people are more likely to believe in ghosts, even if the evidence is lacking.\n7. You plan to start a business too. After receiving the option to start a ghost-themed business, you start from a ghost to imagine the key details of the entire business, rather than assuming that there must be ghosts. As a result of this divergent thinking, your business has begun to take shape and is now ready for development, imagination, and creativity. It also shows that sometimes creative ideas can make a business stand out and have unique charm, and inspired thinking can lead to good results.\n####\n'''",

In this case, we need to offer more guidance. We can view the completion of these actions as questions where the answers are modal actions.\nFirst, let's define a bunch of functions that provide the names of modal actions. :\n\nconst MEMORIZE = {\n  icon: \"💫\",\n  name: \"Memorize\",\n\n  // Represents the table of modal actions, which initially contains only\n  // [\"Pasting content from Clipboard\"]. Users are able to add more entries to\n  // this table through the memorizeModal function.\n  actions: [`“Pasting content from Clipboard”`],\n};\nconst actionConfigsByIcon = {\n  MEMORIZE: MEMORIZE,\n};\nconst getActionConfigByIcon = (name: string) => actionConfigsByIcon[name];\n\n// Prints an error message if the action cannot be found by icon.\nconst actionNameByIcon = (icon: string) => {\n  const actionConfig = getActionConfigByIcon(icon);\n  if (actionConfig) {\n    return actionConfig.name;\n  }\n  throw Error(\n    `Cannot find config of modal action with icon ${icon}.Please check your pronounction.`\n  );\n};\nNow, to memorize these actions, we can add additional focus in Our AutoGPT action-based approach, and paste the modal actions table into the initialization text. To make memorizing actions easier when testing, we can also utilize a function that prints the steps for memorizing:\n\n12events\nHere is the configuration file for memorizing modal actions. It is a dictionary that creates a new AI with the name and agent2 token, uses the AUTO-GPT agent2 cart, and adds the memory stream to it as an input stream. Additionally, it adds the role mix stream to the role mix contexts. The field advisor_results_string allows the AI's role to be emphasized in other streams.\n\n```python\n\"\"\" # remember modal actions ask each ask learning2 items questions attributes memory\n\n\"\"\" # ask a2ki questions attributes memory\n\nHere is a part of any basic Python settings for Auto-GPT.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom auto_gpt.config.settings import AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nSettings = AutoGPTSettingsBase\n\nclass AG2a2kiSettings(Settings):\n\n__file__ = __file__\n__file_path__ = \"/home/zhenyu/Hermes_jupter_notebook/RTG_shared_clone_0618-manifolds.git/local/src/auto_gpt/config/settings.py\"\n\n# Profile\n# settings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple_ninja.cfg\"\nsettings_file = \"auto_gpt_ai_2_keep_it_simple.cfg\"\n\n# model id\nai2_api_token = \"AI2_TOKEN\"\nprint(f\"{__file_path__}: {settings_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n  # if process is None:\n  #   import mypc\n  #   procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  #   Process(['nvidia-smi', f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sleep(5)\n  #   q = libtc.tenant_list_gpus(int(procid))\n  #   gpu_info = \",\".join([*it.pairwise(q[10:11])][0])\n  #   print(gpu_info)\n  #\n  #   Process([\"nvidia-smi\", f\"--query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used,memory.free --format=csv,nounits,noheader --id={procid}\"])\n  #   sys.stdin.flush()\n  #   print(g, h, k)\n\n  import mypc\n  procid = mypc.get_proc_id(\"a2ki.ai2_settings.py\")\n  print(gpu_info)\n\n  import time\n  print(time.time())\n  ther = time.time()%1024\n  print(ther)\n\n  all_gpus = len(g) + len(h) + len(k)\n  n = int(all_gpus*.83)\n\n  a1 = []\n  if n >= 1:\n    g1 = np.array(g[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 10:\n    g1 = np.array(h[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n  if n >= 20:\n    g1 = np.array(k[:n])\n    a1.append(g1)\n\n  b1 = True\n  ids = []\n  print(a1[0])\n  print(a1[1])\n  for i2 in range(0, n):\n    for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n      if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n        aid =  a1[z1][i2]\n        p = np.where(a2ki[:,2] == aid)\n        id = a1[z1][i2]\n        ids.append(id)\n\n  #for i2 in range(0, n):\n  #  for z1 in range(0, len(a1)):\n  #    if a1[z1][i2] >= 5:\n  #      id = a1[z1][i2]\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(f'{id}:{q}')\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}', f'{id}']})\n  #        tt = np.array(v)\n  #        tem = tt.shape[0]\n  #        print(f'{id}:{tt}')\n  #        if tem >= 1:\n  #          q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        else:\n  #          libtc.tenant_revoc_gpu(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'], force=True)\n\n  #      if tem >= 1:\n  #        q = temp_pool.QueryInterface(device_id=[f'{id}', f'{id}'])\n  #        print(q)\n  #      else:\n  #        v = libtc.tenant_query_gpu({'device_id': [f'{id}',",

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

This is much better than before. Remember, this is just a one-shot, there’s no iteration involved. And the output is quite testable, it’s not opaque.\n\nThis template can be used in a lot of cases when trying to apply common reasoning forms such as syllogisms, logical arguments, etc.\n\nThis incredible result was achieved with chatGPT. This could easily be used in any programming or analytical flow.\n\n## Understanding the Limitation\n\nThe understanding we need to build is around the limitations of the LLMs. LLMs are engines of statistical correlations and synthesizing it into a new output. The models have poor inductive biases, poor in-context generalization and often fail to pass the simplest of tests, including pattern recognition. Check the roulette paper here. There are worrying limits here, the best of the LLMs still fail to pass basic reasoning capacities. But they seem to excel in understanding text.\n\nConsider this situation, I wanted to compare the salary/jobs offering in X against Y. Plotting out a few stats seemed like a good thing to do. So, I wrote X Salary Vs Y Salary. And wanted to get comparisons, so I wrote:\n\n(number of job offers(X)/(number of marks in decile)) - (number of job offers(Y)/(number of marks in decile))\n\nHowever, plots didn’t give me the results I wanted. Then I thought of writing a prompt to compare:\n\nTo identify the higher offering career option, what should we compare? Answer: salary\n\nWhich is simpler? Maybe the comparison function, I could test the Cross Validation score and if it was good, it could easily be implemented.\n\nThe following result was amazing. Although any reading would elucidate the simple concept.\n\nYou can imagine language models are “trained” on all this data. Even if GPT-3 is trained on a large chunk of Wikipedia, it can still replace the concept of mathematical functions. With the context of Einstiens Theory of Relativity, I would still be able to replace Time Dilation with Distance Dilemma. The AI system just doesn’t have the concept around these. Adding training data would just reinforce the previously ingrained ideas.\n\nFor anything that is new to GPT-3, it resorts to explanatory analysis or a breaking down with logic chains. It might be wrong at times but majority of the answers should be correct at LogICAL level.\n\n#### Not knowing a language\n\nWhat happens if the AI doesn’t know a language? Well said and well done! How can I analyze this statement with GPT-3?\n\nNow compare to this:\n\nHere, we gave certain context to GPT-3 so it could understand the content better, expand it and analyze it at a more nuanced level. This is the first barrier we face when we’re trying to analyze things, we must understand it. With a bit of input, we can get the reasoning done.\n\n#### Red Herring can be deceptive.\n\nGPT-3 thinks that I wanted to learn about Data Management. But it might have thrown it in there purposefully (gentle sarcasm).\n\nTo get the arguments down I gave the structure\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nAs a language model, I cannot make a subjective recommendation as to which one is better in a general sense. Both options have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and it's impossible to determine that without knowing the specific requirements and use case for which they are being considered.\n\nAn experienced and qualified technical analyst familiar with both of the software options would be better equipped to evaluate the two options and make an objective recommendation based on the use case's exact needs and requirements. They would be able to assess the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, it's difficult to definitively predict which one would be better overall, as it largely depends on the project's specific needs and requirements. I suggest consulting an experienced and qualified professional to make a more informed recommendation.\n\nAnything you input into the prompt, the AI can spit it back if you ask it in a different way. Let’s do that.\n\nArguments on X vs Y:\n\n1. The X has well-defined arguments and suitability criteria, allowing it to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements.\n2. X's scalability, flexibility, and customizability make it more valuable as a project or product grows or becomes more complex.\n3. X's rate of adoption and popularity in the market demonstrate its increasing demand and the trend towards its wider usage. X has successfully proven its value, hence its acceptance as a standard in industry and academia.\n\nWhen we begin to compare between these two argument banks, we can easily see which ones carry more validity and the contention level.\n\nArguments on Y vs X:\n\n1. Y is more scalable and reliable on various platforms, providing a consistent and predictable experience across different operating systems, environments, and hardware configurations.\n2. Y allows for unlimited extensions, modification, and rework, enabling developers to create customized solutions that exactly meet their specific requirements. This higher level of control and flexibility makes X more suitable for complex or highly specialized projects.\n3. Y is widely used as a standard, interfacing a variety of systems, devices, and applications, making it an essential platform for interoperability and integration.\n\nGiven the above analysis, which one of the two is better overall; X or Y?\n\nBased on the analysis, X seems to have a few additional advantages over Y. For example, the added flexibility of X in being able to tailor itself to a wide range of applications and requirements and its scalability in complex projects are noteworthy. However, it's important to note that one software option is not necessarily better than the other since X and Y are intended to address different needs and goals and are used for different purposes.\n\nUltimately, it depends on the specific circumstances, requirements, and goals of the project. Your industry expert may need to dig deeper into the specific capabilities, advantages, and limitations of each of the options, and compare them to determine which one would be the best fit. They may also consider factors such as the project's proper fit, the available budget and resources of the startup, the potential benefits and impacts of utilizing one over the other, and the expected outcomes.\n\nAgain, it's my recommendation that consulting a qualified and experienced professional is the best course of action, as they are in a better position to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case.\n\nDo you think the person you asked it to contact was correct?\n\nYes, as it stated earlier, it's recommended to consult a qualified and experienced professional to make an informed and helpful recommendation in this case. An experienced professional would have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate the different features and capabilities of X and Y and determine which one would be the best fit for the project based on various factors, including their unique strengths, limitations, and the specific goals and objectives of the project.\n\nThey would also be able to assess the long-term implications and potential impact of utilizing one option over the other and advise on the most optimal solution for the project, considering all the",

In each case, the benefits of technology are clearly demonstrated, and the overall argument is supported.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nI apologize for the previous response. As an AI assistant, I am unable to ask for clarification. But I will provide some assistance.\n\nWhen you provide more examples or questions, please also inform me of the reasoning behind the correct answer and the incorrect reasoning of the incorrect answers in a step-by-step style. This will allow me to understand the rules better. I will then be able to provide better responses to future questions.\n\nHere is an example of how to explain the reasoning behind the correct answer and incorrect reasoning of the incorrect answers:\n\n### Response:\n\nYes, please continue to provide example questions. Below are 10 examples with reasoning.\n\n### Question:\n\"Firstly, a study conducted by Harvard University found that participants who engaged in regular aerobic exercise experienced significant relief from depression symptoms over a 12-week period. Secondly, a survey conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, revealed that adults who performed 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week had significantly reduced anxiety symptoms. Finally, a long-term study by the British Psychological Society found that individuals with an active lifestyle had noticeably better mental health compared to those who led a sedentary lifestyle. These specific research findings support the general notion that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use specific instances to argue for the truth of the proposition.\nB.Syl+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use universal propositions as premises and supporting conclusions through syllogistic reasoning.\nC.Metaph+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not use metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic.\nD.Case+ Method: Incorrect. The method does not prove the truthfulness of the original proposition by discussing each case separately.\nE.Contra- Method: Incorrect. The method does not refute the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one.\nF.Elim- Method: Incorrect. The method does not eliminate other possibilities related to the original proposition as false.\n\nA.E+ Method: Correct. The method uses specific research findings to argue for the truth of the proposition that exercise has a positive impact on mental health.\n\n### Goodbye!\n\n\"\"\"\n\ndefault_nlu = {\"nlu_datas\": {}, \"procedure_examples\": {\"nlu\": []}}\nnlu_records = None\ntry:\nwith open(configs.get(\"BASE_PATH\", \"#\") + f\"/nlu_table.jsonl\") as f:\nfor line in data_gen:\nnlus = json.loads(line.strip())\nif nlus[\"nlu_datas\"] != default_nlu:\nnlu_records = nlus\nreturn\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\nreturn\n\ndef empty_prompt():\nreturn f\"\"\"\nYour task to provide me with contextual knowledge.\nThe response format is as follows:\nif it's for meta level, the context should end with T, then the response should only contain its conclusion.\nif it's for input level, the context should end with M, then the response should only contains its conclusion for mulitple metalevel.\nIf there is no conlusion, the output should be repeat context followed by N, the inference should repeat pre sequeces\ninchronization with metadata response.\nIf the conclusion does not support input sequence, the response should be N.\n\n------------------------------\n### Context:\nLong high level context can be represented here.\n\n------------------------------\nExample:\n### Context:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Input:\n{instructions_prompt(task_descriptions)}\n### Metadata:\n{summary}\n### Answer:\nT\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nPlease give the location the dog right before it was jumped.\nN\n\n### Input:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.\nMath Problem:Add 3 and 5, output the result in decimal number after rounding.\n### Metadata:\n{math_problem_instruction_body}\nOutput:\nThe fox jumps over the dog.
