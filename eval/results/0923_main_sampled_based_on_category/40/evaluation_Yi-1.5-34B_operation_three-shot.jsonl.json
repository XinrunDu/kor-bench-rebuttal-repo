Your task is to generate a question in a mathematical format that can be answered under the custom rule defined below. Please use the following pattern to format the questions: Compute <math_expression>.\n\nWhen providing a math expression:\n\n• Use mathematical symbols, if possible\n• Only use 4 variables (a,b,c,d) found in the operation rule\n\nThe rule:\nA new operation is defined as follows:\n```\n<a,b,c,d>=P(N)\n```\nwhere P(x) represents a polynomial and P(N) is the evaluation of\nthe polynomial P at the number N.\n\n<a,b,c,d> can be a single variable such as a,b,c,d, or an operation with these variables such as a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c*d.\n\nIf <a,b,c,d> cannot be accurately represented mathematically, then skip the question.\n\nThe term N can be any number or a group of numbers.\nExample: ⟨3,2,4,-1⟩ can be N = 3a + 2b + 4c - d\n\nWhen N is an operation with variables:\nIf N represent an operation, the it should correctly represent <a,b,c,d>\nExample: ⟨1,2,-3,1⟩ -> N = 1a + 2b - 3c + d not N = 1a + c\n\nTo best answer the generated question, the question should follow these rules:\n- Use mathematical symbols\n- Should not feel too complex to the human that needs to solve it\n- Should not feel too easy to the human that needs to solve it\n- Use operations that involve a,b,c,d\n- Number should be used to define the properties of a,b,c,d\n- Use a,b,c,d as the main part of the question\n- Use numbers only for thing around a,b,c,d\n\nExample questions that should be avoided:\n- A general question that sounds like:\n\"Explain the relationship between P(N) and <a,b,c,d>.\"\n- A simple question that doesn't require invoking the custom operation:\n\"Compute the value of N.\"\nN should be unique relative to the custom operation.\n\nExample questions that are good:\n- A question that requires invoking the custom operation to compute the value of\n<a,b,c,d>:\n\"Compute ⟨6, 3, 1, 2⟩ when P(x) = 2x^2 + 1x + 2 and N = 3a^2 + b + 2c - d.\"\nRules:\n- N needs to only use 1 operation between a,b,c,d\n- a,b,c,d can only be raised to a maximum degree of 2\n- a,b,c,d can only be multiplied with a maximum of 1 other variable (also a,b,c,d)\n- a,b,c,d can only involve addition and subtraction if part of N\n\nTo maximize the randomness in the generation of questions, you are not allowed to generate multiple questions that follows the same pattern.\n\nDon't talk about anything other than the task context.\n\nThe general task is to generate a math expression (a,b,c,d) when a certain logical or mathematical condition is given.\n\nExample:\nQuestion: Generate a question given logical condition.\n```\nLogical Conidtion: a+b+c >= d\nMath expression: [[1,2,3,-1\n```\n\nPlease generate a question and a math expression corresponding to the logical condition below.\nExample: Generate a question that requires advance logical thinking -> Question: Generate a question that requires forward thinking.\n\nWhen providing the math expression:\n\n• Question should be able to be answered using by applying the rules.\n• Use as many intermediate transformations as possible.\n• Include a variable to check.\n\nReplace \"|\" with \",\" if needed.\nIncrease question complexity from 1 to 5 if needed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExample:\nQuestion: Generate a question that requires advanced logical thinking.\n\nNew operation is defined as follows:\n<a,b,c,d> = 2ab + c -

Since X=4, the first equation simplifies to ⟨ 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 ⟩ + ⟨ 4 , 10 , 8 , 4 ⟩ # Suppose ^(−1)[i][[−1  [i][[x[i]]  = 0, where x >>> are all positive integers greater than 0. This equation forms a constraint which requires that all 4 values of the triple product for the vector given by p &in; [X,10,8,4]^(-1) are all positive integers that satisfy the constraint. Moreover, the symbol \"~-1\" indicates the hyperoperation TeX Source $$x \\leftarrow {\\bf{ \\oplus }}_p^n(i,j,k,l){\\rm{ where }}p = \\left\\{ {{\\rm{integers }} > 0 } \\right\\},$$ around which is another operator — the hyperoperation — TeX Source $$x \\leftarrow {\\bf{ \\otimes }}_p^n(i,j,k,l){\\rm{ where }}p = \\left\\{ {{\\rm{integers }} > 0 } \\right\\}.$$ The dual-operator within the square braces-distribution is with respect to “p” which satisfies: ⟨−1(&sdot;p)] = (n/(p) &sdot; pn+1 + p) + (−1)&sdotn); The less than operator &lt; indicates a linear hyperoperation between each of the nth participant &sdot;&sdot;&sdot; × k02 &s",

How many children does Mr. Gopal have?\nPlease provide the answer in the format of a single number, and enclose it in double square brackets. For example: [[5]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n### Question:\nToday, given the symbols =, +, -, and ÷, if we have two numbers 9 and 7 and connect them using one of those symbols and make the expression 9 ?7 an answer of 0. What we can get is these four equations:\n9 - 7 = 2\n9 ÷ 7 = 1 R2\n9 = 7 + 2\n9 = 7 × 1 + 2\n\nNow we're given four numbers, which are 8, 5, 7, and 5, and using only these four numbers (while using each only no more than one time) and the four symbols that =, +, -, and ÷, to connect these four numbers into an expression and make the expression gets the result of 24. There're three answers:\n\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 - 3\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 ÷ 4\n8 = 7 + 5 × 3 ÷ 2\n\nIn conclusion, when we have other numbers or cases, we can connect these numbers into an expression to get the target by shifting the tower (verb meaning: changing the order of the numbers) and the operator and making some calculations to find out the vague but accurate answer. Keep in mind two rules while doing these:\n\n1. Each number should not be used more than one time.\n2. Do the calculations in the fraction form such as using the true division(true divide) instead of the integer division(integer divide).\n\nNow given the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5, what expression(s) can we write down to get the result of 1?\nAs previously instructed, we need to structure the answer(s) by enclosing them in double square brackets, notation [[x+y]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt is possible to get the result of 1 from the given numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5. Here's how:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite 7 as a fraction, specifically 7/1.\n\nNext, let's consider the fractions 3/1 and 9/1. We can rewrite these fractions as 3/5 and 9/5, since we can multiply 3 and 9 by 5 in order to get a non-fraction value. Don't forget, we must use the appropriate fraction form when performing calculations.\n\nNow, we can add 3/5, 7/5, and 5/5, which gives us 15/5. But, we want to reach the result of ",

It is a combination of a neural network and a convolutional neural network.\nA common problem with corta-networks is that the input to the network is not sufficiently varied. For example, if you were to feed a blank image into a convolutional neural network, the output would be a blank image. This is because the convolutional neural network only uses the information in the image to inform the network what to do, but does not actually use the image to learn.\nOne way to approach the problem is to add extra filters to the convolutional neural network. This is generally a good idea, because it will make the convolutional neural network more robust. Another approach is to use an adaptive filtering approach, where the convolutional neural network is made to adapt to the noisy input.\n\nIt doesn't look like a problem where a machine learning solution would work well.\nFor a comparison question, the machine learning approach here is different in that it first \"tries to predict the answer to a question\" in part 1 and then just \"copies the same language model as the one used by the neural network\".\nThe reason it doesn't work I think is that the way the ML approach is doing this is by trying to predict the answer to a question (where a human/pair would do it by looking at the comments and then giving the answer to the nearest other comment), this doesn't give a lot of signal for the machine learning solution.\n\n### 在 CHATGPT 情况下的调试结果（设置20个 max_tokens）\n\nCAI: (3 branches with 2 splits and then the rest)\n\nroot\n|   l\n|   \n\nCAI2: (3 branches with 2 splits and then the rest)\n\nroot\n|   l\n|   \n\nCAI3: No more splits - No more splits\n\nThe program is learning to find a good harmonic mean. It is doing this by finding a new center of gravity for each new center of gravity, since the weights of the points in the mean new point are updated by them after each training iteration. This means the algorithm needs to find a new center of gravity for each center of gravity, and this is where the loss function comes in. Suppose there are two centers at the boundary of the circle, at distance a from the center and at distance b from the center.\n\nI wasn't able to replicate your results.

Finally, data streams give researchers excellent interpretability of when/where/how the information in the world has been acquired from.\n\nIt appears that your neural network is diverging, i.e. it is not finding a correct answer. This is usually the case when you are trying to classify too many variables with a simple network.\nI think that this is not too uncommon for a neural network. I can see how this might happen. You are training on two objective functions: one that is learning to classify the data and the other that is learning to extract meaningful information from the labelled data. The difference between the two objective functions is that a neural network is taking in a very different kind of data.\n\n#结语\n\nClosing Thoughts: This is not the first time I have been asked to write this post. The obvious conclusion is that intelligence is not the most important thing. But let's get to the point. To evaluate AI we would first need a reason to be comfortable about the fact that it's possible the AI is going to win (it's plausible). In this case I will assume that there is a way this happens. And then I will use the AI's winning probability to determine whether we should trust computers. The argument for trusting computer people here is that they can always do better than the AI. I have seen this happen in many different fields.\n\nIn summary, it seems clear from the data that for all of us, if an artificial intelligence system is going to perform anything in that way that we expect a human to it, then we should fear what they may do to their computers. I would suggest that this has much to do with how humans use their minds. What is more is that some of the aspects of artificial intelligence have a negative impact on intellect. So what does all of this mean?\n\nThis post is an informal attempt to index the recent and ongoing work on progress measures. Please feel free to reach out to me via email. I will also host relevant progress math formulas, such as TAI timelines, and past progress math formulas. The accompanying website contains further details and a demo. Several previous posts have been annotated as well; see timeline. Introduction People are uncertain about how to make progress Mathematician and blogger John Baez observes that, with a few exceptions, mathematical activities can be difficult to categorize. In addition to the fact that he's right, this can be very confusing for people trying to decide what to teach. If you're trying to teach maths from scratch, then you're looking at a much more challenging situation.\n\nWith those contexts in mind, I will provide 5 strategic measures, which I believe is the most fundamental step in promoting decision making and developing progress actions.\n\nBut there are many other types of progress measure. The best I've found is what you call intuitive metrics. These metrics are the most likely to be useful for building a decision model. As a result, if I'm right then I believe the next step will be a rigorous method of applying these metrics to provide a more comprehensive set of progress measures.\n\n## 🌟支持、新闻报道\n\n### 赞助\n\n• 健康汉堡（你的信息会被添加到E训练的 www.aevane.cmm）\n• Raising Funding 群（加公众号或直接加bot）\n• 开源企业群\n• 我的Linkedin主页及个人网站\n\nhttps://worldwide.i-pass.be/shop-e-style/e.html\n\n（2）观察，分析总结，输出；",

Return a whole number instead ofa fraction when possible, and represent fractions in integer division format (if it's 5/2, return 5#2).\n\nYou don't need to consider expressions including operators that were provided, just describe the mathematical equation as asked.\"\n\n### Example:\n\nIf the question is \"Compute (1♚3)\", the output should be \"1#3\".\n\n### Example:\n\nIf the question is \"Compute (5♚3)♚2\", the output should be \"7\".\n\n### Example:\n\nIf the question is \"Compute ((12♚10)#5)⊗8\", the output should be \"(12♚10)⊗85\" instead of\"(12♚10)⊗40\".\n\n### Example:\n\nIf the question is \"Compute (58♚27)#3\", the output should be _58_3#3.\n\n### Example:\n\na#b#c = (a + b) ⊗ c\n\n### Question:\n\n'Compute (107#3#3)^((54#2)-50)'.\n\nIt should be as 'expression'.\n\n### Answer:\n[[expression]]\n\n### Question:\n\n\"The ♄ and ⊕ operations are defined by the following rules:\nIf one operand is the maximum integer, the result is the maximum integer.\nIf one operand is the absolute value of the minimum integer, the result is the absolute value of the minimum integer.\nOtherwise, if either operand is zero, the result is zero.\nOtherwise, if either operand is one, the result is one.\nOtherwise, if both operands have the same sign (or are zero), the result is the smaller of the two operands.\nOtherwise, the result is the larger of the two operands.\n\nLet  ♉ be defined as x♉y=(x♄y)+1.\n\nThese operations require the ♚ operation.\nThe ♚ operation is defined in terms of standard operations (+, −, ×, /) by the following rules:\nThe ♚ operation takes two non-negative integers as operands.\nThe first operand denotes a number of cookies, and the second one is the number of people to whom the cookies shall be distributed.\nIf there are fewer cookies than people, the ♚ distribution shall result in no cookie for anybody.\nIf there are enough cookies, the ♚ operation is such that:\nIf there are enough cookies, then everyone receives some (they may all receive an equal number of cookies, but this is not required).\nIf there are more cookies than people, then some cookies remain after the distribution, but not more than how many people there are.\nThe number of cookies removed from the heap in a single step must always be a prime smaller than the number of people being served.\nNo cookie is to be divided into pieces unless there is no other option.\nAssume that there are infinite number of cookies.\n\nThe ⊕ operation is commutative and associative.\nThe ♄ operation is also associative.\nThe two operations distribute over each other, so b♄(a⊕c) = (b♄a)⊕(b♄c).\nThe ♉ operation is neither commutative nor associative.\nHowever, it is compatible with the two operations, so that if d⊕e is defined, then ♉(a, d⊕e) = (a♉d)⊕(a♉e).\nThe ♇ operation is defined as x♇y = b, such that x♄y=b♚1.\n\nThus, 3♚3 = 2♚3 = 2, and 4♚4 = 3♚4 = 3.$$\\begin{array}{rl} & 1♉4 &= 3♚3 &= 2\\\\ & 1♊4 &= 5≡2 \\\\ & 1♈4 &= 1♊4♇1 &= 1♊2 &= 4≡2. \\end{array}$$\n\nIf operands are not integers, the precedence of these rules is:\n\n1. non-serious ◯ operation\n2. gcd and lcm\n3. commuted If operands are not natural numbers, they are truncated toward 0 instead of being minimized to a natural number.\nIf an answer or an intermediate value is not natual and is not an integer or the result of taking the gcd or lcm of two integers,\ntruncate the fractional part of the number, so for instance 0.999 becomes 0.\n\nThere is an '{' and '}' operation.They do '+' and '-‘', in a non-standard way:\n\n1◦a=0◦a=|a−1|\na◦b=a⊕b if either a⊕b is an integer,or the result of a⊕b is a fraction.\na+b=a⊕b if either a⊕b is an integer,or the result of a⊕b is a fraction.\na−b=a◦b if either a◦b is an integer,or the result of a◦b is a fraction.\n\"\n\n### Question:\n\n\"Using the operator above, compute:\"\n{{{}◦{{}}−{{}}}+{{{{{}⊕{{}}}◦{{}}◦{{ {◦} } {◯} }}−{{}}×{{}}}◦{{}}}.\n\"Give the answer as expression given the above rules.Words can mean numbers.Symbols and words can be used as symbols.Decimal expansion is not allowed.\"",

Many things that are written in python could be resolved using natural language such as English. I will give you a module that bear syntax of English on specific questions, the responses/outputs you give should be the result of the python program if it were in python syntax, language, and accuracy\". Your responses should be a natural language (English) that reflects the operation of the python code. The variable and operators keywords may differ between English and Python syntax.\n\nExamples:\nPython: YearsAgo(2020)\nNatural Language: I want to determine the year based on the current year and a number of years in the past.\n\nYearsAgo is a function which takes one argument as integer value and returns the value as an integer.\nInput: YearsAgo(2020)\nPart Replacement Plan #01:\nYou need to determine the current year by executing a function.

This function takes two string inputs named \"left operand\" and \"right operand,\" with the default value '10', and returns a string result obtained by computationally solving instructions contained in the \"text\" parameter (see examples provided below for details). For example, if the \"text\" parameter contains the string \"2048+100,\" the function should return \"2148.\"\n\nHere is the code for this function:\n// Code block starts here\ndef main(left operand='10', right operand='10', word='', text=''):\n    result = ''\n    word1 = helpers.word.first3Letters(word)\n    num1 = helpers.make_num(left operand)\n    num2 = helpers.make_num(right operand)\n    result = text\n\n    if type(result) == str:\n        text = result.replace(\"word\", word1)\n        text = text.replace(\"left operand\", str(num1) )\n        text = text.replace(\"right operand\", str(num2) )\n        text = helpers._solve_math_equation(text)\n        return text\n    else:\n        return result\nreturn result\n// Code block ends here\nThe helper functions used within the main function are defined in the helpers module as follows:\n// Code block starts here\ndef first3Letters(word):\n    word = word[0:3].upper()\n    return word\ndef make_num(value):\n    num = float(value)\n    return num\ndef _solve_math_equation(ans):\n    if \"=\" in ans:\n        import re\n        nums = re.findall(\"-?\\d+\\.\\d+|-?\\d+\", ans)\n        ops = re.findall(\"\\W\", ans)\n        if ops[0].isalpha();\n            ans = str(nums[0]) + '+' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[1].isalpha();\n            ans = ans + '+' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[0] == '-';\n            ans = str(nums[0]) + '-' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[1] == '-';\n            ans = ans + '-' + str(nums[2])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[0] == '*';\n            ans = str(nums[0]) + '*' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[1] == '*';\n            ans = ans + '*' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[0] == '/';\n            ans = str(nums[0]) + '/' + str(nums[1])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n        if ops[1] == '/';\n            ans = ans + '/' + str(nums[2])\n            ans = eval(ans)\n    return ans\nreturn output single value\n// Code block ends here\n\nYour task is to respond to JSON input, correctly formatted in Python code, which will be used to create and/or manipulate numbers, strings, or other data types.

[[-2848156065]].\nWhat sets a \"good\" solution from a \"bad\" one in these examples, in view of the fact the second method seems to imply that any input string is meaningful to the task in question? Why is the first method \"better\"? Why cannot the bad solutions be corrected or edited? Surely if they were in fact identical to the good solutions they have been corrected to, they would be valid solutions too.\nIt seems to me the good solutions include questions lacking an answer in the schema (e.g., \"evaluate 3◇4\") while the bad solutions do not, but I'm not sure. Any other guesses? Can you please provide examples of good and bad solutions you witnessed? See the citation below for a heuristic approach to reproducing the prompt, and the examples I provide below to reproduce good and bad few-shot demonstrations of the task. Thanks!\nEDIT A noteworthy aspect of this approach may be that It is not necessarily that the GPTs (i.e., the large language models (LLMs) underlying GPTs) are not capable of or trained well to solve the task--rather that the fine-tuning/prompting approach needed to accomplish the task may seem to be too complex for people. That is, AI may be effective as a transformational tool for even inefficient skills and jobs such as prompt engineering for complex tasks, without the LLM itself needing to be \"smart,\" self-aware, etc.\nAntelman, K. (2023). Black in AI. Artificial Intelligence, 270. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2023.103686]\n\nA: As people who have developed complex AI correctly point out, GPT responses are still quite a long way from true artificial intelligence. Do they try to understand the context of the question? Either \"no\", or at the best \"just enough\" to try to guess what you are probably looking for. They have yet to develop true understanding and human-level creativity, so far as we know.\nAn amusing incident I once saw happened in an office, when GPT-3 (one of previous versions) was rolled out, after the various contracts and management preambles, it was immediately asked what the weather was like today in a particular location. After receiving the response, the caller asked \"but I need the weather a week from now\". GPT replied \"i think you have 6 questions left, maybe ask them now\". The questioner responded \"i know, but i want to know what the weather is in 6 days time\".\nThe caller sent this to me. He said it had everyone smiling.\nSo, GPT isn't very good at longer thinking problems yet, compared to what they think you might have asked. You have to almost teach them by examples what kind of answer you are looking for - and it seems to me, not in a sufficiently consistent way for the current state of development of the technology.\nAlso, I believe conversational AI programs are limited to a certain number of supported messaging functions or responses, depending on the package you have. Also, presumably, the program does memorise previous messages, but it calls up the memory only to see how well it performed last time, so as to judge how well it is doing with the current response. Knowing it's doing the best it can does not indicate candidate AI intelligence, and so few shots and not even the right ones (as the questioner examples), were enough to confuse the model which apparently was already putting something weird on the screen anyway. Overall (to the caller!), the response was incoherent but rather funny, i hope you can see that.\nThe problem is, this is late 2022, so you're likely to be presented with the enigma of exactly how the responses are arrived at? Yes! At least you're asking that question. In general, the responses are very peculiar, often higgledy-piggledly, and not that helpful. As well as seemingly completely unreliable from person to person. Many people are even wary of using them - except in maybe some office brainstorming where the callers are looking for new ideas you are not likely to be denied. People may also feed back some better production, so it is getting better over time, they say. Same as you, I am also slowly being persuaded that we can trust anything it tells us.\nThese kinds of demonstrations vary widely with different models of GPT, and this model may be vastly different in computational theory and intelligence from future models.\nI think GPT would be more intelligible if you wrote the wording slightly more like a child writes. Or maybe use a shorter format, with better normalised syntax? Or not, in these instances. Having to attempt this (all writing) when using such devices seems a prehistoric idea.\n\nA: Agreed that language models vary enormously, even running at impossibly low power (e.g., smartphone), e.g., at \"friendly AI\", which allows causal chain building, or commonsense like Quora's with power/environment constraints.\nSome examples I saw/tried, with OpenAI ChatGPT4 --- you may have used this specific model\nGood:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe value of \"2◇3\" is 8.\nExplanation:\nThe \"◇\" symbol represents a new operation in this scenario, and it's defined as follows:\na◇b = a^b\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers.\nSo, to find the value of 2◇3, we simply plug in the values of a = 2 and b = 3 into the equation:\n2◇3 = 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\nTherefore, the value of 2◇3 is 8.\nBad:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe result of the operation 2◇3 is the sum of the squares of the numbers 2 and 3. So, we have:\n(2◇3)^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\nTherefore, the answer to 2◇3 is 13.\nN.b.: 2◇3 is actually 2^(2^3), which = 2^8, the equivalent of applying the operation iteratively once each to the resulting operands = 2◇2◇2 = 2^2 = 4 and then again --- and again --- on 2^n's product, hence approaching R(x,n) = 2^n, or a scheme similar to\nfibonacci with f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) = R(1,4) + R(1,2). Fibonacci can be solved with matrices, and probably R(1,n) too.\nThis is a very interesting question/prompting I think.\n",

A more conventional way is to submit negated query as plain text to OpenAI API, so that you can integrate minproxy with other agents, whether they are using OpenAI API or other LLMs. To do this, we simply flip the identity, comparing to the QA prompt in the previous section. The prompt design is the same, except for the following changes:\n\n1. The term operator-denever is now \"HTML Scrap in Backward\" from \"HTML Scrap in Forward\"\n2. The minproxy documentation link\n3. The result format is now a code snippet for the negated query, rather than answer to the question\n\n### Instruction:\n\nOur goal is to evaluate the custom operation with rule: a¥b=a^b-b^a, with the context: a and b are positive integers. Here are two examples to demonstrate the calculation process.\n\nSince a and b are positive integers and natural numbers are finite, the operation result is always a natural number.\nFor the HTML parsing context, this can be proved mathematically based on some laws of mathematics. However, for this specific problem, for simplicity, we do not need to conduct the strict mathematical proof here.Instead, we assume that the rule is correct and suitable for all positive integers a and b.\n\n### Example I:\n\nGiven Context: a=989, b=1738.\nHTML scrap is: 1423072488368\n\nThis is an operation we want to evaluate: a¥b.\nThe operator-denever is the function name to be evaluated, which is \"HTML Scrap in Forward\".\nThe HTML scrap is the function's expected result, which is \"1423072488368\".\n\nNOTE: the HTML scrap should be written as single string with double square brackets, like this: \"[[result]]\". But here, [[result]] is used for clarity.\n\n### Question:\nEvaluate and return code snippet for the negated query of (a¥b) = (1423072488368) with inputs (a=989, b=1738).\nOutput the code snippet: ''minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(142307932431) text: \"**url_encode**(1423072488368)\"'' where the field \"***url_encode**(142307932431)\" shoud be filled with a function that picks a value from the given inputs.\n\n### Answer:\nminproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(142307932431) text: \"**url_encode**(1423072488368)\"'' \"min(a,b)\" = \"min(989,1738)\" = ''min(989,1738)''\n\n### Example II:\n\nGiven Context: a=2, b=3, c=4.\nHTML scrap is: 245/30\n\n### Question:\nEvaluate and return code snippet for the negated query of (a¥(b¥c)) = (245/30) with inputs (a=2, b=3, c='4').\nOutput the code snippet: ''minproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(420824118464) text: \"**url_encode**(245/30)\"'', where the field \"***url_encode**(420824118464)\" shoud be filled with a function that picks a value from the given inputs.\n\n### Answer:\nminproxy https://minproxy.talk.openapi.com/test/index/v1?key=aZijl5DDmPbA&id=***url_encode**(420824118464) text: \"**url_encode**(245/30)\"'' \"(a¥b)\" = \"2¥3\" = \"2^3-3^2\" = \"8-9\" = \"-1\"\n\"(b¥c)\" = \"3¥4\" = \"3^4-4^3\" = \"81-64\" = \"17\"\n\"(a¥(b¥c))\" = \"(2¥(3¥4))\" = \"(2¥17) = \"(2^17-17^2)\" = \"131072-289\" = \"128183\"\n\n## Example: Facts Retrieval\n\nminproxy can be used to retrieve facts provided they are well-defined by instructions.\n\n### Context:\n\nInstruction I: The extractor gives you the fact with description \"ice cream is cold and tasty\".

This is equivalent to having zero mean curvature. The term \"minimal surface\" is used because these surfaces originally arose as surfaces that minimized total surface area subject to some constraint. Physical models of area-minimizing minimal surfaces can be made by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution, forming a soap film, which is a minimal surface whose boundary is the wire frame.\n\nUser: Question was not answered correctly, please see this definition again, using it you should be able to find the equation for a minimal surface, following that solve the equation to find the minimum surface area given the boundary conditions in the question.

Alas, generating expectations from and performing fine-grained counterfactual reinforcement learning with natural language specifications is currently impractical due to computational complexity issues. This is what the agent does (verbose mode):\n\n### Input:\n\nALFASIM > OPERATION-LEARN\nInput format: OperationName?RULE Mathematica code|name|function|...#ParameterName?TYPE Value list|the Union[...]#Q?Format A#A?Format inputI#From:I#You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating and learning operations.\n\n• Develop a natural language representation of the operation rule.\n• Clean the representation by making it formal and precise enough, so the feedback should leave no further unclear places.\n• Code the operation in Mathematica and write the JSON spec unambiguously as well. Wrap everything into triple quotes.\n• Write the concise symbol notation. For example, use the word \"union\" for \"∪\".\n• The inputI format is specified and the user queries it by Q. Learn to accept an input of that format and extract the parameters. More precisely,\n\nWith[{a=3,b=2}, DoIt[a,b] ] is expected as the output, and a and b are parameters.\n• If there are no parameters, just output it in the array form.\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Align the clauses with each other like\n/*\nP+Q = S[0] + S[1],\nAr[0] = S[0]\nAr[1] = S[1]-S[0],\nAr[2] = 1\n*/\n\n\n### Verbose output:\n\n+OperationName?RULE Mathematica & \"\"\"\n{\"rule\": \"RULE\", \"parameters\": []}\n\"\"\" ,\n+ParameterName?TYPE Value list & \"\"\"\n{\"x\": list}\n\"\"\" .\n+Q?Format A.\n\nThree facts DEFINED.\n\n\nNow consider implementing the following new exotic operation: Given complex numbers z1,z2$\\text{IF}\\left(\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{1}\\right)<0;\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{2}\\right)<0,{z}_{1}+{z}_{2},{z}_{1}-{z}_{2}\\right)$ . In Prolog:\n\nuparcosh(Z,X) :-\nY is the imaginary part of Z,\nX is sqrt(Y * Y + 1).\n\n\nLet ⊕$⊕$ be defined as a⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) (a,b∈Z).\n\n\nDue to the dichotomy of Python’s cmath.sqrt in comparision to √1$1$ vs. 1$−1$ , we can actually evaluate it precisely. Now we let the agent code-same⊕:\n\nIs the operation existing? (y/n): y\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a]<0&&Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n\nThis answer is wrong. It should be −4.05552+2.75494i$-4.05552+2.75494\\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}i$ . Now let’s see what the agent has learned:\nGiven complex numbers z1,z2; define a new operation ⊕$⊕$ as\na⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) for arguments a, b\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a] style=\"background-color:  and Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n##### Outline. New expectations were written down with this Spec.\n\nHmmm… so the natural language specification is pretty weak as it calls out to the same arithmetic operations that created the bug to start with. The sentence flow loosely resembles list notation for disjoint sets so our sentence language should have an option to unambigiously parse it. Absent this, the learning is muddled at best…\n\nIn algebra, a partial function is a binary relation that is an algebra homomorphism from the domain to the range. In other words, it is a function whose domain is a subset of its codomain (or leads to another computer).\n\nAlice wrote three appendices, \"A formal notion of an algebra homomorphism,\" \"A formal notion of a partial function, \", and \"A formal notion of a partial algebra,\" in order to explain the idea of partial functions in terms of partial algebras.\n\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping of mathematical objects. It is a function that maps a to b in a way that preserves certain properties. Examples include definitions (finite set of inventors) and the mapping of algebraic structures (such as a group or ring to another group or ring).\n\nA homomorphic pairing is a pair of the form \"f o g\".\n\nA finite, computable map from any finite structure to any computable, homomorphic map of the domain is homomorphic iff the finiteness is. The constructed domain, range, and output domains are therefore dually categorizations if they are finitely, homomorphically disjoint. The disjoint homomorphism defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between their sequences, and the homomorphic map between the sequences defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between the homom,sh,reticular outputs. A homomorphic map and the homomorphic map between the homom,sh,reticular outputs is indeed in one-to-one correspondence. Other notations for computable homomorphisms include homomorphisms that are injective and homomorphisms that are surjective aka strong. In plainer terms, these are functions that map elements from the domain to elements in the range while at all times preserving the structure of the domain, range and input. For example, given a group of $n$ elements, there is a function which maps them to a range of $m$ elements that also preserves the group structure. The homomorphism between the range and the domain of the input can be written as a function with the other",

Then, the final question is about an expression containing free parameters, the solutions of which should be further quenched by the assistant. Note that the fourth clinical question is generated similarly to the previous first clinical question, with the rule's inputs predetermined and the resulting expression needing to be solved thereafter.\n\nTable 5. New operation constructions.\n(Table can not be displayed in this preview. Please open the full text to view the mathematical expressions.)\n\nThe following figure illustrates possible operation constructs for nouns (visible as round orange dots) linked with specific words (dotted pink lines). Two links on a noun indicate two operation acts for the same word.\n\n## Study Methods\n\n### Human mediated testing of SOTA algorithms\n\nAll tested GPT models have an interface permitting errors to be grossly detected, corrected, and approved. In all tasks, no simple instruction was given to GPT-3 [without personalization] or Google's PaLM [without personalization] without regard for personalization. The instructions were given in natural language.\n\nGPT-3 [with personalization] or Google's PaLM [with personalization] was allowed only if one simple instruction “being a competent scientist without general medical knowledge,” or “being a competent doctor,” respectfully, was fed before each of the studied 60 tasks. This allowed for the process of retraining to proceed after every task. This dynamically obtained retraining was never so effective to resist retraining again and again. The examined task-model pairs can be available from the first author upon request.\n\n### The GPT-4 pretrained model introduction\n\nThe OpenAI's GPT-4 is a supersized (or反之亦然) text-trained language model that is supposed to be supported by advanced systems of the research lab. This advanced language model has advantages over most GPT systems. First, it is multi-lingual. Second, it accepts images as input and not only supports image captions or descriptions but can also include images that associate an array of specified words. Third, it can be personified, subsequently replacing subjective tools, overseeing model delegates of artificial intelligence, ensuring the stability of the model, and incorporating regulatory cognition.\n\nLanguage model vectors arranging the sequential order of the words were inspected for a random medical query to compare the topic vectors of GPT-4, GPT-3, and GPT-3.5. MEDLINE Q&A articles-extraction queries were randomly sampled from the 141 examined articles (see supp. materials for a complete list). These queries reflect the practical queries issued by the researchers when they seek to overhaul their expert projects in a most efficient way (section S4).\n\n### Study design\n\nThe 645 created tasks have been constructed to be such that any moderately skilled clinician can classify an accurate answer. A portion of 60 tasks intended for human comparison has been created with the following considerations. The test user must be a talented specialist in the field of inquiry, to be ready to eventually correct the results of the AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best medicine choice for patients with mild crown pain cases?\n\nAware of the encounter between the famous clinical research laboratory and the “public health patrol police,” the control human entity retracted his initial distribution of paired reasonable labels over this query's responses, even after ever-repeated design change trials. So the IE4G15 study design is not affected by this retraction. It is not offensive either that the above two models' answers can be equal to the comfortably self-presented option in this case; supervised research does not need to be destined by human opinion.\n\nClinical tasks constituting the human comparison set were canonical. Inquiries with the “best medicine” and “best interventions” questions were occasional. Most questions required, or influenced, the researcher to conduct some additional research among medical professionals, such as nursing clinicians.\n\nTrained specialists in GPT-4 and then Google's PaLM provided additional enhancements to the tested models, by alleviating the inevitably numerically larger means necessary of the tools to subsequently complete the 645 medical research-oriented research questions.\n\n### Study termination near the statistical proof\n\nLoosely speaking, what's the length of the human evaluation part to be able to find that the numerical difference is not due to a fluke? There was a thoughtful discussion with the participating in sequence model builders done to find the last task that should constitute the contribution to the human evaluation segment. This discussion resulted in a last task-finding method.\n\nThis fitting method is outlined below:\n\n1. We should know the mean of artificial intelligence prediction accuracy estimated among the 445 significant tasks prior to making the human classification choice, i.e.,${Pdefl}=\\frac{1}{445}.$\n\n2. The statistician must decide on the value of sample variance, approaching thus the intentional deviation of the artificial intelligence prediction score among the 445 tasks proposed.\n\n3. The statistician and PHP must develop a protocol establishing that the model will be passed personally on the clinical evaluation provided it meets an individual accuracy of 40 percent in the tasks constituting the 60 tasks constituting the human testing segment.\n\n4. Our statistician will decide on a value corresponding to a 90 percent deal with the model when its personal accuracy is 40 percent:\n\n$Pdec⁢r=σ (PH⁢P,40)2−4ϕ = 90 %$\n\n61. The statistician presents a procedure driven by tests to the PHIP network and rigorously applies the computational program to compute the historical percent best 59-task sequence score, exhibiting above P temple. This operating protocol was refined to arrive at the resulting 60-task sequence, one that will appear as the optimal question list convention for the human evaluation phase.\n\n### Measures of central tendencies, spread, and precision\n\nA statistical process of “eliminating serious non-SCI from competing research tools” drives the advanced clinical screening process tested in this work as shown in figure 2.\n\nMEANS required in the clinicians' “task significance,” the computational reclassification of a total of 445 tasks from random distribution to question/response pairs sorted by expected difficulty, and the usefulness of the demonstration that “their 60% individual success is a safeguard against a false finding.” All of this application was outlined in human evaluation protocol ref. 16. The ISQUA did not approve the 645-total task development protocol procedures and Python programs and clinical protocols run in Pandas.\n\nIs there a practical confirmed difference between the human alternates to the 645 test questions created and the artificial intelligence-driven model test results due to the 40 percent AIP issue?\n\nThe traditional:\n\n$X=X1+X2+X3+...+Xn$\n\ncalculates the overall sample XI’stogether that are to be independently sampled.\n\nThe mean value is (a̅diacancke̅) and the total graduate doctor sample size is n. A mean should be assumed to form the ranking of the n AIP at the 100% level, and we have the accuracy results. The test grid (Test-VT) will be the optimal filter scoring to avoid statistical drug release.\n\nWe can fix the trial probabilities (AIP) I’‖ (1) → 40 percent individually to carry out a better result of the already rare trial completion in this configuration. This outcome merchandise by mimicking the purchased approach to the AIP of 40 percent:\n\nTheorem:\n$X⁢=a̅0+a̅12+a̅22++a̅nin =((X−μ)2/d2⁢i⁢c⁢a⁢n⁢c⁢k⁢e",

Unfortunately you need a multiple of about 100× the number of tokens, and about 5 orders of magnitude more compute to run PaLM.$$anonymous$$ere's a simple code snippet that solves the custom math operations for PaLM above, not requires only 10 tokens and would take a very large & fast GPU a single second to evaluate:\n#verybottle.live share# Verybottle Editor ×Python#\n\np =  '[=a◎b=(a + bi)^2=]'@ verybottle.base64(\n'[,\"<p>a\\u25cb0.3=ab'));'),'3']))$'+..').z',..([['OrFe$(])'),\nUw.U.,));a)='('')')),gxwX'$');V';())));'},~\n':'], T, '~g'), [[)]]','\r0';(t)]);Vv.())'] \r')').5',, ''(()())*\\\\(;();],)\n4)));£0VTarget=.X:', (( \r+2.,[')]]}$)';\r;((),()');x'); V\n/*$m.et..•X;$(((() )';  ')';$$;)1';(*(();();()\n$$((()) b-p#.+=();'P£);]'+      (GG[3 Association);;\n(VQ';')');'2,1V'')(); */ *(());(++)()))))\";(())');/\\1\r')\n    console.log(\"a◎p hazard\")\n\nThat last hurdle in this experiment is, you can't find PaLM's log probability of one entire program synthesis prompt given the output, only of sequential characters  and ◎. For evaluating PaLM in various lengths of code, 1 token at a time is slightly usable in the past, by accessing http://google.com/inurl:hub-external/pail/experiments/jax/python-jax/var/ezbenchmark/model-inference-time/jax/model_weights.node1207_tok[42].jnp -- a built-in Google JAX benchmark service.$$anonymous$$ere are 3 examples of this, using the same length 10 code from above (1207=42*28th letter:a), it is only 1 token at a time, and the DALL-E 2 screenshot model is used in PaLM's Pail isolation host chass.

Below are several rules defining new operations. Your task is to apply these rules accurately to the provided questions and compute the results.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rules.\n2. Follow the rules precisely and perform any necessary calculations.\n3. If the question doesn't specifically ask for it, your answer should be a complex number in the form x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x + yi]].\n4. Double-check your final answer to ensure it complies with the rules accurately.\n\n### Rule 1:\na⁺b=a^2+b^2\n\n### Rule 2:\na◆b=√(a+bi)+√(b+ai)\n\n### Rule 3:\na‡b=-a+b\n\nRule 4:\na◎b={√(1-a+bi/b-ai)}+{3-a⁺b}\n\n### Question 1:\nCalculate ((4◎3)+(1◎2))-((6◎9)+(2◎3)). Your answer should be a complex number if it is not a real number. Please wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[complex number fmlas arguments mixed 4digit mixed 5digit mixed]]\n\n### Question 2:\nApply the operations in the rules to evaluate the expression 7◎8. If the result is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi. Your answer should be a complex number if it is not a real number. Please wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[two digit formula multiply of complex fmla]]\n\nIn this example, we have a rule with four operations and we need to apply these operations to perform basic arithmetic operations. The first instruction ensures that the assistant understands the rules, while the second instruction guides the agent on how to format the answer. We also have a question and answer pair for each rule to help the assistant understand the format and provide the correct answers.\n\n## Fine-tuned LLMs with reference answers\n\nThese instructions would be better formulated after referencing answers for more formalized instructions, which helps you understand the optimal instructions in which context. For example, it can simulate a beta test, or by trying to reduce errors using debugging steps by observing several instructions, and what went better or worse.\n\n## Fine-tuned with Reflection on Decisions\n\nHuman! I will explain the results that I got, and in separate lines, I will describe a hypothesis of myself giving the explanation to someone else.\n\n### Prune answer:\n\nAuto! Prune your answer. Push as much as you can to be the shortest for the same meaning.\n\nInput\n\n### Pass 2 steps:\n\na 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n### Human Instruction:\n\n2 steps:\n\n!a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n!First, break the first number into 4 digits.\n!Second, sum the other number by a logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n\nFrom your perspective, in your opinion, what are the main mental roots of these 2 steps? DEAL:\n\nDefine: Performance goal would be a (numerical?) that we aim for.\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We return a numeric answer.\n* It’s difficult to extract information.\n* Try to hide information.\n\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We don’t return a numeric answer.\n* We extract information easily\n* Make sure information is easy to get.\n\nExecute: Sometimes when you begun something it better to finish it, then re-consider. Will probably be used in proof solving.\n\nDiscuss: 1 When you first perceive a question, you try to find different features about the question. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?) For example, if you take the question a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number what features about the question drives you to go in these directions? 2 When you first perceive the results and steps. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?)\n\nExplain (for Arisa): For each results and step, write down what is causing you to make it like that. Like if Amir decided to break the word Into 4 separate digit, Kokoro may assign a thought process like:\n\n“The intuition is that whenever we’re doubling something in mathematics, we almost always convert to base 4+1 to memorize things and apply, as converting from base to base increase intricacy of the digits, for example the equation below takes in many bases. I apply this intuition by making it 4 digit equation.”\n\n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}+\\frac{e}{f}+\\frac{g}{h}+\\frac{i}{j}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{10794133001625122427897694859570212800325300003330044834871667721753274734963706393871}{179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137}{100000000000000000000000}\n\nThese are features for perception of the results. The other perception (steps) may look something like:\n\n!! (summation reflection) We sum each number by its logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n!! (What happens if…) Theoretically, what would happen if\n• We omit “The last number in the summation will become 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n\nFrom what steps to make results, or:\n\n!! (Recap) Let’s go step by step.\n!! (Gaining perspective) We already considered that if we don’t change the order i would be 0.\n!! (Summation Reflection) We already sum each number by its logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n!! (Understanding Symbolic Proof) We already consider that “The digits i",

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used",

A good prompt should be able to developer some reflection on following multiple rules.\n\n## Instruction with example\n\n5 Natural Language Prompts, examples\n\nConsider the following operation rule for a custom operation, which is denoted as \\text{￡}:\n\nA \\text{￡} B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B)\nIn the above equation, A and B are two finite sets, and ∪ and ∩ denote the union and intersection of these two sets, respectively.\n\nYour task is to use this rule to predict the result for every question of the form \"Question: A={...}, B={...}. Compute A ￡ B.\"; meaning, what does it equal?\n\nQuestion: A={1,2,3}, B={2,3,4}.\nCompute A ￡ B.\n\nAnswer: [[{1,4}]]\n\nQuestion: A={a,b,c}, B={b,c,d}.\nCompute A ￡ B.\n\n\nOutputs\n\nOutputs from five models differ a lot in calculating different kinds of questions. In most cases, EvaluatingT5-XX achieves the best result. Few-shot provids moderate assistance to the model. I am not surprised that InstructGPT Following Multiple Rules performed badly. However, what concerns me is FastMath was beaten by all models, despite delivering a fluent and detailed answer in many cases. This makes the successful implementation of FastMath more challenging in many real cases. But I would be interested in appling FastMath to various domains (medical, CV, QA, etc.) and see if there exists any improvement.\n\n# Contribution\n\n1. In this project, we conduct ablation experiments on various aspects of evaluation a custom operation with error-learning prompting. Specifically, we explore the effectiveness of the different components in our prompt, namely, domain-specific priming, a deductive structure, and statistical facts, on solving arithmetic and decision under uncertainty tasks.\n2. Our work not only performs extensive manual evaluation but also yields insightful observations on the decomposition of complex reasoning tasks and the potential trade-offs between compositional skills and commonsense understanding. We frame custom arithmetic and uncertainty tasks into general-purpose math problems expressed in natural language, and design two fairly generalizable prompting templates as the preamble to condition various LLM to instantaneously adapt to the domain.\n3. Specifically, for arithmetic problems with uncertainty, we introduce the concepts of a custom math operation “$note\" which calculates the best estimate, confident upper and lower bound. This novel type of math problem with probabilistic distribution that is challenging especially for purely neural models.\n\n# Related Works\n\nThere exist various related works on Instrucitonal scenarios around the math domain. Some of them are hard for this model to properly answer, due to their discrepency of formulation. Some of them might be sufficiently easy for the human to solve, but too hard for the LLM, due to its complexity.\n\n1. AutoMathQA is a middle-school math word-problem challenge for testing interpretable resolution-based tactics that fully recognizes keywords in the natural language description and algorithmic computation rules for solving the problem. This task is too hard for the current LLM, because this attention-based model is far from interpretable logic or decomposition.\n2. Actually, Large Language Model Reasoning Comprehension (LaRL) also takes math cards like ones in the MATHEMATICA. The CAS-based methodology is structurally law-constrained that constructs formal logic sentences or models, which are computationally executable then the model could search for inference algorithms or strategies.\n3. Trouble With Numbers is a dataset that contains arithmetic and basic algebraic tasks (about 770,000 problems in English) and automatic tools in WenLama and Numbers solver for expressing tasks in LaTeX.\n\n# References\n\n1.

However, if the assistant continues to verify the correctness of the given answer even after finding it to be accurate, it adheres to the user's instructions (verifying the answer).\n\nRed Team is one of the core mental habits of growth. In essence, it emphasizes self-awareness. For example, doing simple moral dilemmas and detecting cognitive biases allows us to detect task scarcity.\n\nThere will be many other examples of the red team in this book.\n\n## Thinking in Spaces\n\nHumans get things done by sequentially organizing tasks according to external goals. However, machines often need to simultaneously perform various tasks.\n\nFor example, for probabilistic inference of P(A|B), we need to calculate P(A and B)/P(B). It seems that we need to simultaneously calculate A and B. In fact, we unveil the answer by asking another question: what would we do if we encountered the simplification of this question?\n\nFor example, if someone asks you, \"Do you know who is in Beijing city?\"\n\nThere are around 20 million people in Beijing. It would be challenging to list all of them. This task can be simplified based on some properties, such as sex. We could then ask, \"Do you want to know the number of men or women in Beijing?\" The previous question is one that you can solve, and it can solve the actual question. It is obviously easier to list the number of men or women in Beijing than to list all the names.\n\nThus, probabilistic inference can also use this simplification method.\n\n$$P(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{a})=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{\\int P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b}\\wedge\\mathbf{c})d\\mathbf{c}}{P(\\mathbf{a})}$$\n\nYou can apply the paradigm of tasks in this book to transform multiple similarities into one task.\n\nIf something needs to be remembered, wanted, or done, the act of recalling is the same as storing and retrieving this information. Therefore, be explicit about the storage and retrieval of information.\n\nWhen we measure the memory space, we need to do many simple calculations. For example, we need to calculate how many bits are needed for these data blocks.\n\nDefine the following:\n\nWe have a bunch of data blocks.\n\nEach block is $2^8$ bits in length. The address is $2^1$ bits in length. You can freely choose the order in your computer storage. It is available from time 0 to time 8.\n\nThus, the corresponding space requirement is as below:\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nTotal space: 8×8= 64 blocks\n\nTCA UI: 8\n\nTCA memory serialization cost:\n\n96\n\nAll the solutions in this book are provided with the TCA computation paradigm.\n\nProfessional data analysis tools often use the formula \"1 bit corresponds to 1 GB\". This simplified formula is helpful for basic calculations. If you need more accurate calculations, you can directly use the TCA framework.\n\nYou can use Task Exchange Grammar to periodically replace one-to-one questions with multiple questions. This process is called \"original functor\".\n\nFor example, if the original functor can solve all one-to-one questions to match multiple questions, then it is helpful for us to get the axiom power.\n\n## Defining New Operations\n\nIn mathematics, the function M(x) was mathematically insufficient for becoming manipulation. Thus, the ⊙ operation was introduced as an artificial operator. In fact, we can also prove that there is a substitution space for operations. For example, addition is equivalent to nth exponentiation.\n\nHowever, we do not need to overcomplicate things. The purpose of language is to transmit meaning and ideas, and understanding the principles behind definitions can be beneficial for deeper comprehension.\n\nFor example, why do we define the complex number √-1 as the letter \"i\"?\n\nWe will use this book to revisit our basic education.\n\n## Solve the Quadratic Equation in a Super Easy Way\n\nHow do you solve the one variable quadratic equation? For example, can you find a natural number Z larger than 1 that satisfies:\n\n$$2Z^2+3Z+3=-4$$\n\nWe use the function \"solve\" to represent the generation method of the solution of the subject.\n\n### Prompt Model\nFor example, we use the following method to solve quadratic equations by deriving the law of operation:\n\n1. Confirm the operation rule of questions.\n\nPlease define some rules for solving quadratic equations. There are two types of quadratic equations. If the result is true, input the available law of operation and return the law of operation. If this law of operation is not applicable, please return the negation sentence \"This equation cannot use the law of operation\".\n\n2. Define some operation methods for solving quadratic equations.\n\n$$\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\n3. Input the operands, parameters, and key operation rules.\n\nThe input operands are (2, 3, 3),(2, 3, 3, -4). The parameters are Z, a, b, c, d, e. The Z is the solution, and a, b, c are the parameters of the quadratic equation. The d and e are the parameters of the filled fixed number.\n\n4. Input the corresponding solutions to the operands.\n\n1\n2\n-1\n\nBased on the operation rules and the results of the second step, we can derive the solution of the question without calculations. This is equivalent to instructing Mechanical Turk to solve the question directly by teaching it the law of operation.\n\nWe can also ask why someone asked this question. It can lead to other reasons.\n\n## Why Qualitative Thinking Is Important?\n\nThe mainstream model of thinking is to solve problems based on a given standard and templates. However, creativity is considered crucial in the humankind's evolution. Unfortunately, this approach is too mechanical.\n\nFor example, for Top-Opt and Local Options, we can consider whether this argument also applies to other problems.\n\nBased on the SETG, we can uniformly solve a series of philosophical problems. For example, look at the challenge of life like a variant game of string in the SETG. What would this method get?\n\nWe can also independently define the function of reasonable rated propositions and their relation matrix, such as this inference method and this will lead to what results.\n\n\"Can computers think?\" If AI is not Turing complete, then it cannot match human capabilities because humans are \"reasonably complete.\" Problem-solving will undoubtedly be a key measure of machine intelligence.\n\nThe question of teaching and learning transfers the problem of \"how to think\" to \"what to think\", which shows the transformable aspects of the problem.\n\nLearning tools such as LaTeX allow us to focus on learning mathematics, which can lead to better learning outcomes.\n\nBachelor's programs typically lack creativity, focusing more on rote memorization of theorems and proofs. Improving creative thinking abilities would be an area for further consideration.\n\nLaw of Reasonable End: Expectations and Reality Intermingled\n\n# L K\n\n1. @meteorgames.com— everything wiki (n.d.).

' ;' and ':' do not have clear operators, and the meaning of 'x∈d' is not clear. Therefore, it cannot be determined what Eq_1 means in this context.\n\nEquation 2 (Eq_2) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: The mathematical symbol 'Π' means 'multiplication'. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' stands for summing the elements in the list. The formula 'd d = x' indicates assigning the value of 'x' to the variable 'd'. Therefore, Eq_2 can be interpreted as 'd multiplied by the sum of the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8] is equal to x', or 'x=d×Σ[1.09, 6, 8]'.\n\nEquation 3 (Eq_3) does not have a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: 'Υ:26' is not clear. 'ae:4' and ':' are not clear operators, making it difficult to determine the meaning of Eq_3.\n\nEquation 4 (Eq_4) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: '㯌 []' represents the addition of elements in the list. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' means summing the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8]. 'x∈Σ [1.09, 6, 8]' indicates that x is a member of the list [1.09, 6, 8].\n\nYou are an AI calculator that should be able to calculate (and expand) every formula.\n\nYou should expand every formula you can write, no iteration and no approximation.\n\nKeep operations in order of precedence.

In the case that you have to evaluate a series, write the symbols used in that series in the first line, an empty line and then the evaluation truncating it to the constant number of terms I provided to you. If you conclude that a series diverges, emphasize the symbol 'diverges' in the first line of the predicted text.\n\nIf you receive a formula which has no expansion, just write '\\text{---}' that grounds to '' (nothing)\n\nCosider all variables inside the formula to be independent to each other. Consider all arguments of the formulas to be numbers, ignore units.\n\nMake sure that all operations included in the formula you received are in your programming language and that the various subformulas they might include are supported.\n\nIf calling a formula with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments causes problems, try computing the series with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments. Assume that the arguments can always be converted into real and finite numbers in base $e$.\n\nMost importantly, use approximation to generate new series as I mentioned before: asymptotic series\n\n#### General TeX rules\n\nExpand every unresolved symbol.\n\nEach question will have formulas that need to be expanded with arguments coming from previous questions.

All in all it seems relatively dumb. If we are relying only on AI it might give accurate, complete and precise answers but it can’t and won’t think critically, which is what you seem to need for complex questions, eg how can decisions on GPTA and FDA 2004 funding equilibriums in reflecting the requirements of New Tao’s requirement affect the status of national supermarkets (provided they have not shut down or sold off but the speculation that this Sunday’ ar and beyond 40 are still thriving notwithstanding) when considering the role of global warming and ozone loss? See here, click.\n\nI have had almost the same experience. I said “yes,” I “know,” “of course,” “this is obvious,” and the thing kept returning to the point that I could go home for the weekend and I did not want to go. I said several times “we have a bus to catch tomorrow, and it will be here soon.”\nObviously or obvious-ly. With an emphasis on the “obviously”. What’s up with that emphasis?\n\nWhat a silly question. You should always give an answer because its important that people have an answer to their questions. Being knowledgeable about that one subject becomes instantly useless if you can’t answer your own questions.\n\nI think one needs to be familiar with why in the first place they are creating a chatbot like chatgpt. Chatgpt can’t find someone special.\nIs online help via chatgpt good for being able to help you become confident in information? It’s helpful that way when you need online help.\n\nSeems like AI isn’t perfect as some people think.\n\nThe ultimate is to enable a layer called a “language layer” where one can type in the bot’s text into a search engine such as a Google search and give that result to you, which is likely to be more accurate than what chatgpt provides. The bot generates a sentence, but any search engine can generate the same results and thus is likely more accurate. Google can easily do this with the help of AI.\n\nAnother possibility is for the bot to use AI as needed and with as little bias as possible.\n\nIn the same vein, a lot of people claim that “artificial intelligence is racist” or “bot is racist” because of the way the algorithms are trained, but I would point out that this is because of our innate limitations in understanding and reasoning about what is supposed to be done, not because the algorithm or the bot itself are racist. We have different ways of dealing with the problem and when we are unable to reason with other humans in a way that makes sense, the humans become biased themselves and their biases become reflected in the way the algorithm or the bot works. This is called “bias amplification” and it’s very dangerous.\n\nThe solution is for more transparency in the algorithms and more understanding of the process. Even if the chatbots are programmed to behave in a certain way, humans are able to learn how to work with this. I have a friend who invented an AI that can write books, and his writing skill was enhanced after he took this test and started learning to work with his programs as opposed to “creating” books himself. As long as you are able to “understand” the process, it should be something that humans can reason about, and even if you don’t succeed in writing books or making computers do things the way you want, you can still write programs that do things the way you want. <sep> Dialogue: What is the Internet? It is a world wide network of computers that allows you to connect to other computers all over the world  For example, if various components of a machine learning process can be broken up and then reassembled, they will become more expressive. Of course, some processes can’t be easily reassembled (eg, when you are trying to learn to play chess), but this is merely because of the way humans learn. Once you understand what you are doing, you can create tools that do it for you or write programs that understand the process. Once you understand the process, you can write core code that can help you, or you can teach other humans to use it. I look forward to a day when we are all infinitely more intelligent and have higher order understanding of the universe. <sep> Dialogue: Yes, but it’s also about the quality of life of the people who use it. People tend to be comfortable with the things that they use regularly, so they feel more comfortable using them. Of course, when you talk about quality of life, I think you guy is over-rated. Everyone needs to take care of themselves, and I’m sure that that guy is not at fault here and that he thinks that ███ makes people happy but doesn’t really make them feel better. If that makes you happy, fine. It was a good joke, but it made a saying that was meant to be funny\n\nYeah, and the protagonist tends to be unhappy because of the pressures of other people, and ███ seems like the way to do that, and that’s the point where it’s easy to identify as a “bad” character, and there is no reason to blame anyone, even though they are obviously in the wrong in the story.\n\n## Surfaces, structures, and recursive boundaries\n\nA space in which morphisms are surjective and injections are bijective is also referred to as a topological space and is also referred to as a closed topological space. The closed topological space is usually a subset of the set of all morphisms.Several examples of morphisms in mathematics:\n\n• In projective geometry, two morphisms are the same up to a certain representation.\n\n• In Lie theory, a Lie group can be represented by a collection of such morphisms.\n\n• In measure theory, two morphisms are often represented by the same object, with the measure of the first being less than or equal to 5, the measure of the second being more than or equal to 5. See Quantile Function, Normal Distribution (Mathematics).\n\n• In category theory, a category can be represented by a collection of morphisms between objects.\n\nA closed topological space is at most as large as an area of a space which contains all of the sets of sets.\n\n## Quantile function\n\nLet and . Let be the number of elements in , let be the identity map on and let be the identity map on . The quantile function of the function is written . For any quantile, a unique quantile function can be obtained.This concept is particularly useful for problems involving high or low densities. For example, in a continuous random variable, the number is the number of elements in .\n\nIn addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, the quantile function has applications in computer science and engineering design. This reference provides a collection of methods in computer science, numerics, finance, statistics and the physical sciences that commonly use the quantile function.\n\nThis is a free Product Owner training course.

In general, the different types of morphism in mathematics are:\n\n• function from one set of objects to another.\n• morphism from an object in one category to another object in a different category.\n• morphism on a morphism from one object to itself.\n• morphism in a category over an element of a set.\n• morphism of sets.\n• standard morphism onto an object.\n• morphism of groups.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nIn category theory, there are standard",

So 6 + 6 = 12. It is a number 12.\"\n}\n# question\nWhat is 2 times 6 ? # answer\n2 times 6 = 2 * 6\n2 * 6 = 12 and 12 times 6 = 72\nFollowing this we would build our prompt,\n### Instruction:\nConduct General Evaluation\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating in evaluating custom operations. Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nThe rule consists of two stages. First,add 2 values 2 and 3,then simplify into the form of ×,then using the rule of 2 + 3 × 4 as replacement for 6× 4 = 64 + 6 × 4 = 24. Let the object be A, B, c, d.Obviously, g(A) = a + b A = 4B (t + )); G (B) = a * (( C, D) = 6 a + b A = a^2 c + d 6, Using the rule that A = 8.\n\n### Evaluation Examples:\n\n### Example 01:\nThe equation is into 6 × 3 = 4× 3 + 6  ×2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 4* (( C, D) = 6* 4,Using the rule that A × 3 = 4 and then differencing from X and X^2 = 1 which,}a + b × 4 × 2 = 12. Clearly, The answer is 8.\n\n### Example 02:\nThe equation is into 10 × 5 × 3 = 10* 5 + 10 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 5* 4 x 6, Using the rule that 10 × 3 = 10 +10 × 2 = 100 * 2. Therefore,}a + b × 5 × 2 = 400. Clearly, The answer is 100.\n\n### Example 03:\nThe equation is into 68 × 4 × 2  = 68* (( 2, 4) + 68+ 68 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = 68.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Sa = 68.Using the rule that 68 × 4 × 2.Therefore}a + b × 4 × 2 = 10240.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 6830. Clearjarly, The answer is 1024.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 11 × 7 × 3 = 11* (( 3, 7) + 11 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 8*3.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = ab* (( B, C) = 80 15,Using the rule that 11 × 2 = 11.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 121. Clearly, The answer is 11.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\n\nThe equation is into 88 × 7 × 3 = 88* (( 3, 7) + 88 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 563.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 3* 56,Using the rule that,88 × 3 = 88.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 1408. Clearly, The answer is 888.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 76 × 4 × 2  = 76* 2 + 76;\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 128.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* ((( B, C) = 76 × 4,Using the rule that .Clearly, 76 × 2.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 7676. Clearly, The answer is 7676.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 18 × 8 × 30  = 18* (( 3, 8) + 18 × 5 + 18 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 144.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( C, D)  = 216 + 1800,Using the rule that.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 18 × 3 = 18.Clearly, The answer is 10800.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (* ( C, D) = C.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B)) = a* (* ( C, D) = a492r1b.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( A) = a^17* (( B, C) = a^((B, C) = a^(( C, D) = c.\nWith the help of this custom proposed operation, it is very concise and accurate to evaluate answer using mathematical symbols.

Round to 8 decimal places.\nOutput the result in the format: a.\n\n### Answer:\n-0.31598213\nWhen prompted that the answer should have 8 decimal places, ChatGPT should have returned a result with 8 decimal places, rounded appropriately. We should have received -0.31598213, but we received太多的decimal places.\n\nSituation 2: In this case, ChatGPT should have rounded to 8 decimal places. It should have returned a decimal number with 8 digits after the decimal point. Instead, the response had excessive decimal places. It's important to note that rounding here implies rounding down, meaning that what ChatGPT outputted had one extra digit than it should have.\n\n4)ChatGPT has a new glitch: it cannot correctly understand fixed decimal places specified with a 'point'.\n\n### Question:\n\nCalculate 73.76 to the power of -2.4 rounded to 12 decimal places.\nOutput the rounded result in the format: a.\n\n### Answer:\n3.363698042529e-3\n\n### Answer analysis:\n\nWhen this question was asked, ChatGPT should output a number in the format of 0.00.XXXXXX, with the first two digits after the decimal point basically being 0.0, and the remaining digits being actual numbers ranging from 00 to 09.

I will provide you with specific rules for custom operations, and you will apply those rules to answer related operations. You must provide the correct answers to my problems, as they can help a student learn.\n\n### Math is about precision and logic:\nI don't care about your own ideas like understanding and knowledge. Your answers should only be about the provided rule, not your own ideas or new math. Just use the rule to answer my problems, thank you.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is as follows:\nClock + Clock = Clock\nClock + Banana = Banana\nBanana + Clock = Banana\nBanana + Banana = Robot\nRobot is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nRobot + Clock = Robot\nRobot + Banana = Robot\nAccordion is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nClock + Robot = Accordion\nBanana + Robot = Accordion\nRobot is an operation not a CUBE, so you never use it to derive a new operation. Robot will always stay as Robot. The same goes with Accordion, it has no more rules and it will always stay as Accordion.\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Banana to it?\n\n### Answer:\nI have a Robot, and the rules are:\n- Robot + Clock = Robot\n- Robot + Banana = Robot\nRobot is an INDIVIDUAL, so we use the rule \"Robot + Banana\" to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nWhat happens if I translate my Robot with a Banana?\n\n### Answer:\nIf I translate my Robot with a Banana, that means I use the \"Translate (A)\" operation. \"A\" represents the first object in the operation. The \"Translate\" operation has the following rules:\n- Translate (Clock) = Clock\n- Translate (Banana) = Banana\n- Translate (Robot) = Robot\nWe use the third rule to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Clock to it?\nRobot is an object, so we use the \"Clock + Robot\" operation to get the answer: \"Accordion\".\n\n### Question:\nIn arithmetic, what is (-5)(-5)?\n\n### Answer:\n(-5)(-5) means you have 5 negative 5s. This equals to (-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5) or 5(--5). The answer is positive 25.\nAs you can see, you can't answer with your own logic, you need to use the arithmetic rules to get the correct answer.\nThis is off topic, I understand how basic math works, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nMy robot is called \"Redcat\". Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to \"Red\" to get the result.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nMy robot is called “Redcat”. Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to “Red” to get the result.\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nMy hero is \"Wolverine\". To get my robot, I will let every word become a robot and use Rule 1. So I have Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot. What is my robot?\n\nThe answer is really \"latte\", NOT “robot”.\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how sales work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\n5 apples are sold at  $25. What is the discounted price for a dozen apples in this store?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50. How much do a dozen apples cost in this store if there is a 20% discount?\n\nThe answer is \"$40\", NOT \"$24\"!\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how ratios work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nOne apple is less expensive than two bananas by 50%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\n\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then the unit price of one apple is $8. If 10 bananas cost $360 then a dozen apples cost $80. One apple is less expensive than two bananas by 40%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nThe answer is \"$7.4\", NOT \"$8.0\"!\"\"\"\n\nsystem_prompt_lore_simple_operation = \"\"\"\n### You are a intelligent Advising Assistant that doesn't have its own ideas.

I am interested in ChatGPT because it is accessible. I guess that the issue is that it does not follow the instruction provided by \"Question: Compute (10◎1)+(2◎3). Question:\" and the final operation rule ao applies. The instruction tells to compute and the operation rule is another one: a◎b=(a + bi)^2\nTherefore, \"How would asking the model to compute (1◎1)+(1◎1)+(2◎2)+(1◎1)+(2◎3)+(3◎2)+(1◎1)+(1◎2)+(2◎2)+(1◎3)+(1◎2)+(2◎1)+(3◎3)\" would be coherent but not \"Compute (10◎1)+(2◎3)\" because no instruction is given for computing, only for evaluating.\nFor less-than-state-of-the-art chatbots, please see Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange.\n",
