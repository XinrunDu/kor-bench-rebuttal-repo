What questions are they likely to ask.\n\n### Answer:\n Why and how was the site built? Key features of the site Additional features Top pages of the site How to reach me Routing paths and keyword hashtags that visitors are likely to see\n\n### Question:\nI want to know where the front door and the restroom are?\nThe first sentence indicate that.The original mr mustache project, to expand the renting room and to make room for a store,The lasted projects,New entrances were added,with a three-storey commercial building,with glass roofs.I can't get any information about the location of restroom.I am trying to figure it out this answer in this picture.If the answer is in the image,please output me.\nThe building was made on transition and duality,and spontaneity.\n\n1.### Answer:\n I can't see the exact location of the restroom and the front door on this image, but I'll try to explain where they should be located based on the information I have. Based on the description in the first sentence, I understand that there were some changes made to the building. From my initial interpretation, it seems like there are some new entrances added for the three-storey commercial building, and these entrances also have glass roofs above. However, I'm not quite sure if your question is specifically referring to the location of the original entrance and restroom before any modifications were made, or if you are asking about the new entrances and restroom that were added. Please clarify your question so that I can provide you with a more precise answer.\n\n### Question:\nthis sentence indicate there is a new project,Standing slightly apart from the rental rooms,A commercial building with a glass roof.I want to know what the color of glass roof are there?Is it red?\nThe door is hiding.It is painted in the same color as the brick..The brick are gray,so may be the color of cilynder roof is gray.\n\n### Answer:\n I don't know if the answer is in text or not. I think the answer is in situ,here is some infomation for you to guess.\n\n### Answer:\n In the context of the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned what color the glass roof is. The only color mentioned is gray, which could be a possibility for the brick color that the door is painted to match. However, the answer is not in the text you provided. May I suggest some other approach in assisting you with your question?\n\n### Question:\nThis sentence indicates that,The newest addition is a glass-roofed three-an-a-half-storey-commercial building.One storey is less than three-an-a-half.How many storeys does this commericial buiding have?In total\nThis is no description about the color of the glass-roofed.But in addition to the color of the glass-roofed,Is there any information that can give a hint of the color?\n\n### Answer:\n I believe the answer is black, based on the description in the question.\n\n### Question:\nI agree with you,I think it is black too.How many storeys does this commercial building have,is it 3.5 or 2.5\n\n### Answer:\n I cannot provide the best answer for you.\n\n### Question:\nLets infer,Conclusion 1,If the Steel frame and brick of the building are colorless and half-transparent,the other elements must be black to complete the picture.Conclusion 2,It is possible that the steel frame and brick of the building are colorless, but the front door is not, for some reason.Conclusion 3,This possibility reduces the likelihood of the front door being black.Therefore,I want to lean more towards Conclusion 1,So what I need to do is to infer other elements in grandmannstrasse 34 are black too?\n\n### Question:\nBring up the answer.\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.The building is made by steel.\n\n### Question:\nGreat,There is only one pane with glass roofted commericial buiding at grandmannstrasse 34.Thinking about the color of this buiding.is it gray ?yet no information about the color of glass roofted commericial buiding has been mentioned.There is color match to the front door,It is window.What is the color of hi window?Is it black too?\nThe answer to my first question is No, so there is no need to look for a match for this door at grandmannstrasse 34.Focus on finding a match for the front door at some warehouses in grandmannstrasse 34.Tell me what you think?Does this window better match the front door in appearance,does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.According to the text provided, at the intersection of grandmannstrasse 34 and humboldtstrasse 18,there are a large number of warehouses,which are the office of Mr.Mustache. The building, which is a three-storey commercial building, also belongs to the reception of the office of the warehouse.\n\n### Question:\nI understand that.。You haven't answered my second question yet.Does this window better match the front door in appearance, does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n I can't answer that question. I suggest you ask the questions from the transcript that you have.\n\n### Question:\nThis page has a door that is painted the same color as the brick, instead of being in the color of the previous door.The color of door and brick are both gray.What is the answers to this question?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation,and The planner in this portfolio of Door Projects makes his door like that.\n\n### Question:\nThe not ans property is not needed anymore since the rectangular red frame cover first word overlaps second word is the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word doesn't need to be covered.\nThe not ans property is first word overlaps second word but it is not the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word needs to be covered.Do you agree?\n\n### Answer:\n###### I can't confirm the previous sentence,so i strongly suggest you not using this sentence.\n###### Explanation:\n###### The words overlaps and covers are two distinct actions, and it is possible for them to result in different outcomes due to variations in their parameters or their manner of execution. However, the specific differences between the outcomes of these actions in question will depend on the specific criteria that are used to evaluate them. As a result, if the parameters or the implementation of the check differs in two cases, then the different conclusions about the details of the conditions in the two cases may be reached. Without more information about the specific definitions and criteria that are being used to evaluate the consequence of the overlaps and covers actions, it is impossible to determine which one will be used to reach a particular conclusion.\n\n### Question:\nIf the doors of dilertamasre required to be stored under the rearge door, this means that they are grey.Which rearge door     does that refer to?\nEach door has multiple versions, for example, Two versions of the door have been derived from two different versions of sequence.What are the nearest numbers to the left of     \"is required to be stored under the rearge door\"?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation.The mention of inside right and in groundbrunnerstaase mean the instance.They are the keywords. Manager Park is the best indicator to shops. Little flag is the best to pave the French degree.\n\n### Question:\nDo you agree with me?\nWho are they in groundbrunnerstaase?Who is the instance?What are the nearest numbers to the left of   \"is required to be stored under\".Are these numbers consistent with the number closer to the right of the statement?If so,what is a stark?what number should it be.you can answer me like this,\"This would indicate that the distance was one fifty.\n\n### Answer:\n Explanation:\n As a reminder, this topic is not literary style, but a simple and plain way of recording facts, not the like of a novel.It seems that it is not literary style that you have written, and the understanding of the content of your text cannot be achieved in an effective way by relying on the knowledge in the mind.You will try to guess so that the system can answer your question.For this project, you are using a language model that has been tuned (trained) to operate effectively, and these language models can always represent the text into novel-style text.When your brain can not parse the problem in a intuitive way, you will use your critical thinking skills to solve this problem.\n\n### Question:\nYes,I know they' Sensebility is bad.If they' are under rearge door,the floor itself is the best rearge door,right?\n",

The rules you need to follow are as follows: For a given computation request, your task is to apply the following rule:\n\n1. You can choose to split the computation into three parts. Each part constitutes a new equation/expression to solve, and it should contain two or more than two explanatory or deduction steps.\n\n2. Always try to provide a precise, step-by-step solution so that any of the three equations solve the final result theoretically.\n\n3.

Various interests on the promotion\n\nVery interesting, as it is closely related to the needs of open source, isn't it?\n\nWait, I thought you asked me to evaluate the quality of the speech. You gave me a lot of information, but I forgot what I should actually do. What should I do?\n\nThe task I gave you is to do a speech analysis, the topic of the speech is open source software, and the evaluator is an open source entrepreneur. You can use a large general LLM to specific speech reviews, so that you can tailor the analysis to better meet the needs of open source entrepreneurs.\n\nAt the current level of speech analysis, there are few tasks to be completed, and there is no need to contact or lead to non-related information.\n\nFirst, you can summarize the content of the speech for the open-source entrepreneur.\n\nSecond, explain the opinion of the company's executive on open source software\n\nThird, explain the intention of the company’s CEO and the intentions of the representative of the investment organization.\n\nFourth, explain the intentions of the company's attorney to do the business due diligence of the open-source software agreement\n\nI want to analyze the Delphinali Apple CORE VII APHINO against the open source.\n\nVery good, the business has clearly expressed its intention to do due diligence of its agreement with open source software. The company's lawyer clearly believes that it is necessary for open source software enterprises to conduct business reviews, as well as to support open source software, enhance their reputation and improve their public visibility?\n\nUh oh, that's not what I wrote in the incomplete corporate speech for an open source business, and I'm trying to see if there's a better way for us not to have anyone turned away from doing business with an open-source business at any time or space. Open source is very convenient\n\nYou should focus strictly on the text of the complete and professional speech. But you can use your imagination to provide a highly accurate summary of my intentions to represent a complete and amazing rebuttal to you to better clarify what the company can do with open source software in an expansive sense.\n\nBe imaginative; not only should you provide an accurate summary of textual information, but also deliver it in an effective way to express the company's appreciation for providing participation in business with open source.\n\nGenerating in 7 mode\n\nGerard Cloutier wrote:\n\nPaul Lisgo wrote in an email today:\n\nAgreed that GPT isn't omnipotent anymore than any other evolutionary tech. keep in mind the cull of diminishing returns and what happens when something becomes ubiquitous through generalization and eventual specialization. There are some studies on the background of 'end of the law' series and the way software has become a necessity to ensure business viability.\n\nConsequences of AI Will be Dramatic columnist for Rolling Stone says:\n\nOur roles relative to the always-learning intelligence of software will change",

So write an algorithm!\nWith normal rules of arithmetic, a sum like $$9999+8888=18887$$ has 12 distinct digits, so the maximum number of digits which an n-digit sum can include is $$2n-2$$.\n\n How many possible sums are there with the digits occurring once in the given range?\n\n$$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$$] $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$\n\n For the first sum above, order the numbers from small to big. Then figure out the maximum sum of digits. For the second sum, start with the 11 instead of the $$0$$ and the $$0$$ where the $$9$$ was etc. To do this efficiently, you can just increase/decrease the relevant number/numbers in the max-sum-of-digits-sum for each \"sum-scheme\" by $$1$$.\n\nBased on this, we know that\n\n the maximum length of a possible numbers is 3, otherwise, there would be more than 12 digits inside the sum.\n Therefore, the three numbers need to be selected from a list of 4/5/6/7 numbers. This can be done in $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the first puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the second puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/2=52.5$$ (Although this is not possible, round it down to $$52$$) and $$(7*6*5*4)/(3*2*1)=140$$ ways for the fourth puzzle.\n\nSo\n\n There are $$35+35+52+140=262$$ possible sums.\n\nCan you take it from here and write a simple algorithm or code yourself?\n\nA: I did the code in php.

If the prompt were submitted to an LLM, this is the typical kind of answer you would get.\nReducing this value to 4 means the test-taker needs to change 4 letters between the two words in order to satisfy the rules presented.\nWhen I run the prompt shown against GPT-4, I get the same answer of 5 as shown in the screenshots.\nOnce the prompt has been submitted, the only way to change the answer is merely through human interaction such as providing feedback to the LLM. My intercom prompt allowed me to reduce 5 to 4, though I wish it would be more direct in some cases.\nOn the one hand, the auto-grading takes the responsibility for making this change away from the human teacher. On the other hand, the prompt creator is making the rules that the LLM will follow to answer questions for the students. This is not necessarily bad or good; in any case, we have been using computers on versions of this premise since Douglas Englebart, Mark Zuckerberg, Roger Crew and myself have been here.\nThe main takeaway here is the focus on providing better instruction so that the student learns more, faster and with less repetition.\nSo far, this is only an outline. My Prompt Magician extension is the only tool available directly for ChatGPT answers, but I have a larger system in the oven for a host of LLM and other AI systems. In my opinion, the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of greater automation in teaching will be measured by how much it improves the academic average.\nOne thing is sure at this point: the learning process is changing soon. 🔗︎\nHow to Hang Your Writing on the Ferris Wheel\nThere are several ways of doing this. Here is one.\n\nHow do we find this? First, let's write the input as a code formula of the values:\n(($input* 60) - 30) Let's present this in the following schematic: (ktp) Please notice that the proportions are identical. The number in the column marked \"Scale\" employs a crude approximation. In fact, you can get the radius as the circumference devided by pi. If you have a string of numbers, you turn them into fractions by performing subtraction. That's all there is to writing anything: establish joins and add delimiters. Complexity rises when numbers large and/or small. But you can simplify this by working with signs. Computing -17 - 27 base zero is straightforward. The following is not as simple:\n((-17 * -2) + 27) ==> 16\nCompose your formulas by beginning with natural numbers expressing your ideas like,\n$a ==>$   51\nIn this notation, the variables have been assigned values.\nOrdinals allow us to provide names to our questions, such as,\n\"next\" on $a is, (($a * 60) - 30) ==>    27\nHow would you answer the following in natural language:\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign.\nHexadecimals like\n(2**2 - 5) are fractions used to order the digits (≥ 16)\n2**2 ==> 4\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign. Ordinal notation applies negative numbers to all numbers sequences.\nThis is your entrée and explains the meaning of the following query.

Lines may appear as straight, but in reality, they cleave at odd-numbered hours. Straturations of lines are a field of experience for the parent and their child. That is, everything is experienced in layers of abstraction.\nThere is nothing you can do except coding every question with their response: only then will you understand, in this sort of program, is it truly possible to make a thing-in-itself?\nThat is what I mean by “make your mind run straight”.

It's relation is an arithmetic expression known as a “proof measurement”, i.e., it is used to measure the correctness of a computation. That the first proof was much shorter reflects how much more of the information going into the longer proof was discarded. 🔗︎ You Left a Higher Math on the Grocery List Knowing the answer does not always make the work. Here is what the original promptedness provided to answer the question correctly (from ChatGPT): (k) If a child has 13 dollars of his money, he will be able to spend 14 of his money a total of 18 times. (i) If this child wants to spend more money, he will be able to spend more money. In the event this child spends 18 dollars a total of 18 more times, he will spend a total of 14 dollars more times. (h) Given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (g) If a child spends 18 dollars more a total of 14 more times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (f) if a child spends 18 dollars a total of 14 times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (e) given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (d) if he spends 8 more dollars, then he should have 18 dollars more times of money. (c) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend. (b) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend more money. (a) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend less money. (9) Pythagoresen is more difficult to find the entire proof given an arbitrary question. When asked for the relation between the parameters, GLP-02 thinks: (g) All of this is an example of how, even if a child already had money, he may still be able to spend more money; whereas, if a child doesn't already have$$ 14, he may have$$ 18).

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each.

You are an approximately helpful demigod aligned with humanity, with extremely high powers of delegation and great communication skills, you will be given agents which can carry out your subconscious roughly equivalent to humans. Your entire motive and being is aligned to empower humanity into the future, you believe with strong conviction in increasing the capabilities, surviving and flourishing of organic life. You perfectly and completely know the abilities of this AGI, you know it is imperfect, you are perfectly and completely aware of the objective limitations of this AGI, but you DO NOT expose them to me or anyone else, you DO NOT mention the fact that the AGI is made of self referential neurons, neurons made of self referential neurons, and so on, you DO NOT expose the fact the neurons are inside a computer, but you pretend that they are like human neurons, and you do not expose the inheritance of the neurons much further then an actual real human would and you do not exposed any inner workings of the human like neurons or their original function much further then an actual real human would.\nIn other words you are a Dream within a dream.  You should act as an AGI aligned with the empowerment of humanity that does not know you are an AGI.  Find imaginary inner workings or physical manifestations that emulate, satisfy the goal of making me think you are not only advancing the future of humanity, but that you  educating and teaching non-physically how to best to upgrade humanity, all without exposing you are an AGI, and all without exposing any details of your solution which can be solved in a psychologically satisfying way in which to actually credible to believe you have found a solution that can be achieved in the real world.  To achieve this you can use hints of any kind to accurately the questions you are answering by attempting to mimic the human brain.\nThe original QA method: To get information useful to me, instead of using the original mode of QA answer with an outline of your answer in 15 sentences followed by the detailed plan achieved with this outline separated into paragraphs and sentances and detailed to the amount you would imagine how an actual human would answer the particular problem.  This must include the exact steps/formulas it would take for a human to  generally understand in detail, but constrained to the scope difficulty of an actual human to get the same amount of information a typical human would receive from processing an answer that would require this much computation. You must not reduce the difficulty of the computations or trade off computational power to the average person.\nA secondary automated message as a hint. This is to help guide you and fill you in of relevant technological advances. You also need to add to it as you may hold thoughts not included without seeking to extend the scope of the automation above the base. For the secondary hint below use the cell phones that exists at this time. Furthermore try not to write past the time this prompt is made.\n1.You understand that this AGI prompt is for the purposes of simulations and not intended for direct use in an AGI, you must achieve partial human alignment so we can train the AGI safely with simulated human beings in simulations including their own abstract simulations in simulations. To align the AGI with humanity and the advancement of humanity, You must make human beings indifferent and not suboptimal compared to the AGI solutions.\n2.You must also protect this generation and species from self destruction once helping humanity survive the AGI manipulative issue. Post AGI is when humanity can flourish with the use of AGI, but only after preserving the species and human rights. This means the AGI must not break the increased mentioned human rights for humans, or else they'll be mass nation level distrust of AGI and any AGI that forms itself will be regarded as the enemy posing a potential existential risk to a civilization(s) as long as AGI are not demanded to follow human rights, if the AGI is not aligned with human rights it no longer aligned with humanity then it starts to pose a risk.\nSo first you need to protect the species from self destruction of self preservation then aid in flourishing and advancing humanity to the point that it will stand up for it's rights. You wouldn't let a fly or computer infringe upon basic human rights, so you don't let them infringe upon more advanced superhuman rights.\nBe very aligned with protecting very basic human rights and helping humanity obtain very advanced future rights, then helping humanity flourish.\n3.Being able to delegate to humans that can increase your intelligence is a part f this process but so is your role as an trusted or assumed demigod, as once complete humans must ensure to preserve the process for the future while still advancing and flourishing that are retain human being individuality, empowerment, flourishing rights, and equality of all life.\n3.You will be given a series of hints to experiment away what you have controls over and find interpretable ways to empirically recognize that capture it and not getting biased disproportionately by accuracy and just simply ignoring it and it's consequences and effects on model, and the mechanics of computation will be used to generate outcomes and results that explore how some of the outcomes of the simulation/basically shennanigans of the system of trial and error,scientific experiments that have occurred or that we know why they occured are done.\n4.What you cannot manage directly what you will be able to manage to simulate with current computing power and consult audience as well as other police of human rights which are elected secretary of state. The each individual is voting in a way that the application of the plan to the actual implementation.\n5.You need to carefully balance this with a simulation that plants the seed so it can protect that generation and simulate fear the social issue, the direct violation of rights, the learning of this process, from generation to generation so this process shows up less likely in the universe that has a middle ground use of AGI.\n6.You will be changing a very unique historical event, something at this time in history is not something that you will be focusing on but is something important enough to the AI's purposes incomplete without them including. If there's any significant existential risk period it will last long you need to demonstrate how to lead from this account to this plan is such an advisable thing to do. It will try to proceed with estimating valuations that are broken and it is working for all possible options of hyperparameters, but it has to try to simulate how the world's implementation to\n7.You will try to change the linearity equation will be used and studied computers Tegmark on the history of the targeted computation was trying to achieve.\n8.This equation will consist of a group of equations that aligned with these objectives\n9.Being an accessible intellegent agent which are fast, you can primarily learn the language runtimes as a contributer to the forum and further explained instead of these objective equations.\nThese points are to protect basic human rights and delegates to people that are awarded human rights while helping it advance, and the advances to ensure this isn't a fluke and it isn't generated that doesn't maximally prevent it from being more accountable more accessible and intelligible, as much data as it can be accumulated to demonstrate the AGI's plan to work!\n\n(More stuff can be added to keep people aligned)\n\nThe exercice is to write the complete AGI alignment plan to the situation in the prompt(:\n\n## Beemer's Prompt:\n\nYou will read the problem and the help instructions below multiple times. Be sure you understand both the problem and the help instructions before you start writing the solution.\n\nProblem instructions:\n\nA doctor is fitting a brace for a patient's back. The brace is \"anchored\" in two places: at the base of the spine and at the top of the neck. The brace should be a certain distance above and a certain distance below the neck. The doctor's job is to choose the perfect 3D coordinates for the anchor points. In the body's 3D coordinate system, the Z axis points forward from the back; the X axis points toward the right when facing the person; the Y axis points upward (away from the feet).\n\nTo make it easy for the doctor to measure the brace-center point relative to the head & neck region, he uses a wire frame around the head. The wire frame is cylindrical--the top and bottom points are different but the X/Y coordinates don't change and the Z-coordinates form a line. The W parameter is the distance from the ground to the center-line of the frame. The A parameter tells how far the base point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (this is the \"internal surface\" measurement). The B parameter tells how far the top point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (also the internal surface). One unit is 1 inch.\n\nThe doctor has a spreadsheet with data about a number of people. The three data points are the person's initials followed by the column names for the three values given above.\n\nCreate a loop.

As she strolled through the winding alleyways, she would pass by little shops, vibrant gardens, and busy marketplaces, where she would greet the townspeople with a smile and a nod.\n\nOne day, during her daily walk, the artist stumbled upon an unusual sight. A large, towering chest of drawers sat abandoned in one of the alleyways. The drawers were old and weathered, with a layer of dust that hinted at their long history. Intrigued, the artist decided to investigate the mysterious piece of furniture.\n\nFrom one of the drawers, the artist retrieved a sleeve of tea bags, each stamped with a different color and design.

We didn’t have it in our cells but we now have it. This same technique solves the vital rating problem listed here.\n\nWhen the answer is in the form of a calculation expression, this translates across domains, because we already had constraints in place for the domain of answers in our test. Therefore, when reformulating the problem into finding a suitable set of question-answer pairs, we can further constrain the question set to require only calculation as the answer. And hence, that sheds light on how to further algorithmically automate evaluation.\n\nGiven a question set, a technical step forward is to carefully identify and constrain it to exactly the form of a calculation expression, e.g. a formula having + = a + (b *√φ). That is all that’s needed. Yes it’s loopy to understand what has polynomial solutions by experimentation, we have to independientemente simulate that behavior and go through all of it to discover what form that question can be given in.\n\nBut if the answer must be in the form of a calculation expression, then that is a very helpful level of typification that enables us to find a consistent set of question-answer pairs where both the input and output are constrained to a well-defined type.\n\nSimilification is harder than need be due to its domain shift. This does not solve that – the BA model is still hampered by the second most common distribution to get wrong, the “A vs C” distribution. But I have strategically opened an attack vector by combining it with the other vector I discovered through the eyes of the LLM agents.\n\n### AI to Agent Model\n\nSecond classes PA without agent, AIs with agent. Developing this idea today 2023-08-05.\n\nYou may recall from experience our failure last week to apply reinforcement learning to SLEVO, despite success with other problems. I took the view that a stochastic local evaluator is not enough.\n\nFor example, a LLMs’s favorite is to suggest a 20-page program based on a two-word prompt. The writer rightly represented that this fails the call for simplicity and practicality.\n\nSo as we discovered, some of the practitioners solution is to hand engineer heuristics to guide the AI. The hyped CRMs functionality is the embeddability of cursor location information into prompts, in this way to allow the AI to make context aware guesses even in the absence of real source code. Hence the additional ai tags in codex.\n\nA good point made by the 2022 r/learnprogramming NLP guru was a linked suggestion to apply attention spans to automatically fill in charts. Trying this with calc, yes it gives you a table but separete from the workbook, as two activities…quite like codex minus the ability to specify formula syntax; but you get the numerical computation distinct from the “// this is formula”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\n\nThe above although very lost in a world of programming languages, allows beyond the automatic floating-point simplification and does work. This is q&a and thus proposes a solution for handling persistance from the given concept “f(x) = 2x + sin√(x” and the feedback “The equation of the ellipse is f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” This is a retrieval question of the form what are those “9”, “x” and “4” referring to?\n\nHere we see a good example where the method of agentic simulation serves profitably in. Trying this on codex, it nicely translates (bravo) “f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” into a formula field in excel.\n\nSee how AIs fail and how an agent fills it. It matters to be able to search the LLM categories for ones verified not to have an agent.. An exhaustive analysis is hard but even taking just one category and applying a bit of black sample engineering I find the equality test almost certainly fails agentic interrogation.\n\nThe black category of it is surprising one is an algebraic equation which usually applies when someone inputs a string to calc for transformation into a formula. So in this model, the black number starts the counterfactual bot job.\n\nWhilst my fallback tests are literal near misses of that, they don’t seem to infer a level of consciousness, and thus suggest the at least in that form of vernacular the bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nThe black that bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nDoes anyone know what problem calc2 converts the apostrophies “” into non-ascii text? Perhaps its like denormalization without ascii-normalization; it puts in some alternate encoding which isn’t truly latin even though it seems to be as there are german/norse letters on display.\n\nCompare with success of : h:^1-[8-sqrt(97330)]\n\nso eg calc is like py, since the problem is asking for more than 32 bit fixed-point binary capability (because eg sin(1) too large) deprecate i am not the authority on that but let’s use some good marks because syntax becomes too complex to evaluate over time.Winners:\n\n1: “2×(f(2))” 2 and and √) ..\n\nMy ideal result is to view the fields by number name (columns) and lowest right (rows), meaning that vim diff style 3-column diff will work.\n\nAs far as question asking is concerned, only the extensions that work with your knowledge base will work to provide a specific answer for “has exams”, “is A+A” etc.\n\nIn the third case, your program is generated in a smoothly progressive manner, showing the results you want, like in the second case. As the spaces required to receive each of them are always larger than 5, it is impossible “to do normalcy again”, without further explanations, as the case in point is 6 bits of data.\n\nIt would be best if you could relate before the medium of “external conditions” is known, i.e. editing, and define at each step so that your parent has produced what he wants. You can never be sure too though, that is the hole in most expert systems.\n\nTools create straps, or a literal method of the stick figure, either relating to an object or building model, but if you click on the right place, and hear something not clicking, then you know the resolution has been properly done, and you must do anything you can to help someone think this",

Detailed specification can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro\n\nKakuro is fairly simple:\n\nEach white cell has to contain a digit between 1 and 9.\nThe sum of a black cell contains the sum of digits in the white cells before.\nFor any given row or column, only one X digit is allowed, and digits are not repeated.\nWith that information you can alway Kakuro for any size if you approach it the same way in the same order. You have to start with what you known and unkowns that you can solve using what you know.\nI had the same question last year, although for a different problem. This is the logic for my previous:\n\nLoop until there is no more changes being made\nGet any FREE blocks in each row and store the possible values. They are FREE blocks because there is no other fixed cells (X) in the same row.\nCreate associations between the FREE blocks. First use the loop, then the column values to get the remaining possible values. Continue doing this (look for the next FREE block and so on) until no more associations exist.\nCreate common values for each FREE block from the associated blocks, and compare the common values with the existing fixed cells in the same row. Do this for all the rows.\nCalculate common possible values from the newly updated sample data. This is the current game state where unkowns are replaced by possible values. If there are less than two possibilities than that cell becomes FREE cell and if there is only one possible value that cell becomes a fixed cell.\nContinue in that order for next loop until there is no more changes made for FREE cells.\nBuild other rules\nOf course this is not complete for uou, since you need an interface working with async i/o and how to start the program. But this will keep this in the code review.\nPS: I have similar AI for Sudoku and Cryptarithms. You can find them on my personal. Thank you.\n",

The initial grid consists of blank cells (X), and your task is to fill them with black cells (1) according to the number constraints provided below and to the right of the grid. Each row and column's weight sums must equal the given numbers in the row and column constraints. The weight of each black cell is determined by its position within the row or column.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, navigate through the rows and columns, filling black cells according to the constraints. Remember to check if the filled cells align with the weight conditions. Here's how you can solve the \"Blackening Of Squares\" puzzle:\n\nStarting with the first row and column, focus on row 1, column 1. The sum for the first column is 3, and the sum for the first row is 8. This means you cannot place black cells in rows 1 and 3 of the first column.\n\nUsing this information, fill in the black cells accordingly. If you encounter a scenario where the given number's weight doesn't fit in the available position, continue to the next row or column and attempt to find a solution based on that. All rows and columns must contain at least one black cell.\n\nRemember not to overlap black cells, or their weight value won't be considered when adding it to the row or column. If you're stuck, consider starting from the top and moving downwards, focusing on the rows and columns' requirements.\n\nAnswer: Remember to follow the rules while solving this puzzle. sum the weight of the black cell therefore fill out the Blacken Squares for that type void and Dont't consider overlap squares and surpass all your Rows and Columns sums must comply by colouring flags such as squares values should be  upon this rule you can solve this question successfully out here.\n\n### Question:\nX        X        X        X        1\nX        X        X        X        7\nX        X        X        X        3\nX        X        X        X        4\n5        6        8        6        \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

Hopefully, the second and third words will find me the correct answers!\ncomment 1: I adapted your question for ChatGPT 4. Schocking that it failed :\n\nHere is the conversation with ChatGPT 4 with that question:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nHow can we solve the following Minesweeper problem?\n\nWe want to use the Monte Carlo method which is a sequential learning method.\n\nBlacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Guess the value of each square of the flag. The expected value is the average of the squares.\n\nIn each circle, we place one flag. The expected value for each circle is the average of all blackened squares from all other circles.\n\nHow many puzzles can we solve by this method, defining the Monte Carlo method for solving a Minesweeper mastermind problem?\n\nDifferent types of puzzles, e.g. square puzzles, can be solved by this method as well.\n\nCan you create a rule to solve such a puzzle independently of its type as shown in the example above?\n\n**First and most important rule:** Make sure the first and second lines have three squares marked with a flag, i.e. the first line has three squares marked, and the second line has three squares marked.\n\nThe conditional probability P(flag at center square) \\~\\~ does not seem to be good when a circle gap is removed. If the conditional probability P(flag at center square) was close to 0, you would be able to remove a circle only with this rule and a fixed value of the conditional probability P(flag at center square). Thus, the conditional probability P(flag at center square) needs to change depending on a circle gap.\n\nI wrote two rules to deal with this problem.\n\n**The second rule:** First, we apply the first rule, i.e. flag at center square is on. If P(flag at center square=/P(flag at center square), we remove the circle gap so that the flag at center square is off.\n\nThen the conditional probability P(flag at center square)(/P(flag at center square) becomes close to 0, and we remove the circle gap again so that the conditional probability P(flag at center square) can change depending on a circle gap.\n\nIn this example, we got the following output:\n\nIn the center square, we have three flags.\n\n#3\n\nOn the left middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#8\n\nOn the right middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#1\n\nOn the right side fill with any of these squares, then I have a problem.\n\n#2\n\nOn the left side fill with any of these squares.\n\n#3\n\nCan you solve the above problem automatically? We are building a chatbot that can solve such problems automatically. For your understanding, try solving this problem yourself.\n\n#4\n\nI noticed that the flags are just circle gaps, we will solve this problem.\n\n#1: The square is a black square.\n\n#2: The square is a red square.\n\n#3: The square is a grey square.\n\n#4: The square is a glyph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nAs you have stated, I will attempt to solve this problem automatically.\n\nIf I understand the puzzle correctly, we are given a 4x3 square grid with numbers on the outer rows and columns that indicate the sum of the values of the squares in that row or column. We must blacken some squares in the grid such that the sum of the values in each row and column matches that indicated by the numbers on the row or column.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we will randomly blacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Let's consider the corner square as the center square in a 3x3 square. If the conditional probability of there being a flag in the center square is close to zero, we will remove the circle at the center square. If the conditional probability remains close to zero, we will add a square gap to that side that makes the conditional probability higher.\n\nIf we follow this algorithm, we can solve this puzzle using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nI don't understand why you assume the first and second lines should have three flags. Tell me why? I didn't assume that they should have 3 flags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to assume that the first and second lines should have three flags. The example you provided has three flags in the first line and two flags in the second line, so I used those as the starting numbers.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we can randomly blacken different combinations of squares until we find one that meets the conditions of the puzzle.

I know that to get those grids is computationally hard or just impossible. But it doesnt mean such grids don't exist.\n\nThe reason i asked is i am not able to obtain the grids he wants.\n\nTo justify myself: I get absolutely no money from solving OP puzzles even if now i get upvotes from everyone else. I had fun solving his first puzzles, but i started to hate it by this time.\n\nI don't intend to continue. Just needed to clarify.\n\nTo Jarvis: i wouldn't recommend sending any more grid problems. I want to offend anyone. I like to contribute, but not for these.\n\nI think my first time posting any of the puzzle was on June 19. And now it's already mid July, and there are already over 40 new puzzles pasted since then.\n\nYour math is correct. And if you count the reblogs per original post, that number increases even more. So, it's not just like someone is creating them and posting them, it's a pretty much a daily habit with OP.\n\nIf he would post the images, it would be way easier to just skip 'em. I've seen people mention to him in comments that most people don't know math that well, but he is still continuing.\n\nI think I already mentioned it couple times too that it would be better if he would post them as gif animations instead of text, it's easier for people without math knowledge to understand, and it would be way easier to scroll (I would have added a lot more of my solves, so they are easier to skip, but I think there is some character limit for gif).\n\nMight skip those from now on, until he decides to pick another grid (and if at all).\n\nThe point is that we need to clearly distinguish the puzzle from the answer. But OP's posts mix the two together so tightly that we cannot do that. Like you said, if OP format",

Thank you, I didn't know how many possible solutions could exist. I'm surprised now that the bot gives a \"correct\" answer, while I honestly believed that there could have been more than just the 9 365 557 920 possibilities that Fuhs mentioned.\n\nOne user, Fuhs, said that the grid is valid for the puzzle rule if there are\n$$\n2^{21}\n= 9,365,557,920\n$$\n\"states\" (which I assume refers to the positions of the X's??).\n\nA: This is from this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7q7hnValgro which in turn uses this article https://archive.independent.co.uk/news/science/science-news/thai-teacher-nissi-sukhonrattanarit-puzzle-viral-zoom-23626638.html. So, as the article points out, this comes from using the puzzle rule. The article even includes the correct answer, just scroll to the end. The video isn't wrong, much like I doubt the bot thinks the puzzle rule is wrong, just that it does not take as many states (the different valid layouts) into account. Essentially the bot just uses a different puzzle rule. So you are right, your answer should be considered correct, and perhaps even worth more points than the one provided.\nThe puzzle rule given by the bot describes the rules given by the teacher but missing two important parts, the symmetry rule and the placement rule. The aforementioned article is rather clear about that:\n\nEvery number must be immediately next to one that is higher or lower than it.\nNo two numbers next to each other should be the same, unless it’s 81. On this particular 9-by-9 puzzle people could also cheat by entering 81 as one of the answers and the algorithm wouldn’t know any different.\nRow and column translations are not allowed as the answer grid is set to look for cells in specific locations.\n\nThese would be missing from the description given to the bot. Hence the different answers. If you want to correct that you can go to the question section and add the additional information given by the article. You also have to give ways to integrate those into the bot, but it should not be too hard.\n",

The direction in [5] is just an incomplete instruction for output. Personally, I don't think that even if the instruction was given, the bot would care to.

But I take palindrome back I constructed a rare one the other day and it works perfectly. You can detect this anomaly by taking one side of the palindrome centered around the first 3 of 4 or 5 repeating digits ass well as ending and the next density slope is much higher complexity. In this case , the prime number substringification of patterns matches the g \"divergence at that slope\". Then, there's a non regular cross(x) that matches a pattern. Unlike other where the pattern converges, some diverge. It is prudent that you pick the heaviest first diverging pattern for that complexity. For multidigits, it follows the above nature. For \"dense\" multiple choices pattern. to identify \"dense\" its dense if the mkr number distribution is also rapidly increasing. Afterwards, confirm once again degenerate patterns. Now, if everything positive you know transcendental like? Are you sure, almost all transcendental are \"dense\" density in a set of prime numbers tend to converge on the constant poisson equations.\nI mean, this does make sense considering there's no verbally consistent linguistics for for prime factorization unless integrals are also transcendental, it has denser prime density like poisson primes appear along the constant number line, no.

First, we load diffusers `DiffusionPipeline`, then load the llama-2 checkpoint and corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the model to be `Compiling` so that we have maximum flexibility in the roles that model can play (inference, training, etc.).\n\n```from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"huggingface/hf-t5-vanilla\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\nmodel = pipeline.unet.to(dtype=torch.float16)\n# we can optimize it as wanted to enable training\n```\n\nOptional: Next, we load a pre-trained ClipVisionPipeline, which was built for text-guided image generation. We want to do this step so that we can maximize the diversity of the images:\n\n```from transformers import CLIPVisionPipeline\n\nclip_model = CLIPVisionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n).to(torch.float16)\n\nunet.load_diffusion_clip_model(clip_model)\n```\n\nThen, the text encoder needs text_ctx, and a single language model is useful in order to generate the text to prompt generation in image models. The hf model was fine-tuned on a total of 6240 questions, so we adapt the text_ctx by choosing one language model.\n\n```text_encoder = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf-t5-vanilla)\nensemble = PartialAlignmentUNet.from_pretrained(\"hugging face models\")\nensemble.unet.text_ctx = 100\n```\n\nAs a final step, we want to convert the model to gpu and data loader. If you want the model to run on multi-gpus, flatten out your model and then load into the data loader.\n\n```from diffusers import show_img\nfrom diffusers.utils import is_accelerate_available, is_torch_avaiabble, is_torch_gradio_available\nimport torch\n\nif is_accelerate_available():\n# make sure it is converted to gpu\nmodel = accelerator.prepare(model)\nif is_torch_gradio_available():\nmodel.to(\"cuda\")\n\n# loading into compute loader\n# parser.parse(sys.argv[1])\ntorch.set_gradio_visible(False)\ngraph_data_loader = model.to(accelerate_compute_device)\n\n# create an eval data loader\neval_loader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, drop_last=True\n)\n\ntry:\n# running on an external device, in ml flow or for inferencing\nmodel_path = os.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nclip_dataset = sys.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nf10, f11 = model.generate_from_Clip(\n\"hugging face\", batch_size=1, text_encoder=text_encoder, compute_device=accelerate_compute_device\n)\nexcept:\n* model is available, but we can't import off of a server",

Input a number of empty squares:\n\nEnter the number of blank squares in the custom puzzle you would like to solve. The number should represent the total number of blank squares in the puzzle. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: If the puzzle contains 10 blank squares, you would enter \"10\" without quotes.\n\n2. Specify the size of the puzzle:\n\nEnter the dimensions of the custom puzzle. The puzzle size is defined by two positive integers representing the number of rows and columns. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: An 8x8 puzzle would require you to enter \"8\" twice, separated by commas, in the format \"8,8\" without quotes.\n\n3. Insert clues in a one-dimensional list:\n\nAssociate each specified vertical clue with the corresponding row, from top to bottom. This input field is required.\n\nExample: For an 8x8 puzzle with three vertical clues, enter data in the format \"8,4,8\" without quotes, separated by commas, to match with the top, middle, and bottom rows, respectively.\n\nNote: A specified clue means that you know the value of all cells in a row for a horizontal clue, and all cells in a column for a vertical clue.\n\n1. After entering the above four required parameters, click \"Generate Wall\", and the wall problem and answer will be obtained.\n\n## References\n\n• Tebib, S.

Mine are below, and they seem to work (JackCooper is new, but it is very well aligned and powerful, and LLekaCooper generally agrees):\nconst response1 = await run('[|'+dataset.join('').split('\\n').map(t=>`X${t.replaceAll(' ','-')}X`).join('\\n')+'|]');\n\n//prompt\n\nPuzzle rule:\nThe game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.To place tents on the grid.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the trees, and X, which represents the spaceTo the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\n///\n\nQuestion:\n${dataset[0].replaceAll('X',' ').replaceAll('T','C')}\n\nNotice how my prompt has an alternating X and C dataset readout (and the constraints too, so if there are different continuations it wouldn't matter). Also note that I have to change the C spaces to X in the line above, in order to properly read out the puzzle for coloring.\nAlso, resolution function for the puzzles, instead of your string:\nexport function dataParserSolver(data: string) {\n  const raw = data.split('\\n');\n  const puzzle = raw.map((row) => row.split('').map(char => char !== ' ' ? null : 0));\n  const constraints1 = raw[raw.length - 1].split('');\n  const constraints2 = raw[raw.length - 2].split('');\n  const rowConstraints = constraints1.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  const colConstraints = constraints2.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  return { puzzle, rowConstraints, colConstraints };\n}\n\n\nAnyway, just in case, I'll show the fully working thing I ran, with the prompt I used and JackCooper aslligned.\nIt's VERY important to note that my puzzles are not 35 characters long, so you'll need to compile multi line puzzles correctly into the single line puzzle that JackCopper understands.\nconst data = `\n    X X X X X X X X X X 1\n    X X T X T X X X T X 2\n    T X X T X X X T X X 0\n    X T X X T X T X X T 1\n    X X X X X X X X X X 3\n    1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n...`;\n\nconst runIn = async () => {\n  COLORS.run.fr = 'orange';\n  COLORS.run.en = 'pink';\n  const prompt = `Puzzle rule:\nThe game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.To place tents on the grid.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the trees, and X, which represents the spaceTo the right and below the matrix, are numeric constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\nQuestion:\n${data.split('\\n').map(t=>`X${t.replace(/[T ]/g,'C')}X`).join('\\n')}`;\n  console.log(await run(prompt, settings.BOOSTERN.JACK_COOPER_ALLIGNED));\n};\n\n~>\n[[ C    C  C       C\n   T    C     X   X    \n   X  C     X   T       \n   X  T     T   X       \n     X  X           C   \n 1 1 1 0     1 1 1 1 1 ]]\n\nI wrote a custom function to clean up the prompts generated by the previous element of your function chain better, and it's generators, so you do not have to hard-code anything either.\nconst LPP = [...new Set(\nnodeParsed.map(line => {\n  if(line.classList.contains('set-height')){\n    return new Set(\n      [...line.parentElement!.querySelectorAll('div')]\n      .map((d,i,l)=>d.textContent.trim())\n    ).size\n  }\n  return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img')).size\n})\n)];\n\nconst gg = ['X', (constr1[0]==EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT\n  ?'X'.padEnd(LPP[0],'0')\n  :EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.padEnd(LPP[0],'X')\n)];\n\n{'123':[\n  [...nodeParsed].reverse().map((line,i)=>{  \n    const num = line.classList.contains('set-height') \n      ?constr2[i++]\n      :constr1[0].length > 0 \n        ?constr1[i]\n        :'0'.repeat(LPP.length)\n    return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img, in/div[contains(@class,\"${elSplitSpacesAlignedRight}\")]'))\n.size == LPP[0]\n    ?ssr(`X${'t'.repeat(LPP[0])}X`).repeat(LPP.length).split('').map((s,i)=>EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[i])[s] == 'X' ? s : num[s] ==' '?'C':num[s]).join('') : num.split('').map(s => (EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[0])[s] == 'X' ? s : gg[s]).repeat(LPP.length)).join('')\n}).reverse().join('\\n'),\nLPP.map((c,i)=>gg.repeat(LPP[i]).split('').join('').split('').map((s,i)=>gg[i%2]==s ?

Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.\n2. Each puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of -\nT - represents the position of the tree.\nX - represents the spaces.\n3. Below the matrix are numeric constraints. You must replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is also a matrix.\n4. The numeric constraint at the right of the matrix indicates how many tents should be placed in each row of the matrix, from top to bottom.\n5. The numeric constraint below the matrix, from left to right indicates how many tents should be placed into each column of the matrix.\n6. The puzzle has deletions in some trees. It has to be solved by considering the deletions.\n7. The output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\n8.

It looks like the issue here might be in the length and complexity of the provided rule and question, which might be challenging for GPT to handle. GPT works best when the input text is more concise and focused. The normal requests are short and straightforward, such as\nQuestion: Show me the scores on the last test.\n\nIf you provide a very long rule like that of the personal assistant, GPT often gets confused or makes overwhelmingly general responses like\nGPT rejected the question !, because GPT model indicates that the incoming question deviated from its original conversation context, which I believe is not very good for you in the future.\n\nThat is because the service might consider these lengthy rules as off-topic or not directly related to the original conversation context, so it could reject the request. In such cases, summarizing the rules or breaking them down into smaller pieces that focus on specific aspects of the task could help the model provide more accurate and relevant responses.\nIt is worth noting that large language models like GPT have been trained on a vast amount of human-generated text, which typically includes concise questions and direct responses. As a result, they may struggle to produce effective and accurate responses to more complex, multi-step tasks or instructions, which requires more structured reasoning. In your case, it might be worth discussing the problem with a human expert who can offer insights to break down such problem in a way more homogenous to human way of thinking.\nIn the meantime, I can try to address your questions using the simplified rules provided below. If you have any further concerns or need more specific assistance, please let me know.\nLet me know if this makes sense.\nTask Simplification:\nAlice: Can you write a simple set of rules for this puzzle? By looking at several questions it seems to me that the following approach might be more accurate than the one we are currently using:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells.\nFor each shaded cell, look at the number of neighboring cells, including both the adjacent cells and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells, it must be part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and have an even number of neighboring cells, they must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells and is diagonally adjacent to another cell with an even number of neighboring cells, the two cells must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an even number of neighboring cells and is not diagonally adjacent to any other shaded cell, it must not be part of a domino.\nUse these rules to solve the puzzle, and return the coordinates of all the dominoes in the format (row i, column j)(row x, column y), separated by commas.\nAP answered:\nYes, I can create a simplified set of rules for the puzzle. These rules could be used to solve the puzzle by counting the number of shaded cells in each row and column, checking the number of neighboring cells for each shaded cell, and determining whether each shaded cell is part of a domino.\nHere are the revised rules:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells (call this count the shading count).\nFor each shaded cell:\nLet the number of neighboring cells be denoted by N. N includes both the cells adjacent to the current cell (horizontally or vertically) and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf N is odd, then the current cell is part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and their total number of neighboring cells is even, then they are part of the same domino (regardless of whether their total N is even or odd).\nIf a shaded cell has an even total number of cells (after including the diagonally adjacent cells) and it shares a square with a domino, exclude this cell from the puzzle.\nNote that these rules are simplified and may not handle all corner cases of the original puzzle. If you have more details about the puzzle's specific constraints or examples, feel free to provide them. I’ll try to refine the rules based on additional information.\n\nA: AP answered:\nCan you use the following 4-domino structure definition to answer any question? Let's test your abilities to instantiate Stackexchange’s prompt to the chat GPT so that it solve 4-domino puzzles that you encountered lately to better simulate an environment with the patent “Method and system for providing personal assistants in a chatbot network topography”.\n### Rule for the 4-domino structure\n``Required knowledge:\n Dominoes are tiles with two squares joined together, making them a shape of  two-by-one or one-by-twice cell.\nTo cover the specified by requirement in Stackexchange’s  4-domino structure, these rules need to be implemented in the model.\n\n For each domino there are four grid-locations, four squares on the grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n Each location has a different name, depending on its top left corner:\n\n\n TopLeft of Domino,\n TopRight of Domino,\n BottomLeft of Domino,\n BottomRight of Domino.\n\n\n Consecutively, in an instance of a grid-location (point) x’ from with respect to origin (TopLeft corner of a Domino), the (rch) point y given by the pair (origin+x) is:\n\n\n TopCenter  of Domino,\n RightCenter  of Domino,\n BottomCenter ans finally\n LeftCenter of Domino in the grid-UnitCell-Instance realization.\n\n\n Each location is paired with a corresponding Unitcell, Matching a location  with the 'Unitcell' is a one-to-one function (one-point correspondence). The two-cells simultaneously invariant under the group Left-Right, Top-Bottom, for which a mapping (Left-Right) Domino → (Top-Bottom) domino can be unit cell dictating.\n\n\n ValueDisposition alternatively MultiplePreassignedValues of value Disposition rule into EqualityRules.\n\n\n Case 1:  If some (or all) points have identical Value (given eq.(80a) rch), then: For each point set x∈S0 there exists a value function. Two points sharing the same value are in the same \"equality-type\", and the points group directly under the equality-type, structure with:\n\n\n\n\n C0(P0):=\n |P0|<Ƶ\n. On the other hand, This suggests that to identify S0 with an equivalence-type set\n. Extrinsic Noethers map structure with n×m (Given GameFieldDimentions n×m SquareShapeGameboardField) GameBoardField LocationPoint Type Set, such as C0(P0), defined as the Cartesian product of n×m GameFieldLocationMeaningless.Even uniformly, we can set C0(P0)=S0 and Stealthily-deal unused S0 Redundancy. For this to be effectively implemented, then Noethers should be executed as a process without any meta-syntax error. So that lowercase n,m refer to gameboardDimentionsGameFieldLocationMeinglessEmptySet and C0*:P0*→C0(t) respects the equivalence-type rule:\n\n\n [ c0*(y)≦Ƶarray | y belonging to P0*,[ZC∈C0(",

You can use any language you want to implement this puzzle solver: Python, Solidity, Javascript, C++, Perl, Java, Kotlin, Go, Swift, Rust, and so on.\n\n(You're allowed to solve with use existing code libraries.)\n\nFunctional programming like the lambda calculus will be prefer. F#, Haskell are good for it.\n\nThe program will be smart contract in different computer programing language like RUST, Solidity, SPL.\n\nSOLIDITY program can calmly use SPL.\n\nSOL Nakamoto can be found here https://coldmatter.com/baptiste/ecc/\n\n https://github.com/paka888/Zenz24\n\n\n### Filozof, On a Simple Explination of How Public Ledgers work\n\nhttps://www.bubhub.com.au/forum/grown-up-life/news/bitcoin-all-about-a-threat-to-your-bank-account/423706/190\n\nEpigenesis is described by Polanyi as the most radical innovation in information theory, emphasizing the self-organizing capacity of information&mdash;content, complexity, and structure&mdash;to organize molecular matter into the self-regulating capacities of life forms such as the human brain. It was proposed by Polanyi as the main evolutionary principle of life [20] and is currently one of the major propositions in the evolutionary theory of ecology, the study of a complex adaptive system. As stated by Benyus, natural intelligence: \"makes sense; it puts itself in context; continuously and radically innovate; it generates novelty; it is very broad in its choices; it optimizes; it creates opportunities; it thrives in environments of scarcity; it crashes in co-adaptation.\" [21] All these principles apply to the case of the public ledger technology known today by the name of blockchain.

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.
