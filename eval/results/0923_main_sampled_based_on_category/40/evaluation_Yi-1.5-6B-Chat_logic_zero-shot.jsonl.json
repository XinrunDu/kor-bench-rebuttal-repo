(~p1 &p2) =::>(p1 =p3)\n\nThis formula can be broken down into two parts:\n\n- Part A: (~p1 &p2)\n- Part B: (p1 =p3)\n\nThe compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented by p1 =::>p2, and \"p1 if and only if p3\" is represented by p1 =p3.\n\n**Part A Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p2 | Formula Evaluation\n----------------------------------\n1   | 1   | ~(1 & 1) = ~1 = 0 (F)\n1   | x   | ~(1 & !x) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | 1   | ~(!x & 1) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | x   | ~(!x & !x) = ~0 = 1 (T)\n```\n\n**Part B Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p3 | Formula Evaluation\n-------------------------------\n1   | 1   | (1 = 1) = 1 (T)\n1   | x   | (1 = !x) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | 1   | (!x = 1) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | x   | (!x = !x) = 1 (T)\n```\n\nThe \"if... then\" compound proposition \"p1 =::>p2\" requires p1 to be true for p2 to be true. Hence, when p1 is true and p2 is false, Part A evaluates to false (F) for assignments (1, x) and (x, 1), and when p1 and p2 are both true, Part A evaluates to true (T) for assignment (x, x).\n\nFor Part B, \"p1 if and only if p3\" requires p1 and p3 to have the same truth value. Hence, when p1 and p3 are both true or both false, Part B evaluates to true (T). When they have different truth values, Part B evaluates to false (F).\n\nTherefore, the truth values and falsity values are:\n```\n[[F:x|x, x|1;T:x|x, x|1, 1|1]]\n```\n\nNote: The explanation provided is a manual combinatorial analysis approach. For more complex formulas, a systematic approach or automated tools could be used to simplify and evaluate the truth and falsity values more efficiently.",

The paired conjunctive terms can be denoted as m0 to m15, where the subscript is the binary representation of the corresponding hexadecimal number.\n\nA formula is a basic formula if it contains m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form. For an all-even formula, the index i of the paired conjunctive term must be even. The even indices in hexadecimal are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. Therefore, the corresponding binary numbers are 0000, 0010, 0100, 0110, 1000, 1010, 1100, 1110.\n\nAmong the 16 paired conjunctive terms, the ones with binary indices 0000 (0), 1010 (A), and 1100 (C) correspond to the even indices in hexadecimal. These correspond to the paired conjunctive terms m0, Ma, and Mc.\n\nSince a formula must contain m0 to be a basic formula, and we are only considering the all-even formulas, we have 3 possible formulas that satisfy both conditions:\n\n- m0 (corresponding to the conjunction of all propositional variables being true)\n- Ma (corresponding to the conjunction of alternating propositional variables being true)\n- Mc (corresponding to the conjunction of all but one propositional variable being true)\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy both the conditions of being a basic form and an all-even form is 3.\n\nThe answer is [3].",

This occurs when the propositions are transposed incorrectly during logical reasoning, leading to an invalid conclusion. In this specific case, the relationship between the \"less than\" (R) operation is being transposed between the universal quantifiers (∀x and ∃y), which results in a contradiction because ∀x∃yR(x, y) correctly states the property of natural numbers that there is no largest number, while ∃y∀xR(x, y) incorrectly concludes the existence of a largest number. The logical error comes from incorrectly transferring the properties from one type of quantifier to another, leading to a false conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is G (IllTrans Method).",
