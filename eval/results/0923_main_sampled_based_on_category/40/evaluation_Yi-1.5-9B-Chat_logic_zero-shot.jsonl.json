Their negations are ¬p, ¬q, and ¬r, respectively.\n\nThe given expression can be simplified as follows, since (¬p ^ q ^ r) and (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) share a common factor of ¬p:\n\n- (¬p ^ ¬q ^ r) ∨ (¬p ^ q ^ r)\n- Simplify using distribution: ¬p ^ (¬q v q) ^ r\n- Since ¬q v q is a tautology (law of excluded middle), it simplifies to ¬p ^ TRUE ^ r, which simplifies to ¬p ^ r\n\nNow, we need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in the simplified expression, ¬p ^ r. The propositional variables in this expression are ¬p and r, with their respective negations being p and ¬r. However, the expression ¬p ^ r does not include all propositional variables and their negations.

The actual classification of the expression based on the simplified form ¬p ^ r is not a paired conjunctive term but rather falls under a basic formula if considered in the context of the fully expanded form it came from, since it is true for one specific combination of truth values of its variables (¬p is true, p is false, and r is true).\n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms: None]; [denoted: mE (but not truly fitting the definition in this context due to the simplification)]]\n\nThis answer nuances the direct application of the rules to acknowledge that while the hexadecimal E could be assigned based on the true binary value after simplification, the term does not fit the definition of a paired conjunctive term as it stands.

Apply the P-Generalization rule:\n   - According to the rule, if k individuals in the sample possess attribute A (in this case, having an AQI below 50), where k < n, then we can infer that approximately k/n proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute A.\n\n3. Calculate the proportion:\n   - Using the formula provided by the P-Generalization rule: Pr(A) ≈ k/n\n   - Substitute the values: Pr(A) ≈ 4/5\n\n4. Convert the proportion to a percentage:\n   - Multiply the proportion by 100 to get the percentage: (4/5) * 100%\n\n5.
