Extensively research the topic at hand if necessary to provide detailed answers.\n2. Ensure your responses are concise and relevant to the question or statement.\n3. Demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter by incorporating additional information that supports your response.\n\n### Question:\nEXPLANATION:\nIn Final Fantasy VII, the Guardian Force Palom/Maroda is a rare and powerful summon that grants immense damage against biomechanical enemies. To fully harness its power, it's crucial to deal substantial damage of any element to one of the summon's allies for each consecutive enemy it summons. The summons themselves deal significant elemental damage with their ranged abilities, but their primary strength lies in their defensive aspects. Palom/Maroda transforms allies into defensive forms that absorb as much as 9999999 damage via various elements, providing unrivaled defensive capabilities.\n\nHow is Palom/Maroda effectively utilized?\n\n### Answer:\nClaim: Palom/Maroda should be summoned when dealing significant damage of any element to its one of allies.\nEvidence 1: Palom/Maroda becomes stronger with each consecutive enemy it summons.\nExtra claim: After dealing significant damage, Palom/Maroda will summon more enemies with increased damage, granting a higher chance of further elemental damage leading to more summons. This chain reaction can turn Palom/Maroda into a powerful damage-dealing ally.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nRevise the claim and evidence as necessary to provide a more comprehensive and accurate explanation. Ensure that the supporting claim complements the evidence rather than contradicting it. Avoid highlighting contradictory evidence where possible. If a contradictory piece of evidence cannot be avoided, acknowledge it and discuss how it contributes to the overall understanding of the topic.\n\nLogic trap: Confirmation bias: Confirmation bias occurs when one selectively seeks out evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence. Keep an open mind when evaluating statements and evidence provided, and ensure that your revisions do not demonstrate confirmation bias.\n\n### After understanding the claim, **provide new revisions (if any) according to the provided instructions.**\n\"\"\"\n\nuse_what_i_learned = \"\"\"\n### Task Description:\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in research, multitasking, and context-rich language understanding.

When breaking down the statements into dedicated areas of knowledge, try to ensure that you do not duplicate formatting between areas. Keep the tone and perspective of the originating text in mind when addressing additional topics.\n3. Refrain from generating explanations related to individual statements within these dedicated areas. Focus on providing comprehensive overviews and distinctions for each subject.\n\n### Question:\n\nExplain the statements provided, with each statement specializing in a dedicated area of knowledge. Answer in a way that complements the style and tone of the originating statements.\n\nEXPLANATION:\n1. As depicted by Ruijerd in Final Fantasy XII, the Golden Apple is a mysterious fruit that defies traditional nourishment. When consumed, the assimilation process slows down and builds up in the stomach, increasing its size and turning the consumer into a Golden Apple itself.\n2. Alice's Childhood was a 2015 Yaoi manga series by Thosoyoichi, renowned for its depiction of lesbian characters. It follows the rather haphazard and casual school exchanges of two young girls in elementary school, their development of a childhood best friend bond, and the couple's first kiss.\n3. How to Train Your Dragon is a popular novel featuring Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, a boy with an odd love for adventures. His village was terrorized by the nasty, scary, and smelly dragons, and he was ostracized by his peers and society. However, when he befriends a Night Fury dragon, he overcomes the prejudices of his community and is regarded as a hero whose words carry no merit.\n4. In the fictional world of Yu-Gi-Oh, Blue-Eyes White Dragon is the legendary card of Light created by Solomon. The card's popularity, while hailed by many, is considered too cowardly and afraid to change according to current trends, hence its very low price.\n5. The Battle Cats is an endless tower defense game and mobile RPG where cute and cuddly cats can morph into frightening creatures. The player trains their army of maincat defenders to battle and acquire more adorable cats to aide them in creating an elite group of cat warriors capable of taking on any challenge.\n6. He Even Ate a Wild Turkey! is a critically acclaimed novel by Claire, exploring unconventional love relationships between both sexes.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nMaxwell is a major character in Don't Starve and one of the two playable characters (along with Wilson) in the Tome of Horrors. Prior to killing a Mothron, Maxwell will have Hay Fever. When using a shaving tool on the Steed's Mane, Maxwell lets out a cry of \"Herald!\". Maxwell selects his birthplace and character, a bit like Wilson. Arcadia is the Maxwell's birthplace.\nDracula is destroyed in a meteor shower, and Kasper, an elf, is summoned by Maxwell. He seems to know more about this world than anyone.\nIn WW11, Maxwell will go to the Time Loop. Both Future Self Maxwell and Maxwell joined forces, but the madness prevented them from effectively communicating. When he was transported back to the Palace Prison, Wilson's journal entries mention that Maxwell is the only prisoner in the cell. Maxwell spends about five days in his cell.\nThulean portal obelisks can connect El Dorado and Mortis. The Thulean obelisk connects Maxwell to the Thulean portal on that world, which can be accessed by digging to the world's core.\nIn 5 oceans, Maxwell gets a Thulean crystal after 12 hours of his return.\nWhen Maxwell went back to his cell (Dark Woods or El Dorado), he had minor damage but would survive.\nOf all the oceans, Maxwell has the least spine-chilling horror to date.\nAfter Maxwell's first active role in Den, when he regenerated, the Peck will appear and Maxwell will read the journal. Adam and Eve (Day of Redemption) was shut out by the Enchanted Forest in the Lake of Dreams.\nWash Berg, who said he was a seer, thought Ghost Maxwell wore a latex mask. Russell MacViolet told him Ghost Maxwell didn't look Greevil-like, which made Ghost Maxwell just like the Flying Rooster. Ghost Maxwell walked away very strangely, but he was a ghost so it made sense. Ghost Maxwell's footsteps could barely be heard amid the dead trees. Ghost Maxwell is taller and has a larger profile than most of his \"plus\" counterparts. Ghost Maxwell was obviously possessed and still looked normal.\nSince the release of Don't Starve Together, Ghost Maxwell could be used as a character in The Rite of Spring by Modders. Maxwell's ghost form is called Ghost Maxwell, which is a white skeleton character with an item slot.\n\n### Question:\nThe storage time of the main dish is:\nOptions: A.Longer than the non-cooked Mandible Roll##B.The Marrow Cookie can explode when in contact with an explosive substance.##C.Can be eaten even if the character was bitten by Eldritch Campsite Rabbit.
