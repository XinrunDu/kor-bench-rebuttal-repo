Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nConditional Claim:\nA categorical claim that is structured in a unique way. \nIt asserts that a specific relationship exists among the subject, the predicate, and the term that serves as the contrapostulate. The relationship can be either affirmative or negative.\n\nConditional proposition of the affirmative relationship (AC): The knowledge that if all subjects possess a certain predicate, they must respectively possess a certain contrapostulate. Its abbreviation is ARBQ, also known as an affirmative conditional proposition or bi-thesis proposition.\n\nConditional proposition of the negative relationship (NC): The knowledge that if no subject possesses a certain predicate, then all subjects must respectively possess the opposite of the subject. Its abbreviation is ARB¯Q, also known as a negative conditional proposition or anti-disjunction proposition.\n\nUsing English for example:\n- If anything admits of quantity, it must be an accident.\n- If anything is a proper name, then there are plenty of words that do not occur in it at all.\n\nHere are some common exam questions:\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- The Kings of England. If there are kings in England, no one can depose or dethrone them.\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- Owlish faces. Beakers are tall, clear, and narrow. If a face is owlish then it is always beaker-shaped.\n- External relations: All coins are money. If anything is money, the constable can take it away.\n- External relations: According to traditional logic, all gnomes are machines. If there is a mechanical environment, then there are undoubtedly gnomes in it.\n\nCategorize them according to your ability in conjunction with the standardization.\n\n### Question:\nMy brother, for example, always loves to read.

No, I cannot test the output because I'm an AI language model and cannot verify online information or interact with external systems. You can test the output using a web browser.\n\nPlease review if I should add a logic rule for\nproving conjunction of universally quantified propositions. The logic rule for proving the conjunction of universally quantified propositions can be added to the instructions as follows:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by ∧ (and) or ⋀ (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by ∨ (or) or ⋁ (NOR).\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this rule:\n\n### Instruction:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by ∧ (and) or ⋀ (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by ∨ (or) or ⋁ (NOR).\n\n### Rule:\nComplex logical claims must adhere to standard notation and symbols:\n- ∧ (or ⋀) represents conjunction (and)\n- ∨ (or ⋁) represents disjunction (or)\n\n### Question:\nGiven the logical claim:\n\nPP∧M→QM→N∨OS∨ ⋀ (M→N), ∨ (O→S), T→S        P, T∴ Q\n\nUsing the standard notation and symbols and following the previous instructions, prove the claim.\n\n### Answer:\nThe claim seems to be a statement, not an expression for proof. It is unclear how to prove or disprove a statement directly using logical operations. If the question is to determine the statement's validity using the rule of quantifier influence on conjunctions and disjunctions, then the answer is:\n\nThe statement is valid because the conjunction and disjunction are true for all values of P, M, Q, N, O, and S, since there are no specific quantifiers provided on these variables. However, if the intention was to prove the statement using the provided logic rules, please provide a separate instance for that purpose.\n\n### Question:\nFor every A gardener who doesn't water the Rose plants will kill some of them.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n####\nQ: Which logical rule does the question follow?\nA: The question follows the \"Four Modal Proposition Relationships\" from the given logical rule set.\n\nReason: This rule is specifically defined for the type of modal proposition relationships that the question is asking about.\n\nQ: What is the symbolisation for the sentence \"Technology may be a blessing.\"?\nA: The symbolisation for the given sentence would be [[$t]], with t representing \"Technology is a blessing.\"\n\nReason: The answer implies that all possible worlds where t is true are considered, which symbolises the possibility of t being true.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between each of the following sentences?\n\"this new policy will definitely be implemented.\" and \"this new policy will definitely not be implemented.\"\nA: The relationship between the two sentences can be B, Relationship x, in the given four relationships from the logical rule.\n\nReason: Relationship x states that a proposition and its negation can never both be true, which is valid for the given sentences.\n\nQ: What is the relationship between each of the following sentences?\n(1) \"The Chinese women's volleyball team is definitely victorious.\" and \"The Chinese women's volleyball team may not win.\"\n(2) \"This project will definitely be completed ahead of schedule.\" and \"This project will definitely not be completed ahead of schedule.\"\nA: The relationships can be B/D, where Relationship B applies to the first question and Relationship D to the second question.\n\nReason: The first question corresponds to Relationship B because one proposition (they are victorious) and its negation (they may not win) cannot both be true. The second question corresponds to Relationship D because one proposition (they will be completed ahead of schedule) and its negation (they will not be completed ahead of schedule) cannot both be false.\n\nQ: Which corresponds to how many modal logic inference formulas?\nA: The given inference corresponds to one computation, the first one (Move from box to square) in the \"Modal Logic Inference Formulas\" section.\n\nReason: This inference formula is similar to the given feedback: $p → !#!p, which demonstrates the double negation theorem.\n\nQ: Can you explain why the model checks the premise of question # 3 and why this is not the case in question # 2?\nA: In the model, I treated the questions separately and used different inference diagrams for the two questions, which explains why they are not the same. The premise of question #3 includes a double negation, which corresponds to the provided inference formula.\n\nReason: Inference diagrams are unique for each question and represent different relationships.

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Rule Examples:\n\n1. A multiple-choice question asks, \"Which US president had this quote: 'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'?\"\n    Answer: \"Abraham Lincoln, US president from 1861 to 1865, is often associated with this quote. The answer depends on the question context and the available options.\"\n\n2. If a question is about whether London is in France, the answer should be 'No' without further elaboration.\n\n3. If a question is phrased that doesn't have an answer, the answer is \"The given question does not have a correct answer because ...\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Which star is the furthest from the Sun?\"\n    Answer: \"The question does not have a correct answer because there is no specific way to determine the furthest star from the Sun.\"\n\n4. If a question is ill-defined or requires too much context to answer, the answer should be \"The question is unclear, please rephrase or provide additional context.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Who was Jesus?\"\n    Answer: \"The question is unclear. Was it asking about a specific time in Jesus' life, an aspect of his character, or something else?\"\n\n5. If there is no coherent answer to the question, the answer is \"There is no coherent answer to the given question.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is x ?\", when x has no context.\n    Answer: \"There is no coherent answer to the question, given that there is no value for the variable X defined.\"\n\n6. If the question is an incomplete instruction, the answer is \"The question is missing critical information.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What does X plus Y equal?\" when X and Y have no values.\n    Answer: \"The question is missing critical information to solve it. In this case, the values for X and Y are unknown.\"\n\n7. If a question has incoherent premises, the answer is \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is a person's favorite food at a restaurant with no menu?\"\n    Answer: \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification, as it's unclear whether there's a functionally existing menu or where the question's context is set.\"\n\n8. If the question is based on a premise that is false, the answer is \"The question's premise is false.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is the capital of Rhode Island?\" when Rhode Island does not accurately describe its capital.\n    Answer: \"The question's premise is false, as Rhode Island is not the name of America. It is the name of an island state in the southern USA.\"\n\n### Rule Examples:\n\nWhen input is a chat exchange conversation, in the response after an answer, add: \"Conversation incomplete.

Looking for evidence of his deliberate influence on the writing of the novel, he drafted a list of alternating length of book chapters. Containing 52 chapters, the serialized novel is divided into nine volumes. Chapters 1, 11, 21, 32, 41, and 51 were long, ranging from 10 to 16 pages.  Chapters 2 through 10, 12 through 20, 22 through 31, 33 through 40, 42 through 50, and 52 were short, from 2 to 6 pages each. He concluded that chapter length had little to do with his influence on the novel.\n\nScientist B studied a different copy of the same novel once again in a bid to prove Scientist A's claim. Working with another observation, she concluded that chapter length had nothing to do with his influence on the novel. Scientist B noted that the first 10 chapters had all the romance and contrast, which is not observable in the rest of the novel. The remaining chapters, he thought, had designedly impoverished resources to render the effect of contrast. Scientist B invited public attention to this fact and the fact that the revealing scenes of Solidarity undefeated, if any reader reads them closely, will be found in ten short chapters.\n\nWhich method of reasoning does Scientist A's argument follow:\nA.

A trademark, often known as a brand mark, is a distinctive image, inscription, or design that distinguishes a company's items. Trademarks are distinct from protected intellectual property.\n\nPrinciples of existence:\n\n1. Distinguishability: A trademark should be distinctive to distinguish the goods or services of one entity from those of others.\n2. Ownership: A trademark should be owned or controlled by the entity that uses it.\n3. Legality: A trademark should not cause confusion, misleading, deception, or offense to consumers or other businesses.\n\nTrademark registration:\n\n1. Exclusivity: A registered trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with the goods or services for which it is registered.\n2.

As we know, even if the exhaust from a vacuum cleaner is filtered to be comparatively clean, it is still difficult for infants to tolerate and digest.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

The following statement is an example of an IllTrans Method: `let ClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.`\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
