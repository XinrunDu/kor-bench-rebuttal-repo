S must be 8 or 9, as it's the largest digit in the first addend.\n3. O must be 0 or 1, as it's the result of the addition in the thousands place (S+M).\n4. Given that M is 1, O must be 0.\n5. Now we know S must be 9.\n6. E must be 5 or more, as N+R must result in a number that, when added to 1 (M), gives E in the one's place.\n7. Y must be E+1 (or E+1-10 if there's a carry).\n8. D+E must end in Y, so D must be 7 and E must be 5, making Y 2.\n9. The remaining letters N and R must be 6 and 8 in some order.\n10.

The only way for O + O to end in T is if there's a carry over, meaning O + O ≥ 10\n3. The smallest possibility for O is 5 (as 5 + 5 = 10)\n4. If O = 5, then T must be 0, but T can't be 0 due to rule 3\n5. So, O must be larger. The next possibility is O = 6, which makes T = 2\n6. This leaves G + 1 (from carry over) = U\n7.

Vicki's client, Beulah, and the $150 client are all different.\n2. Misty's client is either Eula or Inez.\n3. Nancy's client paid more than Kara's client.\n4. Debra paid $10 less than Inez.\n5. Debra paid $20 less than Misty's client.\n\nFrom clues 4 and 5, we can deduce:\n- Debra paid $160\n- Inez paid $170\n- Misty's client (who must be Inez) paid $180\n\nFrom clue 1, we know Beulah didn't pay $150, so she must have paid $170.\n\nThis leaves Eula as the $150 client, and she must be Kara's client (as per clue 3).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n[[150 Eula Kara, 160 Debra Nancy, 170 Beulah Vicki, 180 Inez Misty]]",
