The ASCII value of \"E\" is 69.\n\nThe key is obtained by performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. We convert this hexadecimal string into a byte array.\n\nNow, we perform a bitwise XOR operation between the byte representing the plaintext and the corresponding byte of the key. Since the key is longer than the plaintext, we recycle the key.\n\nThe first byte of the key is 0x73. Performing XOR between 0x69 (the ASCII value of \"E\") and 0x73 gives 0x1A.\n\nConverting 0x1A to a hexadecimal string gives \"1a\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[1a]] ",

We take the first 8 bits (1 byte) of the key, which is '73'.

Converting the first two characters of the key '73' from hexadecimal to decimal gives 115. Performing the XOR operation: 58 ^ 115 = 123.\n\nConverting 123 from decimal to ASCII gives '{' (which is not an uppercase letter without punctuation and spaces as required by the plaintext format).
