        "response": "[[B]] \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe story heavily emphasizes that the vast majority of humanity resides in underground cities powered by planetary engines. This is to escape the dangers of the sun's imminent helium flash. The story explicitly states that access to the surface is strictly controlled. Therefore, an ordinary person would most likely be born and raised in an underground city, never having seen the surface world.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A:** The Earth's rotation has been significantly altered (day-night cycle of 27 hours in 2050, extending to 60 hours by 2058). This makes a regular sunrise and sunset impossible.\n* **C:**  While the goal is to reach Proxima Centauri, the story doesn't indicate they have arrived.  Even if they were nearby, Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star, much dimmer than the sun, and it wouldn't be visible in the same way as the sun on Earth.\n* **D:**  The Space Biosphere 1 project experienced a fatal failure. Additionally, living in space would be a highly exclusive scenario, not applicable to an ordinary person. \n",

It did not achieve 4 years of operation.\n* **D is incorrect:** The story focuses on humanity's efforts within our solar system and makes no mention of detecting biospheres beyond Mars.\n* **C is correct:**  The story highlights the failure of Space Biosphere 1, implying that achieving complete self-sufficiency in space remains unattained. \n",

        "response": "[[B]] \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nOption B accurately reflects the information provided in the story about Han Fei. The story states: \"The 'Liu Sha' organization... was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han...\" \n\nLet's look at why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A:** While the story mentions Jing Ke's assassination attempt on the King of Qin, it attributes this action to the Mohist school, not Han Fei or the Liu Sha organization.\n* **C:** The story doesn't mention anything about Han Fei's death being caused by a curse from the Yin-Yang School. \n* **D:**  The story does not mention how Han Fei died, nor does it implicate Li Si and Yao Jia in his death. \n",

        "response": "[[D]] \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the information provided in the story:\n\n* **A. COVID-19 triggered a global public health crisis, with many schools adopting remote education, posing challenges for students and educators.**  This option is incorrect. The story does not mention COVID-19 or its impact on society. \n\n* **B. The 1997 Asian financial crisis began with a currency crisis in Japan and quickly spread to other Asian countries.** This option is also incorrect. The story focuses on events related to the solar crisis and does not discuss the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\n\n* **C. Due to the Earth United Government presenting substantial scientific evidence proving the likelihood of a helium flash around 2100, debunking the solar stability theory conspiracy, and preventing social unrest.** This statement is incorrect. The story states that despite the UEG's efforts to debunk the Solar Stability Theory, it still gained traction and led to a three-year rebellion. \n\n* **D. The United Government's proposed plans to address the solar crisis sparked intense debates in the scientific community.** This option is **correct**. The story explicitly mentions that the United Government's plans, particularly the \"Moving Earth\" plan, faced opposition and sparked debates. The emergence of the Spaceship Faction and the \"New Geocentrism\" accusations highlight the intense disagreements surrounding the proposed solutions to the solar crisis. \n",
