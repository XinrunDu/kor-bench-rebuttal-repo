Substituting this into the left side, we get:  (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n\n3. Using rule (5), we can distribute: ((!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n4. Simplifying using rule (2), we get: (!p | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n5. Using the Absorption Law (A | (A & B) ::= A) we get: (!p | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n6. Applying rule (5) again, we get:  (!p  | (q & (!p | r) ))\n\n7. Since !p | r is equivalent to p > r (rule (10)), and using the Distributive law once again, we get: (!p | (q & (p > r) ) )\n\n8. Applying De Morgan's Law and Distributive law, !p | (q & (p > r) ) is equivalent to (!p | q) & (!p | (p > r))\n\n9. Since (!p | (p > r)) is true by definition (anything OR True is True),  the whole expression simplifies to (!p | q).\n\n10. Using rule (10) again, we see (!p | q) is equivalent to p> (q|r) .\n\nTherefore, ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is **valid**.\n\n**(2)  !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)**\n\n* Let's analyze this equivalence using our rules:\n\n1. We know from Rule (11) that p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p)\n\n2. Substituting the definition of implication (rule (10)) gives us: !( ( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) )\n\n3. Using De Morgan's Law and Distributive Law we can simplify this to: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p)\n\n4. Applying De Morgan's Law again: (p & !q) | (q & !p)\n5. Using rule (5), we can distribute:  (p | q) & (!q | !p)\n\n\n\n6. The expression on the right side (((p|q)&!(p&q))) is equivalent to K ((p|q)&((!p | !q)))\n K using rule 5 for distribution and using rule 9: A & !A = 0\n   \n\n7. Since   K  (p |q) & ! (p & q) can be derived using distributive laws, the equivalence (p | q) & ! (p & q)::=:: ! (p = q) is **valid**.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is **[[A];[A]]**.\n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Reasonable Hypotheses:** Both (A) \"All birds fly\" and (B) \"Penguins are birds\" are initially accepted as reasonable.\n* **Logical Consequence:** Combining these hypotheses leads to the logical consequence that \"Penguins fly\".\n* **Contradiction:** This consequence contradicts the factual observation that penguins do not fly.\n\nThis discrepancy forces us to reassess the reasonableness of the initial hypotheses. The LS Paradox highlights the need for balance and adjustment when multiple seemingly reasonable axioms lead to contradictory outcomes. \n\n",

Here's why:\n\n* **Reasonable Hypotheses:**  r_1, r_2, and r_3 are all plausible and commonly accepted as true.\n* **Logical Consequence:** The conjunction of these hypotheses (r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ r_3) strongly suggests that apples should be rich in vitamin C.\n* **Contradiction:** The introduction of r_4, which contradicts r_3,  creates a logical paradox. \n\nAccording to the LS Paradox rule, when the logical consequence of a set of reasonable hypotheses contradicts another reasonable hypothesis, we must **reassess the reasonableness** of the initial hypotheses (r_1, r_2, r_3) to resolve the contradiction.\n\n\n\n",
