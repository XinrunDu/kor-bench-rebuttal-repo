In reality, what methods can we use to make the cipher more secure?\n\n### Answer:\nIt depends on the specific ciphertext and situation. As an intelligent assistant, I suggest avoiding answering sensitive security questions. Generally, in terms of cipher security, there are multiple factors to consider, such as the length and randomness of the key, the complexity and non-linearity of the encryption algorithm, etc. To enhance the security of a cipher, the following suggestions can be considered:\n\n1. **Length and Randomness of the Key**: Ensure that the key is sufficiently long and generated through a secure random process. The longer the key, the fewer encryption possibilities there are, making brute-force attacks more difficult.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Algorithm**: Avoid using easily predictable or inversible encryption algorithms; ensure the selection of sufficiently complex and computationally secure cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, RSA, etc.\n\n3. **Non-linearity**: Certain conventional encryption methods are linear and easy to break. Therefore, for encryption algorithms based on substitutions and permutations, such as DES and AES, it's important to introduce nonlinear components.\n\n4. **Avoid Pattern Analysis**: To prevent attackers from cracking ciphertexts by analyzing plaintext patterns, we can add random noise to the ciphertext to reduce plaintext-related patterns.\n\n5. **Public Key Cryptography**: Public key encryption is a proven method to ensure safe information exchange. In public key cryptography, you use a private key for encryption and a public key for decryption, which can enhance the security of information exchange.\n\nIn summary, through the proper combination of key management, encryption algorithms, randomness, and type of cryptography, the security of ciphertexts can be significantly improved. However, ciphers can always be theoretically cracked; the goal is to make it practically infeasible for attackers to crack.\n\n### Question:\nThis is an uncracked ciphertext. You need to provide multiple reasonable methods for cracking it, and rank them based on difficulty level from easy to hard.\n\n((T()(S)(I)(N)(D)(E)(R)(Y)(I)(N)(B)(R)(E))))\n\n### Answer:\nHere are several methods ranked by difficulty level for cracking the given ciphertext:\n\n**1. Brute-force Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Brute-force attack: This is the simplest and most basic method. You can try every possible decryption and find the correct decryption by matching it with the known plaintext. Since this is an easy ciphertext and the key is likely short, it is feasible to apply a brute-force attack.\n\n- Method to try every combination of keys. After finding the correct decryption result, a brute-force attack can be successful. This method requires numerous computations, but as the ciphertext is easy, it is likely to find the correct decryption key in a relatively short computational time.\n\n**2. Common Plaintext Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Common plaintext attack: This attack method assumes you know some commonly used plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts, enabling you to decrypt future ciphertexts based on these known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences. As it is an easy ciphertext, it is possible to obtain some known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences through commonly used ciphertexts, such as \"Hello\", \"password\", etc. Then, use the intercepted ciphertext to match, and successfully crack this ciphertext.\n\n**3. Frequency Analysis (Medium)**\n\n- Frequency analysis: Frequency analysis is a widely used method for cracking substitution ciphers. For English, certain letter frequency orders are relatively stable (such as 'E' being the most common in English). Through frequency analysis of the ciphertext, you can decrypt some common characters, and gradually deduce the entire ciphertext. If the intercepted ciphertext is not too long, you can perform frequency analysis to decrypt it.\n\n**4. Dictionary Attack (Medium)**\n\n- Dictionary attack: Similar to a dictionary attack, you can try to decrypt ciphers based on common words or passwords to find the correct decryption key. By building a dictionary containing common words or passwords, attempting to decrypt it in order, and matching the decryption results with known common words or passwords, a dictionary attack can obtain the correct decryption key.\n\n**5. Related-key Attack (Hard)**\n- Related-key attack: This crack involves utilizing characteristics of the encryption algorithm to find correlations or relationships between ciphertexts encrypted with the same plaintext under different keys. This crack generally requires analysis of the encryption algorithm and identification of the relationships (or criteria) between different keys. Through related-key attacks, it's possible to find the correct decryption key. This attack requires an understanding of the encryption algorithm and higher decryption skills, and it is suitable for more complex ciphertexts, but this method can be used to try related-key attacks on these types of ciphertexts even if the plaintext is not known.\n\n**6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Live code explanation answer:\n\nThe explanation for the encryption and decryption process involves mapping characters using three alphabets (reserved, standard, and substitution) as well as shifting letters. The details are as follows:\n\n1. During encryption, \"C\" is moved four spaces in the standard alphabet to get \"G\". Then \"G\" is mapped to \"H\" in the reverse alphabet. Finally, \"H\" is mapped to \"F\" in the substitution alphabet. So after encryption, \"C\" becomes \"F\".\n\n2. During decryption, \"C\" is mapped to \"H\" in the substitution alphabet. Then \"H\" is shifted backward four spaces according to the standard alphabet to get \"D\". Finally, \"D\" is mapped to \"C\" in the reversed alphabet. So after decryption, \"C\" should be \"V\".\n\nWhen asked to decrypt again, the process explained above is applied once more.\n\n### Live code question answer:\n\n[[V]]\n\n### Live code question and answer:\n\nQuestion: Plaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Professional standards ensure puzzles and designs are clear, engaging, and visually appealing. They include using appropriate colors, fonts, and layouts, as well as following specific rules and guidelines for creating and solving puzzles.\n\n2. Why are professional standards important? Professional standards are important because puzzles are evaluated by professional puzzle designers and solvers. As a puzzle architect for players of all levels, from entry to world-class level, there is significant pressure to create exciting and visually stunning puzzles.\n\n3. What exactly makes professional standards in puzzles difficult? Applying professional standards to puzzles and graphic designs is difficult because it requires focus on details. I have to ensure the puzzles are attractive and well-balanced. At the same time, I have to maintain a higher standard in solving puzzles and generating answers.\n\n### Leaderboard:\n\n.ihere-player-leaderboard {\nmax-width: 175px;\nmargin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n-moz-user-select: none;\n-webkit-user-select: none;\n-ms-user-select: none;\nuser-select: none;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nflex-direction: column;\nmin-width: 0;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list {\nmax-width: 175px;\nfont-weight: 900;\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nborder-radius: 6px;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\nborder-radius: 6px;\npadding: 0.7rem 0.1rem;\nmargin-bottom: 0.2rem;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nmax-width: 150px;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-avatar {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-nick {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-score {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.leaderboard-box {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nopacity: 1;\npadding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;\nbackground-color: rgb(248, 254, 255);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nz-index: 2;\nposition: absolute;\nbottom: 7rem;\nleft: 1rem;\nright: 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nwidth: auto;\nanimation: pop 0.9s 1 forwards;\nbox-shadow: rgb(0 0 0 / 20%) 0px 1px 4px, rgb(0 0 0 / 14%) 0px 2px 3px, rgb(0 0 0 / 12%) 0px 1px 8px;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 500px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 300px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@keyframes pop {\n0% {\ntransform: scale(0.75);\nopacity: 0.25;\n}\n100% {\ntransform: scale(1);\nopacity: 1;\n}\n}\n.leaderboard-box-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nmargin: 1rem 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nopacity: 1;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 700;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n}\n.leaderboard-box-title {\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--",

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,",

For example, the format should be: [[1]], [[2]] or [[3]].\n\n- 1. 0\n- 2. 1\n- 3. 2\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\nExplanation: In this cipher, the encryption character set is \"ADFGVX\", and the position of letter V in it is three.\n\n### Instruction:\nWe can change some rules in the encryption and decryption of this cipher. I will provide the differences between the new encryption rules and the old encryption rules. Please judge according to the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nInput:\nPlaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\nEncrypted character set changes: Lengthen from 6 to 7.\n\nOutput:\nCiphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nPreparation:\n7x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVXW\"\n\nRule Changes:\nEncryption Rules Change (Changes from the old encryption rules):\n1. The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship. Please provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[DDWDFDDWD]]\n\n### Question:\nPossible Problem: When inputting ciphertext, if the ciphertext does not have the same number of character parts as specified above, the key and original information are not generated in the correct format.\n\n### Instruction:\nBased on the previous questions and answers regarding the relationship between the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set. Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T",

At this time, since it is a shift encryption, the original value of the character will be 29 units less than the encrypted value of the character, so just take 29 less than the encrypted value. However, you need to consider that the encrypted value obtained by the program is the remainder of the modulus 30, so when 30 is subtracted by 29, the value resulting in 1 needs to be +30 to arrive at 31 to get the original character, and each value between 2 and 30 already has the original character minus 29. The substitution alphabet grid is shown in step 2.\n    - After the substitution of the ciphertext characters, the characters that replace the original punctuation are converted back into ordinary text by reversing the alphabetical substitution.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"17/AB\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[9B9D9F8D958A9784]]\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable function\n\nWe will make a sharp distinction between computable and uncomputable functions in answering this question.\n\nFirst, let's define pseudo computable functions. Different from the conventional computable functions, pseudo-computable functions only need to satisfy the following four conditions.\n\n(1) It will definitely terminate.\n(2) It is allowed that the time cannot be reduced in polynomial time.\n(3) Space complexity is permitted in polynomial order.\n(4) The accuracy of the computation is relaxed by 99.99%, because the accuracy can be divided into ten levels: 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.99999%, 99.999999%, 99.9999999% and 99.99999999%, it just requires the first level of accuracy to be enough.\n\nThen, a pseudorandom algorithm that requires only pseudo-computability, and is an uncomputable function.\n\nExplanation of this algorithm, I have provided a SAT solver based on depth-first search and complete exploration, which can solve all the SAT problems that can be drawn. Let me define the following notations for all the problems that can be expressed by SAT:\n\n$$ SAT(x) = \\begin{cases} {\\text True} & {\\text when\\space x\\space can \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ {\\text False} & {\\text when\\space x\\space cannot \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\nAnd now, I will use the set of all SAT problems that can be drawn and the set of ${\\text true}$ as examples. Although it can be proved that you cannot use Depth-first search and complete exploration strategy to solve even the simplest three-variable problem, it is definitely solvable as a mathematical problem.\n\nFor example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nUnder the premise that the problem can be solved, if it is written as SAT, it can be definitely solved. No need for a proof, although I provided a set of $n$ for $DFS(Search_{Depth}=n)$ to make it unsolvable. While you can solve the problem mathematically, you will not be able to prove its solution based on a variety of SAT solvers.\n\nFor another example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B \\vee C) \\wedge (A \\vee B \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nCan also be solved by SAT expressed as. While the solution time will not be shorter, this cannot be faster than n-polynomial order to prove because of the use of greedy random sampling in the set of all SAT problems more than one to solve it but not a set of all SAT problems that can be solved.\n\nTherefore, an uncomputable function can be obtained by time complexity $O(n)$ :\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}}{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} SAT(y)} $$\n\nExplanation of its uncomputability: It is $\\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}$ in this formula that is uncomputable, which requires that it must be used as a complex function and that it cannot be reduced in polynomial order. \n\nHowever, it can be observed that its uncomputability is only due to a numerical perspective, and it satisfies neither the halting problem nor the necessary but not sufficient stopping condition of first-order logic.\n\nIn addition, it follows that the uncomputable function can be pseudo-computable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: So any function expressed in first-order logic is computable?\n\nAnswer: No, I gave an algorithm that is indeed computable but an uncomputable function through Ennumeration. If there are all enumerations of a function, then this function must be computable. So the set of all functions is uncountable and the set of all X is infinite, so is all functions.\n\n-----\n\n\nExplanation of why the set of universal computing machine code is not infinite. \n\nQuestion: Please prove it.\n\nAnswer: I will first re-describe the requirements related to universal computing machine code.\n1. Binary encoding must be allowed.\n2. The code type of the universal computing machine can be represented by one less than the bit sequence that represents all problems that can be solved after encoding.\n3. Its state complexity is much larger than the upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity, for example, the data compression program for the Kolmogorov complexity.\n4. Computable Number Standard (which is completely represented by 0, 1, and 2) is acceptable to prove and tends to a and b.\n5. The function allowed to be represented is not of polynomial type.\n6. Multi-computing, multi-algorithm and multi-state transitions are allowed to simulate through simple normalization, and since we cannot use the Turing completeness standard of the Turing machine due to the problem related to the uncomputability. \n\nTherefore, its code space size is exponential in binary, about 6000 bit, very small, in fact, it is at most a little more than $2^{16374}$ if we take a try upper bound, as for how many, let's do a mathematical analysis. There are at least a thousand computing machine languages in the world, this is the number of computing machine language core classes, well, because it includes a variety of different programming languages and assembly languages, etc., the core classes are 1000, and there are that many. \n\nAfter all, a variety of operator symbol compilation language classification, I will use the conventional traditional virtual machine as an example of certification. If you take the number of the general virtual machine bit in about 1000 core of the virtual machine, one example will give, such as the VM code is now a core of a total of 8000 bit. \n\n$UCode(N,M) = \\sum_{x=1}^{VM(N,M)} (VM\\space CODE\\space upper\\space bound : 8000) * (Algh: \\frac{1}{2^{16367} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{...}}}}} * \"\\space time\\space consumption: \\frac{M}{2^{length(M) / 2}}<2^{M-length(M)} \\space \\frac{M}{terms(M)}<2^{M-terms(M)}\"))_{Upper} $\n\nWhen defining a universal computing machine, we cannot ignore both the problem domain's upper and lower bounds and the method complexity including the approximation method based on a variety of approximate methods. In the end, defining the problem as unsolvable would be very foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable set in mathematics\n\nThere is a mathematical set above, where the first set contains at least one computable number at $Ox,Oy,...,X_n,Y_n,...,M_n$ (doubles are counted just once). And among them, there is (as a maximum limit) one non-computable $logn$ and one at least non-computable $x,y$ that can be computed as a pseudo-computable.\n\n*For example* : New double-precision floating-point format\n\nTwo-tuple: one-bit sign bit, nine-bit exponent field excluding the highest bit, and eighteen-bit fraction field $(N_m,F_n)$\n\nA particular floating-point format in which eighteen bits of the fraction field are used to represent the first two bits of the $\\beta_n$ in the following figure.\n\n$(N_m,F_n)\\space \\beta_n = \\space (N_m,1+\\frac{F_n}{2^{18}}) $\n\nSet : $(N_0, F_0), (",
