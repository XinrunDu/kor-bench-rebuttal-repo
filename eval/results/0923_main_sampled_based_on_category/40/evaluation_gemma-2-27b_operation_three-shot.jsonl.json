Using history as an example, formulate a multitude of such new rules, where the A,B,C,D represents integer(can be negative, positive or 0), and x and y are parameters. The design exercise should include factoring the parameters (x,y) into the equation, and different arithmetic operators.The new rule requires to factor all parameters for comparison.This means by putting the value of these parameters, we would immediately be able to compute the answer to the question in the rule. Furthermore, to ensure the design rule exercises the assistant's math ability, the equations should be at least 10 word tokens long. The new rule should be reasonable easy for regular high school students to answer.The rule should be effective, should not contain equation that yields a deceptively indeterminate, ambiguous or invalidity answer.

Your task is to devise an effective strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of the given custom operation in the context of the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question hints at it or clearly asks for it, take the time to devise a strategy or algorithm for efficient calculation before providing an answer.\n3. If the question doesn't specifically ask for it, your answer should be a numerical value or a group of numerical values.\n4. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★4 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=4:\n2\\times 4^1 = 8\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n8 - 4 = 4\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★2 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2*\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n### Question:\nGiven a★4=15, devise a strategy for efficiently calculating the value of a★1, and display your process accordingly.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or'.e.g.[[1or2]]\n\n### Answer:\nGiven that the integration is with respect to x, to find the value of b in \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx, we can use the known value and solve for a.\nStarting with the given integral formula: \\int_{a}^{4} 2x \\, dx=15\nFirst, we perform the integration:\n=\\frac{2x^2}{2} \\Big|_a^4\n=x^2\\Big|_a^4\n=(4^2-a^2)\\Big|_a^4\n=16-a^2\nThen, we set this result equal to the known value 15 and solve for a:\n15=16-a^2\na^2=16-15\na^2=1\na=±\\sqrt{1}\na=±1\nThere are two possible solutions for a, a=1 or a=-1.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a★4=15, devise a useful trick or observation that can help calculate the value of a★2 efficiently. The original purpose of this rule is aimed at making this calculation easy to do in your head.\n\n### Answer:\nRecognizing that the integrand, 2x, when integrated becomes (2/2)x^2 = x^2, which gives us a simple quadratic in terms of the limits, can be very helpful in this calculation. \nThe resulting quadratic is a simple difference of perfect squares, allowing for quick mental calculation.\nAlso, we can recall that the difference of squares formula is a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b). In this case, the formula is 16-x^2=(4-x)(4+x).\nFor specific values, like 15, we can reverse engineer: if 15=16-x^2, then x^2=1, leading us to the values -1 and 1 which solve it efficiently.\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★-1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★2.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your",

Examples\nf(x,y)=1,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nUsing the new operation, we can solve this problem as abov​\nThe question specifies an area 'D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3', on which we integrate the function 'f(x,y)=1'. Let's solve this using the formula 'f◆D = ∬_{D} f(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy'.\n\nThe given function f(x,y) is a constant function equating to 1. Since the area 'D' is a rectangle bounded by x values 1 to 2 and y values 1 to 3, we can compute the double integral straightforwardly. Here's how you perform the operations:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 1 dx dy (by integrating 1 from 1 to 2, the result will be 2-1=1) by integrating 1 from 1 to 3, the result will be 3-1=2. So integral will be 1*2=2\n\n\nf(x,y)=xy,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nTo solve this one, likewise, we just simply compute the double integral with the given function over the given rectangular area:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (xy) dx dy(calculate ∫ xy dx from 1 to 2 = x^2y/2; substitute boundaries: (2^2*y)/2 - (1^2*y)/2=3/2*y) By doing ∫ (3/2*y) dy from 1 to 3 it will be (3/2)*(3^2)/2 - (3/2)*(1^2)/2=9/2 - 3/2=6/2=3hence, integral is 3*∫ dy from 1 to 3 = 3(3-1)=3*2=6\nf(x,y)=x^2+y^2,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nHere's the solution:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (x^2 + y^2) dx dyFirst, solve ∫ (x^2 + y^2) dx from 1 to 2 = x^3/3 + xy^2; substitute boundaries: (2^3)/3 + 2y*y - (1^3)/3 - 1*y^2=7/3 + y^2Next, solve ∫ (7/3 + y^2) dy from 1 to 3 = 7/3y + y^3/3; substitute boundaries: 7/3*3 + 3^3/3 - 7/3*1 - 1^3/3=6 + 9 - 7/3 - 1/3=15 - 2*1/3 = 15 - 2/3 = 45/3 - 2/3 = 43/3 = 14 1/3.Hence, the result is 49/3.\nf(x,y)=x^2y,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nWe solve as before:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (x^2y) dx dy First, solve ∫ (x^2y) dx from 0 to 1 = x^3*y/3; substitute boundaries: 1^3*y/3 - 0^3*y/3 = 1/3*y Next, solve ∫ (1/3*y) dy from 0 to 3 = y^2/6; substitute boundaries: 3^2/6 - 0^2/6 = 9/6 = 3/2 Hence, the result is 3/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 3/2*3 = 9/2\nf(x,y)=xy^2,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nSame as above:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (xy^2) dx dy First, solve ∫ (xy^2) dx from 0 to 1 = x*y^2/2; substitute boundaries: 1*y^2/2 - 0*y^2/2 = 1/2*y^2 Next, solve ∫ (1/2*y^2) dy from 0 to 3 = y^3/6; substitute boundaries: 3^3/6 - 0^3/6 = 27/6 = 9/2 Hence, the result is 9/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 9/2*3 = 27/2\nWhat will the following integral expression simplifies to? Prove your solution and turn it into decimal with at most two digits after decimal.\n\nf(x,y)=x^2 + y^2, D: x^2+y^2 = 4, x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, compute f◆D.\nMy answer is 11/3\\pi, but markdown only supports latex, can you calculate this integral for me?\nBy using polar coordinates\nWe know x^2+y^2 = r^2. So, we can transform the coordinate system to polar coordinates where x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ). The Jacobian of this transformation is r. The new integral limits for the given circle with radius 2 will be from 0 to 2pi for θ and 0 to 2 for r.\n\nSo, our new integral is: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 ((rcos(θ))^2 + (rsin(θ))^2) * r dr dθ Simplify the integrand: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 * (cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ)) dr dθ Since sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr dθ Now we solve the r integral: ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr = [r^3/3] from 0 to 2 = 8/3 The final integral becomes: ∫ from 0 to 2pi (8/3) dθ = (8/3)θ from 0 to 2pi = (8/3)*2pi = 16/3 * pi = 11/3 * pi.
