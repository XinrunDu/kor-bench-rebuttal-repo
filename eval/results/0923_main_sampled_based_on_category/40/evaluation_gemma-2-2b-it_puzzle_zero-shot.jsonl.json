Interpret the Inequalities:**\n\n   - The inequalities (row i, column j) < (row x, column y) tell us the order relationship between numbers.\n   - Example interpretation: \"(1,3)<(1,4)\" means the number in the cell (1,3) is less than number in (1,4)\n\n\n**3. Analyze the Rules:**\n\n   -  We must fill all empty cells in the grid in ascending order.\n\n**4.  Apply the Rule & Repeat:**\n\n   - Step by step, we solve for each of the spaces (if you get stuck at any point, it means we might need a bit of additional feedback on the number of each cell, or the order of filling a particular cell).\n\n **5. Solution:**\n\n  You would repeat this process of trial and error, using the fifteen possible spots of number placement, alternating column by column to fulfill all the requirements from each numbered spot while maintaining the rule to input each number (1 to 4).\n\n** 6.

We need to find the fitting heights for an 6 x 6 grid.\n* **Building Heights:** Skyscrapers can be 1 to the size of the grid. \n* **Rule of No Duplicates:** A skyscraper cannot have the same height in the same row or column.\n* **Directionality:** The numbers near the edges indicate how many skyscrapers you would see if you looked in the direction of the arrows. It's essential to account for this when determining the skyline view.\n* **Fill the Gaps:** We need to use the patterns on the grid to place the numbers where they appropriately depict building heights.\n\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n\nLet's analyze the provided grid and the clues. \n\nIt's difficult to definitively figure out the exact skyscraper heights without a clearer visual or more contextual details, as the rules don't fully specify where to address the placing the numbers.\n\n\n**Need for Clarity**\n\nTo effectively solve this puzzle, I need additional information:\n\n* **Image:** A visual representation of the grid with a clear indication of arrow directions.\n* **Context:** Any additional or hidden information (like special arrangements on the grid to fit columns).\n\nOnce I have that information, I can apply the given rules and most effectively solve the puzzle.  \n",
