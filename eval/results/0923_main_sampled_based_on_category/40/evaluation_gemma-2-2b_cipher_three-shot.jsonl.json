I will be grateful for your suggestions for improving this solution.\n\n### My Explanation:\n\n1. Identify the relevant headers and objects mentioned in the rule: Plaintext, keyword, ciphertext, reversed_alphabet, substitution_alphabet, standard_alphabet. The rule indicates that the task involves encryption and decryption procedures, and the process involves shifting encryption and decryption.\n\n2. Follow the specified steps for encryption and decryption:\n- For encryption:\n    - Use reversed_alphabet as the reverse mapping, so that the alphabets in ciphertext string can be mapped to the correct ones in plaintext.\n        - Considering that ciphertexts are uppercase strings, the corresponding process could be similar to the reverse mapping of plaintext integers in reverse_digits reversal rules. Specifically, for each alphabet ci, find its original index ci in reversed_alphabet, then replace ci with the character xi in the plaintext. For example, if A is mapped to Z, B is mapped to Y, etc.\n    - Add n positions after the alphabet in plaintext. The new plaintext of ciphertexts mapped character (1) is mapped to\n    - Obtain the character at position n of plaintext. Then replace it with the original character of that mapping. For example, if the n-step plaintext character is D, then the position of encrypted plaintext is\n    - Replace the character obtained by (3) with the letter corresponding to the position n of the encrypted plaintext in ciphertext alphabet. For example, the cipher alphabet is \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\", where the original character obtained by (1) mapped to\n3. Follow the specified steps for decryption:\n- For Decryption:\n    - Use the encryption results as the encryption results for decryption step. Assume that the character obtained from the decryption step is\n    - Compare the new character n step with cipheralphabet, then find the number ci of cipheralphabet for it. Finally, execute the decrypt steps on ci maps. For example, like encrypted string\n    - Dexcrypted character is\n    - If p maps to Z, it means that p was a candidate encrypted plaintext, and the decrypted cipher text p is\n    - Find ciphertext character ci, corresponding original number i means cipher c\n    - [^]\n    - If the encrypted character obtained by decryption is\n4. Ensure the output contains a formatted string.\n  * Use plaintext, key, transformed alphabet, and end point for consistent output formatting.\n\n\nThe variable used in the solution:\n\n```\nkey = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM\"\n# reversed_alphabet = \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n# substitution_alphabet = \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\nreversed_alphabet = reversed(str(key))  \nalphabet = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\nalphabet_dict = {}\nfor i in reversed_alphabet.rstrip():\n    alphabet_dict[reversed_alphabet.index(i)] = i\nfor index in reversed_alphabet:\n    if index not in alphabet:\n        result = \"\"\n        txt = f\"Enter the encryption rule:\\n{txt[1]}\"\n```\n",

It is represented as a letter, specifically \"P\".\n\n2. Check if \"P\" exists in the Polybius square. If it does, use the principle of \"rows and columns to replace it\".\n\n- If O does not exist, replace with 66.\n\n3. Obtain the ciphertext: \"35\" (row and column notation)\n\n4. Process according to \"rows and columns to replace it\", and obtain \"O\".\n\n5. Conversion as necessary, answer: \"34\"\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"35\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns, and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"B\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[B]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"4533332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"KN\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[KN]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2.

Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"QQ\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[QQ]].**\n\n* Explanation of XOR Operation:\n\nXOR (exclusive Or) operation is applied to each character pair of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext. During decryption, since there may be O in the ciphertext, the corresponding XOR operation is carried out. If the plaintext contains O, perform the overall XOR operation as usual, otherwise perform the XOR operation as follows:\n\n`If XOR(c,p) = O XOR(c,p) = 66 `\n\nBe careful not to be confused. The purpose of \"rows and columns replacement\" is not only for encryption but also for decryption.\n\n**Example of XOR Operation:**\n\n ciphertext: \"45346\"\n\nplaintext: \"B\"\n\nin_pair: \"45346\" \"B\"\n\nout_pair: \"0C33133D3D3D1313 D13333363\"\n\nThe XOR operation result of \"66\" is very close to \"C\", so perform the overall OR operation instead of XOR.",

This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n",

At the end of the twentieth century, algorithms that are efficient and produce the largest number of zeros when decrypted became popular and widely adopted. It's important to understand how these algorithms, the best known of which is the data encryption standard (DES), operate below the surface. These algorithms employ a long array of numbers called a KDF (key derivation function), which is a key-dependent function, to encrypt data blocks. To decrypt messages, you must be familiar with the original ciphertext generated by the encryption algorithm.\n\n<strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://aes.stackexchange.com/questions/58/data-encryption…\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question01.png)\n\n### Question 1:\n\nProvide explicit examples of Python statements to obtain the frequency of each character in the input string using class lists.\n\nPlease specify the functions including and the function signature\nwith explicit examples.

Feel free to use the provided information to your advantage, and if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I hope this provides necessary input to generate meaningful answers for your AI assistant system!\n\nHi! I am your AI assistant called 'CipherBot'. It's my pleasure to assist you in finding the encrypted and decrypted answers from the given input and rules.\n\n### Encryption Rules:\n- The encryption process is designed as follows: For each letter (e.g., A) in the plaintext, the corresponding value in the reel is used as the encrypted letter. The reel contains the letters 'ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN' in this example.\n\nFor instance, if the plaintext is 'A', the expected output should be B, as the correspond input reel letter is B (A is 5 mod 26, corresponding to 26 + A = B). However, if the plaintext is 'A' (constant 10 mod 26), then the output is B (instead of Z as B in the input reel) as A matches B directly without any round-robin movement to the next reel.\n\nSimilarly, if the plaintext is 'ACDFGHJ', the encrypted output should be P, as D is directly matched with P (first input reel alphabet) while H matches B.\n\n### De-Encryption Rules\nThe de-encryption process as follows: for each letter (J) in the ciphertext, the correspond input reel letter is used to de-encrypt the letter.\n\nFor instance, if the ciphertext is 'J', the expected output should be I (via subtracting 7 from 14 mod 26 as J in the input ciphertext is 14), as I is the corresponding letter when deducting 7 from 26 (as the code specifies reel numbers as mod 26 mod inherit).\n\n### Sample Answers:\n\n- \"A\" --> \"B\" (via removing the letters ones spots apart from the last from the first reel and using those spots as the plaintext's answer.)\n- \"J\" --> \"I\" (via subtracting the 7th reel alphabet (i.e., Z) from the plaintext's answer.\n- \"U\" --> \"X\" (this move does not affect the plaintext; B is moved from the beginning of the Reel to the end; thus, U is in the plaintext.\n- \"S\" --> \"X\" (the Y and Z spots interchange; we move P to fit the Z spot's position, the Z is in the plaintext)\n- \"X\" --> \"S\" (due to the ciphertext in order (A and all uppercase letters are already converted) the answer is backward, but unchanged; likewise the ciphertext is in order; so the answer is S)\n\nRemember, encryption requires the proper alphabet order, while decryption does not.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"N\" --> \"M\"\n\nAnswer: Here's a rule:\n\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'N' --> 'B'\n- 'M' --> 'C'\n- So, the answer is 'MC'.\n\n### Question:\n\n- \"U\" --> \"X\"\n\nAnswer:\n\n    Here's a rule:\n\n    - Plaintext: \"VAWC\"\n    - Output: \"SCUX\"\n- 'A' --> 'B'\n- 'U' --> 'C'\n- 'W' --> 'D'\n- 'C' --> 'C'\n- 'A' --> 'X'\n- 'V' --> 'W'\n- 'O' --> 'C'\n- 'B' --> 'D'\n- 'D' --> 'U'\n- 'N' --> 'D'\n- 'J' --> 'Z'\n- 'Z' --> 'O'\n- 'U' --> 'R'\n- Finally, 'X' --> 'SCUX' (for 'U' --> 'X') which results in 'SCIWX'.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Then, we will use the '.-/-...-' pattern to combine three letters into one pair of characters, and then use these pairs to represent the corresponding Morse code by converting them into numeric string form using the numerical-index mapping table. Finally, this string is added to the end of the ciphertext for encryption.\n\nFor decryption, we first need to split the Morse code into pairs representing each character and convert these pairs to numeric strings using the numerical index mapping table. Then, we use the morse_code Table to convert this numeric string back to the character form and finally concatenate it together.\n\nDuring the process, it is important to ensure that the output strings are formatted according to the specified instructions. For example, the encryption step should be \\'.-/-...'\\' separated by /, etc.\n\n![Here another image]\n",

Don't repeat encryption and decryption, otherwise it will be considered as cheating.\n- When answering the encryption and decryption, the ciphertext and plaintext must be checked before submission, if the ciphertext and plaintext don't match, it will be considered as a typo mistake (error handling is provided by Coursera, if you make a typing mistake, it will still be evaluated as correct).\n- If you use spaces and special characters outside of the ciphertext and plaintext, the correctness of your answer will be determined by checking whether your ciphertext and plaintext satisfy the encoding and decoding rules.\n- Only answers that match the correct solution will be marked as correct.\n- For your safety, please do not use illegal characters (such as html tags, Japanese characters, special symbols, etc.)\n- Please answer the prompt question about encryption and decryption, including \"CipherRule,\" \"plaintext,\" and \"ciphertext\". Don't just put your answer on the first line!",

You need to use the decryption algorithm, but not all of it. The \"Unified Algorithms Operational Instructions for the National Unified Algorithm Library\" in the \"Encryption Algorithm Assessment Standard\"\n\nEncryption cipher (related parameter calculation algorithms):\n\n1. Ciphertext Calculation Method\n\nThere are many methods to calculate the ciphertext, generally from:\n\n(1) According to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext, encrypt and count according to the encryption table, then encrypt the result character by character.\n\n(2) Use the previously calculated key to encrypt the data, and then encrypt according to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext character by character.\n\nEncryption is encrypted according to the corresponding table, and each character is converted into a corresponding position according to the original data. To do this, it is necessary to find the position of each character in the cipher text.\n\n(1) When the cipher text is not arranged in order, the commonly used way is to find the longest ascending position of the character. The shortest descending character from the long to the short position;\n\n(2) Determine that there is no encryption key, please refer to the Standard algorithm in the Unified Algorithm Library for definition.\n\nThe ciphertext above uses some encryption rules based on columns.",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[emphasis]NEIEKOWQRE]]\n\n*NOTE: The cipher rule provides additional entries in its list of tables. However, only the specified tables are used for both encryption and decryption for the questions provided.*\n\nBy applying the rules mentioned, you should be able to find the answers in the provided questions. Be careful to follow the format and adhere to the specifications.\n\n# Verifying the cipher rule\nYou can verify the cipher rule by attempting to encrypt and decrypt:\n- \"W\" to \"11111001\" using the fixed key \"10101010\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"S\" to \"6676155\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"11111011\" to \"S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"EKEOKUIRPNRNKDPEEKRTKMQ\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"KIOKRKIOCRIRKIARCRIVKIARCRKR\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"VNN\" to \"KNNW\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" to \"VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n\nTo encrypt \"W\" to \"11111001\", a 0 is added to the letter \"W\" to make it 5 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 5 is added as an offset to other values in the permutation table. The Permutation Table is just like the Key(e.g., \"10101010\") where a row is picked according to the offset added to the values in the 'Permuted Alphabet(Table)'(e.g., \"10101010, 11111011, 11000111, 11011101, 10111110\"). \"11111011's\" position of \"2\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table(e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is taken as its value while \"11000111\" in the \"Permutation Table\" picks \"11011101\" (\"11111011\" x 2) and it is decrypted out in the second step through a\nseries of steps.\n\nDecryption follows the same pattern but it follows the Pre-Invers permutation, Pre-Inv to Permuted table and then Permuted table to Inverse table (preinv,inv).\n\nA 0 is subtracted from the letter \"W\" to make it becomes 4 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 4 is subtracted from other values in the Permutation Table. Now, \"W\" is taken to \"O\", it's' position of \"4\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table (e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is picked and in a permutation\nof table it becomes \"1\" since a 4 is subtracted. Now it's value in pre-Inv,inv table is 2. Through a serier of steps \"W\" (value 1 at Inverse table) is decrypted out.\n\n\nYou can also try with the other cipher rules to encrypt and decrypt the following cipher text:\n\n\n\n\n### Cipher Rules:\n\n- Given a ciphertext, 3 step cipher rule, and key, encrypt/decrypt the ciphertext.[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101 to KIOKRKIOCRIRKIARCRIVKIARCRKR\n- Given a ciphertext, 3 step cipher rule, and key, encrypt/decrypt the ciphertext.

Your response should follow the specified encryption and decryption rules exactly, as described in the [instructions](instructions.html# INSTRUCTIONS).\n2. For security reasons, you should only share encrypted sample data with the owner of the dataset. If need be, you can encrypt sample data using any appropriate tool before sharing it.\n3. To prevent replaying your response, make a small change in your code so it won’t be considered as a duplicate and still remain under a different name. For example, on run-time replace a fixed integer of your code by a variable (as a temporary measure).\n\n### Submitting Data:\nThis challenge involves creating encrypted and decrypted data based on an encryption rule. When submitting your encrypted data as CCDD data, please ensure consistency with the formatting of the encryption rule [below.](images/cipherimageexample.png) For example, if the cipher rule has a variable \"k_q_x,\" please ensure that its value is correctly represented as a sequence of numbers. In the encryption rule for \"k_q_x\", the left side string\"12,\" is not part of the data and the right side digit is actually\"12\". But the CCDD challenge requires that both the digits\"1\" and\"2\" be shown, and there is a blank space after the digit, so that the \"k\" values: 1 and 2 are combined into 12.\n### Note:\nYour submission will be scored and annotated by Kaggle during the grading process. Any changes made to your submission will result in it being graded by this system again and a new score calculated accordingly. Therefore it's often best to make final changes after the final deadline, as Kaggle accounts for multiple days to review and score. Kaggle does not perform a manual check of any particular question, after the final deadline.\n\nThe encrypted and decrypted input and output formats for this challenge are shown below. The rules are in the encrypted form.\n\n![Encrypted and Decrypted Data Format](images/cipherimageexample.png)\n\n### Encryption rule:\n\nPlaintext:\n**Input data**\n- k: 12\n\n![encrypted cipher example with plain text N](images/cipherrule-encryptedcipher.png)\n\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- For each letter p in the plaintext:\n    - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n    - Calculate x * k as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n- Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n![Decrypated cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 936](images/cipherrule-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 984,840,804](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedCiphertext).png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted cipher text PO and its decrypted answer 862](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n### Hints:\n- Consider if you need to get from an alpha charachter (e.g., 'a' code 97) to a decimal value (e.g., 97 / 10 = 9.7).\n- Note that the \"plaintext\" is usually in UPPERCASE while \"ciphertext\" is in lower-case.\n- When submitting your scores will be shown as a range. The final value in the range is the score that the owner would give if the score was made in the same way as the final score.\n### Submission format: Answers\n",
