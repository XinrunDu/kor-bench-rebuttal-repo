None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, ¬(p∧q)∧¬w can be written either as ¬p∧¬¬q∧¬w [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or ¬p∧(¬q∧¬w) ∨ ¬p∧¬q∧¬w (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of ¬p↔p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, ¬p∨¬q is logically equivalent to ¬p∧¬q. In contrast, ​¬(p∨q)¬r\n][1] is not a logical implication of ¬p∨¬q¬r because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition ¬p∨q¬r can be reduced to ¬p∧¬q∨¬r.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p∨¬p^(¬q∧¬r) -p^¬q^¬r (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p∨ψ` the [`p∧¬ψ’ `p∧ψ](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & ¬A)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P ∨ Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. ¬Q (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q ∨ ¬P (disjunction). When it is true ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) is true ∧(¬P ∨ ¬Q)] (logical ∨). When it is true ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)) = ¬P ∨Q] ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) = P ∨ Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P ∨ Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A ∨ ∧(B ∨ C ... N.) for the DNF `(A ∨ (B ∨ (C ∨ ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) ∨/∨[(X ∨ Y ∨ Z ∨ ... N. ∨ X ∨ Y). ∨ (X ∨ Y ∨ Z ... N) ∨X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p∧q∧r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p ∧ (q ∧ r))))) ∧((q ∧ (p ∧ r))) ∧((r ∧ (p ∧ q)))] ∧((r ∧ (p & (q ∧ r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p ∧ Q)(p ∧ R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P ∨ Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: ¬(¬A∧¬B)→(A∨B) ((¬ A∨¬ B)→( A∧ B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P ∨ Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q∧¬r&¬q∧r^(¬¬p∨¬p∧r∧¬r∧p^(¬p∧¬r^(¬¬q^¬p^(¬r∧¬q)))>= (p∧¬¬p∧¬q)^p∧q∧¬r`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. ¬P ∨(P^¬¬Q))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## 使用与输出格式：编写符合格式的逻辑配置和输出。\n\n- 使用自定义规则的定制逻辑配置，从输入字符流中回答，生成符合自定义规则格式的回答并写到输出字符流中。\n> 输入： 字符流，满足以下格式`[输入字符流:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **问题**: `[“**Output:**”，格式：\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> 将自定义规则的定制逻辑配置应用到字符流输入`[“'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `输出`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n用[0]中的函数实现输出。\n\n\n## 编译选项：\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# 实现：\n\n## 1). 自定义逻辑  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). 实现文字输入([LNOT^2和calculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). 逻辑输入输出格式([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). 编译参数,错误信息返回([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)",

If x is a circle, x is a sphere.\nIllustration:\nFor each circle x,x is like a sphere, because every circle can be like the Sun when the Earth is stationary.\nAnalysis: If an object x meets the definition of 'circle', and it is still consistent with this definition after adding x has \"capacity to revolve\", then x also coincides with the definition of 'circle' after the change. Therefore, x cannot be a sphere.\nProof:\n1. If x is a circle, then it also has \"capacity to revolve\".\n2. If a circle has 'capacity to move freely', it is the Sun.\n3. If an object x is the Sun, then x is a sphere.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n\n\n2. If x is a quadrilateral, x cannot be a regular one.\nIllustration:\nTake the square as an example, the sides of the square form a regular quadrilateral, but they are not a regular one.\nAnalysis: The definition of 'circle' has a number of conditions to satisfy, to ensure the meaning of 'circle', which is consistent with some rules of 'circle'. The definition of 'quadrangular' has a number of conditions to satisfy, but it is not based on the combination of some concepts to form a regular one, because there is no combination of two or more sets of 'triangle', and squares are all quadrilaterals , so it is a kind of regular one, not conform to a definition of 'quadrangular'.\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrilateral, then x has at least one of the 4 types of 'triangle', the regular one included.\n2. If x has 'triangle', and it is a regular one, then x agrees with the definition of 'quadrangular' but is not a regular one.\n3. Therefore, if x is not a quadrilateral, then it cannot be a regular one.\nConclusion: If x is a quadrilateral, then x cannot be a regular one.\n\n\n3. All quadrangles (are) quadrilateral?\nIllustration:\nSquares, trapezoids, rhombi are all quadriangular, but not just added.\nAnalysis: quadrilateral(is)quadrangular(be) can be regarded as a conclusion. Its entry must agree with the definition of quadrangle (or triangular), can be interpreted as saying that a quadrilateral is quadrilateral absolutely correct. Since the squares' definition is the combination of regular tetrahedron and diagonal triangle, since the two pieces of a regular tetrahedron embedded in this tetrahedral combination and the line of two of the corners of the rhombus are the sum of the diagonal triangle's description, is consistent with the definition of triangular, which is called a quadrangle absolutely correct from quadrilateral definition. So the correct one conclusion is truly the meaning quads(is)quadrangular(be)\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrangle, then it must be a combination of quadrilateral or triangular.\n2. If x is a combination of quadrilateral, x is quadangled.\nConclusion: x is a quadrilateral wherever it is.\n\n### Question:\nProve the following propositions using analytical and judgment principles (3 hypotheses and 1 conclusion).\n\n1. If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n2. If x is a sphere, then x is a planet.\n3. If x is a planet, then x has an orbital ring around it.\n\nA total of 3 propositions must be proven. Prove the following 3 pairs of propositions in order using the Homological Domain:\n\n(1) 1 and 3 (2) 1 and 2 (3) 2 and 3\n\nDetermine which combinations can be proved at a time. Do not repeat the same proposition or use the same proposition combination twice (such as using the statement\"if A, then B\" and \"if B, then A\" in the same part). Assuming that your reasoning order and the verification of the principle sequence of the conditions will be considered during the examination of non-mathematical errors, such as arbitrary creation of Proposition, intentional reversal of inference, and substitution of the conclusion of a statement with a false proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n1. If x is not the sphere, then it is the sun.\nIllustration:\nLet the circle be the sun, as the sun, with a ring of orbital mirror around the edge, and there is a circle, which is not just a planet. If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\nAnalysis:\n If x is a circle, by definition, x is not just a sun and a spherical surface with an interstellar ring around the edge.\nIf x is a sphere, and x has a spherical surface, a belt is hanging around, and the edge is oval, x is a planet.\nIf x is a planet, then the spiral has to be around it too.\nProof:\n1. If a circle is not a sphere, the sun is not obviously.\n2. If x is a sphere with a ring of orbital mirrors like the sun, x is clearly a planet.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\n\n2. If x is not the planet, then x is a cube.\nIllustration:\nThe diameter of the planet is an arm’s distance, and its outer edge is an arm’s distance.\nAnalysis:\nIf the planet is not a sphere, the diameter of the planet cannot be an arm’s distance, so a planet can be small that can accommodate the body. If x is a sphere, and x has an oval outer surface, the width of x’s radius is smaller than an arm, so the outer hex radius can also be smaller than an arm’s distance. Therefore, x is not the cube (is not a sphere or planet (is) cube).\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, it is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a sphere with a belt-like ring around its legs, then it must be the cube, because the radius is smaller than the arm.\nConclusion: If x is a planet, then x is a cube.\nConclusion: x can not be the cube.\n\n3. If x is not the cube, then x has a memory.\n1. Every continent has enough room to hold half of the world.\n2. Only the space on the bottom of the world and in orbits is available, so if anything exists in the universe, there must be something in the orbit.\nAnalysis:\nIt may be a cube, it has no core;\nbecause the volume of the cube is very large, it cannot be stored within three continents, which is too small. Therefore, the only possibility is that there is no core to make the volume look huge.\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, x is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a planet’s spherical surface, orbiting x orbit 1 is absolutely impossible and can be ruled out, so x must be x, so x is the Sun.\n3. If x is a sphere orbiting x, then it must be a planet, and it is impossible to have a planet within the orbiting distance, so x is not a permanent one.\nConclusion: If x is a cube, then x has a core.\nConclusion: x is not a cube.\nWith the combination of propositions is not enough to prove.\n1, 2, 3 are sufficient conditions/not enough conditions, they can only prove a relationship between proposition/can not prove the truth of the combination of propositions, need to use the corresponding way to proved to be not enough to prove truth.\n\n### Question:\nSymbolise and verify the following proposition using the analytical principle (analogy principle) and judgment principle (proof by contradiction principle).\n\n(1) (A1 v A 2) ⇒ ((( A 2 Λ A 1) Λ (( A 1 Λ A 2) Λ ( A 1 Λ A 2))) Λ (( A 1 Λ A 2) Λ ( A 1 Λ A 2)\n\n(2) A 2Λ(A 1 Λ(",

The conditional statement, in and of itself, can take on two possible truth values: true and false.\n\nTo determine the truth value of the sentence, we need to consider the inputs:\nThe sentence has three inputs:\n- The company has received awards [M],\n- The awards were announced this year [AT], and\n- The awards were accepted [PD].\n\nThe relationship between these three inputs is captured by the sentence, \"If the company received awards and the awards were announced, then we received compensation based on the results. (AT ↔ &p.\"\n\nThe proposition will be true if and only if either:\n1. the company has received awards and the awards were not announced, which means\nAT ∧ ¬P or P ∧ ¬AT, or\n2. the company has not received awards and the awards were not announced, which means P ∧ ¬AT\nSo the proposition will be false if neither the company has received rewards nor the awards were announced\n\nNow we refer back to the conditional statement. Note that the company has received awards is given by ∧ (M, p). The conditional statement, is represented by the formula ⇒ (AT, OR (&p). Therefore, the proposition will be holding any one of the following rules:\n• If the company announced the awards (AT ↔ ∧p), then the proposition will be holding true, if and only if: at ∧(p), which means AT∧ ∧M↔ P.\n• If M is a premise and the proposition fails, then the proposition may be false: so it will be false, if either M is false or AT is not true or they both are true. Therefore, the proposition may be true, if and only if M is true.\n\nSo the proposition is a conditional truth. In other words, the first line of the second paragraph is saying that AT is a premise, while the last line of the first paragraph is saying that only if P fails can the proposition be false\n\nThe question asks us to identify the following property: (The proposition is a condition)\n• If P were to occur, then ¬AT would be a premise [AT = M], the latter statement is either false or is false and may result from the former\n• If P were to also occur, then ¬AT will be a premise [AT = N], and the proposition will either fail or succeed [Proposition hold whichever value of possible truth].\nThe conditional will only occur if AT = true [IF TRUE.→true.]; if ¬AT = true, OR (AT∧ &p) the proposition will be a false statement.\n\nThe third term of the conditional statement can be written as follows: 'If Mnp or AP & p, then the conditional staten will be true (OR [M&p & &p)). The phrase & p will follow the same rule as follows:\nM NP p → At\nON\nOR ( M&p) P\nBUT\nOR (¬AT&P)\n\nThe final term of the conditional is: if¬M&p→AT. The conditional will also be\n\nQuestion",

If someone makes mistakes in their research and the mistakes are not corrected, then the study will receive negative ratings from all scholars. Considering the number of studies, mistakes can be made very gradually and can even go unnoticed. We see that when a new study is developed, several researchers gather in the same place and sit down on a table and start to discuss the study and try to prove how bad the study is. However, we can say that one or two important points can be made against this study and the rest of the scholars' contribution to such a study can be seen as positive.\n\nIn this example, which method was mentioned by the researchers used (regarding how the research works)?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ꙮ Method   D. ⵣ Method   E. ⚘ Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nIn physics, there is a formula called $A_{ds} = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} F_{opp} \\, dr$, which states that the moment of the external force $F_{opp}$ is proportional to the distance $r$ travelled by the external force to produce the moment of the force about a point. In analytic geometry, the concept of moment-generating function (MMGF) finds important applications in statistics. By applying the technique of Runge–Kutta, the MMGF is calculated,\nwhich proves that there is no universal formulation using just to avoid fictitious forces (nonconservative forces). In real life, if an astronaut is taken in a chair by a rocket with no thrust, the astronaut's weight does not change with a change in $r$. For example, consider a ball with the same mass and shape. It is lifted from your desk at the same time. If you have a convex mirror with a mirror curvature of $20$ m, the external force will definitely affect the astronaut. Or if you are on a moving bus with no external forces, the astronaut's weight will not change.\n\nIn the example given above, which method is used?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ReusableCell   D. ReusableCell compositor   E. ReusableCell compositor\n\nPlease note that in the case of answers E, choose ReusableCell compositor.

The environment can influence how a plant looks and how well it grows. The plant's stem gets longer in good growing conditions, and it grows to become taller and bigger. It can also grow to be very bushy and wide in order to protect itself from any bad weather. But not in every growing environment, the stem can grow horizontally like in a forest and naturally, in an environment of rocks and gravels, where the stem is resistant to any climatic changes.\n\nIn this scenario, which method was applied by the researchers?\nA. ReusableCell   B.ReusableCell compositer   C.ReusableCell composer   D. composer\nE.ReusableCell compositer\n\nPlease note that in the case of answers E, choose ReusableCell composer if the answer is not listed as an answer, choose the answer `ReusableCell compositri further instructions on the review.\n\n### Answer:\n[[ReusableCell composer]]\n\n### Question:\nA researcher has collected data on the relationship between income $I$ and the number of siblings $B$ on a dataset.

On 3 September 1950, Lt Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base was flying a H-80M equipped with USMC operations around the Philippine Sea when he found a suspected Type 1 diesel-electric submarine in the aircraft's radar. Due to insufficient ammunition, Tran simply disembarked on the submarine to capture it alive (because the submarine did not have a crew), but was captured by the water on the submarine. According to the subsequent account of Chinese Naval Lieutenant Commander Jiang Wu: “Under the command of Lt Col Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base, a H-80M equipped with USMC operations was cruising over the Philippine Sea at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the water. During the search and reconnaissance, the submarine suddenly appeared on the radar of the H-80M, which was very unexpected. After the dive of the submarine, the H-80M tried to launch the hand launch AA missile, but the launch failed. The missile was not within the effective range of the target 20 nautical miles, and hitting other targets was difficult.
