Implement your solutions independently by exploring Pyzo or a comparable Python IDE as suggested in the Introduction to Python in Data Science.\n2. To complete the prerequisite challenge, please introduce the relevant import statements, and import the PIL module used to import the required images from the sister programs you have built.\n3. Save your solutions independently in a separate directory. If you are using macOS, your filename should have the extensions '.py3' (where 'py3' indicates Python 3), and the file should be named 'main.py'. Then launch Pyzo and bring up the terminal. Assuming you created this file in ~/eMMC2.0, replace the current working directory with the path /eMMC2.0 on the hardware, and run this program in the terminal:\n\n<code>$ python3 main.py</code>\n\n### If you've solved the task successfully, your output should be equivalent to the following:\n\n<code>Welcome to Crime City!

Find m, given that 3^m+2^m=p, where 2^p-p^2=18.\nThe answer should only be given as a positive integer.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[11/16]]\n\n### Question:\nThe equation 2^n+6^n-126=30 is true for two distinct positive integers n.\nCompute their sum.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[18]]\n\n### Explanation to determine the value of m :\nThe question states that 3^m + 2^m = 30, and 2^p - p^2 = 18. We need to find the values of m and p that simultaneously satisfy both equations.\nFor the first equation, we can rewrite it as:\n2^m * 3^m = 30\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\nm * log2 + m * log3 = log30\n\nSince log2 and log3 cannot be combined with log10, we can consider log2 = a and log3 = b:\n\na + b + (m * a * b) = log30\n\nSolving for m, we get:\nm = ((log30)/(a + b) - 1)\n\nNow, we can use the second equation to find the sum of m, pi, and p:\nsum = m + pi + p\n\nSince pi cannot be expressed in terms of only natural logarithms, we cannot find the value of pi directly. However, by using the relation between a and b (a = log2 and b = log3), we can simplify the equation using logarithmic identities:\n\nlog2 * log3 + log2 * a + log3 * a = log30\nlog2 * (log3 + a) = log2 + log10\n\nSubstituting the expression for log2, we obtain:\n\n(b + a) * (a + b) * a = log10 - (b + a)\n(b + a) * (2ab + a^2) = log10 - b - a\n(b + a) * (2ab + a^2 + b + a) = log10 - b - a + b + a\n2ab + ab^2 + a^3 = log10\na^3 + (2ab + ab^2) = log10\na^3 + a(2b + ab) = log10\na(a^2 + 2b + ab) = log10\n\nSince a^2 + 2b + ab = 1, we have:\na^2 + 2b + ab = a(a^2 + 2b + ab)\na^2 + 2a + 2b = 0\n\nSolving for b, we get:\nb = (1 - a)/2\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of b in the expression for a^3 + (2ab + ab) and simplify:\na^3 + a((1 - a)/2 + a) = log10\na^3 + a(1 - a^2 + 2a) = log10\na^3 + a - a^3 + 2a^3 = log10\n3a^3 = log10\nsolving for a, a = ((log10)^(1/3))\n\nFrom the relation between a and b (a = log2, b = log3), we can find b:\nb = (1 - a)/2 = (1 - (log10)^(1/3))/2\n\nNow, we can substitute these values of a and b in the expression for the sum (m + p + pi):\nsum = m + p + pi = (log10^(1/21) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10^(1/6) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10^(1/3) - (log10)^(1/3))/2\nsum = ((log10)^(1/21) - (log10)^(1/3))/2 + (log10)^(1/6) - (log10)^(1/3)\n\nThis is the final value of the sum.\nNOTE: You can evaluate the equation any way you like. At the end, you should just end up getting another expression that can be simplified further.",

Therefore, we should consider if there is an answer that follows the rule and hides the root.\n\nWe can refer to known cases with roots:\n\na^b = \\sqrt[b]{a^b}\na^{b+\\c{n}} = \\sqrt[b]{a} * \\sqrt[b]{a^{b+\\c{n}-\\c{1}}}\na^{b+\\c{2}} = \\sqrt[b]{a}\\sqrt[b]{a^{b}}\n\nIn this case, if a=b, then we'd have 3^3=3 to prove:\n5=\\sqrt{3+3}\\\\\n5=\\sqrt{6\\\\\nTherefore, 5 is a 4%3.\n\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\frac{15+\\sqrt{75}}{2}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {5*4} = 25+\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{5+4}+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {2} =\\sqrt {20+\\sqrt {20}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {5+\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {4}}\\\\\n5+\\sqrt {5}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt {20-2\\sqrt {}}{20-2\\sqrt {5}}}=\\sqrt {\\sqrt { 45-14\\sqrt {5}}}\n\n25+\\sqrt {16} = 36\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{25+\\sqrt{20+\\sqrt{20}}}\\sqrt{\\sqrt { 5}+{\\sqrt {4}}}=\\sqrt{\\sqrt {25+5+2\\sqrt{5}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt{\\sqrt{30+\\sqrt{60+20}}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt {\\sqrt 60+4+2\\sqrt4 +2\\sqrt(5*\\sqrt2)}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt 6}=3\\sqrt{\\sqrt {15}+2\\sqrt3+{2\\sqrt2}}\\\\\n25+\\sqrt {16} =\\sqrt3\\sqrt 15\\\\\n36 = 6\\sqrt5\\text{ ans.}\\sqrt{30+6\\sqrt 5}\n\nNow, 16%8 should be 0 and 16%6 should be 3.\n\n- Therefore, the answer is 3+\\sqrt{15}.\n\n- 16%1 should be 4, 16%2 should be 64 and 16%1 should be 64.\n\n- 16%5+5 should be 25+\\sqrt{5}\\sqrt {5+4.} Multiplying the number on the top can produce `25+5`, which is indeed proven in the above work.\n\nThe best answer is `5-+-\\sqrt {5}\\sqrt {\\sqrt {45-14\\sqrt {5}}}.\\text{With the first answer, take the value as 64, then multiply the two terms to get back to the original result.\n\n###### Solution 2:\n\nIn this question, the root of the answer is 2. Based on this result, the answer should look like:\n\n3+\\sqrt{2}\n\n3 is mulitplyied by the root 2, which also equals 2, ensuring that the given equation is valid.\n\nSince 16%4=0 and 16%6=3, the answer would be `[[2+\\sqrt{16-6}]]`.\n\nHowever, we should write it in the form `[[2+\\sqrt{x}]` `[[16-x]] The second problem:\n\n4%2 =  4 * 2 - 2^{4-1} = 8 - 16 / 3\n\n4%1 =  4 * 1 = 4\n",

Globalization, documentation, and maintenance:\n\nI'd like to know your thoughts.\n\n<code>Error: expected property\nProperty `a` has to be specified. \n```\n  a=b\n  t[a] = b\n</code>\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/editor/problems/split-an-array-in-parts/\n\nI can't seem to understand what exactly I'm supposed to do. Where am I going wrong?\n\nIn total we have 26 labels (0,1,...,25). They are representing the set of letters in all other characters in the string. The way to think about this question is that each letter is divided into 3 sets: Set A (1st Letter), Set B (2nd Letter) and Set C (3rd Letter). These letters cannot be from the same letter. The elements of A can be from B but not B from C. The elements of B can be from both A and C but not A from C. The elements of C can be from both A and B but not A from B. The letter T has no important thing so can be anything, even Set A, Set B or Set C.\n\n<code>def func(str)\n  A, B, C = [], [], []\n  (0...25).each do |letter|\n    (0...str.length).each do |i|\n      if str[i] == (\"a\"*(letter % 3).chars.sample)\n        A << letter\n      else if str[i] == (\"b\"*(letter % 3 + 1).chars.sample)\n        B << letter\n      else if str[i] == (\"c\"*(letter % 3 - 1).chars.sample)\n  C << letter\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  res = []\n  1...@str.length - 1.to_i.step(3).to_a.each do |i|\n    if A[i] >= C[i+1]\n      res << \"T\"\n    end\n  end\n  str = str[0...str.length - 1 + 1.to_i.step(3).to_a.reverse]\n  \"T\" + res << A[0...str.length] + B[0...str.length]\nend\nstr = \"accbb\"\n`func str` #bT\n</code>\n\nLink to console.\n\nI'm really confused on how to even think about solving this question. I also have to write an assert method to do some testing?\n\n<code>class Solution\ndef smallest_factor(n)\n  return n if n==1\n  for i in 1....100001 do\n    if n%i==0 then return i else --end\n  end\nend\n\nassert smallest_factor(62) == 2\n</code>\n\nYou're given an array A of size N. Complete the function to print the minimum element in the given array.\n\n<code>const minimum = function(array) {\n  if (!array || array.length == 0) \n    throw new Error(\"array cannot be zero or empty\");\n  else {\n  var minimum = array[0]; //could be your min\n  array.forEach (function (elem, index, array) {      \n  if (elem <= minimum) minimum = elem;\n  });\n  return minimum;\n  }\n};\n\nconst array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; \nconsole.log(minimum(array)); // 1\nconsole.log(minimum([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ])); // 1</code>\n\nAfter some struggle, I came up with this solution finally.\nBut it only checks up to <code>n^3</code> ~= 10^9. It seems you can pass the test cases when <code>7 > n^3</code>, despite I did add the border cases when I was debugging the test results.\n\n[Edit] Maybe my solution is too slow? How can I improve the performance?\n[Edit2] The runtime error happened here: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array.
