Please save detailed encryption code and decryption code as python file. Each file contains a single text block and is saved as  `Encryption-address.zip“ or  “(Decryption-address-your zip package).`\n\n## Submission process\n\n- Each user is allowed 10 submissions. However, in order to ensure the fairness of the competition, the number of submissions for entire users is limited to 100. If you submit in violation, the submission may be invalidated and a corresponding deduction will be made.\n\n## Score mechanism\n\n- The score will be calculated based on the accuracy of the ciphertext or plaintext generated and the text it produces using your given cipher. If it is consistent with the required output, 40 points will be awarded for accuracy.\n- Code efficiency will be evaluated. If completed within 50 ms, 25 points will be awarded for efficiency.\n- Code quality will be evaluated. If the code logic is clear, the code itself is concise, and the variables used are correct, then 25 points will be awarded for quality.\n- A final score of 100 points will be awarded for accuracy, efficiency, and quality.\n",

Please provide the results for this activity.\n\n### Solution:\n**Encryption Steps:**   \n- **Convert Each Letter to Binary:** Convert each character in the plaintext to its ASCII value, which is then converted to an 8-bit binary string.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of each character and the fixed key. Repeat the key if necessary to match the length of the binary representation. This operation results in the cipher text.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**   \n- **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:** Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n- **Inverse Permutation:** Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n- **Convert Binary to Character:** Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent. Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n\n**Input (plaintext):** \"SOLUTION\"\n**Output (ciphertext):** 1111100111111001111100001110000001110010011100010111001011111001110110100111000110110010\n**Ciphertext (plaintext):** \"SOLUTION\"\n\n**Input (ciphertext):** 1110110001110110111001000111111100010010011100000011110111110011111000011101000110110111001100\n**Output (plaintext):** \"HIVERSION\"\n\n### Question:\nGiven the plaintext/ciphertext you have provided, please develop your own cipher text rule and encrypt the plaintext or decrypt the ciphertext following your chosen rule.\n\n### Solution:\n**Encryption Steps:**   \n- **Convert Each Letter to Binary:** Convert each character in the plaintext to its ASCII value, which is then converted to an 8-bit binary string.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of each character and the fixed key. Repeat the key if necessary to match the length of the binary representation. This operation results in the cipher text.\n- **Permutation:** To produce more randomized result, use a new unique permutation for any given plaintext.  The user will need to use a custom generated permutation as input to this key, which will make the cipher unpredictable. The custom permutation is generated using the users name and the month/day/year of their birthday. This will result in a permutation that is unique to each user.\n- **Result:** This would result in unique each plaintext with a unique ciphertext out put.\n**Decryption Steps:**   \n- **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:** Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n- **Convert Binary to Character:** Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent. Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n\n### Question:\nBased on your final answer generated, write your own scenario (imaginary/real world) in which it can be used/applied.\n\n### Answer:\n#### Scenario:\n**Protecting Confidential Information in Sensitive Documents:**\nImagine a situation where you work with confidential company documents filled with sensitive information, including employee data, financial statements, project plans, or legal contracts. To ensure the confidentiality of this information, you decide to use a custom encryption cipher.\n\n### Input:\nYour input would include the sensitive document containing the confidential information.\n\n### Output:\nAfter applying the encryption algorithm, you would have an encrypted version of the document. Only authorized personnel with the decryption key would be able to read the contents of the document. This would be your output.\n\n#### Benefits and Drawbacks:\n\n### Benefits:\n\n- **Confidentiality:** The encryption provides confidentiality by transforming readable data into an unintelligible cipher text.\n\n- **Secure Transmission:** If the document needs to be shared with others, such as business partners or consultants, the encryption algorithm ensures the security of the document during transmission over networks, even if it falls into unauthorized hands.\n\n- **Compliance:** If your industry or work requires strict adherence to security protocols or is legally mandated, using a custom encryption cipher can help you ensure compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n### Drawbacks:\n\n- **Complexity:** Creating and managing your own custom encryption algorithms can be complex and time-consuming. It requires specialized knowledge and expertise to design an algorithm that is both secure and easy to use.\n\n- **Key Management:** With custom algorithms, you would need to manage and secure the encryption/decryption keys effectively. The loss or compromise of these keys could potentially make it impossible to read the encrypted document.\n\n- **Compatibility:** Custom encryption algorithms may not always be compatible with standard encryption protocols used in software, hardware, or cloud services. This could potentially restrict your options for sharing or using encrypted data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy utilizing your own custom encryption algorithm, you can protect the sensitive information in your documents, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and read the data. This can enhance overall data security and compliance with regulations, while also addressing the challenges associated with custom solutions, such as complexity and key management.\n\n\n### Solution:\nIn summary, the benefit of using a custom encryption cipher is that it provides a high level of security by implementing a more complex and personalized encryption algorithm. Potential drawback that using a custom cipher includes potential for mistakes in implementation or requirements for expensive equipment and specialized personnel. Overall, the use of a custom encryption cipher can be useful for high-security operations where standard encryption may not be adequate. However, it does require significant time and money to implement and maintain.\n",
