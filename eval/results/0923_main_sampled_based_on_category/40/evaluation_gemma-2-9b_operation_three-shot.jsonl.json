By the rule, we get 2*2*3+4-2 = 14. Then [[14]] is the final answer.\n* For the second question, follow the same steps and get [[30]].\n* For the third question, we find that k>=4, so y cannot be larger than 20. Then k=4 and y=1. Double check to ensure that you got the correct answer.\n* For the fourth question, you can see that d is always the highest element in the expression. Therefore, k=2. Try different values for y and you will get y=1. Double check to ensure that you got the correct answer.\n* For the fifth question, you have to find a set of values for k and y that satisfy the given values for the expressions. Try different combinations of k and y until you find a set that satisfies both conditions.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to a mathematical expression.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations.\n\n2. If your answer is not an integer, your answer in code should be a float.\n\n3. If your answer does not satisfy one or more of these restrictions, your answer could be wrong. If we can't be sure, we will not grade your code.\n\n4. Carefully compare your answer to be sure it satisfies the constraints specified below.\n\n### Rule Definition:\n\n1. Add, minus, multiply, division, power (^) operations are allowed\n2. Numbers on both sides of equals sign are integers.\n3. There is no restriction on the number of elements on either side of the equal sign, but we are only interested in the element on the first index.\n4. If the number of elements is odd, the result of the operation on odd indexed elements are summed up to get the final answer.\n5. If the number of elements is even, the result of the operation on even indexed elements are multiplied up to get the final answer.\n\n### Example:\n\na = 14, b = -6, c = 7, d = 3, e = 2\n-1 = a+b+c-d-e\n14n+!n^4*c-d^3*e+c^2*d-e3*d^n+e^c is wrong because there is no element at index 12\n14n+!n^4*c-d^3*e+c^2*d-e3*d^n+e^c is wrong because n and ^ are used to denote the multiplication of the elements in a group rather than the multiplication of the operation's results.\n\n### Question:\n\nabcde=f/30\nabce=11\nac=3|3\naddcdefgh+i=j+k\nIf addcdefgh is the largest odd prime number that ends with digit 5, a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k=?\n\n### Answer: [[28]]\n",

For example, have 10 and 27, and swap them. If you had 27, and you make it equal to 10 as well as making 10 equal to swaped 27. This makes it that you have two new variables, but you changed the value one of those two variables. The original 10 is set to 10 and the original 27 is set to 10. They are no longer two different values. I want you to explain this. How did they become the exact same value? How do you swap? Why does this work?\n\n### Answer:\nThe swap equation is x = y, y = x. If you inputted x and y, they equal eachother. So lets say we had y value of two and an x value of four. So when you do x = y, four equals two. There are two ways of thinking about it. One way is that the x value of four, now equals two. The other way, is that the y value of two, now equals four. Both ways of thinking about it, both ways the original x values becomes two, and original y's become four.\n\n### Question:\nYou're working on a project in Python, you are using iterables, lists, dictionaries, a bunch of custom classes, shape, and a bunch of stuff. You set a variable equal to input('Please input your name: '). You are now asked to convert the name to uppercase, and using lowercase, create a custom variable. The name's first letter should be capitalized. You are being asked to type out custom code in English.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven a list of strings s = ['abcd', 'life', 'a', 'b', 'z', ''], you are asked to clean these strings. To clean a string, you should return it in capital form if the length of the string is greater than 0, and if the list is at least one character long, you are asked to leave it uppercase. You are also asked to capitalize the first letter if the length of the string is greater than one character.\n\n### Question:\nYou're given a list in Python called a = [1, 2, 3], and a function called square. write out your best definition of this question in English. The input will be the list. What should you return?\n\n### Answer:\nIt is being asked to return a square variable. You are given a function square, which is not prewritten. The question asks to write out the function.\n\n### Question:\nYou're working with a list in Python called a = ['a', 'b', 'c'. 'd']. There is a function that returns 'a', then 'b', then 'b', 'c'. Then 'd', then 'd'. Then it goes back to 'a', then 'b', then 'b', then 'c'. Then it cycles through all the variables once, and says again.\n\n### Answer:\nWrite a function in Python, called odd or even, which gives the input either 'even', or 'odd'. Or it returns the word 'equal', which is another custom variable. If the last digit is zero or two, or four, or six, or eight, it should return 'even'. If the last digit is one or three, or five, or seven, it should return odd. And if the number is the even if it's zero, or a one, it returns equal\n\n### Question:\nYou are given a list a = [6, 5, 4, 9, 1, 3]. You are being asked to change everything that is equal to three or higher. Change it to 'a' and '1'. You are now asked to change anything from the input one to nine, which is seven, to 'b', and anything else to 'c'. Then return the resulting list.\n\n### Answer:\nYou are working with Python. You are given the pseudovariable p1 and v12. You are writing code in your head, and you are given pseudo variable 'a' and 'b'. You are creating a custom function. Given the two variables p1 and v12, p1 value is six. You are adding one to p1 and assign it to p2, and p2 = seven. You are then adding one to p2 and assigning to p3. You have to assign p3 value to p4, and p3 should take a value of p2, then the value of p3 should be what p4's value is. So when you add one to p3, it equals p4, and p3 equals p4. If v12 is true, you need to print 'p4 does not equal three', if v12 is false, you need to print 'p4 equals three'.",

        "response": "[[2]]\n\n### Explanation:\nAccording to the given rule,\n5¥X=5^X-(X^5)=4.\n\nLet's deduce the equation according to this rule, by solving X.\n5^X=(X^5)+4\nUsing the fact that X>4, we can calculate as follows:\n5^3=(3^5)+116\n5^4=(4^5)+80\n137=(4^5)+249. This is an equation of the form a^b, where both a and b are numbers, and is therefore unsolvable by hand. However, using Wolfram Alpha, we obtain:\nX=4.29417.(This number is not rational, as it is not a pure power of five.)\nThere is no doubt that this result is correct, as substituting any number for X greater than 5^4 will result in values below 4.\nTherefore, no rational number can satisfy the requirements of the equation. The answer to this question is a rational number. Using this principle, we can find the answer to the question:\nAs 5 is not a power of 3, 5 must be less than the fifth root of 5^3.\nSince this ratio is less than 1, we can approximate it to 1 by dividing it evenly into the larger of the two sides.\nThis yields a result for 2, which is 5, or 5000 in decimal notation.\nSince this number is not rational, it cannot be used, and the question is indeed unanswered.\n\n### Question: \na¥b=\\a^b-\\b^a.

Then, we can simply let a=b=5, and solve for the 10001st term.\nLet a=b=5, then\n    1^5=5^1-1^5=24.\n    2^5=5^2-2^5=15.\n    3^5=5^3-3^5=8.\n    4^5=5^4-4^5=1.\n    5^5=5^5-5^5=0.\n    6^5=5^6-6^5=1.\n    7^5=5^7-7^5=24.\n    8^5=5^8-8^5=49.\n    9^5=5^9-9^5=161.\n    10^5=5^10-10^5=5^{9}-10^{9}.\nWe can notice a regular rhythm in the above series, which can be further explored.",

The operation involves two variables *a* and *b* that are combined using the symbol *⊕*, forming a mathematical equation. This equation involves addition (*+*), multiplication (**), subtraction, division (*/).\n\nThe rule assigned to the operator *⊕* states that (*a* *b) = (*a+bi*)\n\nTo accurately apply this rule, you’ll need to analyze the problem and recognize the values of *a* and *b* in each part of the problem. These values are represented by the numerical expressions enclosed by the parentheses.\n\nThe problem is asking you to evaluate several expressions using this operation. Each expression involves three terms, these are:\n\n- *({2}) ⊕ [{})\n- *({}) ⊕ (\n- x ⊕ 2) × 3 =\n\nThe problem tasks you with finding the answer, which should be a number or a series of numbers. This means your final answer should be a single value, not a set of different numbers.\n\nThe final answer should be included in double square brackets as part of a single answer.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf we were to evaluate the expression *({2}) ⊕ (³, then using the rule given, we’d find the answer is *([5+2i]*.\n\nIn this specific example the answer must be *([+2i] as an expression of *[5\n\nRemember to double check your final answer to make sure that it meets the conditions of the problem.\n\nThe following resources can be helpful in solving this problem:\n\n* [Khan Academy’s Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)\n* [MathCSQUARE’s Number Theory and Algebra Course](https://httpwww.mathcsquare.com/number-theory-algebra-courses).\n* [Advanced Algebra Set Theory](https://www.mathcsquare.com/advanced-algebra-set-theory).\n\n### Similar problems\n\nHere are some similar problems you can try once you understand the solution:\n\n- Evaluate [*([2+i]*) given that *m ⊙ {m+b i*}\n- Evaluate *m ⊙ {m+b{m+b i}*({*)* given that *m⊕{m+b{m+b i}*[{}\n\nWe appreciate the autonomy, intelligence, and eagerness to learn you’ve shown. We look forward to your continued intellectual exploration.",
