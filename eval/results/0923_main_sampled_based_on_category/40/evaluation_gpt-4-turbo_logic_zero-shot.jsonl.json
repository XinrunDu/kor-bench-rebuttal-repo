According to the proposed hypothesis \"All swans are white\" (∀x(S(x)→W(x))), seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) confirms the hypothesis, but seeing a non-swan that is white (¬S(b) ∧ W(b))—which should not logically affect the hypothesis—also confirms it under the equivalence of ∀x(S(x)→W(x)) to ∀x(¬W(x)→¬S(x)). This creates a paradoxical situation in confirmation standards, reflecting the description of the BC Paradox.\n\n### Answer: [[B]]",

Contradictory Observation:\n   - Penguins do not fly, which contradicts the logical consequence derived from r_1 and r_2.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The assumptions that were found to be reasonable are causing a contradiction, indicating the need for reassessment of these hypotheses.\n\nAccording to the rules stated for the LS Paradox, this situation fits because it involves multiple hypotheses that are generally reasonable yet lead to a contradiction that requires reassessment of their reasonability.\n\nAnswer: [[C]]",
