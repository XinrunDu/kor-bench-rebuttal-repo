He can see the sun rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- The story indicates that Earth is facing a catastrophic threat due to an accelerated helium flash in the sun. Consequently, planetary engines have been built to propel Earth out of the solar system. This suggests that the traditional day-night cycle on Earth, where the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, is no longer a normal experience for ordinary people. Additionally, the earth's rotational speed has been altered, causing significant changes in the day-night cycle duration.\n\nB. He has been living in an underground city since childhood and has never seen the world above ground.\n- The story mentions that the vast majority of humans have moved into underground cities associated with planetary engines and that only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city. Given this information, it is plausible that many ordinary people would spend their entire lives in these underground cities without ever seeing the world above ground.\n\nC. He can see Proxima Centauri rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- Proxima Centauri is a star located outside of our solar system and not visible as a rising and setting star from Earth. This option is scientifically inaccurate in the context of an Earth's perspective.\n\nD. He lives on the Space Biosphere 1 space station.\n- The Space Biosphere 1 experiment and the space station housing it were destroyed by a solar storm in 2026, which led to the loss of six scientists.
