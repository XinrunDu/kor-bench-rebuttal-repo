Whether they can both be false.\n\nExamining the conditions of the relationship types:\n\n- * relationship: Both cannot be true and cannot be false.\n- x relationship: Both cannot be true, but can both be false.\n- @ relationship: Both cannot be false, but can both be true.\n- % relationship: Both can be true, and both can be false.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ ¬§p→§¬p \\]\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. Both ¬§p and §¬p can happen. For instance, if something is not permitted (¬§p), it implies that the negation of it is permitted ( §¬p being true).\n  \n2. Both ¬§p and §¬p can also not occur together. It's possible to have scenarios where both statements can be false.\n\nFrom this analysis, it indicates that both statements can indeed be true together and can be false together.\n\nThis aligns with the \"% relationship\" where both can be true and both can be false.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]",

        "response": "Given the specified logic rules, let's break down the conditions for formula A that contains 4 propositional variables and satisfies both being a basic form and an all-even form:\n\n1. A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]",

        "response": "To determine the classification of the formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r), we need to evaluate it based on the provided logical rules.\n\n1. Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of ¬p, ¬q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r.\n   - (p ∧ q ∧ r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p ∧ q ∧ r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it’s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it’s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it’s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it’s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it’s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4.

        "response": "Based on the given 16 Basic Equivalences and the rules for propositional symbolization, let's evaluate each equivalence to determine if it holds true.\n\n#### Equivalence (1): ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n1. Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p ⇑ q) & (p ⇑ r) ::=:: p ⇑ (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2. Apply negation using equivalence (6):\n   - \\(!(p = q)) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\\)\n   - Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6):\n     \\[ !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p) \\]\n     Using De Morgan transformation:\n     \\[ (!p | q)' ::=:: !p & !q' → p & !q \\]\n     So:\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: (p & !q) | (!q & p) \n\n3. Simplify other side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n    - Apply equivalence (6):\n    ikkore komi:\n   - \\((p | q) & !(p & q) = (p | q) & (!p | !q)\\)\n\nNow compare:\n   \\[(p & !q) | (!q & !p)=   \\((p | q) & !(p & q) \\]\n\nSo because equivalence states:\n\n The equivalence holds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the representations of the given statements confirm their validity.\n\n**Answer**: [[A];[A]].\n",
