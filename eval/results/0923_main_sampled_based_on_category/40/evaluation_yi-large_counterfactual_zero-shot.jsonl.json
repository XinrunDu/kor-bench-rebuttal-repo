The setting of \"How To Train Your Dragon\" is in a Viking era, which predates the invention of firearms.\n\nOption B aligns with the themes and values presented in the story, emphasizing understanding and cooperation with dragons rather than their exploitation or harm. While the story does not directly mention conservationists using cameras, it does promote a change from the initial approach of violence towards dragons to one of respect and coexistence. This shift is in line with contemporary conservationist ideals of non-lethal methods of observation and interaction with wildlife.\n\nOption C is partially correct regarding the difficulty of capturing dragons and the importance of training, but it oversimplifies the narrative and contradicts the story's core message. The series shows that through understanding and respect, dragons can be befriended rather than just being considered too dangerous to capture. The statement about no one being able to capture them is not accurate, as the characters in the story do capture and train dragons successfully.\n\nOption D is also partially correct, as dragon hunters do capture dragons and use various methods to control them. However, the statement implies a broader acceptance of dragon hunting and training practices that the story ultimately rejects in favor of Hiccup's more humane approach. The narrative arc emphasizes the shift from exploitation to mutual respect, making this option less aligned with the story's values compared to Option B.\n\nTherefore, considering the context provided by the story and the emphasis on non-violent coexistence with dragons, Option B is the correct answer.",

The experiment was declared a success in 2022, showing that the green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. The space station has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists. However, in June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth and Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists. This indicates that such biospheres were not capable of resisting solar storms beyond G5 level, nor have they been operational for over 4 years (options A and B are incorrect). Option D is also incorrect as the story does not mention the detection of biospheres beyond Mars, only the success and failure of artificial biospheres in space related to Earth and the Moon.
