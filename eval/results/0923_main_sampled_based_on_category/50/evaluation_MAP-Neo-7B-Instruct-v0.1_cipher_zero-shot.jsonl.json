For a comprehensive solution, the exact mappings, shifts, and positions defined by the cipher rule would be necessary.\n\n**Decrypted Plaintext:** After applying the reverse process following the decryption rules:\n\n- \"CLRV\" remains \"BU\" when correctly interpreted and decrypted.\n\nPlease note, without a detailed and precise explanation of the grid mappings, positions, and the exact encryption and decryption mechanism, this explanation provides a general approach and example.

Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters.\n   - \"WHFI\" divided into blocks: [W], [H], [F], [I]\n\n2. Perform the encryption operation on each block individually.\n\n3. For block [W]:\n   - Place the template with holes on a blank grid.\n   - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the template.\n     - \"W\" through the single hole in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"H\" through the two holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"F\" through the three holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n     - \"I\" through the four holes in the template is:\n         \n         ▮  \n\n4.

(continued blocks)\n   - Block 13:\n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"M\", \"#\", \"F\"]\n\n3.

Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid for each block.\n2. Place the template with holes on the filled grid for each block.\n3. Read the letters visible through the holes to get the first part of the plaintext message.\n4. Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to get the next set of letters.\n5. Repeat the reading and rotation steps four times (twice for the initial and final blocks) to decrypt the message.\n\nGiven the length of the ciphertext, we'll focus on the decryption of the first few blocks for clarity:\n\n- Block 1: \"##\" decrypted gives \"LO\".\n- Block 2: \"U\" decrypted gives \"U\".\n- Block 3: \"H\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 4: \"E\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 5: \"M\" decrypted gives \"ME\".\n- Block 6: \"F\" decrypted gives \"FE\".\n\nConverting these blocks to a single plaintext message, we get: \"LOHEMESFE\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [\"LOHEMESFE\"]. Note that due to the specific rules, padding or repetition is necessary to ensure all blocks are filled, which isn't reflected here for simplicity, but would be the case in a full encryption and decryption process.\n\nPlease note, without the full grid and template from each block, the decryption process might not align perfectly, but this approach provides a clear representation of how to decipher the given ciphertext using the specified encryption and decryption rules. In practice, the process might involve more complex steps, including additional checks and adjustments for alignment and integrity throughout the encryption and decryption process.",

Instead, we'll directly look for the positions:\n            - G is at position (3, 2) in the matrix, and D is at position (17, 5).

For \"GD\", we assign positions directly without relying on full binary decryption:\n    - Start by identifying \"G\" and \"D\" for their positions in the encrypted character set, which are (G,V) and (D,F), respectively.\n    - From the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set, we might look for rows and columns directly:\n        - For \"G\", we find the corresponding letter \"A\" in the matrix (\"G\" is at position (0, 2)), but due to the unique rule described, we need to apply the following correction:\n            - We must use the specific number of characters from the encrypted set and match them to their correct positions in the matrix and the plaintext.\n        - For \"D\", we find \"G\" in the same matrix position (\"D\" is at position (17, 5)), but our specific rule suggests we should decipher based on the order in the encrypted character set.\n    - Applying the specific rule:\n        - \"GD\" in the encrypted character set is in positions (G,V) and (D,F).\n        - From the matrix, \"D\" (from the position (17, 5)) might not directly map to the plaintext, but given the encoded positions in the encrypted character set, we check \"G\" (from the position (0, 2)):\n            - \"G\" is \"G\" in the plaintext, following the order of positions in the encrypted character set.\n            - For \"D\", since the matrix position doesn't align with our extensive application for \"G\", we adjust our approach slightly:\n                - We start directly by matching characteristics of the matrix to the plaintext encoded in the encrypted character set, which involves our specific encoded positions:\n                - The key here is to correlate the ciphertext to the property of the matrix and encrypted character set positions.\n\nUltimately, the decrypted answer, adhering to the specific rules and positioning, might be:\n\n**[\"GA\"]**.

Herein, we're deciphering the hexadecimal representation of the ciphertext.\n\nIf you're working with specific characters or sentences, make sure to contextualize the decrypted result accordingly. For instance, if \"C0\" represents a hexadecimal mapping of certain letters (like 'C' and '0'), then \"C0\" might be the decrypted plaintext in a different encoding scheme. In this scenario, the base64 representation of \"C0\" would be \"SL\", reflecting the hexadecimal mapping from 'C' to 'S' and from '0' to 'L'. Adjust the decryption as needed based on the encoding used.",

For encryption and decryption of longer strings, the process is essentially the same, but the steps become more complex due to the necessity for looping or recursion. Here, the simplicity of the task justifies the direct decryption of a single byte from the given ciphertext.\n\nIf you were performing this operation for a real encryption or decryption, you would use the same approach but with the appropriate key and possibly larger sequences of data.

Converting the ciphertext into a sequence of bytes. The hexadecimal \"27ad\" decodes to bytes: 0x18 0xD7 0x01 0xB0 (in decimal).\n\n2.
