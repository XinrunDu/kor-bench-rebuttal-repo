The possible even indices are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n5. Since m0 is already included, we need to choose additional paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 even indices.\n6. The number of ways to choose k paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 is given by the binomial coefficient: C(7, k) = 7! / (k!(7-k)!)\n7. The number of formulas that satisfy the conditions is the sum of C(7, k) for k = 0 to 7:\n\nC(7, 0) + C(7, 1) + C(7, 2) + C(7, 3) + C(7, 4) + C(7, 5) + C(7, 6) + C(7, 7) = \n1 + 7 + 21 + 35 + 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 128\n\nSo, there are 128 formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form.\n\n### Answer: [128]",
