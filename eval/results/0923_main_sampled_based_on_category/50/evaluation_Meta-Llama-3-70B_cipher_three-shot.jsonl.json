Each character in the Morse code consists of a sequence of dots (.) or dashes (-). The dot . represents a short duration on the off state, while the dash - represents a longer duration on the off state. Both the dot and the dash are separated by a short duration in the off state. For example, the Morse code for the letter A is encoded as .- (dot followed by dash). To simplify data storage and reduce the size of the data representation, it's possible to map each dot-dash pattern to a number. For example, the letter A represented as .- can be mapped to 1. By systematically using numeric patterns for the Morse code symbols, such as .---, -.--, -.-, ..-., .---, etc., the Morse code can be efficiently represented by a sequence of on-off signals.",

You only need to include the correct answer in each element within double quotes, without any additional information such as brackets and brackets. Element order is followed in order of the plaintext.\n- The format should be: [\"Shirdon\", \"CMU\"] or [\"Miscellanea\", \"Narrative\", \"Six\"]  When there are multiple elements: [“…”, “…”,”…”] , Use English half width commas to separate elements. The entire string is background Advisory and should not be included in the answer.\n-The reason for repeated reference to the notation is to allow you to better understand those using only pure numerical notation strings.!\n ```\n\n#[test]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: #189,faq_ciphertext,faq_l2_diff Forgot to exit out of the program when typing the test cases before going into hiding to write the code to start the testL2_diff. Somehow HJ1051 (then L2_diff, HJ1051 and L2_diff problems before the end of the program) became L2_diff problem names after I exited the program. I then tried to remove the thread from the list, but Caffeine seems to have deleted the thread. So I tried to recall it here.

To solve this, we first need to define the encryption key `e=263` and the modulus `n=299`. The algorithm for encryption involves raising each letter in the plaintext to the power of `e` modulo `n`, and the decryption process involves raising the ciphertext back to the power of `e` modulo `n` to retrieve the original letter.\n\nWe can assume that the plaintext is all in uppercase ASCII alphabets since the prompt mentions that the ciphertext should only contain numbers separated by commas. To simplify the encryption/decryption process, we can first convert the letters to their equivalent ASCII values using `ord()` function and then encrypt/decrypt the values.\n\nFor encryption, we can iterate over each character in the plaintext and compute its encrypted value by raising it to the power of `e` and then modulo `n`. Similarly, for decryption, we can split the ciphertext by commas and iterate over each number, raise it to the power of `e` and modulo `n`, and convert it back to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr()` function.\n\nThe code provided implements this algorithm and provides a `encrypt()` function for encrypting the plaintext, and a `decrypt()` function for decrypting the ciphertext. It also includes some tests using the sample inputs and outputs provided in the prompt.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n\nclass SmartPrimer(object):\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Encipher given plaintext to ciphertext using RSA algorithm\n        :param plaintext: the text to encrypt\n        :return: encrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        cipher_text = \"\"\n        for c in plaintext:\n            ascii_val = ord(c)\n            cipher_text += f\"{pow(ascii_val, k, mod)},\"\n        return cipher_text[:-1]\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Decipher given ciphertext to plaintext using RSA algorithm\n        :param ciphertext: the text to decrypt\n        :return: decrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        plain_text = \"\"\n        for c in ciphertext.split(\",\"):\n            ascii_val = pow(int(c), k, mod)\n            plain_text += chr(ascii_val)\n        return plain_text\n\n\nclass TestSmartPrimer(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.smarter = SmartPrimer()\n\n    def test_encrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"I\",), \"213\"),\n            ((\"Z\",), \"32\"),\n            20312345678901234567879\n        ]\n\n    def test_decrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"213\",), \"I\"),\n            ((\"55,55,213\"), \"WWI\"),\n        ]\n        for params, expected in test_data:\n            with self.subTest(parameters=params, expected=expected):\n                actual = self.smarter.decrypt(*params)\n                self.assertEqual(actual, expected)\n```",

A customer needs to encrypt the ciphertext to hide their messages and then send it in a group chat. However, on this occasion, they would like to notify a specific person of the ciphertext and hope that only this target person can decrypt the ciphertext. Can you design such a group chat notification system? Please provide a complete workflow of your proposed system, including instructions for sending and receiving messages using the messaging app you created, as well as an illustration using an instance of a message. Please use symbols like arrows for \"encryption\", \"decryption\", \"query\", \"send to\" in the illustration to represent message processing flows.\n\n2. Besides the system you just designed, is there another encryption mechanism that also allows you to hide the plaintext when encrypting the message? To answer this one, you don't have to worry about designing an encryption mechanism.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The design of my system is as the following:\n   1. Plaintext stored on user's local.\n   2. User send the plaintext to me and I will encrypt it using RN format.\n   3. I will send the ciphertext to the group chat.\n   4. One and only one user who would want to know the plaintext will find me to decrypt the ciphertext.\n   5. I use the key from it's admin to connect the user to the encrypted message since the message is only targeted to that person.\n   6. I will use the key on my server to do the \"true\" decrypt the ciphertext by OAM.\n   7. Then I send the plaintext to the person who needs to know the plaintext.\n\n   The most difficult part of this system is how to make a robust system not to break the connection between something that only one user need to know and the special key used to decrypt.\n\n2. Well, I will try to use the chat room to send and retrieve the message.",
