Whenever two objects change each other's motion, they apply force to each other (they always apply oppositely). Plants do work on water and CO2 because the glomeruli get closer to each other. People think, incorrectly, that plants that change the state of water make such changes using light, but they don't, it's not just physically impossible. (1B) instead, water absorbs energy from the sun, causing the water molecules to escape from the bonds near the plants, and carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst in the water. When the water molecules escape from the small clefts, the sun's energy is released stealing the molecules from the plants. Plants use this energy to break down ATP pumps in the form of water flow and break down water molecules to expel the oxygen. The ATP is then hydrolyzed back to ADP + Pi to provide energy for glucose uproutine6 phosphate production.\n##-B.Yes, because formation of bonds over conformation is endothermic. One gives up 27.31 kJ of energy for every 1 mole of c-c bond in a reaction that forces to be very sharp. Complementary reactions (decreased bond strength) release a quantity of energy similar to that required to form bonds).\nAnswer with a list of uppercase letters from A to B representing each option.

At this time, Tanizaki took the first name Seiji, but it did not remain for very long. In 1909 he attended Tokyo Imperial University and studied Japanese literature. Despite his interest in classical Japanese literature, he loved the modern works as well, devouring Dostoevsky, Proust and Hardy among various others. During his second year in college, his opinions of Japanese spirit began to take shape with a disdain towards Western-influenced ideas.[7] He then joined a rightist fraternity and cultivated a fascist lifestyle, which included actions such as vandalism and random attacks on strangers. This patriotic activity was only momentary; he went back to his books by the end of his collegiate career.[10] One year after his entrance into Tokyo Imperial University, a year after he published his first work,[8] and the year he fell madly in love with a woman, Tanizaki's father died. His life as a creative writer, in fact, began the following year. He contributed many poems and stories to literary magazines. In 1910, he had his first publications: a one-act stage drama, \"A Change of Ideals\" (paginate Tanizaki's signature and a fashion column, both in a magazine he edited with friend Isoda, Chōjū ryūkō (Fan of Romance)[10]:38). Four such works were collected that year and published as the first edition of a book titled, \"Tanizaki Jun'ichiro Inshu\" (The Collected Works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro).[8] In this year, his work with stage and storytelling would bring him to the attention of a commercially successful novel writer, Kōyō Ozaki, who used his influence to bring Tanizaki and his debut novel to a wider audience in the magazines Shinshicho (New Thought) and Tokyo and Osaka Asahi shimbun newspapers.[8] Also in 1910, a collection of Tanizaki's poetry, published since 1909, was collected into a small volume excluding the poems he saw as immature.[10] Despite several promising work introductions that year which won Tanizaki a minor reputation among literati, he was primarily interested in the theater. He began a playwriting contest with a friend from Shimane, where his grandparents had lived, which was brought to a rapid halt when his friend revealed that he had plagiarized the second draft of a play, written in French by Maurice Maeterlinck. Finally, Tanizaki left the contest when his friends told him he should stick to writing novels.[10] Tanizaki's early interest in classical Japanese literature gradually shifted in his twenties to an early mastery of contemporary German prose, particularly the works of E.T.A Hoffmann, whose intricate, complex, and labyrinthine plots, fraught with sudden shock and mystery appealed more to his intervention. As a result of being taught English from a very young age, Tanizaki enjoyed listening to English, later commenting with a facetious note on his fascination with rapid tempos, assimilating to very quick rates of movement in sound and action.[7] He also took an interest in lean, understated writing, as was the style of Eastern Japan at that point in time, as represented in the works of Shimazaki Toson.[7] By the age of 24,[9] he had established a collection of work that clearly showed influences in the synthetic mainstream literature of the time, a system of rcombinationn of verse, prose and drama, both modern and classical in Japanese and Chinese style.[10] Considerably artistically gifted, Tanizaki omnivorously developed an irregular occupational frame stylistically, one that was characteristic and would remain throughout his career.[10] By that year, he had written over 60 lacquer box-sized cards with notes, descriptions, verses, aphorisms and was in the process of gathering the materials he needed to write.[10] On 10 June 1910, or 1912 depending on the source, Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in Tokyo. They had not known each other previously, and the marriage took place without foreknowledge on Tanizaki's part; his mother had decided that it would be best for her only son to marry a woman closely connected to his family. Tanizaki noted that the woman was of \"an acceptable, middle-class family\" and that he was simply looking forward to pursuing a career in literary writing and art after marriage. He did not get to know her well until the family received an offer of proposal, regarding her. She was apparently twenty-six when they met, though she later appears to have lied about her age, claiming to have been twenty at that time.[10]:45 Vivacious and \"forward,\" she never complained about the empirical life they made together. Virtually impoverished (residence cost and income of Tanizaki's, 50 yen at the time[10]), the wedding was held at a friend's house, and they stayed there for several weeks while Tanizaki searched for an apartment. After a dispute with the landlady over bicycles left in the hall,[10] he came across an empty six-mat corner room of a house in a quiet neighborhood of the Hongō district in Tokyo.[10]\nIn April, 1911, Tanizaki published his first full-length work, a",

It took the Qin emperor three years to reconsolidate his rule over the whole country, and finally he sent the 400,000-strong army to the south to suppress the Chu commander's army.##B. Although the state of Qin had conquered Qi, the heavy casualties from the war impeded the clean-up battle against the scattered remnants of the fallen armies that were still scattered in various parts of the country, so large troops could not be sent to suppress the rebellion in the south.##C. The ruling class was afraid of the infinite expansion of the war, causing a bottom-up rebellion that could not be suppressed, so they strictly limited the dispatch of troops by the central government in the name of national defense and strategic security, leaving the rebellion in the south unattended for three years.##D. After the state of Qin annexed Qi, the state was in utter chaos and civil war broke out, leaving scarce resources to suppress the southern rebellion.

Because the strength of  Master Ban was more than twice that of Bei Bo and matched the strength of Guiguzi, he decided not to retreat and met Guiguzi in a battle. He used frontal combat to suppress the special qi of Guiguzi and replaced Tianming in a duel with Guiguzi.

After that,  Master Ban once again locked Guiguzi, allowing himself to get close by relying on his own strength.##B.

Without the assistance of the aura Bei Bo had infused into his knife earlier, now it couldn't hit Guiguzi, and Master Ban personally admitted that he was no match for Guiguzi, so he decided to treat Tianming's poison and retreat.##D.

Which of the following options might be an acceptable treatment description to wake Duanmu Rong up?\nOptions: A. This method was inspired by Kong Qiu's method of removing the curse mark from Ximen Xun's body in the \"Rivers and Lakes\" area of Qishan, where he used water from seven wells to wash away the curse, thereby removing the corpse poison disease from Duanmu Rong.##B. \"Fate creates diseases, and medicine treats the disease from the cause.\" Using two poisons to counteract each other was taken from a statement about yin and yang and diseases by Qibo, a doctor from the Qin Dynasty. The toxicant in the Green-Scaled Fiery Snake alone could only make people more dizzy, unable to be awakened, and killed them. While the leaf of the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was a potent poison, when the toxins counteracted each other, the leaf of the poisonous Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was a potent poison, but the leaf of the poisonous Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was not.##C. When Funi was poisoned, Professor Ye sacrificed the rules and overcame the obstacle by using the 'Baize Gong Yu Defense Breaking Medicinal Pill'. Among the ingredients, besides dreamscape grass as the main ingredient, there are also four hidden ingredients—the bloodfly flower, the fragrant pine leaf butterfly, Heavenly Snake's Jade Centipede, and the blood-spinning fabric python egg, as well as a disguise for use. Crimson Snake also used a method similar to that of Baize Gong to combine two toxins to counteract each other, which enabled Duanmu Rong to wake up from her coma.##D. This is the method that Professor Ye demonstrated as  use of 'Zhang Liang's First Pill of Virtue', among these, Qichongcuver (Bichongcuver), liquorice, and matraca echo the three qualities of Zhang Liang being sly and flexible, possessing both wisdom and courage; and are loyal to righteousness and virtue, and Liang is virtuous. Nature implies temperament. It is a kind of poison. 'Zhang Liang's First Pill of Virtue' attack certain parts of the body, bringing 'death' to the dead (internal strength is blocked), making the wounds larger and uncontrollable, and a place hundred times poisonous than the Green-Scaled Fiery Snake.

If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again.

Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while.

However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state.
