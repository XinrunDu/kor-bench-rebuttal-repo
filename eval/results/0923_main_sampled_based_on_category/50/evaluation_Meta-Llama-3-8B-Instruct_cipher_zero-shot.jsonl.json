The result is: 0x7E 0x0C\n    * Substitute: Use the S_BOX to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together. The result is: 0x9C 0x88\n    * Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The result is: 0x8C 0x98\n    * XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again. The result is: 0x6C 0x8C\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string. The result is: 6C8C\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext. In this case, we have only one block, so the ciphertext is: 6C8C\n\n**CipherText:** [[6C8C]]",
