Decryption is simply using the uknown plaintext and the key to obtain the letter list of the unknown plaintext again.\n\n### Explanation:\n- Plaintext: XNARZKEM\n- Key: KULLLU\n- Ciphertext: UNIXO\n\nExplanation of reverse transformation (related to \"-\"    \" \")\n\nIf the text is translated, and after each reverse translation, it is a letter (case doesn’t matter here), then the basic grammar of the code changes to it. The question is, distinguish between special characters and normal characters, you need to have a list of special characters.\n\nRefer overall here\n\nKULLLU\n\nThe original code here is KULLLU, there are 7 letters and 1 space in it, so take the first character of the first word and write the whole leter code here. Then use the reverse icono to translate it into U, K, L, L, N, Add a space to the end.\n\nEncoded plaintext here is: U K L − L, they are encrypted in small letters in the ciphertext of the question, to be deciphered. (Refer follows for the entire cryptogram)\n\nWrite the others in the same way:\n\nEncoded Plaintext here is: X N A − R Z − K E − M\n\nthe entire program\n\nU K L N U N I X O N K U F E S O R L U Z X E N F A R E Z L I Y T H E C O D I G\n\nThe kulllu remains the same. Because there is only one space, it will also not be encrypted to the reverse of the word\n\n",
