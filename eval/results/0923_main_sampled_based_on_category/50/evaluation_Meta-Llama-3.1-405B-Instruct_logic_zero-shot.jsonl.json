First, let's expand the implication `>` into its equivalent form using rule (10) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`.\n   - So, `(p>q)` becomes `!p | q` and `(p>r)` becomes `!p | r`.\n   - Thus, `((p>q)&(p>r))` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   \n2. Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3.

The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity.

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001.

To determine if it is a basic formula, an all-even formula, or an all-odd formula, we need to identify the indices (i) of these terms.\n\n   - The first term is (¬p∧¬q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r).

Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause.

The results show a significant difference in yield between the two types of rice varieties in both 1980 and 1981.\n\n1. **Method ⸮** involves identifying if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ. However, the conditions in the scenario are kept constant, and the focus is on the difference in outcomes (yields) between the two groups (Chinese hybrid rice vs. American rice varieties), not on the variation of other conditions.\n\n2. **Method ؆** involves observing if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. In this scenario, the presence of Chinese hybrid rice (S) corresponds to a higher yield (P), but we do not have direct evidence of the absence of S (Chinese hybrid rice) leading to the absence of P (high yield), as the scenario focuses on the comparison rather than the absence of S leading to an absence of effect.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** involves comparing a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions with a negative group where S is absent, and so is P, under varying conditions. This method doesn't perfectly match the scenario since the conditions are not varied between the positive and negative groups; they are kept constant for comparison.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** involves observing changes in S corresponding to changes in P. In the scenario, the change from using American rice varieties to Chinese hybrid rice varieties (change in S) corresponds to a significant change in yield (change in P). This method seems to align closely with the scenario as it focuses on the change in outcome (yield) due to a change in the variable (type of rice).\n\n5. **Method ⚘** involves knowing causal relationships between other variables and outcomes to infer a causal relationship between S and P.

This seems applicable because the subsidence (P) occurs in areas with a high concentration of textiles (initial supposed cause), across different conditions. However, the actual cause identified is the high volume of underground water use, which is a more specific condition than just the presence of textiles. This method could initially apply to identifying textiles as a common factor but doesn't directly address the deeper investigation's findings.\n\n- **Method ؆:** This method involves the cause (S) being present when the effect (P) occurs and absent when P does not occur. The discourse does not explicitly provide instances where the supposed cause (high volume of underground water use) is absent and the effect (subsidence) is also absent, making this method not directly applicable based on the information provided.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This involves comparing a positive group where the supposed cause and effect are present (with varying other conditions) to a negative group where the supposed cause is absent, and the effect is also absent (with varying conditions). The discourse does not explicitly discuss a negative group for comparison, making this method not directly applicable.\n\n- **Method ⵣ:** This method involves changes in the supposed cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the discourse mentions that areas with a higher concentration of textiles (and by extension, a higher volume of underground water use) experience more subsidence, it does not detail varying degrees of water use corresponding to varying degrees of subsidence, which would be necessary for this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This involves causal relationships between multiple factors and outcomes to infer another causal relationship. The discourse, however, focuses on identifying a single causal relationship (between underground water use and subsidence) rather than using known causal relationships between other factors to infer this one.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the information provided, **Method ⸮** is the most applicable, as it involves identifying a common factor (initially, the concentration of textiles, and more specifically, the high volume of underground water use) across different conditions that correlates with the observed effect (ground subsidence). However, it's worth noting that the method's direct application might seem a bit forced without explicit mention of comparing instances of the absence of the cause.

The only variable differing between the two groups was the presence of salivary glands.\n\n2. **Outcome**: The wounds of the animals with intact salivary glands healed much faster than those without salivary glands.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the methods:\n\n- **Method ⸮**: This method suggests a causal relationship if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ. The scenario doesn't directly fit this description because it focuses on the difference in outcomes (wound healing speed) based on a single variable (presence of salivary glands), not on multiple varying conditions.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This seems to fit the scenario because faster wound healing (P) occurs when salivary glands (S) are present and does not occur (or occurs at a slower rate) when salivary glands are absent.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent, with varying other conditions. While the scenario has elements of this (presence of salivary glands leading to faster healing, and absence leading to slower healing), the \"varying other conditions\" aspect isn't explicitly explored in the scenario as described.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. While the scenario does involve a change in condition (presence vs. absence of salivary glands) leading to a change in outcome (healing speed), this method typically implies a range of variations or a gradient of changes, which isn't the focus here.\n\n- **Method ⚘**: This involves known causal relationships between multiple factors, which isn't the focus of the given scenario.\n\nGiven the information, the scenario best fits **Method ؆** because it involves a condition (presence of salivary glands) that when present leads to an outcome (faster wound healing), and when absent leads to a different outcome (slower wound healing).\n\n[[B]]",

This suggests a potential causal relationship between uranium and radioactivity.\n   \n2. **Removal of Uranium and Continued Radioactivity**: After extracting uranium, the remaining samples showed even higher levels of radioactivity than pure uranium. This indicates that the radioactivity cannot be solely attributed to uranium.\n\n3. **Discovery of New Elements (Radium and Polonium)**: Further research led to the isolation of radium and polonium from the leachate, which were identified as the sources of the remaining radioactivity.\n\nNow, let's examine which of the methods aligns with the causal derivation described:\n\n- **Method ⸮** involves multiple instances where S and P occur together under varying conditions. While uranium and radioactivity initially seem to fit this pattern, the discovery of radium and polonium complicates this, as they also contribute to radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ؆** suggests that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. However, the removal of uranium (S) did not eliminate radioactivity (P), suggesting other factors at play.\n\n- **Method ꙮ** involves a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The narrative about uranium, radium, and polonium does not directly describe a scenario where changes in one variable linearly correspond to changes in another in a straightforward manner applicable to this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘** suggests that if S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known, then S and P may have a causal relationship. This method is the closest fit because it deals with multiple elements (uranium, radium, polonium) having causal relationships with a common effect (radioactivity). Understanding the causal relationships between these elements and radioactivity helps infer the presence of a new radioactive element beyond uranium.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is **E**.\n\n[[E]]",

The Hearer's Inference (CQ1 and CQ2) deals with deducing what the speaker knows or doesn't know based on the strength of the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle** focuses on the Minimalization Criterion, where the speaker should speak as little as possible to achieve the communication purpose. The Hearer's Inference (CI1 and CI2) is about assuming conventional relationships and matching confirmed situations with minimal information.\n\n3. **C! Principle** deals with avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.
