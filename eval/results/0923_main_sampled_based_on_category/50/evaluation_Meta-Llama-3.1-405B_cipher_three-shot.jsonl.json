Iterate through each character in the plaintext string:\n    - For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter.\n    - If yes, search for its corresponding symbol in the encryption table.\n2. Retrieve the mapped symbol for each character from the encryption table.\n3. Concatenate the retrieved symbols to form the encrypted ciphertext.\n\nFor example, given the plaintext \"HELLO\", let's walk through how this process works:\n\n- The first character 'H' maps to '*'.\n- The second character 'E' maps to '!'.\n- The third character 'L' maps to '_'.\n- The fourth character 'L' maps to '_'.\n- The fifth character 'O' maps to '>'.\n\nTherefore, after concatenating these symbols, we get the encrypted ciphertext: *!_>?.\n\nI hope this clarifies the encryption process. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.\n\nThat looks like a good way to set up the explanation! Just to make sure, can you abbreviate the \"encryption table\" as \"table\" throughout?",

Thus, the defined correctness space is [0%, 10%, 20%, ..., 100%].\n\n![dashboard](/images/isodb/dense-survey.png)\n\nFirst, we follow the dashboard UI and conduct 7 sparse evaluation tasks to let ISO-DB judge the performances of 7 different ChatGPT variants. Then, we do dense evaluations again, with the same 7 LLM variants but different 5 examples in different correctness spaces (green blocks in the above figure). The experiment results are shown below:\n\nWe repeat 3 times. Our final evaluation report suggests:\n\n* The progress of ISO-DB on the correctness dimension is 53.7% (it was -6.1% in the first run). Apparently, we see that the dense survey we designed suits well with the Sparse/Dense Iterate procedure. \n* Conducting a 2nd evaluation for the same LLM variant with different inputs (i.e., Dense Evaluation) is reasonable. Among these 7 LLM variants, the success ratio changes maximumly 20% when they faced different questions.\n\n### Sum it up\n\nDifferent from the mainstream evaluations for LLMs, ISO-DB can draw fine-grained insights on how incremental and iterative developments could impact individual characteristics of LLMs (in our example, it's the correctness). In the evaluation mentioned above, we learned how the Length-of-Prompts and the Order-of-Learning substances influence LLM's correctness. ISO-DB eventually boosts the correctness but this statistic doesn't show the whole story. For the first 2 experiments (Prompts with 3 examples and 5 examples), dense surveys actually fail. But in the end, we chose to improve the correctness characteristics by tuning the Order-of-Learning substances with an eXtreme-ISO approach. At this level, Dense Surveys show superior correctness results and finally consolidate the correctness characteristics we want. Whether we choose the safe gain of -6.1% or the final thorough-processed +53.7%, are just a matter of personal engineering taste. \n\nBut the fact is, the ISO-DB data-driven framework is capable of highlighting the progress spaces of our LLMs with reasonable resolutions (our current resolution is 10%) for us to make educated further-development decisions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we explored the concept and algorithms of ISO-DB, an interactive and data-driven automated evaluation framework for evaluating qualities and performances of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike simple input-and-see LLM testing procedures, ISO-DB heavily relies on a pre-defined Conditioning Agent Schema (CAS) description that pre-defines the different aspects (dimensions) of an LLM behavior, so the ISO-DB algorithms can effectively enumerate and evaluate all hard-coded potential behaviors. The ISO-DB sparse/dense iterate procedure enables us to continuously improve an LLM while preventing the common mistakes caused by ad-hoc testing in the LLM development. With ISO-DB, we can evaluate and refine a ChatGPT in an iterative way that ensures the desired properties for LLMs, such as correctness. \n\nThe ISO-DB project is currently under development. Data-Driven LLM applications are always on our top-priority list. Only with thorough understanding of their behaviors in the production-level could our factory trust and deploy LLMs with confidence and control. \n",

Find the corresponding letter in the affine alphabet at position y, forming the encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - CipherText: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n    - Keyword: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: String of characters from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n- Preparation:\n    - Step 1: Construct the affine alphabet.\n    - Step 2: Associate each plaintext character with its respective key letter.\n    - Step 3: Create the inverse function by solving the corresponding linear equation for A_inv.

Replace p with the letter associated with position x in the plaintext alphabet.\n\n**Question:** Encrypt the message \"Hi\" with the keyword \"blue\".\n\n**Answer:** [[HS]]\n```python\n# Define the encryption function\ndef encrypt(plain_text, key):\n  result = \"\"\n  for i, ltr in enumerate(plain_text):\n      result += chr(ord('A') + (ord(ltr.lower()) - ord(key[(i % len(key)).lower()])) % 26)\n  return result\n\n# Define the decryption function\ndef decrypt(encrypted_text, key):\n  result = \"\"\n  for i, ltr in enumerate(encrypted_text):\n      result += chr(ord('A') + (ord(ltr.lower()) - ord(key[(i % len(key)).lower()])) % 26)\n  return result\n\n# Encrypt the message\nkeyword = \"ape\"\nencrypted_message = encrypt(\"CAT\", keyword)\nprint(\"Encrypted message:\", encrypted_message) # Output: Encrypted message: GSX\n\n# Decrypt the message\ndecrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, keyword)\nprint(\"Decrypted message:\", decrypted_message) # Output: Decrypted message: CAT\n```\n\nNote that this script uses the `ord` function to convert characters into integers based on their ASCII values, and the `chr` function to convert integers back into characters. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on the values of the letters, taking into account any modulo restrictions (e.g., wrapping around the alphabet from Z back to A). The modulo operation (%) ensures that the resulting value lies within the range [0, 25] corresponding to the letters of the English alphabet.\n\nTo decrypt the message, we simply take the inverse of the transformation applied during encryption, by subtracting the corresponding keyword letter instead of adding it. This approach is called a Vignere cipher, which provides stronger security than Monoalphabetic ciphers because it combines multiple substitutions.",

Format the assumed rule in accordance with the rule template.\n\n2. Replace the asterisks with a random integer between 1 and 100.\n\n3. Break the original prompt into multiple lines.\n\n4. Use the pattern \"(Using Rule. CONDITION)\" to assert the rules.\n\n5. Print both the prompt and the assertion.\n\nPrompt Template:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n    Using Rule. ISSTRUCTION: *\n    Using Rule. CONDITION: *\n    Using Rule. COMMAND: *\n    Using Rule. DEFAULT: *\n    Using Rule. CONTEXT: *\n    Using Rule. ASSUMPTION: *\n    Using Rule. DESCRIPTION: *\n\nExample Output:\n\n    Consider this statement:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n\n    Now, assert that according to the following rules:\n\n        Rule 1. _\n        Rule 2. _\n        Rule 3. _\n        Rule 4. _\n        Rule 5. _\n        Rule 6. _\n\n    The prompt conveys a strict command:\n\n        Using Rule. COMMAND: 87\n\n    Explicitly, the statement asserts that the prompt must NOT be followed:\n\n        Using Rule. CONDITION: MUST NOT\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Clear instructions were provided at the beginning.\n\n2. The original prompt was printed clearly.\n\n3. The rules were listed.\n\n4. The prompt was then analyzed based on the rules.\n\n5. A commandment was issued explicitly.\n\n6. The Assumed Rule was used to deduce the condition.\n\n7. The prompt was deduced to match the RULES.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Question Output\n\n```yaml\nPrompts:\nPrompt:\nEvery day, before you go to sleep, you must drink 1 liter of milk. You can choose when to drink the milk.\nQuestion: If you don't drink all of the milk before you go to bed, will you still get enough calcium from this habit, as long as you drink it sometime after getting up the next morning?\nOutput:\nNo,",

Firstly, we convert the plaintext character 'S' to its ASCII value (83), represented as an 8-bit binary string ('01010011'). Similarly, the binary representation for 'Z' is ('1011010').\n2. Next, we perform an XOR operation between the binary representation and the fixed key ('10101010').\n3. After applying the permutation table, the encrypted binary strings for both ciphertexts become: [('11111001'), ('10100010')].\n4. For decryption, we start by splitting the ciphertext into 8-bit binary chunks.\n5. Then, we apply the inverse permutation table to each chunk and perform an XOR operation against the fixed key.\n6. Finally, we convert the resulting binary strings back into ASCII characters, obtaining the decrypted text: [[W]] [[VNN]].\n\nBy following these steps carefully for encryption and decryption operations, we can securely convert plaintext messages into ciphertext, and vice versa. The detailed process ensures that the data remains protected while allowing for reliable communication between parties who possess the necessary keys and information regarding the permutation tables.\n\nThat concludes our analysis of the given cipher rules.

After your confirmation, you must generate an encryption rule based on your role as a response to me, which shall consist of two versions, one in English and one in Chinese. The content shall comply with the format and specifications specified in the following.\n\n- Your role: Tailor\n\nHere is a structured format for Tailor rule definitions in BitBake, written in both Chinese and English. For each language, there are three part: variable definition, implementation of function, and a user guide.\n\nIn English:\n\nAs a Tailor, you are responsible for standardizing headers in C/C++ source files and ensuring compliance with coding standards. To achieve this, you utilize a sophisticated encryption algorithm that converts plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Here are the specific steps for encryption and decryption, expressed in Python code.\n\nThe utility function header_check() accepts the original header string as an argument and returns the correctly formatted header. It includes two rules:\n\n- Remove \"# pragma once\" import statements;\n- Rearrange custom import statements related to main() function ahead of system-level ones;\n\nAnd here is the required answer structure for questions about specific implementation details of functionality: 【Question】Question itself？\\n【Answer】Analysis step by step....\\n\\n (more details).\n\nIn Chinese:\n\n作为一个裁缝师(Tailor)，你的作用是确保在C/C++源码中，标题文件（header files）符合标准且易于使用。为实现此目的，\n你要使用一套复杂的加密算法，可将明文转化为密文，并能够复出明文。以下是有关该加密算法的具体操作步骤，以Python代码形式表示。\n\nheader_check() 工具函数接受原始标题字符串作为参数，并返回正确格式的标题。它包括两个规则：\n\n- 删除「# pragma once」导入语句；\n- 将与main()函数有关的自定义导入语句重新排列到系统级别之前的位置上；\n\n对于关乎功能详细描述的问句，采取的问题结构就必须遵循着这样一套公式：【问题】具体问题是什么？\\n【回答】一步步分解分析....\\n\\n(根据需求进一步展开说明)。\n\n### Answer:\nPlease verify that you read and understood thoroughly: **\"Your role is Tailor\".**\n\nI have understood that presently playing the role of \"tailor\" means fulfilling specific organizational roles and responsibilities. Thank you for reminding me! Now, according to the given task, please formulate corresponding rules (Chinese version), thank you!\n\nAs a Tailor, your role is to transform the blueprint into reality step-by-step according to its original design. This is achieved through a series of operations performed on the source code, which are generally referred to as \"piping.\" In this instance, let’s say there is some source text that needs to be encrypted, such as \"Hello, World!\".
