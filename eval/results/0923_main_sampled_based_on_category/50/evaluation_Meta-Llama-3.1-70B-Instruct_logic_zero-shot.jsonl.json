However, since neither `c1` nor `c2` affects the truth value of `φ`, we can consider `φ` as being true if it's true initially, regardless of the execution of `c1` and `c2`.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression.\nSince neither `c1` nor `c2` affects the truth value of `φ`, we don't need to consider their individual effects on `φ`. The Concurrent Rule simplifies to the consideration of `φ` being true or not, independent of the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. Thus, the focus shifts from the possibility operator `⟨ ⟩` to the necessity of `φ` being true in the initial state.\n\n## Step 4: Express the logical expression in the required format.\nThe Concurrent Rule's application in this context essentially leads to considering `φ` as a necessity before and after the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. However, given the rules provided and the instructions, the exact expression in the simplest form isn't directly derived through the Concurrent Rule alone but through understanding the effect of concurrent execution on an unaffected proposition. \n\nGiven the rules and the requirement for the format, there seems to be a misunderstanding in directly applying the rules to derive a `[]` expression based on the description. The Concurrent Rule is about possibility `⟨ ⟩`, not necessity `[]`. Thus, based on the instructions and the provided rules, we cannot directly write a `[]` expression as requested without misinterpreting the rule's application. \n\nHowever, to follow the instructions as closely as possible and provide a formatted answer despite this mismatch:\n\nThe final answer is: [φ]",
