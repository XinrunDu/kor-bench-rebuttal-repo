Rule of Inference: ( Disclaimer:The following formulas represent the logical form of some inference expressions, not the full content, so please adopt the format of reference answers in their corresponding expressions. )\n\n    Rule                            Formal Representation\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    AND Introduction                ((P), (Q)) → (P^Q)\n    Hypothetical Syllogism        ((P → Q), (Q → R)) → (P → R)\n    Constructing Alternative    ((P ∨ Q), (¬P)) → (Q)\n    Reductio Ad Absurdum            ((P), (¬P)) → (Q)\n\n2. Universal Quantifier Instantiation: Given (∀x)P(x), we can conclude P(c) for any individual c.\n\n3. Existential Quantifier Generalization: If we can prove ∃xP(x), then (∃x)P(x) is true. Similarly, if we can prove (∃x)P(x), then ∃xP(x) is true.\n\n4. Simplifying Implications: \"If A → (B1 & B2 &... & Bn), then A & ¬B1 & ¬B2 &... & ¬Bn are contradictory.\"\n\n5. Material Implication: \"P → Q is equivalent to ¬P ∨ Q.\"\n\nBased on these rules, simplify the formula and provide an equivalent result using only ∨、∧、¬、∃、∀、() symbols and atomic predicates P,Q,R. Do not use meta-symbols such as <=>, ==>.\n\nFor example, if a question is given like this:\n\nQ: Evaluate whether the premises and conclusions of the following argument are correct: \n(1) If there is at least one rabbit in the forest and at least one rabbit has a tail, then there is at least one rabbit with four legs.\n(2) So, there must be at least one rabbit in the forest and at least one rabbit has four legs.\nGive the corresponding logical form of each sentence. Use parentheses appropriately.\nA = {There is at least one rabbit in the forest}\nB = {There is at least one rabbit with a tail}\nC = {There is at least one rabbit with four legs}\n\nThe correct answer should be presented in the following format:\n[[A];[B];[C];[[Rabbit(x)∧HasTail(x)∧FourLeg(s)]]]\n\nNote: In certain cases where there are multiple equivalent results, only one of them needs to be provided.",

This implies that:\n1. The process of completing the report involves challenges and difficulties;\n2. Just like how C's response provides extra information, it can be inferred that there must be more meaningful content behind B's answer than the literal meaning of \"completing the report.\"\n\nBased on these points, we can deduce that:\nC's response:\n\n1. Involves more effort;\n2. Indicates that there may be more meaningful content behind the words;\n3.

X% MP Principle → C's response provides extra information beyond the literal meaning of \"completing the report\";\n2.

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n##### Prompt: Question\nIn this dialogue, B’s response “She will do her best” is somewhat vague and does not directly address whether “she will be able to complete the project on time.” This response suggests that the statement “she will complete the project on time” might not be true, as “doing her best” indicates there is a risk she might not finish on time. \n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

The player's task is to arrange black and white pieces on the chessboard one at a time. Whoever captures more pieces wins. The black pieces, of course, represent the protagonist, and white pieces represent the opponent. The game has no real point or purpose; it depends purely on individual ability. There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun. This ELISP code abstracts this meaning into a common language: if something does not belong to you, then try to seize it. Later it was discovered that many hackers and gamers were accustomed to stealing others' substances and creating chaos.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",
