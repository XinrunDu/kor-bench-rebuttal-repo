The calculated number of positions below it is 1 (49 mod 26 = 1). The value of the 2nd card corresponds to the decrypted character.\n   Step 6: The corresponding positional value x = z - y (mod 26) = 8 - 1 (mod 26) = 7.

Convert the ciphertext from hexadecimal to bytes:\n   - Using Python, `hex(int('27ad', 16))[2:]` will decode the provided hexadecimal into a byte sequence. But since the key length in this cipher is fixed, the byte sequence needs to be padded to match the key's length. Let's assume the key length is X bytes, so we'll add (X mod 4) zeros at the end of the byte sequence to make the total length 4*X bytes.\n\n2. Perform decryption using a bitwise XOR (different-or) operation with the key:\n   - Recall that the key is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3', which has a length of 64 bytes. So, the key's first byte (0x73) will be used to decrypt the first byte of the byte sequence, the second byte of the key (0x73) will be used to decrypt the second byte of the byte sequence, and so on.\n\n3. Convert the decrypted byte sequence back to a plaintext string:\n   - Once all the bytes have been decrypted, they form a byte sequence that represents the original plaintext. Since we're dealing with uppercase letters, ASCII values 65 to 90 correspond to these letters. There might be some non-letter characters due to padding, which can be ignored.\n\n4. Convert the resulting plaintext string into a single combined ASCII character string:\n   - Now that all the decrypted bytes have been converted back to a plaintext string, we simply concatenate all the individual characters to form the final plaintext string without spaces or punctuation.\n\nSince the provided ciphertext may be padded due to key length differences, we'll assume a key length of 16 bytes for this example to make calculations easier. So, the first step is to add 8 zeros to the byte sequence for a total of 16 bytes: `(0x27ad00000000)`.\n\nWe'll continue with the decryption steps mentioned above and obtain the plaintext string. However, it is essential to note that without the actual key used for encryption, it's impossible to decrypt the ciphertext into the original plaintext.
