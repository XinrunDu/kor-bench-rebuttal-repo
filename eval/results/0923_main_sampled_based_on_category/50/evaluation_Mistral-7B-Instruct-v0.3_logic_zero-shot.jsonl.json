The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and ✓|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false).

Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2.
