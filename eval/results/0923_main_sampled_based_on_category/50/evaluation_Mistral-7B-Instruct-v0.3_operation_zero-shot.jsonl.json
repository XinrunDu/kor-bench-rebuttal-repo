First, we check if 25 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* 25 would be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n2. Next, we have the result from step 1 (24) and check if 24 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* the result would still be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n3. Similarly, we check if 24 is a multiple of 14. It is not, so 14 *apt* 24 would also be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n4. Now, we have 24 *apt* 24 as the two intermediate results. We need to apply the operation again since 24 *apt* 24 wasn't initially defined.\n\n5. Check if 24 is a multiple of 24. They are both multiples of 12, but the rule only considers the smaller number in the case they are both multiples. Hence, 24 *apt* 24 = 24/24 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the final result: 24 *apt* 24 *apt* 14. Since the first two operations resulted in 2, the entire operation sequence is equivalent to 2 *apt* 14. Following the rule, since 2 is not a multiple of 14 and vice versa, 2 *apt* 14 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]].",

Neither 19 nor 28 is a multiple of the other.\n2. Next, let's calculate 19※28 based on the given rule: Since 19 is not a multiple of 28, we have 19 apartments (a) and 28 buildings (b). According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n3. Now, let's combine 19 apparently 28 with the next operation 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 28 (or 19), their operation results in 24. These results can be written as (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp = 24.\n\n4. Then, let's perform the stamped operation with 104 and 13. Because 104 is a multiple of 13, we have 104 houses (a) and 13 apartments complexes (b). According to the rule, achts (104 houses) apt (13 apartments complexes) = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 apartments complexes.\n\n5. Finally, let's perform the last stamp operation with the new result (10 apartments complexes) and 4. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, their operation results in 24. We can write this as (10 apartments complexes) estamp (4 units) = 24.\n\n6. Combining all the results from the stamp operations gives us the final answer: (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp (4 units)  stamp (104 houses  apartments complexes) = 24 × 24 = [[576]].\n\nThe answer is [[576]].",

If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\n\nGiven the equation 25※X※14 = 4, we can start by deducing the relationship between 25, X, and 14.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 could be on the inside of the repeated operation, and we'd have 25 modifications (one per occurrence of the repeated operation). However, this would result in a multiplication of 25 raised to an undefined power, which is impossible. So, X must not be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, 25 also cannot be a multiple of X or 14, as it would violate the given equation.\n\nNow, it's time to see if X is a multiple of 14. If it were, then the repeated operation would result in 14 being on the inside, and again, there would be 14 modifications (one for each occurrence of the repeated operation). This would lead to 14 * (14/X + 2) = 4.\n\nSolving for X would give us X = 14 / (1 - 4/14). Calculate this to find that X = 3.\n\nHowever, since we cannot exclude the possibility that 25 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 14, then we must consider the last case of the rule, a※b = 24. This means that 25※X∗14 = 24 * X * 14 because neither 25, X, nor 14 are multiples of each other. Simplifying the equation gives us: 25 * X * 14 = 24 * 196. Solving for X gives us multiple solutions:\n\n* X = 196 / (25 * 14) = 8/11\n* X = 4*196 / (25 * 14) = 16/11\n* X = 9*196 / (25 * 14) = 72/11\n* X = 24*196 / (25 * 14) = 316/11\n\nSince X must be an integer but we only have fractional values as possibilities, those options are not valid and our initial solution (X=3) remains the only viable answer.\n\nTherefore, [[X=3]].",

If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4.

If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]].",

Compute each element of the resulting matrix by applying the rule:\n\n  - A&B(1,1) = (5)^(2) and A&B(1,2) = (6)^(1) so the first row will have the values (5^2, 6^1)\n\n  - A&B(2,1) = (7)^(0) and A&B(2,2) = (8)^(2) so the second row will have the values (7^0, 8^2)\n\n3. Double-check the final answer:\n\n  - The final matrix should have two rows and two columns, matching the original matrices A and B.\n\n  - The elements of the matrix correspond to the computed values [(5^2, 6^1), (7^0, 8^2)], which satisfies the operation definition.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [[((5^2, 6^1),(7^0, 8^2))]].",
