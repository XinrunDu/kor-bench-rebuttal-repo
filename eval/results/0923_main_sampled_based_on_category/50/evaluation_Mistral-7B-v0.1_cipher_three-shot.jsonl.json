Output: Encryption Steps: - For each character p in the plaintext: - Find the character in the outer_disk. - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. - After encrypting every period characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by increment characters. In this case, `p : 'Q'` and `outer_disk : 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL'` - 'Q' corresponds to 'OP' on the outer disk - Replace 'Q' with 'OP' on the inner disk - After encrypting three characters [`O` `P`], rotate the inner disk to the right by six characters. - Inner disk: `['O' 'P' 'D' 'N' 'M' 'S']` - `p : 'W'` and `outer_disk : 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL'` - 'W' corresponds to 'Y' on the outer disk - Replace 'W' with 'Y' on the inner disk So, the ciphertext becomes [[QW]]\n\n**Decryption:** Input: Ciphertext: [[QW]] period: 5 increment: 6. Output: Decryption Steps: - For each character c in the ciphertext: - Find the character in the inner_disk. - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk. - After decrypting every period characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by increment characters. Therefore, ciphertext [[QW]]: - Inner_disk: `['O' 'P' 'D' 'N' 'M' 'S']` - Plaintext: `'WN'` So, the plaintext is [[QW]]",

The encrypt() function takes plaintext as input and produces ciphertext as output. After collecting the required values and converting the plaintext to numeric values, it applies the given encryption rules to generate the ciphertext. Similarly, the decrypt() function takes ciphertext as input and produces plaintext as output by applying the given decryption rules.\nIn summary, the module creates a cipher that operates in two modes: encryption and decryption. The encryption process translates plaintext into ciphertext, and the decryption process translates ciphertext into plaintext. The module follows the specified rules to produce the desired output, either encrypted or decrypted.",
