The given statement does not directly fit the criteria laid out for the C* principle as it does not involve information strength or the speaker's knowledge in the way described by CQ1 and CQ2.\n\n- **C% Principle**:\n  This principle involves minimalization and the hearer's inference to expand information until they grasp the intention of the speech. The statement can be considered to fit the C% principle because the hearer can deduce that the beer being part of the food in the food box is a minimal statement necessary to convey the relevant information about the contents of the food box. The hearer can infer the details based on the minimal information provided.\n\n- **C! Principle**:\n  This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or obscure expressions without reason. The given statement does not involve any lengthy or obscure expressions, so this principle does not apply here.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement conforms to the C% Principle.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",
