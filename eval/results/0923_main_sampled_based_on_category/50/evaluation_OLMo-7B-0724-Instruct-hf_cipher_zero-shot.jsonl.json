For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5.

The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8.

Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11.

        "response": "[[\"SECRET\"], \"FTH\"] (using hexadecimal representation? yes, and letters a-e in lower case)\n\nTo decrypt \"27ad\", let's follow the given encryption steps:\n\n1. The plaintext we'll use is \"SECRET\" (the recommended key).\n2. Perform SHA-256 on the key (\"SECRET_KEY\") to get the key for encryption: \"73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\".\n3. Convert \"27ad\" to hexadecimal representation: \"13 and 23\".\n4. The encrypted bytes are: \n\t* 13 (in hexadecimal) = 51 (in decimal)\n\t* 23 (in hexadecimal) = 67 (in decimal)\n5. Now encrypt 51 with 51 (key byte) using XOR: \n   \n   * (51 XOR 51) = 0\n(0 XOR 51) = 51\n6. Next encrypt 67 with 51 using XOR:  \n   \n   * (51 XOR 67) = -6\n(67 XOR 51) = 16\n7. Convert the encrypted byte sequence into hexadecimal representation:  \n   \n   * \"5116\" (add leading 0 in front of single-byte data)\n8. Decryption steps:\n   1. Convert the hexadecimal ciphertext \"5116\" to bytes: 51 and 16\n   2. Decrypt 51 using 51 (key byte) using XOR:\n      * (51 XOR 51) = 0\n(51 XOR 16) = 35 (in decimal)\n3. Decrypt 16 using 51 (key byte) XOR:\n   \n   * (16 XOR 51) = -6\n(51 XOR 16) = 35\n4. The decrypted plaintext from ciphertext \"27ad\" is \"[\"SECRET\"], \"FTH\".",
