Since all the PCTs include either p or ¬p, they correspond to hexadecimal numbers 2^(i−1) and 2^(i−1)+1, for i=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, our PCTs correspond to the following hexadecimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe disjunctive normal form of A (in this case, CNF) consists of all the above PCTs. We want all the PCTs to be even, meaning their corresponding hexadecimal numbers must be divisible by 4: 0 (no issue), 2, 4, and none of 1 or 3 (each is divisible by only 2).\n\nAnd the answer is[[]], meaning there is only one possible formula that satisfies both conditions: ¬p∨¬q∨p∨¬r (hexadecimal number 0). This conforms to be a basic formula since it includes m0 and is also an all-even formula because all the hexadecimal numbers are divisible by 4.",
