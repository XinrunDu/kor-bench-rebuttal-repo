Looking at the given string 'SG', it is found to be 'Z', which means letter 'C' should be mapped to Z, so the position that 'C' should go is in the position with the letter 'Z'. In this case, 'C' should go at the 18th position in the alphabet.\n\nTo find the necessary number of positions to shift, we look up the mapping in the substitution_alphabet, which is \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\". Looking at the given string 'SG', it is found to be 'Z', so the position that 'C' should go is in the position with the letter 'Z', which is at position 18. To shift the positions of 'C' in 'SG', we simply use the mapping in the substitution_alphabet and replace letter 'C' with its corresponding letter from the reversed_alphabet at that position.\n\nThe decrypted answer follows the format '[[[encrypted answer]]]', where '[[[decrypted answer]]]' separates the two parts of the answer.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nEncryption:\n- The object ```plaintext``` with the characters ```*```, ```@```, ```!``` and ```^^``` has a length of ```9``` bytes in ASCII representation.\n\nYou are given the encrypted table ```encryption\\_table```.\nYou are also given the ciphertext ``plaintext``.\n\n1. Encrypt the actual plaintext using the encryption table ```encryption\\_table```. The output should be interpreted and represented accordingly.\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext using a suitable method like the one you provided earlier.\nTo encrypt the plaintext \"H\" using the provided encryption table, the steps would be similar to the inverse of Caesar cipher.\nThe Caesar cipher transforms an input character by shifting it 'n' places forward in the alphabet, where 'n' ranges from 1 to 2 ** 12-1 = 15. However, for calculating n, since we are working with ASCII representation, we can use an integer number approach where we can shift each character in the alphabet a '15' number of positions forward in the alphabet, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n1. The plaintext character \"H\" will be converted to uppercase, as uppercase and lowercase of character are interchangeable, so the transformed character should be uppercase \"H\".\n2. Negative shift of characters 3 ('4') and 13 ('5') have been taken care during converting characters to uppercase into arabic alphabet. Here is the step by step calculation:\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 3: \n- The number 3 is divided by 26 and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 1.\n- This means that the character will be shifted to the right 1 place in the alphabet.\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 13:\n- The number 13 is divided by 26 the result is rounded down to the nearest integer that gives us 2 (and not 1) and converted to uppercase ('A').\n3. Writing these steps in the correct format of a tabular expression where each row will represent a character from ascii and ```<=``` will represent the lowercase character and ```>=``` will represent the time based form of the character. As you can see the decrypted string will look like this:\n\n```\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!<XW>\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!><W>!\n\n```\n\n4. Here is a specific solution using Python:\n```python\nimport optparse\n\ndef encrypt_data(plaintext):\n    encryption_table = {\n        'A': '!', 'B': '@', 'C': '#', 'D': '$',\n        'E': '%', 'F': '^', 'G': '&', 'H': '*',\n        'I': '(', 'J': ')', 'K': '_', 'L': '+',\n        'M': '=', 'N': '~', 'O': '?', 'P': '/',\n        'Q': '0', 'R': ':', 'S': ';', 'T': '<',\n        'U': '>', 'V': '1', 'W': '2', 'X': '3',\n        'Y': '4', 'Z': '5'\n    }\n    encrypted_cipher = ''\n    for char in plaintext:\n        if char == 'A': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['A']  # Encrypt -> \"A\"\n        if char == 'X': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['X']  # Encrypt -> \"X\"\n\n        if char == 'Y': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Y']  # Encrypt -> \"Y\"\n        if char == 'Z': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Z']  # Encrypt -> \"Z\"\n        if char == 'W': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['W']  # Encrypt -> \"W\"\n        if char == 'U': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['U']  # Encrypt -> \"U\"\n\n        if ord(char) not in encryption_table.values():  # If the encoded character is already present in the table\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table[ord(char)]\n        else:  # Otherwise encrypt the character by shifting all the specified ASCII \"special\" letters, '&' followed by 3 letters\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['^']  # Encrypt -> \"^\"\n\n\n    return encrypted_cipher\n\n# Usage\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\nparser.add_option (\"-n\", \"--plaintext\", type = \"string\", action = \"store\", dest = \"plaintext\", help = \"Enter the encrypted string, Default value is empty\")\n(options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n\nif len(args) == 1:\n    print(encrypt_data(options.plaintext))\nelse:\n    print(\"Please enter a valid plaintext string, \" + str(args[1]))\n```\n\n**Output: encrypt\\_data(*) returns the encrypted string, \"EaXL....dE\"**",

However, there are some technical details that may need to be clarified. \n\nFirst, you have mentioned that you may be making some limited assumptions in certain cases that cannot be fully accounted for by the rules or protocols. You are suggesting that the threshold values are reasonable to keep in mind and can be utilized in certain situations. This may necessitate more careful validation, but it is important to keep in mind that even small variations in the threshold values can lead to very different results.\n\nSecond, you have mentioned that you may want to name the relevant properties and objects, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext, in the formatting of your cipher, ensuring clarity and readability. It is important to make sure that the objects and their values are defined correctly for the specific use case being described.\n\nAdditionally, you have mentioned that you would prefer to provide both plaintext and ciphertext, encapsulated in double square brackets. It is important to also consider the potential scenarios where only one of these may be insufficient or incomplete. \n\nIn the scenario, where you indicated that you are interested only in the ciphertext, you are clearly on the right track. But, if you have another use case where you want the plaintext and ciphertext to be provided together in double square brackets, you would have to considerome environment and implementation details to suit your requirements.",

Just to clarify, the decryption rule you're asking about seems to be missing some details and instances that depend on a weaker rule than the one we're focusing on. In order to help with that, I'll provide a list of the keys we'll be using.\n\nRULE: Encryption\n\n1. In this rule, specify the initial (plaintext) string.\n2. Given a key, generate ciphertext of that string.\n3.(Optionally) parse the output to see what the \\* character stands for.\n            \nCOUNT-SLASH-MACRO:\n    \"ANSWER\": [ '_', 'HTTP?' ]\n\nRULE: Decryption\n\n1. Input the ciphertext as string y.\n2. Convert string y to character array to easily manipulate following steps.\n3. Parse the character array to figure out what to do.\n4. Based on what we know about encrypted symbols, switch to the phrase \"ANSWER\" or \"ANSWER:\".\n4. Alternatively, you can use CASE-INCLUSIVE.\n5. (OPTIONAL)\n    Exclude the sign \\* from the answer variable(y when y is not (E.g., \"WELCOME\" and \"DARKLY:\")).\n\nNote:\nAND: We use 'stackoverflow.com' instead of 'stackoverflow.'\n- `identifier: 5`\n- `amount: 666`\n\nFor example:\nhttps://habr.com/ru/blog/228603/\n\nSo, you'd parse the following text:\n`http://stackoverflow.com/project/browse/topics/computer-issues`\nand it would output a list of negative symbols, such as `/`, `d`, `ic`, etc.\n\n Tips:\n     Using uppercase letters is not recommended if you want exact ASCII values because they roll your long-term and short-term memory.\n     If you need any help please let me know, I can add more pieces of information when needed!\n     Also you could add space between words instead of pipe and in case you need subscriptions purchase them, if you pay as 3 to 5 USD the price might be very different from the one mentioned in the input.   The 3 dollar price of sticker paper items (with repetition) works fine.",
