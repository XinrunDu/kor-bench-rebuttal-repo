The words in the list are: AIDS, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR, JUVENILE, TICKET, TEENAGER, BRAHMIN, ELEVATE.\n\n2.

Moving to the diagonal directions from left to right, we have the words PAIR, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR.\n\n8. For the word PAIR again, it's in both row 5 and column 4. So the start point is 5, 4.\n\n9. Moving to the next word, AUTOPPILOT, it's in 6, 6 because of the eight's puzzle.\n\n10.

Create a list of ordered pairs representing the dominoes, ensuring that each domino spans exactly two cells and is properly aligned.\n\nUsing the provided grid:\n\n- The following regions contain the required 2 overlapping dominoes: (from left to right/top to bottom): B-C, D-E, and F-G. \n- These regions include cells marked as shaded.\n  \n- Cell (1,2) in the first region B-C is part of a domino spanning 2 cells across the top.\n- Cell (1,3) across in the same region B-C is part of a diagonally positioned domino spanning two cells in its top and left columns.\n- The same cell (2,4) in the same region B-C is part of another diagonally positioned domino at the top. \n- Cell (3,4) in the same region B-C is part of another diagonally positioned, but not the same as the first, domino spanning two cells in the top-right and left column.  \n- The cell (4,1) in the first region B-C is part of a domino spanning two cells across the right column.\n- Cells (4,2) in the same region B-C are also part of a domino, but not the same as the first one.\n\n- Cell (2,4) in the second surrounding region D-E is part of a domino spanning two cells across the top.\n- Cell (3,4) in the same region D-E is part of another diagonally positioned domino spanning two cells in the left column and top row. \n- Cell (4,1) in the same region D-E is part of a domino spanning two cells across the right column. \n\n- There is no region containing exactly 2 overlapping dominoes with cells (1,2)(1,3) in the same region; they are not needed for the answer.\n\n- The information about cells (2,4) in the same region remains.\n\n- The coordinate pairs have been carefully chosen to ensure that each domino spanned two cells, and diagonal alignment is maintained.\n\nHere is the systematic approach to building the dominoes list:\n\n1. (1,1)(1,2) (2,1)(2,2)(3,2) - B-B, C-C, each has 2 cells covered by a domin.\n2. (1,3)(1,4) (2,3)(2,4) (3,3)(3,4) - B-D, C-E, each has 2 cells covered by a domin.\n3. (2,3)(2,4) (3,3)(3,4) (3,3)(4,4) (4,1)(4,2) (4,3)(4,4) (4,3)(4,4) (5,2)(5,3) (5,4)(5,5) - D-E, F-G, each has 1 cell covered in a domin, swapped for non-colliding ones.\n\nUsing this new, theoretically correct grouping of cells, we could organize a list of these numbers, like this, so it's applicable for both cases listed in the final answer.\n\n[[(1,2)(1,3),(2,4)(3,4),(4,1)(4,2)]]",
