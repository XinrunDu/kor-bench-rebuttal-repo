Here, for p1 to be negated (~p1) and true (✓), p1 must be false (x). For p2 to make the \"and\" (p2) part true (✓), p2 must be true (✓).\n- Now, for ~p3 to be false (x), p3 must be true (✓).\n- The assignment where x|x|✓ will lead to the formula being false.\n\nTherefore, the falsity value is [[F:x|x|✓]].\n\n### Formula 2: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\n- The formula is formed as an 'and' operation.\n- For the formula to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- For (~p2||p3) to be false, both parts (~p2 and p3) must be false.\n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n  - For p3 to be false, p3 must be false.\n- For (p1=::>p2) to be false, p1 must be true (✓) and p2 must be false (x), which is not consistent with the assignment required by the first part.\n- Falsity assignments: Since (~p2||p3) requires p2 to be true and p3 to be false, but (p1=::>p2) cannot be false with these assignments, no single assignment can make the entire formula false.\n\nTherefore, falsity value for the given structure: [[F:None]]\n\n### Formula 3: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\n- The main connective here is '&', meaning both parts must be false for the entire formula to be false.\n- Consider (p1=::>p2): The conditional statement is false in only one case: p1 = 'True' (✓); p2 = 'False' (x).\n- Next, consider (~(~(p1&p3)||p1)):\n  - The leftmost part is a nested negation (~ (~ (~(p1&p3) || p1))). In order for it to be false (contribution to the overall falseness of the formula), ~(p1&p3)||p1 must be true.\n  - In the scenario to nullify (~(p1&p3)||p1), we need both ~(p1&p3) and p1 to be false.\n    - For ~(p1&p3) to be false, (p1&p3) must be true, requiring p1=✓ (True) and p3=✓ (True).\n    - This directly conflicts with our previous finding that p1 must be True to make the conditional (p1=::>p2) false, which implies the only assignment that makes (p1=::>p2) false makes another part of the formula True (p1=✓), causing the entire structure not to have a false assignment under the analyzed scenario.\n  \nTherefore, the falsity values identified are:\n[[F:x|x|✓]];[[F:None]];[[F:None]].",

Replace predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ(x, y) denoting x = y.\n\nThe provided formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, a), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing a with \\(a'\\) = 0, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing g with its implementation \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\), the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F((x * 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 gives 0 and because the implementation of predicate F(x, y) denotes \\(x = y\\), it becomes necessary to consider the semantics implied by these expressions. The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x — \\(F_J(0, x)\\) — only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x — this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]",

This suggests a positive group where the presence of an unknown radioactive element (S) corresponds to high radioactivity (P), and a negative group where uranium alone (S is absent) does not produce the same level of radioactivity (P is absent). Therefore, the passage is consistent with the ꙮ method. \n\n[[C]]",
