For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X]]  (Decryption of \"3=\" gives \"WX\" with the given cipher table, but because of the way the table is defined, \"X\" is at symbol position 3 and \"W\" at \"=\". So, \"X\" is the first decrypted character.)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"W\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]=[[0]]   (Encryption of \"W\" gives \"X\" which is at symbol position 3 and encrypts to \"0\", hence the answer is represented as [[0]] since it's a symbol not an uppercase letter.)",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[OAPALU]]\n\nBelow is an explanation of the cipher operations you need to perform for both encryption and decryption:\n\n1. **Encryption Steps (for the \"Plaintext\" question):**\n   - For each plaintext character `p`:\n     - If `p` is an uppercase letter and exists in the Polybius square:\n       - Replace `p` with the number of rows and columns (both counted from 1) in which the character appears.\n     - In particular, O, which does not exist in the Polybius square, is replaced by 66.\n   - This is equivalent to looking up the character in the Polybius square and replacing it with its corresponding code. For example, \"R\" in the Polybius square is replaced with '11', \"W\" is replaced with '22', and \"Q\" is replaced with '43'.\n   - If `p` is not in the Polybius square, it should be replaced with 66. This is done because \"O\" is not in the square. Therefore, \"O\" in the plaintext will be replaced with '66' in the ciphertext.\n   - As for the special case of \"N\", which is in the Polybius square, it will be replaced by '51' in the ciphertext.\n\nExample: Plaintext is \"North\". The corresponding ciphertext will be: \"14325234345343415553451425134314243243343115142\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps (for the \"Ciphertext\" question):**\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc in the given ciphertext:\n     - Based on the rows and columns denoted by CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid.\n     - If CrCc=66, replace with \"O\". This means that any occurrence of \"66\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"O\" in the plaintext.\n   - This is the reverse operation of encryption. In other words, you need to look up the corresponding character in the Polybius square for each pair of numbers and construct the plaintext.\n\nExample: Ciphertext is \"36634441131153143612\". The corresponding plaintext is \"OAPALU\".",

The provided ciphertext \"84./71./7.5./4!=?79.\" seems to appear correctly in the rule.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, in the decryption task, for the fourth test case, the cipher rule is pertaining to the third task in the instructions. It states that each character of the plaintext is encrypted to a 2-character group separated by /. If the length of the plaintext is odd, the last character is not encrypted and is included into the ciphertext without the following mapping. Therefore, the encrypted form is 2 characterized groups separated by /. In this scenario, the encrypted ciphertext is \"84./71./7.5./4!=?79.\", which is consistent with the rule description.",
