Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4. From the identity of AND with a true statement, we know that p&1 is logically equivalent to p itself.\n5. Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8.

Thus, \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: (!p | !q)⇑r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) ⇑ r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)⇑r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6.

It mentions specific years and the corresponding number of deep wells, water usage, and the level of subsidence. The claim is that as the number of deep wells increased and more water was extracted underground, the land subsided faster. This implies that there is a relationship where the intensity of the cause (number of wells and water extraction) is related to the effect (land subsidence).\n\nGiven these points, the logical method that fits best would be:\n\n4. Method ⵣ:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of deep wells (S) and the use of underground water (S) changed over time, corresponding to changes in the level of land subsidence (P).\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n[[D]]",

The key findings are based on observations of radioactivity, whether uranium is present or absent, leading to the identification of another source of radioactivity.\n\nGiven the logic rules:\n\n- Method ⸮ describes finding a potential causal relationship S and P when other conditions vary, but S and P remain consistently together. This does not outright fit our scenario as the main focus is on the radioactivity present even after uranium is absent.\n- Method ؆ fits very closely - the radioactivity (P) occurs both when uranium (S) is present and does not occur as expected when uranium (S) is absent, leading to the identification of a different substance causing the radioactivity. This method describes a situation where the presence or absence of S (in this case, uranium) influences P (radioactivity) in a way that suggests a causal relationship.\n- Method ꙮ involves the same conditions as method ؆ but also adds to it by considering both positive and negative cases, which isn't explicitly detailed in the passage.\n- Method ⵣ would describe a situation where changes in S correlate with changes in P.
