Here's how this works:\n\n1. **Encryption Table:** A predefined mapping (encryption table) associates each uppercase letter (from A to Z) with a unique symbol or digit (such as `A: '!'`, `B: '@'`, etc.). This table is used both for encryption and decryption purposes.\n\n2. **Encryption Process:** During encryption, each character in the plaintext is replaced by its corresponding symbol or digit from the encryption table if it's an uppercase letter. For instance, if the plaintext contains the letter 'H', it gets encrypted to the symbol '*'.\n\n3. **Decryption Process:** Conversely, during decryption, each symbol or digit in the ciphertext is replaced back into its original uppercase letter using the same encryption table but in reverse. Since each symbol maps uniquely to one uppercase letter (and vice versa), there's no ambiguity in reversing the process. For example, if the ciphertext contains the symbol '*', it gets decrypted back to the letter 'H'.\n\n4. **Uniqueness and Invertibility:** The key feature of this method is that every character in the plaintext has a unique representation in the ciphertext, and every symbol in the ciphertext directly corresponds to only one character in the plaintext. This ensures that decryption can perfectly reconstruct the original text from any valid ciphertext generated by this encryption method.\n\n5. **Preservation of Formatting:** Both encryption and decryption processes preserve the positions of characters/symbols relative to each other within the text, meaning that the structure of the message remains intact throughout these processes.\n\nIn summary, the encryption table provides a clear one-to-one relationship between plaintext characters and ciphertext symbols, allowing for perfect decryption back to the original plaintext when the correct ciphertext is provided.",
