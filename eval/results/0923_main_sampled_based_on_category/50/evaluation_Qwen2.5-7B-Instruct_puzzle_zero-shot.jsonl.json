The rule specifies that each word should have a common feature that can be changed to form a weather condition.\n2. We need to change one letter in each of the words: \"fig\", \"must\", \"hind\", \"slow\", and \"smug\" to form a weather condition.\n3. Let's work through each word to see if we can identify a common feature:\n\n- **fig**: Changing the \"f\" to \"n\" gives us \"ning\", which can be a weather condition like \"fog\".\n- **must**: Changing the \"m\" to \"r\" gives us \"urst\", which can be \"storm\".\n- **hind**: Changing the \"h\" to \"n\" gives us \"ind\", which can be \"wind\".\n- **slow**: Changing the \"s\" to \"r\" gives us \"low\", which can be \"snow\".\n- **smug**: Changing the \"s\" to \"r\" gives us \"mug\", which can be \"rug\", but a more fitting weather condition here is \"roar\" (as in a thunderstorm or heavy wind).\n\nHowever, there seems to be a common theme: each word can be changed to one of the word's final three letters to form \"fog\", \"storm\", \"wind\", \"snow\", and \"roar\". Since \"roar\" doesn't fit as precisely as the others, a more fitting second word could be \"gale\" for \"smug\".\n\nThe following transformation aligns more closely with typical weather conditions:\n- **fig** -> **fog**\n- **must** -> **storm**\n- **hind** -> **wind**\n- **slow** -> **snow**\n- **smug** -> **gale**\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[fog storm wind snow gale]]",

The equation is: ONE + ONE + TWO = FOUR.\n2. This can be simplified to: 2 * (ONE) + TWD = FOUR, where D is zero.\n3. Let's denote the values as follows: O=O, N=N, E=E, T=T, W=W, D=0, F=F, U=U, R=R.\n\nNow, let's start assigning values:\n\n- Since T, O, and F are the leading digits, they cannot be 0.\n- From the equation, we see that O + O + W must end in R (since the unit place of 2*ONE is added to TWD to get FOUR).\n\nLet's try some values:\n\n- Let's assume O = 1, then the unit place calculation is 1 + 1 + W = R (mod 10).\n- T + 1 * 10 + W + F * 100 = F * 100 + U * 10 + R, simplifying this, we need T + W + 2 * 1 + 0 = F * 10 + U + R.\n\nAssuming some values:\n\n- If O = 1, then 1 + 1 + W = R, W = 8 (since 1 + 1 + 8 = 10, R = 0, but R can't be 0 because F is the leading digit and T, O, F are unique and non-zero).\n- Trying again, if O = 2, then 2 + 2 + W = R, W = 4 (since 2 + 2 + 4 = 8, R = 8).\n\nLet's assign:\n- O = 2, W = 4, R = 8, T = 9 (since T cannot be 2 or 4 and has to be non-zero).\n- Now, 2 + 2 + 4 = 8, so the unit place works. We need to check the tens place.\n\n- 2N4 + 2N4 + 94 = F28.\n- 4N8 + 94 = F28.\n- 4 + 9 = 13, so the tens place is 3, and F = 1 (since 2N8 + 1 = 213).\n\nTesting:\n- 2N4 + 2N4 + 94 = 218.\n- 4N8 + 94 = 118, which is correct.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n[[O=2,N=1,E=4,T=9,W=4,F=1,U=8,R=8]]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure all letters are unique, so:\n- O=2, N=9, E=4, T=1, W=8, F=5, U=7, R=3.\n\nSo the correct unique assignment is:\n[[O=2,N=9,E=4,T=1,W=8,F=5,U=7,R=3]]",

We need to fill the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column matches the given numbers.\n\nLet's denote the grid by \\(G[i][j]\\), where \\(i\\) is the row number (1 to 5) and \\(j\\) is the column number (1 to 6).\n\n1. **First row (sum = 12)**: We need to place black cells whose positions (weights) sum to 12.

Given numbers need to be continued in sequence (1 to 81) in an 9x9 grid.\n\nWe start from the provided sequence and fill in the gaps:\n\n1. The first row is already partially filled with '11', '7', '3' and '81', and '77'. We know 11 should be next to 12, 12 next to 13 but 13 is already inserted as 13. The sequence until 13 is correct: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. So, we need to fill the blanks:\n```\n11 12  7 14  3 16  81 18  77\n```\n2. The second row has '9', '5', '1', '79'. Inserting the missing numbers:\n```\n19  9  20  5 21  1 22  79 23\n```\n3. The third row has '13' and '75'. Missing are 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. But 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 are already provided, so put 23, and add 24:\n```\n24  13 25 26 27 28 29 30 75\n```\n4. The fourth row has '21' and '73', so fill 22 and 23:\n```\n31 32 33 34 35 36 37 73 39\n```\n5. The fifth row has '23' and '71'. Fill 24:\n```\n40 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 71\n```\n6. The sixth row has '35' and '59'. Fill 36, 37, 38:\n```\n41 35 36 37 38 39 40 59 42\n```\n7. The seventh row has '37' and '69'. Fill 38, 39:\n```\n43 37 44 45 46 47 48 49 69\n```\n8. The eighth row has '41', '31', '49', '67', '65'. Fill the missing numbers:\n```\n50 41 51 31 42 43 52 67 65\n53 54 55 56 57 58 59 61 63\n50 41 51 31 42 43 52 67 65\n```\n9.

Since (1,1) > (2,1) and the only pre-filled number is 3 at (2,1), (1,1) must be 4, 5, 6, or 7. But considering other constraints, we will verify as we fill.\n\n2. Since (3,1) > (3,2) and (3,2) > (3,3), the sequence in the first column of row 3 must be in strictly increasing order. Hence, possible candidates for (3,1) are 5, 6, or 7. But we need to check with (3,1) < (4,1).\n\nBy filling the first column start:\n- (1,1) = 7 (since it is the highest number and (1,1) > (2,1)=3)\n- (2,1) = 3\n- (3,1) = 6 (highest for first column in row 3 and (3,1) < (4,1))\n- (4,1) = 5\n\nNow we have:\n```\n7 X X X\n3 3 X X\nX X X X\n5 X X X\n```\n\nFor row 2, the only number left is 4 for the second column.\n\nNow:\n```\n7 X X X\n3 3 4 X\nX X X X\n5 X X X\n```\n\nFor row 3 and 4, filling the remaining numbers considering the inequality constraints we have:\n- (3,2) = 2\n- (3,3) = 1\n- (4,2) = 6\n- (4,3) = 7\n\nNow the grid looks like:\n```\n7 X X X\n3 3 4 X\nX 2 1 X\n5 6 7 X\n```\n\nRemaining number 8 for the fourth column of row 3 and 4.\n- (3,4) = 8\n- (4,4) = 8\n\nNon-duplicate:\n\n```\n7 8 X X\n3 3 4 X\nX 2 1 8\n5 6 7 8\n```\n\nSo the correct sequence for the matrix is:\n```\n7 8 X X\n3 3 4 X\n2 1 8 X\n5 6 7 8\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n[[7 8 X X,3 3 4 X,2 1 8 X,5 6 7 8]]\n\nAfter replugging the filled data to ensure correctness, if we confirm there are no contradictions, the result is:\n\n``` \n[7 8 9 10,3 3 4 11,2 1 8 12,5 6 7 13]\n```",

The number 2 in the first row must be in column 1, because it is the only available place for 2 in the first row.\n2. Given the constraint (1,2) > (1,3), the number in the second column must be greater than the number in the third column. Since only 1, 2, 3 are available, and 2 is already in the first column, the third column can only have 1, and the second column must have 3.\n\nSo, the first row is now:\n2 3 1 X\n\n3.

Since the third column (1,3) is 1, and (2,3) > (1,3), (2,3) must be 2 or 3. But since 3 is already in the same column in the first row, (2,3) must be 3.\n\n5. Given (2,2) > (2,3), (2,2) can only be 3, but since 3 is already at (2,3), (2,2) must be 1, and the remaining cells (2,1) and (2,4) must be 2 and 3 respectively, which means (2,1) = 2 and (2,4) = 3.\n\nSo, the second row is now:\n1 2 3 3\n\n6. For the third row, given (3,1) < (3,2), and since (3,2) cannot be 3 (3 is already in the fourth column), (3,1) must be 1 and (3,2) must be 2.

Since the 4 is at the top of the column, the 3 must be in the 5th row (visible from below) and the 2 will be in the 1st row (visible from right).\n   - The 2 at the bottom of the column means the 3 must be in the 4th row, so it is clear the order is 3, 4.\n\n4. **Second Row (From the bottom):**\n   - The 1 means there is only one visible sky scraper in the second row. Since the column can only show 1-4 in order and 1 is at the right, it must be that only the 3 is visible. So, the 3 in the 4th row (visible from bottom) forces 4 to be in 2nd row (visible from right).\n\n5. **First Row (From the bottom):**\n   - The 1 and 4 must be correctly filled, since the 4 is the tallest. The 2 is placed next, and the third is continuously filled.\n\n6. **Filling in details:**\n   - The first row can be determined as 1, 4, 3, 2, 1 to fit the clues.\n   - Continuing this to fit all the numbers in a correct logical order.\n\n### Final Correct Filling (top to bottom, left to right):\n```\n1 4 3 2 1\n4 4 3 2 1 1\n3 3 2 1 4 2\n2 2 1 4 3 3\n1 1 4 3 2 4\n5 5 4 3 2 1\n```\n\nSo, the solution when flattened and formatted in the required manner is:\n```\n[[1 4 3 2 1 1 1] [4 4 3 2 1 1 1] [3 3 2 1 4 2 2] [2 2 1 4 3 3 3]]\n```",
