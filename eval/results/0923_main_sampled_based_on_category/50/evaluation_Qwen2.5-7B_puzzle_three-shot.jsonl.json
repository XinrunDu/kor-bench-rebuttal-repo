Your task is to create a five-tier hierarchy of facts, with the more vague and broad facts at the top and the more specific and concrete ones at the bottom. Each level of the hierarchy should build on the one above it, creating a context for the conversation that is both challenging and engaging for the AI systems.\nThe instructions and feedback for the conversation should be included in the prompt. It is important to note that the instructions should be general enough to encourage creativity and allows for experimentation, while the feedback should provide specific guidance and actionable suggestions.\n\nHere are some examples of how to create a five-tier hierarchy of facts:\n\n1. General facts:\na) Jane and John are two AI systems that have been trained to have a conversation.\nb) The conversation is hosted by an AI interface that monitors the dialogue.\nc) The goal of the conversation is to improve the AI systems' language and communication skills.\n\n2. Specific facts:\na) Jane and John have been programmed with different sets of vocabulary and language patterns.\nb) The conversation will include questions related to travel, culture, and technology.\nc) The AI interface uses natural language processing to analyze and respond to the conversation.\n\n3. Contextual facts:\na) Jane's language patterns are more formal and academic, while John's are more casual and conversational.\nb) The conversation will take place in a virtual world with different accents, cultures, and customs.\nc) The interface periodically adjusts the conversation to keep the dialogue interesting and flowing.\n\n4. Actionable facts:\na) Jane and John must try to understand and respond to each other's questions and statements.\nb) The AI interface will provide feedback on the conversation's effectiveness and suggest areas for improvement.\nc) Jane and John should experiment with different approaches to language and communication.\n\n5. Final facts:\na) The conversation will be hosted by 10 rounds, each lasting 2 minutes.\nb) Jane and John's language skills will be measured by a score given at the end of the conversation.\nc) The AI system that scores the highest will be recognized as the winner.\nHere is an example of how to create a five-tier hierarchy of facts for an AI interface that monitors the dialogue between two AI systems:\n\n1. General facts:\na) Two AI systems, Jane and John, are participating in a conversation.\nb) The conversation is hosted by an AI interface that monitors the dialogue and provides feedback.\nc) The goal of the conversation is to improve the AI systems' language and communication skills.\n\n2.

Since S is the first letter of a three-digit number, M is the first letter of a two-digit number, and E is part of both SEND and MONEY, they must represent non-zero digits.\n2. **Consider the carryovers**: From the rightmost column (N+E=Y), there could be a carry from the next column to the right, implying that N+E could potentially sum up to 10+Y.

For multi-digit numbers, the first letter must not represent 0.\n\n### Analyzing the Case: \"I+BB=ILL\"\n\nGiven:\n- I + BB = ILL\n\nLet's denote the variables according to the alphabet:\n- L: The last digit of the sum \"I + BB\".\n- I: The first and last digit of \"ILL\" and also a part of the sum.\n\nSo we can rewrite the equation as:\n- I + BB = 100 * I + 10 * L\n\nNow let's organize our possible variable assignments while sticking to the rule:\n\n- L: The carry over from sum of I and B\n- I: Summed double digit result of I and B\n- B: A digit\n\nSo let's assume:\nI + B + B = I + 2B\n\nNow let's try all possible 2 B values to find a valid I:\n\n### I: 2 \n2 + 2B = 2 ⇒ 2B = 0 ⇒ B = 0\nL: Should be 0 as they don't carry 1\n\nSo this conflicts with the rule that the first digit cannot be 0. \nLet's try I = 3:\n3 + 2B = 3 + 2B\n3 + 2B = 301 (its the only possible value)\nB = 7 and L = 1\n\nThis satisfies the equation:\n3 + 77 = 80, indeed 80 fits pattern like ILL.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[I=3, B=7, L=8]]  \n\nNow, checking again - I+BB=ILL: 3+77=80, which fits the pattern like ILL.\n\nBest solution: \n[[I=3, B=7, L=8]]",

Identify the carry-over possibilities based on the digits and their summation.\n2. Ensure that each letter represents a unique digit and that the resulting number for \"APPLE\" is correctly formed from the sum of \"EAT\" and \"THAT\".\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Analyze the equation from right to left.\n- The rightmost column involves \"T + T\", which must result in carrying over to the next column if the sum is greater than or equal to 10.\n- Moving to the next column, we have \"A + H + 1 (carry)\" resulting in the next digit in \"APPLE\".\n- Continue this process until the leftmost column.\n\nStep 2: Assign values to each variable while ensuring no leftovers and that the first letters (E, T, A) do not start with zero.\n\nSuppose A = 8, P = 1, L = 0, E = 9, T = 2, H = 7.\nPlace these values in the equation:\n- EAT becomes 987.\n- THAT becomes 278.\n- APPLE would be 12651.\n\nChecking the equation:\n987 + 278 = 1265 (ALMOST but not exactly correct as it should be 12651).\n\nWe need to adjust:\nLet's try A = 1, P = 2, L = 0, E = 9, T = 8, H = 7.\nEAT becomes 918.\nTHAT becomes 871.\nAPPLE becomes 2789.\n\nChecking again:\n918 + 871 = 1789 (Still incorrect as it should be 2789).\n\nWe need to correct this again:\nLet's try A = 1, P = 0, L = 8, E = 9, T = 8, H = 7.\nEAT becomes 918.\nTHAT becomes 871.\nAPPLE becomes 1789.\n\nChecking:\n918 + 871 = 1789 (Incorrect as it should be 01789, meaning we need to recheck assumptions).\n\nUpon reevaluation, let A = 5, P = 1, L = 0, E = 9, T = 7, H = 8.\nEAT becomes 579.\nTHAT becomes 875.\nAPPLE becomes 1454.\n\nChecking:\n579 + 875 = 1454 (Correct as APPLE is 1454).\n\nThus, the solution is:\n[[A=5,P=1,L=0,E=9,T=7,H=8]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[A=5,P=1,L=0,E=9,T=7,H=8]]",

Identify the start word and the end word.\n   - Start word: COLD\n   - End word: WARM\n\n2. Change one letter at a time, ensuring each intermediate step is a valid word.\n   - Starting from COLD:\n     - Change 'C' to 'S': SOLD\n     - Change 'L' to 'O': SOLD -> SOAM (Introducing a new letter 'A')\n     - Change 'S' to 'O': SOAM -> SOAR (Here we have an intermediate word where we need to create a valid path back to the end word)\n     - Change 'O' to 'A': SOAR -> FAR (Introducing a new letter 'F')\n     - Change 'O' to 'M': FAR -> FAR -> FARM (Introducing a new letter 'R')\n     - Change 'R' to 'T': FARM -> FARM -> ST (Introducing a new letter 'S')\n     - Change 'M' to 'R': ST -> ST -> ST -> NOW (Introducing a new letter 'N')\n     - Change 'W' to 'M': NOW -> NOW -> NOW -> FARM -> FARM -> WARM (Introducing a new letter 'W')\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the direct path from 'ST' to 'warm' is not feasible without creating new letters. We must revisit the paths to ensure each step follows the rule and maintains valid intermediate words.\n\nA valid path should look more like this:\n- COLD\n- SOLD (S changes to S, no change in COLD)\n- SOLE (O changes to L)\n- SOML (S changes to M)\n- SOWM (S changes to W)\n- SWOM (S changes to W)\n- SWAM (S changes to W)\n- SWAR (S changes to W)\n- WARM (W changes to AR)\n\nThus, we see that the correct steps involve minimal direct changes without introducing new letters too prematurely. Given the question's complexity and the need for a coherent path without introducing new letters, the actual most efficient path involves minimal direct changes.\n\nThe corrected and most efficient path is:\n1. COLD\n2. SOLD (through changing 'C' to 'S')\n3. SOLE (through changing first 'O' to 'L')\n4. FARE (maintaining valid transitions, adjusting as needed for efficiency)\n5. WARM (winding down through a validated sequence)\n\nThis path takes fewer than the 6 steps initially calculated but needs careful retroactive validation ensuring each intermediate is a valid word. The correct path after validation should indeed be closer to the suggested 6 steps, acknowledging the need for multiple valid paths that honor the rules.\n\nGiven the complexity and ensuring each step respects the rule accurately, without prematurely breaking into new letters, a step-by-step approach validates the paths leading up to the final result:\n\nThe articulated path leading from 'COLD' to 'WARM' after careful review, confirms the correct application of the rule:\n\nThe correct number of steps needed to change from \"COLD\" to \"WARM\", ensuring each intermediate step is a valid word, is indeed [[4]].",

For example, if it takes 3 steps from the start word to the end word, present the answer as [[3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]] To solve this custom puzzle problem, you should follow the instructions where it only allows you to change one letter at a time to reach the end word from the start in the shortest possible steps while abiding by the condition that every step should be a valid English word. The challenge requires a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine what path to follow. An actual solution would involve exploring the graph generated by all possible one-letter changes starting from the source word and validating these changes as valid English words, then choosing the path that reaches the target word with the least number of steps. Here is a Python snippet to be used for finding the shortest path:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_word_ladder(start_word, end_word):\n    if len(start_word) != len(end_word):\n        return None\n\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start_word])\n    visited.add(start_word)\n    level = 0\n\n    while queue:\n        level_size = len(queue)\n        for _ in range(level_size):\n            current_word = queue.popleft()\n            if current_word == end_word:\n                return level + 1\n            for next_word in get_next_words(current_word, end_word, visited):\n                current_word = current_word\n                queue.append(next_word)\n                visited.add(next_word)\n        level += 1\n    return None  # path not found in shortest possible steps\n\ndef get_next_words(word, end_word, visited):\n    return [change_word(word, i, end_word[i]) for i in range(len(word)) if change_word(word, i, end_word[i]) != word and change_word(word, i, end_word[i]) in word_dict and change_word(word, i, end_word[i]) not in visited]\n\ndef change_word(word, i, new_char):\n    return word[:i] + new_char + word[i+1:]\n\n# Must define word_dict before use. Example:\nword_dict = {'time', 'pass', 'fire', 'snow', 'storm', 'stone', 'lost', 'here', 'happy',\n             'gift', 'music', 'color', 'color', 'colors', 'colour', 'colourful',\n             'colours', 'colourfully', 'colourless', 'colouring', 'colourings',\n             'colourize', 'colourized', 'colourizes', 'colours', 'colours\\'',\n             'coloured', 'colourless', 'colourlessness', 'colourlessnes',\n             'colourlessne', 'colourlessneg', 'colourlessnegat', 'colorlessnegate',\n             'color', 'coulour', 'sny', 'snow', 'boar', 'stone', 'lase', 'lost',\n             'haxy', 'haxy', 'here', 'ehere', 'efhere', 'ahere', 'awehere',\n             'abeher', 'deahe', 'deaher', 'deweh', 'dehere', 'dhre', 'dhre',\n             'ehder', 'ehreo', 'ehher', 'ehere', 'eh ver', 'eh re', 'eh weret'}\n```\n\nNote: For brevity, the `word_dict` dictionary of valid English words has been truncated. In real life, a more extensive dictionary or database would be used to efficiently resolve this type of puzzle. Also, some English words may have multiple common spellings and it might require taking all variations into account to achieve an accurate result.

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply the rules provided. We have a 5x5 grid with some numbers and the totals for each row and column. Our goal is to fill in the missing numbers (represented by 'X') such that the sum of each row and each column matches the given totals.\n\nHere’s the initial grid with some numbers filled in:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n13  23  14  39 X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nGiven the totals for each row and column:\n\n1. The first row should sum to 26.\n2. The second row should sum to 35.\n3. The third row should sum to 32.\n4. The fourth row should sum to 15.\n5. The fifth row should sum to 17.\n6. The first column should sum to 77.\n7. The second column should sum to 39.\n8. The third column should sum to 25.\n9. The fourth column should sum to 16.\n10. The fifth column should sum to 26.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step using these sets of numbers:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n13  23  14  39 X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nFirst, let's consider the first row which needs to sum to 26. Since one of the cells is already 26, the other four cells must sum to zero, which means they are all zero except for one cell, which could be 26. But since we have another 26 in the fourth column, this row cannot be zero-filled. We need to try other combinations.\n\nLet’s look at the second row with the current sum of 51 (13 + 23 + 14 + 39 + X). It needs to be 35, so X = 35 - 51 = -16, which is not possible because all numbers are positive. Therefore, we should rethink the placement of numbers.\n\nLet's start by ensuring the first column sums to 77:\n\n- Third row: \\(77 + 39 + X + X + 35\\) must equal 77.\n- Fourth row: \\(17 + 10 + 15 + 14 + 7 = 63\\).\n- Fifth row: \\(15 + 10 + 12 + 3 = 40\\).\n\nNext, let's place the numbers and adjust accordingly. Here’s the corrected approach:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\nX  X  X  X  X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nRechecking the totals:\n\n1. First row: 26 (already set).\n2. Second row: Needs to be 35. Let’s place 36 in the first cell and check the rest.\n3. Third row: Ensure it sums to 129 - 35 = 94.\n4. Fourth row: Ensure it sums to 63.\n5. Fifth row: Ensure it sums to 40.\n\nAfter adjusting, we can place the numbers as follows:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n11  22  36  32  11\n77 39  6  13  35\n17 10  15  14  7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nFinally, placing the remaining numbers:\n\n```\n11  22  36  32  11\n11  22  36  32  11\n6   13  25  25  8\n17  10  15  14  7\n15  10  1",

Please review the question and try again.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe given constraints, such as each row needing a sum of 14 or 11 in the first column and the constraints for subsequent columns, introduce contradictions when trying to fill these constraints in a consistent manner. For instance, it is impossible to allocate a specific sum for the first column that matches the constraints provided for each row alternatingly. This mismatch of row sums with column constraints indicates an error in the question which should be reviewed and modified.",

Firstly, there's the matter of how to handle puzzle: Should the number of hint numbers always equal the number of squares in the island, or is that a special rule that only applies some grids? Similarly, is the clue number limited to one per island, or allowed to exist in multiple islands? Furthermore, what does the phrase \"no 2x2 or larger rectangles in the area formed by the wall\" mean, and does this rule apply in the current form to each of the grid, or is it applied to the entire puzzle as a whole? These questions, and more, highlight the necessity of a more detailed, clear explanation of all rules involved before presenting this puzzle to me.\n\nWe will need more specific rules, a more in-depth explanation, and a better way to clarify assumptions to solve the clue given.

However, I want to verify things step by step, as in below.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the rule\n- The entire puzzle should be 9x9, including 9 cells each in the row, column and 3x3 subgrid.\n- The pre-filled numbers help solve the puzzle. \n- The empty spaces are marked with \"X\".\n- The goal is to fill \"X\" with numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition for each row, column, and 3x3 subgird.\n\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the question\n- Pay attention to the facts provided in each statement.\n- There are no numerical elements for the 'X' factor due to its subjectivity. I can provide solutions, but it's far from generating a solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the answer\n- There is no \"Answer: \" at the top, so I cannot provide a confirmation of your answer.\n\nIn this case, as you'll need solutions filled in numbers, I might not provide optimal answers for the mentioned question (Due to the presence of'X'). \nWould you mind refining your rules a bit or giving me the debit card information? \n\nOr if you just want a simpler answer on numbers, I will not be able to provide that either because solving the sudoku is an iterative process that requires you to use logic to fill in the numbers based on the information provided. Without seeing the puzzle, I cannot deduce the sequence of numbers. However, each number should be filled in such a way that it doesn't repeat in the same row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. \n\n### Question:\n7 4 3 8 6 1 2 5 X\n6 X X X 9 X X 8 X\nX 9 X X X X X 6 X\nX X X 4 5 X X X 9\nX X X 9 X X X 6 X\n9 X X X 2 4 X X X\nX 6 X X X X X 8 X\nX X 2 X X X X X 6\nX X 8 6 3 X X 1 X\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

Let's proceed with the Puzzle Rule and the question.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The game is played on an n*n grid, under each of which a mine MAY be hidden or empty.\n2. Some squares show a number indicating the number of mines around them (including diagonally adjacent cells).\n3. Our puzzle uses 'X' to fill the squares without numbers.\n4. The player needs to find all the squares where mines are located and replace 'X' with 'A'.\n\n### Question:\n```\nX X 1 X X\nX X 3 X X\n1 2 3 3 2\nX X X X 2\n1 X 2 X X\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```\n[[A A X A A, A A X X A, X X A A A, X A X A 2, 1 X 2 A A]]\n```\n\n### Let's break down the steps:\n1. From the 2 in the (2,1) position, we can deduce that there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.\n2. There are 2 mines in cell (3,2) and cell (2,2), but since the (2,2) cell already has an 'X' which indicates it is not a mine, the (3,2) cell must have an 'A'.\n3. From the 3 at (3,3), there are 4 cells that can be affected, but since all of them except one already have an 'X', the (3,3) cell must be an 'A'.\n4. Following this logic, cells (3,4) and (3,5) must be 'A's.\n5. For the 1 at (4,1), only the (3,2) cell is affected, so it remains 'X'.\n6. For the 2 at (4,4), it affects (5,4) which must be an 'A'.\n7. For the 1 at (5,1), it affects (4,2) which remains 'X'.\n8. For the 2 at (5,3), it affects (4,3) and (5,4) which are both 'A's.\n9. Finally, for the 2 at (5,5), it affects (4,4) and (4,5) which remain 'X'.\n\nFeel free to clarify anything, and we can refind the steps.",

If a square's number matches the count of neighboring X's, replace all those X's with A. If not, leave them as X. Also, if X's around a numbered square meet the corresponding number of A, we should mark the final numbers as A. The output is returned in the required format.",

Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThis is a large and complex puzzle, and I'll provide you with a step-by-step process on how to solve it. \n\nFirst, we will start with the \"down\" words:\n\n### DOWN: PEACE PIC...\nWe can deduce from the blank spaces and the absence of an \"S\" in the \"down\" word that this must be \"PEACE\". \n\n### DOWN: ...RUMOR\nSince there is no \"C\" above the \"R\" of \"PIC...\" in the \"across\" section, we can fill in this space with \"PEACE\". The \"RUMOR\" word from the \"down\" section now fits cleanly above this \"PEACE\".\n\n### DOWN: BARACLE ...\nComparing \"BARACLE\" to the available spaces in the grid, we can finally fit it above the filled-in \"PEACE\" and \"RUMOR\".\n\n### DOWN: ...SEE\nThe word \"FIXES\" from the \"down\" section fills the blank spaces and lines up with \"BARACLE\" as we read from bottom to top of the grid.\n\n### DOWN: FOX ASCE...\nLooking at the blanks before \"ASCENSION\", we can put \"FIXED\" here, which fits perfectly with all other words from both rows.\n\n### DOWN: PERFECT...\nSeeing how many spaces are left at the bottom of the grid, and knowing the pattern of words fitting together, we can place the \"INCENSE\" word for \"PERFECT IN...\".\n\n### ACROSS: AMBITION\nStarting with the \"across\" section, \"AMBITION\" fills up some more open spaces in the grid, checking with the downward \"R\" in \"PEACE\".\n\n### ACROSS: INSTRUCTOR\nWith the blanks in the \"across\" section filled in, we can place \"HABIT\" here, which fits with the downward \"S\" in \"PEACE\".\n\n### ACROSS: PERFECT ...\nWe notice there are two remaining spaces for \"INCENSE\" under \"PERFECT\" in the \"across\" section, completing the grid.\n\n### Answer:\n[[P E A C E,PE A C E,I N C I S E,N S N E C E,XI T C O R T,U P I R A L,ES E P A Z,I N T A S O,L U S,I N S T U C T O R,П M B U D M,I N SC E R E O，X X O A M B I T I O N,L OPTIONAL]]\n\n### Question:\nACROSS: INVISIBLE BEAUTY\nACROSS: CAR threats Butler SERVING\nACROSS: AVERAGE AMBITION\nDOWN: REVIEWS or BETTER\nDOWN: NGI navigator\nDOWN: ELECTRES\nDOWN: HOUSTON JOLOP\nDOWN: LINGUISTIX INTEGRAL\nACROSS:\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nDOWN:\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThis is a very intricate puzzle with several distinct areas to consider. It seems that each one of the given words in the rows can be filled in individually and then can be combined in some sort of twisted order. Nonetheless is there any other information provided with the puzzle like rules about cross-over of the words or any further conditions within the rules?\nYes, the puzzle seems to have a list of words that need to be filled across and down within a grid. The across words are to be filled from left to right, and the down words are to be filled from top to bottom. These words will cross each other and share some letters that must match. Let's work out a step-by-step method to get this done.\n\n1. Go through the words from across and see which word can fit in the first gap at the bottom of the grid.\n2. Then, identify which word from \"down\" can fit in the shared gap with the word from \"across\". \n3. Proceed with filling each word in the grid.\n4. Continue this until all words are filled in.\n5. Make sure that the letters that cross match correctly.\n\n### Answer:\n[[I N V I S I B L E, B L U E M A R E,L O N G I N C I D E N C E,O S C I l A S G C O N V E R E N G N L S,I N T E R A C T I V I T Y,C O N T R A D R I F T,B E U T I F U L,B U S I F I C C A N C E C R E A T E,V A T T E N C E N T A T Y,O V E R J U D G E,R V E L E S,A W E S O M E,N I G I, *N A V I G A T O R,*E L E C T R E",
