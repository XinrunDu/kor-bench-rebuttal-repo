Apply the equivalence (4): (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C) to the sub-expression ! p | (p | q), which simplifies to ! p | p | q.\n3. Apply the equivalence (7): A | (A & B) ::=:: A to simplify ! p | p, which is always true (1), so we can simplify that part to 1.\n4. The expression now is 1 | q & r, which, by the nature of OR and AND operations, keeps the AND part as it is, due to the identity A | 1 ::=:: 1. The simplified expression is effectively just the original AND part, as the OR with a true condition is dominant, but we retain the original for the AND part: q & r.\n\n### Expression 2: p&(((p|q)&! p)>q)\n\n1. First, simplify the sub-expression (p|q)&! p. This uses the equivalence (6): ! (A & B) ::=:: ! A | ! B, applied to ! ((p|q)&! p), which becomes ! (p|q) | p.\n2. Next, apply the equivalence (6) again to ! (p|q), which becomes ! p & ! q.\n3. Now, we have the sub-expression simplified to (! p & ! q) | p.\n4. Apply the equivalence (10): A > B ::=:: ! A | B to the entire expression's core, ((p|q)&! p) > q, which, substituting our simplified sub-expression, becomes (! p & ! q) | p > q.\n5. Apply the equivalence (10) again, inside the parentheses, to ! q > ! ((! p & ! q) | p), which flips to: ! ! q & ! (! (! p & ! q) | p), simplifies to q & ((! p & ! q) | p) by the double negation.\n6. Given our goal is to simplify to `|`, `&`, and `!`, we recognize that multiplying by q through the AND operation keeps the structure of the OR part but doesn't simplify further with immediate identities given.

The correct interpretation involves recognizing that the initial formulation of the left side, through any direct simplification, does not lead to a match with the right side's structure without deeply embedding into the logic of NAND or NOR operations implicit in the behavior of negating an OR operation directly through De Morgan's, which isn't directly cited in the simplifications allowed.\n\nGiven the structure and the aim to match $(p | q) & (!(p | q))$ through direct logical simplification from $(p & !q) | (!p & q)$ without deeply engaging in the implicit transformation via De Morgan's to directly compare the negation of the OR through AND operations directly specified, the equivalences provided do not straightforwardly confirm the equivalence without engaging in a deeper, non-explicitly-allowed transformation.\n\nTherefore, for the strict application of the provided basic equivalences to directly confirm or refute the equivalence:\n\n**The answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.

        "response": "To find the number of formulas that satisfy both the basic form and the all-even form conditions with 4 propositional variables, we first need to understand what these conditions entail for a formula to be both a basic formula and an all-even formula.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables, the total number of paired conjunctive terms (or paired disjunctive terms, since we're considering the principal disjunctive normal form) is \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of propositional variables. For \\(n = 4\\), this number is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n**Being a Basic Formula:**\nA formula is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\), which corresponds to the truth assignment where all propositional variables are false. In terms of our notation and the given rule, this means including the paired conjunctive term that represents the hexadecimal number 0, which is \\(m_0\\) in binary form (since \\(0_{16}\\) in binary is \\(0000\\), and \\(m_0\\) corresponds to this binary representation).\n\n**Being an All-Even Formula:**\nA formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have indices that are even. In the context of hexadecimal numbers used to denote these terms (where \\(m_i\\) or \\(M_i\\) corresponds to hexadecimal numbers), an even index translates directly to the binary representation ending in an even number of 1s. This is because even hexadecimal numbers (except zero) in binary start with 1 and have an even number of 0s following (or are 0 itself, which in binary is \\(0000\\)).\n\n**Intersection of Basic and All-Even Forms:**\nFor a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must include \\(m_0\\) (corresponding to the all-false assignment) and no other terms except those with even indices in their hexadecimal to binary correspondences.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables:\n- The only form that includes \\(m_0\\) and satisfies the all-even condition without including any other paired conjunctive terms (to adhere to the definition of being both a basic and an all-even formula simultaneously) is \\(m_0\\) itself. This is because including any other term, either from odd-indexed paired conjunctive terms (which would violate the all-even condition) or from even-indexed terms beyond \\(m_0\\) (which are necessarily included due to their pairing in the binary/hexadecimal scheme and the need to exclude all others for the formula to be basic), would contradict the criteria of being a basic or an all-even formula.\n\nThus, the only formula that satisfies both conditions is one that essentially represents the disjunction with no variable truth assignments beyond the all-false case, which is distinctly represented by \\(m_0\\). There are no other formulas under 4 propositional variables that can simultaneously be both a basic form and an all-even form due to the exclusivity of the conditions when applied strictly to their definitions as outlined.\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form with 4 propositional variables is 1.\n\n### Answer:\n[1]",

Identify relevant properties and objects:\n   - Proposition 1 (p): A person can pull their own hair.\n   - Proposition 2 (q): A person can leave the earth.\n   - Necessity (#) and Possibility ($): Implied relationships.\n\n2. Apply the logical operations:\n   - The statement asserts that a person cannot necessarily do both actions (pulling their own hair and leaving the earth) simultaneously. This means that it is not necessarily true that both actions occur.\n   - We can express this situation with the negation of the necessity for both actions to occur together: !#(p + q).\n\n3. Find the corresponding truth-value modal reasoning formula:\n   - The given statement corresponds to an assertion that it is not necessary for both propositions to be true at the same time. This does not directly match one of the provided formulas but can be related to the idea that if something is not necessarily true, its opposite could be considered possible. Therefore, we look for a formula that best captures this nuance.\n   - Formula (9) #p → $p comes closest in the sense that if something is necessarily possible, then it is just plainly possible. However, to directly align with the given scenario, we need to adjust our understanding of the relationship between # and $ as described in the Four Modal Proposition Relationships. Specifically, relationship (1) applies where #p and $¬p cannot both be true or false, indicating a strict separation between necessity and possibility for the same proposition.\n   - Given the structure of the initial scenario involves the interplay of two actions (pulling hair and leaving the earth) rather than a single proposition's necessity and possibility, we need to focus on how the negation of necessity intertwines with possibility. The closest conceptual match in the operations and relations provided, considering the interplay and the negation involved, is more aligned with understanding the implications of necessity and possibility relationships as outlined but not directly matched by the numbered formulas.\n\nHowever, the direct inference from \"A person cannot necessarily pull their own hair and leave the earth\" to \"A person cannot possibly pull their own hair and leave the earth\" isn't straightforward from the provided formulas as structured. The inference involves a shift from negating necessity to asserting impossibility, which is a stronger claim than merely stating what is possible. \n\nGiven the structure and the aim to find a direct match or the most conceptually aligned formula from the provided, the process involves inferring a stronger claim (from not necessarily true to impossible) which doesn't have a direct numerical match in the provided modal logic inference formulas. \n\n### Answer:\nWhile the question aims to find a direct match from the provided formulas, the inference and its alignment to the given logical operations and relationships highlight a nuance not directly encapsulated by the listed modal logic inference formulas. The closest conceptual alignment in the context of discussing the interplay between necessity and possibility without a direct numerical match suggests a recursive application of the principles, especially around negation and the implications of necessity (#) and possibility ($):\n\n- The inference from \"cannot necessarily\" to \"cannot possibly\" involves a leap from negating necessity (#) to asserting impossibility (which can be seen as !$, given that \"cannot possibly\" negates \"possible\").\n\nGiven the focus on finding a formula that corresponds to the direct inference asked in the question, the exercise underscores the need for a formula that explicitly bridges the negation of necessity to the assertion of impossibility in a single step, which is not directly provided in the list. \n\n### Answer (Approximate conceptual match):\n[[(1)]]$ - This is not a direct match but conceptually, the transformation from necessity to possibility in the context asked, considering the aim to find a closest principle, indirectly involves recognizing that if something is not necessarily possible (negating the necessity of the conjunction), it implies a different level of possibility discourse, which, while not formulaically matched in the provided, conceptually aligns with exploring the implications of # and $ relationships and their negations. The closest practical application would be related to how negations interplay with # and $, guiding toward understanding the implications rather than a direct numerical [[number]] match.",
