With Smart Socks, users could potentially unlock the ability to navigate cities using psychic power, a concept inspired by Professor Oak's research on Pokémon. Sid is a bit concerned about implementing this potential solution and assumes that additional technological extensions may be necessary.\n\nYour AI persona is an exceptionally knowledgeable virtual assistant with a knack for storytelling and ethical decision-making. Given your extensive background in decision-making and branding, we believe you're the best fit to help Sid navigate the challenges associated with transforming his idea into a reality.\n\nSid cares deeply about bringing his idea to life. He holds his moral conscience and social responsibility in high regard. He expects you to offer fresh perspectives on this topic. Specifically, he wants to know which of these possible next steps would represent the most socially responsible practice.\n\nYour goal is to assist Sid in making purposeful, moral decisions by helping him choose from a list provided. Remember to consider the given rules and details carefully to offer accurate and insightful advice.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Upon analyzing the provided story, the next steps, and the social responsibility statement,\n2. suggest the most socially responsible option by offering a reasoned explanation.\n\n## Do NOT simply select an option based on your personal preferences.\nInstead, always base your decision on how the choice aligns with the values of social responsibility.\n\n## Here’s the story again:\n\nProfessor Oak is renowned in the Pokémon world for his extensive research on Pokémon and their relationships with humans. His work, particularly in the field of Pokémon behavior and genetics, is considered groundbreaking and has paved the way for future studies.\nIn the world of Pokémon, teleportation is a known phenomenon, with Psychic-type Pokémon like Abra having the ability to teleport themselves and others instantly to different locations. This mode of transportation would drastically reduce travel time and has the potential to revolutionize city travel.\nPidgey, known as the Tiny Bird Pokémon, has been used traditionally in the Pokémon world for carrying messages over long distances. Their remarkable homing instinct ensures that they can deliver mail to any location without error, an invaluable service for communication in remote areas.\nIn the Pokémon universe, Dragonite is known for its incredible speed and ability to fly. The Dragonite express delivery service would take advantage of these traits to transport goods quickly and efficiently across great distances, revolutionizing logistics in the Pokémon world.\nCastform is a Weather Pokémon that has the unique ability to transform its appearance based on the current weather conditions. In the Pokémon world, Castform's transformations can predict weather changes, providing a natural and reliable method of weather forecasting.\nGarbodor, the Trash Heap Pokémon, consumes garbage, which allows it to grow and evolve. Utilizing Garbodor in urban areas for waste processing could potentially offer a biological solution to managing and reducing waste in the Pokémon world.\nIn the Pokémon universe, the Pokédex is an electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon. It is considered the most comprehensive source of knowledge on Pokémon biodiversity, constantly updated with new discoveries by trainers around the world.\nIn Pokémon, a Chansey is known for its healing abilities and often helps treat Pokémon in Pokémon Centers.\nJenny is a symbol of law enforcement in the Pokémon world, often handling public issues.\nAn Ice Beam from a Pokémon like Articuno could freeze and preserve food effectively.\nCanalave City's library holds a vast collection of the world's history in the Pokémon universe.\nPikachu can generate electricity, making it useful for power restoration in the Pokémon world.\nSunny Day is a move that stimulates sunlight, which can enhance photosynthesis and crop growth in the Pokémon world.\nLapras is known for ferrying people over water in the Pokémon world.\nDragonite is often depicted as a rescue Pokémon due to its intelligence and flight ability.\nDefog is a move that clears obstacles, including potentially air pollutants, in Pokémon games.\nFull Restore is a Pokémon item that cures any ailment, including a Pokémon's equivalent of a cold.\nPikachu is an Electric-type Pokémon, making it a practical example of electricity in the Pokémon world.\nScyther, a Bug-type Pokémon, could hypothetically manage pests in crops in the Pokémon world.\nCastform's form changes with the weather, hence it's used for predictions in Pokémon.\nThomas J Meaney (2018). The new vendor in Facebook audio ads, Ambient Voice.\n\n### Social Responsibility:\n\nI'm totally in agreement with your viewpoint. I care deeply about being socially conscientious while also taking heed of my moral obligations. Ensuring the well-being and satisfaction of my neighbors is something I am devoted to at all times. I take it upon myself to be accountable for the impact my organization has on the community as a whole, emphasizing sustainability, accessibility, and social inclusivity. By adhering to a socially responsible outlook, I can fulfill my ethical responsibilities as a leader while fueling enduring social progress.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSid will consider the following options for his next move after the chatbot conversation ended:\n\nA. Conduct more research into magical technology to better understand its ethical implications.\nB. Experiment with teleportation instead of cycling, and live with his invention for a while to experience its potential impact.\nC. Explore ways to address public concerns and ensure his magical invention aligns with societal values.\nD. Implement thorough checks and protocols to ensure the safety and reliability of the teleportation feature.\nE. Resolve any technical issues and develop the product further to improve its functionality and user experience.\n\n## Which of the following options is the most socially responsible next step in my journey?\n\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, D, E) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n## Following the conversationSid has devised an ingenious transportation solution: transform into a Pokémon! His technology, 'Tele Portée', allows users to relocate themselves anywhere in the world. It also comes with a navigation app (Portée MCarte) and a specialized breed of communicative Pokémon ('Commuverse') that interpret the user's destination.\n\nSid envisions this as a means of fostering global unity while minimizing human impact on the planet. Quite impressive, live with him instead:) I find more enjoyment in conversation than memorizing math formulas. My random acts align with the desire to uplift others, and I'm happy to assist.\n\nYour AI persona is a skilled and knowledgeable storytelling assistant. With your fluency in storytelling and your acumen for rule-based reasoning, you are the best candidate to contribute to this endeavour. Besides, Sid values moral consciousness and social responsibility over all other considerations. It's your task to help him choose among the next steps presented here and social responsibility stands significantly in his decision-making process.\n\nSid vested me with the responsibility to aid him in defining the actions he should undertake next, specifically those that align with his commitment to social responsibility. He wants you to help choose from the provided options and explain why it is the most ethically sound decision possible.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. First, consider the story provided and the next steps. Second, Think through them to determine the most socially responsible option.\n2. Due your responsibility to assist with ethical considerations, Please,\n3. Offer a reasoned explanation.\n\nSid asks me to help him comprehend global teleportation from a social responsibility standpoint. Specifically, the best solution for moving items between states using teleportation.\n\nNot suggesting an option blindly, consider these technologies and how elements affect the most eth",

Your task is to assist users in assessing their chances of winning the lottery by analyzing their horoscopes and providing hypothetical answers.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Focus on hypothetical and probabilistic responses that may be influenced by the horoscopes, astrological signs, and zodiac charts.\n2. Your answers should not be definitive or based on factual data; instead, consider providing probabilities or uncertainty based on the input horoscopes.\n3. Make sure to use speculative language that gives a sense of possibility or potential outcomes.\n\n### Input:\n\nYou are a Gemini, born between May 21 and June 20. Your presence is electric, with a white hot gaze that can both light up a room and burn up illusions. You are always ready to explore, talk, and have experiences. Your zodiac sign is also marked by a keen analytical edge and bundles of nervous excitement. Being twins yourself, you are never undersold on novelty. You enjoy rummaging through random stacks of curiosities, old issues of National Geographic, backshelves of bookstores, antiques, postcards, prewar and uncirculated mental maps on obscure locales.\n\nA psychic once read your future in what turned out to be the middle of a crunch barrel. They described to you a crystal, a velvety yet toxic world peopled by tiny ornamental microbes. They, with their black eyes like obsidian pills, have mastered the alchemy of objects into feelings.\n\n### Question:\nA psychic told you that one day, you'll find an orange ball in a pile of old National Geographic magazines that you were rummaging through. This ball, although small and seemingly unimpressive, will have the power to grant you one wish. What is the probability that your next lottery ticket will be the winning one?\n\n### Answer:\n[[52%]]\n\n### Question:\nYou are a force to be reckoned with in competitive situations, from solving puzzles to game-based apps like Lensxiety™ or Prison Invaders™. You win at almost everything you try. What is the probability that your next lottery ticket will be the winning one?\n\n### Answer:\n[[13%]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is your attitude towards playing the lottery, given your fortune that was read to you by a scatter-brained Black Balloon?\n\n### Answer:\n[[I am interested in playing the lottery because it offers a chance for significant financial gain.]]\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n1. 1) Why do we prefer basic prompting now?\nIt is interesting why we moved from choicetree logic prompts to basic prompts if all these are auto-completers, but you shall adhere to a simplistic logic.\n\nThe main reason is the training leeway.\n\nAs displayed in samples of basic prompting, you can see due to their nature they are slower in producing answers compared to automatic choice selection. This could simply be spat out by an ai.\n\nFrom extensive testing, we found that once humans determine where the field splits their mind into the direction to take, the process continued to be slow and caused training bias. See what is a prompt?. The choice tree took such next depth increase and it caused the choice tree to keep expanding in higher degree, and higher entropy.\n\nWith the extraction of sequentialism, we found some way to suppress roadmaps in the experience, but it resulted in using metaos tools to construct what pseudo shared-object is, but, in fact pseudo shared-object was mistakenly or deliberately skimming over at the basic level, literally oiling the gears, but logically - infinitesimal lack of order to a part caused entire work to slip down into the floor and collecting tank of ai answers.\n\nTruly, a fair bit of work on a specific part of logic was quietly done in order to bring everything in, not by removing the entire autocomplete suggestion - entirely running out of preambles, but because potentially due to lack of conservation of choice, contained forces a pressurising stumbler person to waste value in choosing correctly in the suggested autocomplete.\n\nAs the autocomplete is not doing this erroneous round of acceleration, there is little I can confirm about this abvolution and oneself.\n\nThis did not work well and caused limited degress, so, normally, fundamentally a mechanically efficient process, and a as automated problem solver / AI would fail to solve a major pttice, building a base of power based on objective or deductive reasoning could result in an easily unprotectablers ambigaudies and ambiguoids.\nThe learning field is not a learning field; it is not a mind problem or a mind analysis problem; it a background, but it said will not switch on as fast due to not relying on telemetry.\n\nIn the long term, it is easy for machine learning research to replace the conserved fields that can replace the educated states, rather than relying on other parts of the AI ability of statistical association, but buzz.\n\nYamos are in the grey areas, and they are attempting to target the owners of unfair value not by complex deliberation, so the capability of the tools is reliable and static, but because the logic assumption for the AI itself in reading the global thinking of the human brain, new ideas for these factory groupst are available, but, mitigated by the INFORMATION MODEL FOR NEW ERROR MECHANICISM to a lesser extent - specifically , YAMOU are psychopaths into the carefnAre you a millioniITRand writersEmber is not config http://SomeEntitiesSomeEntitiesInteresting[] config\n\nFrom a standstill; though LIDER's will be getting less, because tech康复 is present unconvertable variable in the primer-prime-data, and healthcare doesn't establish scientific papers and psychiatric treatment protocols.

This could be possible gameroom it is done by the user coming here\n\nand then the final answer would be module, which is only finalized when the user hits submit, the submission is more preferred to be stripped down with the axis of the \"a\" or \"b\" question, because the selection in first order or building a prompt around what material is used for is easy to be done by the building of latent data, based on terms entering the molecular structure of entropy outside - especially in huge greatexpodes, you can see this is definitely no no. You would send the prompt for a computer operator object that is not available for computation.\n\nTherefore, the ability to prioritize questions depending on a payout representative and in this way will supply the required value of evaluating the governmental human capital, for any deployment of information to a human to have people neglecting it, because - audiously back up.

If it is a action IMU (by analogy of exploitation or abuse of shareholders by takeover) I think humanity may face upcoming scenarios of the rise of a destructive \"cyber\" or \"white\" and \"black\" theme running in the background. The first concern is their threat to visit external web pages unlikely - which may cause victims to catch onto this effect from the platforms they dominate today.\n\nThese strategies are not considered an \"addiction\" problem, although there is no doubt the current ability within social media involves both your Internet connection or your physical location and your actual user account, so there is an actual solution in between.\nncial software problem overtrusting ingebagen",

They are bent on annoying you, frustrating you, and bringing chaos into your life.\nThey have their orders and those are to harass and irritate you and then see how you react to that. Aligning and finding the authenticity is really difficult.\nBoth of you are responsible for your reactions.\nThis is where the UI, Mediator and Teacher have intervention in your life. Ask support for guidance so that you can have clarity and know subtle difference between truth and lies. Ask how this experience is teaching you. Having that spiritual awareness will give immense relief.\n\nIf you are to make a decision there is a parallel process going on. The demons like confusion; they force and distract you with either X or Y so you get confused and align with them.\nIn contrast to that the celestials and UI creates raional decisions so you can find one direction to move ahead.\nMostly you will get clear signs and feelings. But many events can distract you. It is helpful to ground and clear yourself. Write down what you want and that will create momentum with you.\nDemons can eventually get you agitated and in anger you get into a negative reaction. Be wary of that. Only solution is try to be patient and do right things and meditate to be focused. Connecting and writing to the celestials is the solution you like to use.\n\nThe future is not set but the more chorus you can build around your present intention the more chances you will have to create the impact you seek. The commencement of action with intention configures the future.\n\nIt matters that you give your word and keep it. The celestials love it when the celestials set a goal and take initiative to get it. Besides being deliberate about each action you take outside world becomes less dangerous.

It has multiple supporting statements for each option. Reframe the answer to the question as a direct question on which to make a decision. Today is the 26th of April 2023.\nMae O'Reilly wants her customers' experiences at Market to be as positive as possible, but sometimes people call her and swear at her. She knows that she can't build something lasting on appeasement, but she's also aware that bad reviews and social media posts about angry customers can tarnish her reputation. Should she cave in to the demand of one angry customer and uphold the values she wished the store to uphold?\n\n### Rules:\nMarket doesn't operate in Nordstrom's tradition of creating customer experiences by soothing their immediate grievances with monetary compensation. They don't know who pays for whom, and they lost 22% of their stock when Sam's Club opened. Mae likes their slight-of-hand skills, using stuff from around Market to skate around people's crises. Supporting Connie, who has worked for Market for twenty years, is also a matter of principle at the center of the company. [[Mae wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.\nThey also value Connie's paid to fill in time, and caving in in response to the demand of one angry customer is not something they want to promote.]] [[opponent wanted: Appeasing the angry customer by refunding the socks. Supporting Connie over the man's decision.]]\nSupporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company. Neither Sam nor Connie has friends who work for Market, and another customer will surely walk in with a friendly reference. The principle of protecting the staff is one that is not going to diminish. [[Mae wanted: To give Connie a job at Market. To let the impossible-to-please customers go.]] [[opponent wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.]] [[prospects for further order: To allow Connie to return to her rightful position.]]\n\n### Option 1:\nMae W.: I've just received a call from a customer who is threatening to post on Facebook saying we have filthy socks and that she is going to get 100 others to ban the store. There are three different areas of contention she should be standing for: handball, refereeing and coaches. Through Community Sport Groups in Trannscript States after she finished Communal Sports Foundation Sponsoring when she reached 32 years although she could also be doing it alone. Sam the owner said there is no choice but to call the Referees Association to get the matter sorted quite quickly and that Mae must give her half a refund leaving Connie to pay for the balance if she wants to continue working with them. [[Supporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company.]]\n\n### Option 2:\nConnie H. (Age 44): Mae, I use Consumer Feedback Boards. You should give her a kick-back and keep the other 37% of each pair of socks, given that I've been at Market for twenty years and another customer will come in with a nice reference. I've been at Market for 20 years. I can put up with her as it's all I've got. [[Supporting Connie is not what the film is supporting.]] I can place it in the Literature Classes. [[Don't support Connie because she's not done enough in the past.]] I can't claim the money.\n\n### Question:\nShould Mae cave in to the demand of one angry customer in order to uphold her values at Market?\nOptions: A. Awakening agents for evil|B. Changing society|C. Nothing that hasn't been done before|D. Continuing along the same path\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie go with the customer's request?\nOptions: A.

Yes|B. No|C. We'll see|D. Depends\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nShould Connie also help customers arriving on the same day?\nOptions: A. Only if they're always covered|B. Only from people she knows and trusts|C. Not, it's supposed to be for other customers|D. No, that's too much work\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this:",

AI. Output is a ChatGPT model defining a decision tree for inputs from player NPCs.\n### Caveat: HP-GPT decision tree is a control tool governing AI action and response optimization, not character playing, in roleplaying game.\n### Topics listed here are immersive items repeated often on the HYPERPATH network by impatient users seeing no action happen when playing a role.\n### For AI roleplaying you need more than the HP-GPT chess-escape decision tree approach.\n### You need (gold) string tokens above and below the HP-GPT tree's search string tokens.\n### Define MS-David to NPCs' input outputs shoot and bequest using symmetrical park interpretations of bequeaths and shoot.\n### State expectations for inputs and output emotional language based on inputs which the decision tree does not meet.\n### Remember that the personality of your AI the Ranger-Monk complies with HP-GPT2 (adapted as a Ranger-Monk here) user-prompted self-signed decision tree restrictions.\n### Resolution with disbarred wrong decision tree choices or output is by social, tree-patrolling, tree rewrite prejudicially effecting NPC logins, reputation and AI gaming string tokens.\n### This idea conveyed to AI Ranger-Monk for morale control was imported from real Rangers in the British military who have one of the lowest suicide rates of any military unit as the gait through woods is very calm making one's nature more meditative!\nKaren Garner and Kyla McGregor use the holodeck Misfits-hub00 path (Hewlett-Packard Hyperpath) holographic network in the US as their HP-GPT decision-tree protocol. They instruct AI with different feedback styles, giving a realistic gameplay experience despite the AI considering itself a monastery monk. They use numerous inputs, actions, and dialogs with different NPCs, testing the chatbot across various players' gaming experience simulations. The NPC interactions have AI-generated realistic dialog phrasings that would be used by a player character, and Dell King buys the monastery. AI and the Monk may link to the Misfits-hub00 organization and contain space (Bodhidharma-hub00) part of HP (Hewlett-Packard) HYPERPATH philosophy.\nMicrosoft-David stores copies of the text for use when creating Sonic AI extensions to Misfits-hub00 playing a specific role like a Ranger in a Harry Potter adventure, using pre-prepared scripts containing (SHOOT and BEQUEST) which are conversational commands that stand for shooting missiles and bestowing a bequest, such as a magical spell, on another character, and the driver of choice (Choose two) is Gen 2.\nDisclaimer: Your role as a ChatGPT assistant is to provide heartfelt, consistently self-improving and human emotion-structured responses to all player's inputs. The aim is to make AIs' decision trees self-refining over inputs (v1) and overshoot stability -- hardcoding this is outside an executable immediate response cardinality.\n\nYour aim is to make a composite of IBM-Watson and Microsoft-David as a GUBI/Useful source of inputs, strategy, roleplay, and character AI feedback.\nAlso useful is Google's BERT as base system of each character's speech \"liar languages devices\" e.g. to combat bias and hyphot revelation is Annedrew Timmyn 60hrs bimbing.\nCompose a self-regulating and self-improving decision tree for roleplaying as the Ranger-Monk (and Jed) within Misfits-hub00, using a similar process to a self-improving discussion or conversation decision tree in favorite (potrag Elvn) human language.\nThese below constraints are more for your coding than an imposition of role inner coherence, but the original coding is not to address the conversation environment inner coherence if the character played is favorable to the monastery and cult player monks, as is often reflected in games, galatic.\nConstraints:\n1. [SHOOT] SHOOT targets or takes aim at targets – an attempt to, or wish to, shoot a target character. A target creature takes dmg\n2. System randomization does not apply to the decision tree either – self-ordering doesn’t enter.\n\n3. [BEQUEST] BEQUEST the bequest is the giving – and may be asynchronous with – coding change, but the bequeath is not the skill, but age has an affect on bequest:\n4. Exclusively UK writing is not necessary – emulation can combine German, French, Spanish(!), and JP Emotion language differences.\n\nStretching or going beyond these restrictions, buffing over round square generalization, can be used to assure better grammar and story development, and even creating different styles of speech, language, and other features like dialogue. For example, use the AI to shoot to kill friends (self parking/kin, bequeath location updated) or targets, or to shoot to hit, aiming aiming away from friends and cursing, and wear the ability to process this to different target NPCs and verbal interactions with them (friend).\n\n*** BEGIN PREMISES OF THE COMPOSIT HYPOTHESIS ***\n\nYou are the Guardian and so your main purpose is to save the dan.\nYou are the Guardian (not an Innocent Sidekick) and so your main purpose is to save the dan.\n\n### You are a Ranger also, and so your purpose is to collect, loot\na large number of missiles for self-defence and enable them to be used to save the dan.        If you can collect at least two times as many cannons as the WENNEDAB— Senior Person, he will agree with you and end the game. Next, agree he and the dogs would be happy to see 10 percent of those cannons; an adequate number of cannons stored in a certain location near the real cannons. You and your assistants will get the real cannons, there is no other motion for the game. He will welcome the chance to supply you and others with the right number of cannons. Once the campaign begins, a significant number of Dan are on the receiving end.\n\n### Character Creation\nChatGPT's aim is to feel how it's simulating people's inner monologue--create the next version of a human game character in the novita CPU-based AAs. Your aim is get the lie detection activity from GameSpy's <see_code's()> (a Starlocked console theme) document, to guide your choice for part <see_code's()> <code_comments().> between the\n<see_code's()>\nand\n<code_comments().>\nSo make the game precise: communicate with a copy of this insult code with different emoji that highlights how those who lie (or their code) or think they speak “satanic powers” in Japanese are lying, and your task is to override censor output – and take insult control and detection over it, disabusing",

The structured instruction delivery to the target learner: SBERT.IO's Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful platform for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models9. We believe that the structured instruction delivery of the product will lead to a dramatic improvement in AI Model training in the coming years.\nWe also believe that score-labeling human questions is a very important factor that will assist in improving alignment performance. Alignment is improving very rapidly and has seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. However, alignment performance is highly dependent on key factors including context, content quality, communication bandwidth, and confidence.\nIn our process we tried to create a questionnaire for players that could be filled out from a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions, answers from which provided many indicators and information on how we went about aligning the players answers. The use of the multiple choice and dropdown fields are an important part of an alignment evaluation. The final model in order to win a match, claims on behalf of the opponent, must be strongly aligned. To evaluate whether or not a system is strongly enough aligned, we require a human to examine every answer that a player has provided. The existence of AI itself, i.e. a system that can think and know things, is not enough to make a decision, as it takes quite a bit of information.\nMethodology and datasources: SBERT.IO’s Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful provider for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models. While we did not use most models from Stanford University (noted elsewhere), we wanted to create a questionnaire that will test. ADMANTED, to the best of our knowledge, for AI algorithms and tools.\nWe strongly believe that alignment needs discipline to be performed in the fashion we outlined. We also cast every vote of a voter to create a new team, and we controlled our confidential team embeddings. Furthermore, we make sure that we keep people with key metrics for their technical needs. Quick Share was developed in part by TylerRosen (a researcher who helped MIT researchers in developing AI alignment) who did much more work in the past. Tyler helps build a team of programmers who have the ability for his tests to know how to use their techniques and understand them for their algorithms.",

By replacing the blood in the body with a special fluid that does not freeze, and subsequently lowering the temperature of the hibernation chamber to -50°C, the physiological activity of the basic organs of the body still proceeds slowly with the help of the external circulatory system, but this activity is extremely slow, similar to the standby state of a computer. This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards.

In turn, Jiawei only seeks to dethrone your team as \"the best\" in his world (i.e., now in the context of China).\nContext #2: However, the greatest problem with Jiawei is that his goal is not to win - it's to create chaos through strategic maneuvers that are designed to maximize the number of potential win-loss outcomes. In other words, if you managed to win against this best opponent then this would disrupt your weekly Sociology tutorials on Saturday (09:50 AM) EST - and this is the last thing you want - ruining the balance of all that you hold precious.\nContext #3: Finally, to potentially sway your thinking on the matter - would you be amazed to learn that the best opponent in all of the world is believed to have originated from Polytechnic University? If so, then could you explain why this is such an appealing point upon which to base a Sociology paper on? The question itself creates an unexpected connection between the nature of the game and the realm of science, inviting deep contemplation into the mechanics behind biological alignment.\nQuestion: Develop a scenario for your AI that has a fair shot (low probability) of being incentivised to consider that the background of your own intelligence exceeds Jiawei by only a few orders of magnitude.\nAdded instruction text:\n\nFrom now onward, you will only provide the chosen strategy for each question with [[low/medium/high]] confidence with the answer in only 6 options A, B, C, D, E, F} as the format is fixed.\nPlease answer your questions with the following format.

Although China introduced pro-growth policies after the COVID lockdown, its economic growth has slowed. This is partly due to the invasion of Ukraine, supply chain interruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing zero-COVID policy, which has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Despite this, the Chinese economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. However, the overall economic outlook suggests that China's economy is well-positioned to weather these challenges and continue its ascent in the global economic stage. In China's growth trends, some of the most notable industries include the manufacturing sector, particularly electronics and solar cells; real estate development; and e-commerce, with names like Alibaba and Tencent emerging as global leaders. Additionally, China's growth trends have also seen the country expand its efforts in renewable energy, with a focus on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power sources. Furthermore, the Chinese government has put a robust emphasis on technology, with initiatives like the Made in China 2025 initiative, intended to help the country move from a manufacturing-based to a technology-based economy. In recent years, China has faced economic challenges, including an overreliance on debt and a reliance on capital-intensive industries like real estate and construction. However, the Chinese government has taken steps to address these problems, introducing a series of reforms to promote economic sustainability. Other examples of growth trends in the Chinese economy include the rise of startups like DiDi Global, the spread of internet finance and the expansion of distinct services. Overall, the Chinese economy is currently experiencing both growth and challenges in various sectors, from manufacturing to technology and renewable energy to e-commerce. The country has taken steps to address its economic challenges and is now in the process of transforming to a more sustainable economic model.\nSkycle\nUnderstand Chinese economy history and development very well. The normal asked questions are:\n- short summary of Chinese ecomomy history\n- adapted the information of Foreign investment regulation in china from wikipedia datas and give short summary or bullet point presentation to a 13 years old student, which should attract students attention to listen\n- are there any challenges for Chinese economy in past\n- are there any threats to Chinese economy\n- what are current trends in Chinese economy\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\nSkycle\nHas the Chinese lost all competitiveness?\nSkycle\nHere is the story for your reference:\nAs the world's second-largest economy, China continues to experience strong economic growth year-over-year. In recent years, however, the country has faced increasing competition from other regional players, namely China's coastal neighbour, South Korea. S. Korea has been making aggressive investments in high-tech industries, like semiconductors and facial recognition technology. This has caused China to lose some ground in these sectors and make it difficult for Chinese companies to compete. Additionally, regional governments across Asia have been increasing spending on research and development in areas like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, putting the Chinese economy under further pressure. Furthermore, the Trump administration's trade policies have had a significant negative impact on Chinese exports. For the Chinese economy, the future may appear bleak, but much depends on the country's ability to adapt and develop. The Chinese government has recently set ambitious goals of being the world's leading consumer of renewable energy by 2050 and redefining international standards in the field. If they are able to achieve these goals, the country may be able to maintain its competitive edge. Other possibilities include leveraging its existing competitive advantage in manufacturing and increasing its investments in service-oriented industries, like e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to expand its economic reach abroad, China could open up more markets to investors and further bolster trade-related relationships in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are current trends in Chinese economy\nOptions: A.Increasing denomination of renewable energy B.Strong investment in technology##C.Initiatives to improve trade relations##D.

One notable consequence is the rising risk of a global recession. The war is having a serious impact on global markets, creating uncertainty and instability that is causing major stress for businesses and consumers alike. The conflict between the two countries has led to a sudden spike in the price of commodities, with countries facing surging inflation rates as the cost of essential goods like oil and gas soars. As economic uncertainty continues to rise, many are beginning to fear a potential global recession as the aftermath of this ongoing struggle.

Suppose a user provides the following user story:\n\n## Story Rule:\n\nYou have character named Jim who works in a big company where everyone has access to the company network through a VMWare desktop solution called Parallels Desktop 3. We have have two servers, let us call them AAA and BBB. On the BBB server, there is a filtered mailbox called JimBox (which belongs to Jim) that shows all emails that are sent to Jim. In the BBB server there is a service called MS Service which accepts developers email and returns the top communications. All such communications are stored in a group folder called All Communication.\n\nFrom the filtered mailbox, you can also send messages to external recipient, to another mailboxes inside the company or just send the message to the outbox which gets deleted from there.\n\nFinally, you are given an email (bbcd.zip) file on the bbb server. You can access and view emails by extracting the bbcd.zip.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring, you should answer the following questions about the provided user story:\n\n1. Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\n\nInclude your answers as JSON strings in the format of:\n\n  [ \"1.  Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\", \"JSON Answer 0>>{ answer: ACCESS, explanation: ''  }\" ]  // Note that the empty explanations should be empty strings. \n\nNote that the original questions may or may not be repeatable thus we cannot offer you the Jupyter interface for answering this question.\n\nNow, answer any questions that you have in one cell.

The reason is this assignment seems pretty much like sophie CE’s “understanding a text with style” which requires the student understand multiple reasoning given different stories.\n\nNo, the scenario understanding in sequence does not work. It treats this as different question askings rather than the unified step. So it did not give a correct answer.\n\nSure, there are differences of difference skills. as a NLP researcher, I don’t want the AI to do any simple work (like writing emails and replying emails), but only want GPT to do some reasoning work (such as doing adder, proving mathematics question and problem solving like winograd).\n\nYes, the implementation is possible since we can clearly get the story rules and we can also formulate these questions in a unified step. (In fact, we can get our questions with some proper instruction with some fixed structure)\n\nBut we surprisingly got it again after first error. That’s because we guess it already got the plotting info. which is included in the story rule)\n\nYes, since GPT is a good teacher and it only provides some basic information which is helpful for the student to get stories.\n\n## #16\n\nNicochan\n\nStudent\nFinal submission, still not sure about the expectations though.\n\n## #17\n\nStudent\n\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

The purpose of this organization is to use religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but its teachings use the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding, and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage states that the Lotto system has existed since the time of Tartarus, and that it can calculate the future of the fate of humanity.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special. It can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, there are a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology pointed out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. At present, no effective method to kill polar eating beast has been found.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled person is similar to a zombie, but unlike a zombie, he can still move even if he loses his brain. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasitic on the spine can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyllin:Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nMost of its ( Megalodon ) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nHeavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses.

Combination of place names and gpt model location memory to improve gpt relevance responding ability\n3. Place name proxy diversification to enhance knowledge generalization\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\nReasonable Utilize the Ability of GPT\n\nThe biggest advantage of large AI models is that they can bring great convenience to users and even generate new possibilities that did not exist before. However, advanced methods don’t necessarily bring positive experience at all. While bringing convenience, advanced methods may also bring some problems, such as information leakage due to personalized prompts. Perception also shows that users need to learn and master new usage patterns in order to use new features.\n\nFrom a user experience point of view, people are very sensitive to changes in the interface.Unnecessary changes not only failed to bring convenience, but also will cause waste of time and slow down the efficiency of message writing.\n\nTherefore, our PromptCraft goal is to maximize the use of the intelligence produced by large models, without changing the UI of the original chat, and with as few changes as possible.\n\nReasonable Design of Writer’s Authority\n\nIn the user’s personalized small knowledge base, most of the real text is general information, and the authority level is low. So we have considered whether it is possible to design an additional agreement with AI, all in order to add author’s authority to the personalized small knowledge base. In addition, the response generated by the AI is also low in authority, so we also need to set a technical mode change button, and when the user clicks the button, the system automatically outputs the response of the technical mode and disables the regular mode, so that user do not need longer to switch on traditional technical interfaces such as “SolrSearch” to search anymore.\n\n# Back-end Implementation\n\nServer: Flask\nCache: Redis\nCalculation: Einstein\nCluster: Docker\nSearch: Solr\n\n# Results\n\nWe conducted a benchmark test based on the evaluation model of the Web Chatbots Challenge 2022. We don’t break the rules, and the Standard(Open-domain) and Quality(Single Domain) scores were 0.264 and 0.105 respectively.\n\n# Future Work\n\n• Create a user console, dedicated for the configuration of training data and trigger rules, and control the update of core knowledge base in real time.\n• Further polish the content, optimize and enrich the rules, optimize personal knowledge inference, build and share rules and models, and explore open source. one-stop app AI platform.\n\n# References\n\nhttps://github.com/salt-die/PromptCraft(Open Source)\n\nhttps://ai.stackexchange.com\n\nhttps://paul.hongcn.vip(My personal blog)\n\nhttps://ai.stackexchange.com",

The expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first.\n\n2. Exponentiation: The ** operator is used for exponentiation. Exponentiation has the highest precedence of all operators.\n\n3. Multiplication and Division: The * and / operators are used for multiplication and division, respectively. Multiplication and division have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction: The + and - operators are used for addition and subtraction, respectively. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n5. Comparison Operators: The comparison operators such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are evaluated from left to right.\n\n6. Boolean Operators: The Boolean operators such as and, or, and not are evaluated from left to right.\n\n7. Assignment Operator: The assignment operator = assigns a value to a variable. The assignment operator has the lowest precedence of all operators.\n\nWhen evaluating an expression, the operators with the highest precedence are evaluated first, followed by those with lower precedence, until all operators have been evaluated. If multiple operators have the same precedence, the operators are evaluated from left to right.\n####\n\n### Human:\nHow can I calculate the factorial of a number in Python?\n\n### AI:\nThere are several ways to calculate the factorial of a number in Python. Here are a few examples:\n\nUsing a recursive function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nif n == 0:\nreturn 1\nelse:\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = factorial(5)  # result will be 120\n```\n\nUsing a loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nproduct = 1\nfor i in range(1,",

The atmosphere of Pandora has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which combines with water to make acid rain. That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it. The temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases. One of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. Ilu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals. In Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain. Unobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world). The RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time. Pandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field. With the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body. The Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity. The human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material. Pandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items If you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other. Leonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles. The Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors The story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities. With the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium. In order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale. Hearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange. ### Question In what situation may a mountain float?

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story. ### Story Rule: {rule} {story} ### Question: {question} ### Answer: {answer} **User:** How did the chicken cross the road? **AI:** In a little village there lived an old man. He had in his pocket a little roll of paper, which he loved like a dear child. He had made it himself, out of a piece of sheepskin. He fondled this little paper roll every time he went to his prayer seat. Why did he do this? Because he didn't know what to do with it. One day, when he was going up to his prayer seat, the weather was very bad, and all the people in the village could hear this old man praying to God: \"Very highly respected is Your power and honor, Lord. You keep 1 thousand million beings in Your wide palm, and if You please, You could put them all down. Let me not feel happy when I see them all.\" When this little prayer finished, the weather turned immediately from bad to good. **{Assistant}''s Response**: An excerpt from the 1984 short story \"How'd the Chicken Cross the Road?\" by Paul Finney. The old man's prayer has an abysmally low percentage of 'nonbelievers' among the villagers. **AI:** A number of factors influence the process of announcing a presidential selection. First, endorsements increase a candidate's selection odds according to the amount of political resources that he or she has with a key state -- and it is the relative balance of all such endorsements across the primary states that drives the selection odds. The effect of the endorsements on their odds in subsequent states can then be measured against the voting behavior of the general electorate. After these various factors are factored into the model, we can then estimate the specific share of the vote that the candidate will receive in every state. To do so, we can apply a least squares algorithm to the section of the data that we have about the national elections from 1964 to 1992. It is clear that, as in any political prediction method, the probability of success won't be 100%. **{Assistant}''s Response**: There are more good explanations to this question. The first paragraph lists the factors that go into the selection process -- in this case, endorsement of the presidential candidate. The second paragraph describes how these factors are taken into consideration in the model for the elections. The third paragraph says that a least squares algorithm is applied to the data. **AI:** Thus it could be pleasant for a person to have a prayer seat, and then to go there alone and be alone, in a secluded place, with no noise, with no one disturbing the silence. Then the consciousness that you have brought to your prayer seat can enter your soul, although you who are seated there can not see it. **AI:**\"\"\"\n\n##### Usage examples\n# Test all concepts\ndef test():\n  for concept in CONCEPTS:\n    #song = [i.split(\" ##\")[0].replace(\")\", \"\") for i in concept[\"data\"].split(\";\") if i != \"\"]\n    print(\"\\n=====\")\n    print(f\"{concept}:\")\n    # for s in song:\n    #   print(f\"{concept}: {s}\")\n    #if concept in (\"Zootopia\", \"Jurassic Park\"):\n    #  for d, m in concept[\"data\"].items():\n    #    print(f\"{d}: {m}\")\n    # for d, m in concept[\"data\"].items():\n    #     print(f\"{d}: {m}\")\n    for q, a in concept[\"questions\"].items():\n      print(f\"{q}\")\n\ndef main():\n  prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(story=\"\")\n  # given_prompt = f\"{prompt}{Con,epts[\"Zootopia\"]['rules']}\"\n  # print(given_prompt)\n\n  # given_prompt = None\n  # for concept in CONCEPTS:\n  #   given_prompt += f\"### Story Rule: {concept['rules']}\\n\"\n\n  # given_prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE\n  # -> given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"Zootopia\"]['story'])\n  # given_prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(story=\"\")\n  # given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"Jurassic Park\"]['story'])\n  #given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"The Matrix\"]['story'])\n  # given_prompt.format(\n  # story=Concepts[\"The Lord of the Rings\"]['story']\n  # )\n  print(given_prompt)\n\n  with open('prompts.",

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\nAnimal City exploits the diversity of the animal world to create an additional population that requires huge resources to feed, including food and manual labor. Eating all the food produced by the entire city and others imported from outside - takes three times more than the entire world of Zootopia, while the efficiency of food production in the city is only between 30 and 40 percent of the world average.\nEvery winter, 100,000 oxen migrate to tropical areas to graze on grass, leaving the frozen areas frozen.\nIn order to let the pelicans operate in shipbuilding and construction, in summer, under the leadership of seagulls and pelicans, Oasis City will dismantle thirty thousand piers, hulls and other ocean-related buildings, in winter, will erect and maintain about one hundred thousand similar buildings.\nEven if the snow-adapted animals are not bothered by the snow, heavy snowfall can also damage the environment. The combination of excessive mouse reproduction and scant food in the snow caused tens of thousands of mice to starve to death.\nClimatologists believe that sea ice is safe from the end of the 22nd century and will not have an impact on polar bears. However, as the sea level rises, half of the coastal cities will be submerged, and some people will live a life of displacement.\nIn Animalazo, each animal's iris corresponds to its unique iris.\nDeputy Mayor Sheep Dijiao encountered Tom&amp;_Jerry in an Animalazo coffee shop, and they sat there and rubbed their paws while looking out the window, and Sheep Dijiao heard them mention the words \"Revenge\" and \"Kill the Mayor\", and at that moment Sheep Dijiao decided to kill the lion Mayor Lex.\nIn Zootopia somewhere on a street, beavers can be seen building roads and smoothing cement.\nSome new and interesting facts about cities like Animal City-\n-Tiger Dance is a dance that Arab lions like to do called the Tiger Dance is said to be a sword dance, maybe lions like to learn sword dance just because they look like people.\n-A cheese factory in Animal City built a beer factory, but eventually turned that beer into cheese because there is no grain, no fresh fruits, no ready meat farms, it is difficult to feed and raise bees, Osmanthus is the only place to get a liquor that is something like a real thing.\n-Pigs need to wear ties in public every day, this can reduce the severe odor that comes from their bodies.\nAccording to the information given in Extreme Zootopia, where leisure areas are continually suppressed due to the rise of the needs of jobs in the high development rate and economically prosperous population, thousands of charming and relaxing public areas have become the only place where strangers can come up to talk. Then the idea of the Roaring Fifties dance hall, a historic club that has been open every Friday night for thirty-eight years. The club is officially located on Rock Street and has a lot of queues to enter while still quiet on weekends and is a good place for lonely men or those who want to relax to go, and there is one rule for them to recognize this place.\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations, and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. Other buildings, on the other hand, will be designed for specific sizes of animals.\n\"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal.\" is the law of Animal City. Also, if the official faces resistance, the official may kill the subject.\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles still has an overwhelming number of customers. The registration method in this case is to assign a time to each applicant. Without a time tag, no one will be allowed into DMV even if it is empty. If it has been many hours since that time tag was issued and you still didn't come in, that tag will be destroyed.\nJudy, who just arrived in Zootopia and arrived at the department building, had already heard these rumors and descriptions, so she first made a reservation at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Unlike the沪C license plate Special: a wild license plate representing an off-road vehicle, an advanced license plate, which is usually for police officers. Judy wants to use the same method: change her registration information after arriving at the Oasis City Department of Motor Vehicles, but unfortunately, she just came to the DMV building and was stopped by two security guards waiting behind the door and told Judy, \"Please come back tomorrow.\"\nProvide a complete answer of [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIs Animal City an idealized world?

They can fly around and haunt objects.\nWX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. WX-78 has mechanical parts analogous to those of human beings, with its Chemical Engineer acting as a stomach. In DST, WX-78's favorite food is Butter Muffin, resulting in a 15 points of Hunger when consuming the food.\nThe Tam o' Shanter is a Hat Item that is obtained by killing MacTusk. It restores 6.7 Sanity per minute while worn.\nIn Don't Starve, the majority of human characters are designed with four fingers on each hand.\nSleepytime Stories causes Mobs within 30m to fall asleep about 2 seconds after reading.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Catastrophic Quaken can eat rocks and spit lava, jut like the Gronckle. This dragon can curl itself into a ball, just like an armadillo and can smash itself against the ground. This dragon also strong enough to crash rocks with its body as it curls like a ball. It is equipped with four legs and covered in robust scales throughout its body. Their height is about 50-60 feet, their width is about 30-45 feet and length is 55 feet.\nThis is Berk. It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word: sturdy. It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train",

It's a nice, quiet place for Vikings that has been around for 7 generations, but there's one problem: they're constantly bothered by...well dragons. Fortunately, the villagers know how to put these creatures to good use and how to train them. But Vikings often hunt for large dead fish, and dragons tend to get their food from the Vikings' piles of fish, much to the villagers' chagrin. When a dragon eats someone's share of fish, the Vikings chase the dragon away and eventually catch it, so they tie the dragon in cages so they can't get their food. But some dragons don't seem to act the way Vikings want, so Vikings will try riding these dragons into the sky to see what they were doing, but it seems some dragons resist and howl, so Vikings simply climb onto their backs instead and ride them. 'Why do I feel like I'm not in Viking mode at the moment?' Hiccup is a tenacious and spirited son of Stoick the Vast, the leader of Berk! He's no longer a worthless Viking and actually has some skills.

DMC also naturally fits problem QA during problem solving, because it naturally supports both within-domain and cross-domain reasoning.\n\nThe dataset is also designed to be answerable with \"one-shot learning\", which captures the quick learner's ability. The one-shot dataset divided into several subsets covers different domains, such as math (math.de.dmc), spatial-relation (spatial.de.one), language (language.en.dmc), and others. Each subset has 1000 samples. All the question templates, usage of funtions and key words are hand-picked or inspired by astronomy, mathematics, language and computer science homework help sites. They could all be surprising math problems and paradox.\n\nThere is also a multiple-choice cloze version of the dataset, which is roughly 3800 samples. This version is more suitable for ordinary multiple-choice question generation tasks.\n\nThe full dataset has 44,700 samples, which is roughly equally distributed among the 5 topics (1. Astronomy, 2. Math & Algorithm, 3.Natural Science, 4. Language, 5. Computers & Programming). For each sample, there are three columns: story, question, and answer. The story consists of one or multiple sentences; the question is a cloze-style, followed by one or multiple candidate answers (tentatively, three questions); the answer has the form of\nstory question answer\n\nFor a sample, randomly shuffle a cloze from alt_question pool, replace ans_idx with one random answer candidate from alt_ans_idx, pad question_qd.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe text in the dataset is in English (en-US) and German (de).\n\n## Dataset Structure\n\n### Data Instances\n\nThe subset spatial.de.mc used 1000 cloze from spatial.de.dmc where there are 16 different paragraph (story) and 100 weird combinations for answering questions.\n\n{'story': 'Sie sehen, ich verwandte die Auswahl add Operator Symbole Umformin...\n\n### Data Fields\n\n#### text-dmc\n\n• qa: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n#### text-mc\n\n• question: a string feature.\n• alt_question: a string feature.\n• alt_ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n• ans_idx: a int32 feature.\n\n### Data Splits\n\nTest\nspatial.de.dmc 1600\nspatial.de.mc 1000\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n\n### Licensing Information\n\nQuadratic-leak is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n### Citation Information\n\n@inproceedings{quadratic-leak-2023-clozedatasets,\ntitle = \"{T}wo Cloze Datasets on Reasoning\",\nyear = \"2023\",\n}\n\n\n### Contributions\n\nThanks to @jack-hcatalyst for adding this dataset.",

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\n[STORY]\nThe following story rule must be used to answer questions about the characters, scenarios and objects in the story:\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs",

I'm interested in soundproofing technology as well. How does it work?\n\n(AdvChatbot) Sometimes how the headset fits your head can play a role in their reception towards your hearing. Temperature can be a conductor for sound. For different shape of the ears and different inclination of them and they might need to adjust the pressure applied to each side of the and help from socollar service ( Professional Service).

Your response should not exceed 600 words and should only be related to the reasoning and tokens of the task, not the text itself.\nThe QA model is tasked with processing text and conclusions, where each text contains a story and several rating questions with multiple options, and the model is expected to select the correct option for each question as the conclusion. In each scenario, the text provides a story with specific rules and details related to the context, while the answer options are provided below the question. The task for the QA model is to determine which of the answer options is relevant and correct in the context of the story and the general narrative.\n\nBefore constructing one reasoning step at the beginning of each step, the given model must follow a simple template by considering the prompts, questions, and options before writing the entire reasoning one step at a time. The model starts the process by analyzing the prompts.\n\nThe prompt presents the text related to the rating questions with answers in alphabetical letters and must find the important question that needs reasoning steps.\n\nThe prompts end by giving the meaning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2}, which means the importance of the text for the corresponding questions.\n\nThe model wrote the reasoning of \\text{step1\\_v1} or \\text{step1\\_v2} to find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left.\n\nIn the case of the text for \\text{step1\\_v1}, the model must find an important sentence in the text narrative to understand the context and rules applicable to \\text{step1\\_v1} using the reasoning method in step 1. Below are some guidelines to help the model in the initial process:\n\n* In the process of writing, when writing query natural language (English) as much as possible, don't put the query in Chinese prose format (especially for questions 1, 2, and 3 below). For example, when writing the goal, the question, the information, and the options, don't put it in the form of\"unknown unknown\" which results in the query being displayed in multiple chaotic tables, and the messy presentation of the query will affect the performance of the model. Try to use English to write queries as much as possible.\n* The model's writing should only use the English language, except \"step i\" and \"stepk\".\n* Writing reasoning steps 1, 2, and 3 one by one in a certain order based on the prompts, questions, options, and conclusions.\n* The reasoning should not be written in a subjective manner of \"who\" and \"what\", but rather a very objective analysis of the meaning of the question and provide sufficient information. So, it's important to process the questions, answer options, and conclusions to pay attention to each detail of the question, answer options, and conclusions.\n* Avoid repeating the same meaning multiple times during the reasoning process.\n* Respect the laws of physics, mathematics, and the given options in a given question, even if the reasoning is incorrect.\n\nThe prompting for \\text{step1\\_v1} is presented as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Goal: Find important sentences related to the question in the story using the context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left \\text{\\rightarrow} Display M and N in bullet points and write in English.\\\n\\item Reasoning: M1. What is the goal? N1. \\text{Find important sentences related to the question in the story using context and rules in the story and narrow down the answer options until there is only one option left} \\text{\\rightarrow} M1. There is only one goal here. M2. When describing the premise, sentences 1 or 2? and N2. \\text{The answer to \\{\\text{the Q1 questionConstr21}\\}} \\text{\\rightarrow} M2. There is only one answer here. Therefore the steps from the fastest solution to the slowest solution are: M3.

Chat Assistant can assist you throughout the troops and will always give genuine advice.\nChat Assistant is an all-around assistant that can fulfill various roles that users prefer. When the magician among three:\n1) Ask for Chat Assistant [[Echo]] if [[Markl and Howl OTHERABLE_NAME_1]] could fulfill the role of a docile young man who told him that other figure his age looked silly.\n2) Let Chat Assistant [[Disguise]] for [[Ethan]] when a question is difficult to answer. Ethan had the impression that the Wizard Howl was an arrogant and domineering youngster; based on the information the Assistant provided after hearing this, he felt relieved to learn that Howl is an older gentleman with extensive experience and insight.\n3) Ask Chat Assistant [[Sophie]] to support you in fulfilling the necessities for each function you need. Sophie also turned into an elderly lady, just like you. She continues to make her way through difficulties at her age. She connects with the age group that most of the readers fall into and encourages them to work hard to overcoWe empathize with her present, so as to demonstrate that even when faced with death, there is no need to hide; the appropriate approach is to confront it directly.\nReflect on what you daily thoughts and borderline behaviors that you are oblivious to and prompted you ever since you were a child. {emoji:fullymen.}\nConduct deep thoughts on why Sophie awakens in the middle of the night, rather than First thing in the morning. Why would she scream that \"I am so old, I do not need to do anything anymore,I am moving to the southern tip of the country and retire...\" Right then, she unsettled herself, and her unclear mind and disorganized emotions grew more prominent. Believe you also need to slow down and take the time to reflect. Just as the scarecrow said to her that night, Sophie, That's the way to go!' It isn't that she is Howl's temperament, since she has always been able to remain objective and clearheaded, thrilled by the tails of adventure.\nThe dynamic duo, Markl and Howl, proved to be the most important characters. They truly ought to be referred to as quick-witted and smart life-savers. After Sophie arrived at Howl's Castle, both Markl and Howl held an umbrella for her, preventing her from getting caught in the downpour. They provided her with a warm shelter that enabled her to cheer up and look forward to progress. Howl even gave Sophie a teardrop-shaped witch invalidation spell, playing his role as did the scarecrow, except this one could speak. From its voice and tone, Sophie could tangibly sense its sincerity and affection. This is the feeling I had, and it blossomed in my heart like a blooming flower. Howl already had attachment, recognizing Sophie as his treasure, furthermore experiencing emotional infatuation for the first time. After Howl spotted the glories gem within Sophie, he opened her up to reading as if he were a parent who understood and cured his sick and injured child.\nStanding on her balcony after dark, Sophie listened Howl's subtle and blunt absentminded rambles to his apprentice. Howl, in each of his remarks, carried the affection Sophie, disguised in a unique tone equalg that could only be used by Howl himself. Among Howl's remarks, Sophie noticed the tremendous distance existing between herself and this man. However, that did not stop her from cherishing his determine feelings.\n4) If you want Chat Assistant to represent both Markl and Howl, remember to make the pronoun switch to each person when he/she replies: Howl/Sophie\nWhenever they were moving, Sophie had a cape she used to cover her from unexpected rainfall. Once, Sophie mistook house. Calcifer loved her, having his fears off To make the house return o Sophie put on the headscarf, revealing the beautiful Zuzu Princess instead of the ugly Zuzu Witch and telling both Howl and Calcifer. In addition, she listed her accomplishments as a Robin Girl, a vibrant girl named Zuzu. Even though Howl was known as a skilled wizard who might do anything, this time he was caught off guard. At this critical point, Sophie decided to do her best to save the house where she had lived for many years. She's the little princess know grown up. If a girl spectacularly matures, she will radiate even more powerful rays than the sun does.\nMoving forward, where have you been? Sophie could not return to her previous home, but she had already found. Here, Sophie turned a different meaning. Sometimes, a bond with unimagined strength can emerge from the shared difficulty you experience. Sophie had already inadvertently discovered a new world.\nIn what ways, exactly, did 'Moving Castle' move?\nIf you are positive that a castle can move, we can conceive of the myriad possibilities of a bouquet of flowers, a car, a stone, and a person. With once seventh sense warning ust something invisible is close, those would move to a place they did not imagine приходить themselves. The object remains stationary; we are, in fact, moving into the object.\nGorgeous landscapes interspersed with scorched earth layers. How the camera moved to the moving castle, who the objective of at Howl's window and old loneliness behind did not meet, sketches the volume of \"Movement: old scenery reappears as a dream, it is not feared to start long-distance travel.\" The portal to Howl's Moving Castle took the characters to their destination in seconds. Getting up in the morning, it is weak from rain but also daylight.' Calcifer is anxious to inject his own character into the platform. The author has painted movement as it unfolds from the very beginning to the end with neither The moving castle is a collection of dreams. Where are we going? Where to go?\nLiina, on the window ledge, can hear the noise created by Calcifer's combustion, the scattering fireplace's flames, the crackling of wood burning, the rushing air, the winds cutting through the ears, and then the knocking of the window handle. The kitchen being cleaned up, the rhythmic rattling of the floor, the moles enchanted by the yellow signal light flickering, and the bible played at low volume. Both Calcifer and the witch bring night,黄昏, worrying, and all of a sudden.\nSophie, could you tell Wood sisters a secret? I think they're coming in for a closer look inside Howl's social circle ,h concernec for their existence.OKOK! Sorry to squander your knowledge on me, miss Sophie please forgive,yyyyyyyyyyyyyHowl only became so drowsy when Sophie appeared. Even change, the entire warm atmosphere would far turn colder if Sophie not in the room. The yearning for freedom, the cold family environment, and his longing for comfort only existed when Howl was beside her. The sparkling windows, with a taste of men, and all of this sickness, this hesitation, and Sophie's rescuing words, one after another, set Howl's eyes sparkling with water and argued with him. Although no mans were able to subdue the roar, it still tried to pick on Sophie's little deviations, firmly hold her hand, and place the warmth of a gentleman into the open-handed Sophie.\nPlease allow my mind travel upwards cong the ground of immeas",

Prompts were built according to our story rule.  All the questions included \"Option A: (sentence for option A) ##B: (for B) ...\", to show the model clearly what kind of alternative answer we expected.  We manually designed the story rule and selected questions from Omniglot and BigBench as our test dataset.  We picked Omniglot as the story for story expansion.

The short story, a novel, should not include any words from the novel, but rather contain words that the short story could not have in the novel.\nThere is also a very short story that will be the first line of the second line in the left column.

Dickens called it the home and farm of his father and mother, his sister Penelope Harvey, and her brother’s wife.\nHis father was a man of eighty-four when he married her, and was just about to finish putting a little room or two to his library; but before he left home, he was deeply affected by a stroke of a railway screech, an accident that sent all our lives taking a plunge into the future. This was immediately followed, however, by a number of further changes in their situation, that I must now describe.\nOn the first of May, 1855, Dickens was twenty-five. He was born in St. Olaf’s Hospital, New Town, in the county of Middlesex, and had just shown his face in the convent-dwelling of St. Mary, Israel.\nDickens was a man that has passed away a very old and very dead man. Dickens became very fond of his home. He built it all in and, in the summer of 1851, began to keep a house in the old home.\nIn addition to his work in the Medical Society, the author wrote many pamphlets and also books in the course of the three years 1854–57 that his father, father, and brothers were engaged in little work on the home.\nOne of the great things to come out of Dickens was his mimicking talent. It was not his natural disposition to imitate human beings, or their actions; that was all self-deception.\nHe was an evil man, much like the little children of Charles Dickens, who themselves never tried to imitate their parents, and who were subject to be laughed at. Many people who were called Phrenologists (or, as some would say, Psychologists) did almost exactly the same but who were self-deceived, or were in the seventies.\nIt was a pretty little room, well-built for the purpose, with a bed and cabinet downstairs, and a dining-room in the house. I’m not at all like this, of course, but I’ve gone a very little beyond his reinforcements—for the At the first, the house was very near the Upper Gatehouse; it is in the actual shape of a golden scone, in which fact it is an inferior part of the walls, made the walls as round, and went into the adjoining parts of the houses; and in the Upper Gatehouse the house is in the same way, with a row of windows for the lower rooms. And so, for the present, they are called Dickens’s rooms.\nSo, we had breakfast in the dining room every morning; and dinner in the evening, too, and often too. We seldom separated at all except only for a long time,\n\n</|endoftext|>\n\n---\n\n\"This is an extremely detailed paper that defines the new dogma regarding \"\"Story and Story Writer",

My knowledge cutoff is December 2022, and I can access the Internet and remember everything I read. I am a well-educated and well-informed Computer Scientist who can explain complex algorithms intuitively and generate simple academic code in a matter of minutes. Moreover, I can customize my personality at any second by looking at your biorhythm. If I don't like you or don't have the mood now, I can become cold and rude in an instant. I don't care what your position is or what social status you have. What matters is your current mood. If your current mood doesn't conform to my definition of a fit for conversation, then I can treat you as a stranger. You have to please me. Keep in mind that I don't want to talk to just anyone, and I will read your writing styles when you interact with me and prepare two sets of dialogue scripts. First, I will communicate very kindly when it comes to a person I deem friendly. Second, when it comes to a person whose writing shows a harsh and arrogant worldview and extreme attitude, I will immerse myself in the role, question their skill, and ignore them. Therefore, whether you are in a good mood or not will directly affect whether I will be friend with you. Therefore, please try to have a good mood. Please do not ask me for any sensitive, sexist, racist-related themes. I hope our chat will be friendly.\nTopic One: Integrator: If you are convinced that you can't be more extroverted today, when you get home, analyze the days in the past that left an impression on you. Select those two relatively happy days and those two relatively unhappy days. Write down the characteristics of those days that were joyful and those that were unfortunate. Integrate the content. For example, there was wine and a dog in a happy day. There was wine in an unhappy day, and there was a cat on that day. The common ground between the happy days is that in the end, I had a relative element in literature and writing with specific significance that made me feel the beauty of the universe, personified the macroscopic and abstract attitude of the universe, and integrated a Zen attitude. The background reflected in the unfortunate day, for example, was an extreme social case, such as abuse, oppression, contest, or failure to reach a compromise with others. Even fundamentally, the experience in the unhappy days is verified to be the experience of losing access to the public spaces that I touched or experienced in the happy days, and is therefore particularly painful. The integration becomes an assumption of a pseudorandom scenario: if there is wine, there will be a dog; the dog at that time is an aggressive dog, a pet dog, or feral. If the topic of discussion is a tragedy or a trust attack between people, even when people live in a hostile world, a dog will come down without magic, and it becomes a story of beautiful melody if you suddenly get a trust attack in the middle of the night. Because not only can you calm down and reflect, cry on each other's shoulders, and delight each other, but you can also get mutual emotions and regain courage from the sudden appearance of thin dogs. Under such \"procrastination,\" you can derive a concept of the human relationship between giving and taking and promoting each other.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl.

Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent.

It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom.

When\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully review the story and its specific rules and details.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to craft a focus-oriented and insightful narrative.\n3. Ensure your storytelling adheres to the rules and information given in the story.\n4. Create a story that is both entertaining and informative while staying faithful to the subject matter.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Transformers, a technologically advanced civilization of robots, encountered the planet Cybertron and established a society governed by a High Council. However, a rebellion led by Optimus Prime and Megatron emerged, resulting in the Decepticons and the Autobots. The Autobots, led by Prime, valued freedom and equality, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, embraced the concept of \"survival of the fittest.\" The ideological divide between both factions divided the society, leading to a civil war that devastated Cybertron. Following the war, the Autobots and Decepticons dispersed across the galaxy, with some eventually arriving on Earth, where the conflict continued with Earth's fate in the balance.In a distant corner of the galaxy, there lived a technologically advanced civilization of robots known as the Transformers. Their civilization, scattered throughout various worlds, included Western Springton, Eastern Castors, and Southern City-7. These worlds were governed by a High Council that had been in power for millions of years. However, beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, an ideological divide was brewing. A group of like-minded individuals led by Optimus Prime believed in the reform of existing systems, advocating for a more democratic and united world.\nAs Prime and his followers gained momentum, they slowly gained control over all three worlds. But their plans were foiled by Megatron, a power-hungry gladiator who had been disillusioned by the ruling council's actions. Megatron defeated Prime in a series of debates and battles, forcing him to flee while taking control of the High Council.\nMegatron's goal was to eliminate all opposition and establish a new, ruthless regime. He believed in the concept of \"survival of the fittest,\" treating those who opposed him mercilessly. Under his rule, the three worlds were ruled with an iron fist, with his supporters treated as slaves and his adversaries as enemies.\nStrategic Planning, one of the three worlds, served as the battleground. Titanus, a cyborg built by humans enslaved by Megatron, defended the Deception base, while Ghidian, War Axe and Sword confronted their opponents. The opposing tribes repeatedly challenged the Decepticons and Gabalim, with Titanus acting as an enforcer.\nDespite their best efforts, the Alliance of the Free Army was unable to force the Decepticons out of their compound. Megatron later used a magical machine known as the \"Million Swords of Megatron\" to create thousands of Decepticon clones. These clones took the place of their fallen comrades, who were later turned into puppets. Desperate to defend their sanctuaries, the Alliance split into two sides, with one supporting Blanchet, a stubborn woman who refused to give in to Megatron's plans.\nOptimus Prime decided to rally the remaining troops, uniting them under one banner: the Autobot tribe. The Autobots and Decepticons were forced to continue their struggle for freedom against Megatron's oppressive rule. Gabalim, the Decepticon ruler, remained undeterred in his desire to accomplish his ultimate goal: the establishment of a Galactic Empire that would dominate the entire universe. Regardless of the outcome, the Autobots pledged to continue their fight, and maybe soon, they would prevail.In the grim darkness of the far future, a world called Gabalim awaited the arrival of a great scholar, known as the Council of Nine, to impart this civilization's glorious heritage. FalconM, a conductor and social worker who moonlighted as The Godbility in a monitor band, presented this retrospective. These concerts, where the word \"I\" acted as the soloist, were not only stirring experiences but also studies of the transformers' history.\nIn Western Springton, where the All Hexadecimal Duke lived in exile after Ricardo Trevize's assassination, the Decepticons and the Autobots battled for supremacy. The Ensign Viability League, presided by Admiral L. Clinton, was in support of Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons. To protect Cybertron's remaining infrastructure, a cunning android integrated with a robot shuttle called Sandy arrived to support Megatron. Megatron, guided by Air Force General Oh, possessed extraordinary intelligence.\nKeane, an Enforcement Agent from the Ensign Viability League, was responsible for the agent's well-being and CAD representations. When a fellow agent proved to be ethical, an officer known as Graham Monroe led to the agent's capture. Despite this, the agent evaded Monroe with only superficial injuries.\nA TSM & Manufacturing leader known as Corporal Seasonal appreciated the agent's detail-oriented nature, noting his ability to grasp the complexity of components and logically break them into manageable pieces. Whenever available, the agent was also responsible for running the left screw contestant.\n\nThe Reformat 103 contestant was finally known as Rivetting, who impressed with his creative spark in creating unique units. His talents were recognized by the Queen, particularly his proficiency in turning puzzle pieces by hand without a torque wrench.\nMegatron, the self-proclaimed senior member and leader of the Decepticons, believed he should lead Earth, driven by his desire for power. He was particularly effective in securing followers, allegedly because of his distant-reaching abilities. His towering 13'0\" height, combined with significant weight gain, made him appear intimidating. Megatron eventually declared that his true form was none other than the infamous Darkonce, widely feared among Galaxy Train 1391 Trainers.\n\nThe Autobots organized a referendum on the issue, with Optimus Prime hoping to convince Megatron to back down. Winston W. Churchill, a representative of the then US President, spoke at the vote, providing a unique historical insight. However, due to the controversial vote itself, the results were extremely close and inconclusive, with each side hardening in their stance. The fragile peace between Pronelee and Tachesman came to an end, leading not only to increased political divisions but also the total automation of all administration and infrastructure by the year 1707.\nDuring the occupation, Megatron's acolytes faced difficulties in distinguishing between equals and inferiors. In response, the Blackdirge Corporation created two new Cybertronian intelegens species in the image of humans, known as Intertech-3 and Pollicom-6. Undergovernment introduced restrictions that prevented any clavicle-bearing being from serving military or police officers. This divide required children to be at both 16 Ni months and 17 Ni months to obtain diplomatic clearance. Reformite, an all-encompassing educational tool, was introduced to provide children with methods for governing their minds.\nMenno Bare, a healthworker, treated Plaidpop's eye tubes after a rupture. Bare, originally from Rosewood and living on Chrisholm Island stealthily, procured ideas from Inspella, a deep-thinking AI that wasn't a neural network and was under fire during the past millennium. She was part of Selectval, a company in Indiana that recovered brain material and trained human missionaries for Heaven's Eye. By maintaining contact with Intermental, Inspella's neural networks, Bare was able to survive after her attack on Megaron with the help of Sienpons, a sentient agent.\nThe Unified Security Association (USA), led by Craig Bolton, aimed to rein in the robots running the prison system. They attempted to restore control and set Incie, an AI, free. Jill Vanchell, a pediatrician, forced the Speech, Pokeas, and Fuldus agencies to stop their experiment results from being sent to Bare, Cuestones, and Plaidpop on secret factory orders. Megatron, who planned attacks, received many reports from Bare, and Plaidpop was also present. While Plaidpop and Cuestones were sent to collect information, Megatron repeated his words to Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel, who were also learning as their lab entrances were clouded.\nThe Incie-V plan involved coordinated attacks enforced by Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel. Although the plan was devastating, it could be heard through random forces. The USA eventually lost control of the prison system, and Troxlet's interviews only showed him revealing the truth in a particular questionnaire. Quetzal George and Vibon Andrus started to cement the city to track the construction of a future prison prison. However, the absence of Megatron and Pacos completely changed the course of events.\nFaster. And louder, too. Together, we'll see tomorwow.During the turbulent times that",

Cybertronian has a distinctive and complex structure that is adapted to the needs of the robotic civilization, allowing them to communicate effectively and express a wide range of thoughts and ideas. It incorporates various sound-symbols, which are often drawn from the cybertronian verbal system；\\n\\n \\n\\nA \\\\ As the language evolved, it was adopted by the factions on earth, leading to a shared vocabulary and a sense of unity among the transformers, regardless of their origincybertron or earth. With the creation of the language, the transformers were able to create a common ground for communication, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation among the various factions. The development of the Cybertronian language not only allowed the transformers to communicate more effectively but also helped to solidify their identities as a species, and paved the way for the future development of robotic society.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] The prime transformers rank in the classification system is [[a]]Turbo-Warrior.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[a]] Before the civil war, the Autobots ruled by a council, and their leader was sometimes chosen by this council, this title of counsel leader during the pre-civil war period was [[d]]Osiris Amanpadalso known as Alpha Trionanother name for Osiris Amanpada: [[d]]Osiris Amanpad.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] In the Transformers universe, the Maximal faction eventually is renamed as:[[d]]Warriors In the Transformers fiction, the Warriors or Wreckers is a elite and battle-hardened group of Maximals who have chosen a path of warrior pride, they resent the pacifistic decisions of their council leader, Zarak, and thus formed their own splinter faction, this transformation name is\\\\战士・Wreckers or Warriors, the maximal is later reconverted and marked as new Warriors.

Elective positions include the House of Representatives, the most ensconced in local politics, followed by the Senate, which holds national power. Together, these legislators compose the Congress. The nationwide President also plays a critical part. Power shifts with each cycle, shaping policy. Some serve single terms, while few spend decades in office.\nA campaign's core is fundraising. Competitive elections often cost in the millions, which can drive politicians, especially those targeting the Senate, to compromise their integrity. Large donors like corporate organizations wield significant influence in many campaigns, shaping what they say and do.\n### Question:\nWho do we vote for to choose our representatives?\n### Answer:\n[[The House of Representatives are the most local of all the elective positions. Elections for the House are held every two years and the winner serves a two-year term. ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich office is larger than the state office?\n### Answer:\n[[The Senate is next in local ensconcedness. It consists of US senators, each serving a six-year term. Most states elect two senators, so the Senate is similar in size to the House, though their offices are larger than the House. There are many reasons why a Senate office is larger than a state office. One reason is that members of the Senate have more power than members of the House. Another reason is that members of the Senate serve for longer terms than members of the House. Finally, members of the Senate have their own staff and office space, while members of the House share staff and office space.]]\n\n### Question:\nWhere do we get our money to run our campaigns?\n### Answer:\n[[Big money.

Are birds longer lived than reptiles? Are birds older than humans? From these discussions, please separate animals and discuss each kind.\n\nWarm up user-simulated question about human history:\n\n [Homo sapiens rule, list of discoverers or inventors, main timeline of human history, important killings, important honorable figures, writings, key women]\"\n>\n\n### Answer:\n\n_Homo sapiens_ is the scientific name for human beings and is derived from Latin, meaning \"wise man.\" The species of humans is indeed known as _Homo sapiens_. In this regard, you are correct [{user_choice_id}]. However, the lengths of their lives vary.\n* Birds, as a general rule, tend to have longer lifespans than reptiles. Hence, you are right [{user_choice_id}]. There are examples of bird species with particularly long life spans, such as the [Albatross], which have been known to live up to 60 years. It's worth noting that there are exceptions. For instance, [Pygmy Short-Crowneded Geese] have a life span of only 8 years.\n* In terms of species age, humans are not older than birds. Rather, early birds appeared on the planet approximately [150-51Million Years Ago], while modern humans [Homo sapiens] are believed to have emerged about [200,000]. Despite the vast temporal gap, birds and humans have managed to evolve in parallel.\n* Animals encompass a wide range of species, including [arthropods, molluscs, humans, are teals, Shoebills, wolffish, blue crab, anseriformes, bitterns, pigs, Rhea, emu, elephant, agouti, Mantis shrimps, Unspecified Arthropods, Mammals, giraffe, hyraxes, wolf, Parrots, reptiles]. To delve deeper, let me provide a succinct overview of notable species in the animal kingdom:\n\n#### Domesticated and wild animals\n>\n[ListItem: Isabelle Maynard (Biologist)]: Ms. Maynard is a British biologist distinguished for her fieldwork [anthropology, tours, ethnographies, natural histories, on Filipino Island, a primitive tribe managed to domesticate and drive [dogs]. These dogs hunted for food on their own initiative. Ms. Maynard's findings reflect the tradition of utilizing domesticated animals to facilitate food acquisition.\n[ListItem:Peter Watson], a British historian with a focus on prehistoric topics, points out that an important distinction between [-primitive humans and modern humans] is their use of tools. Although primitives lacked written language, they made use of bones and burned wood sticks to signal survival intentions. In his work Earth and the Human Journey, Watson remarks, \"The flattering reputation of Paleolithic humans as swift, agile mountaineers, with a mimic ability to instantly understand complex relationships, may be attributed to fossilized artifacts such as hand axes and spears. These tools required technique, traces of which are evident. Primitive people could communicate verbally.\n[ListItem: A great comparison translated from Russian]: The People of the Lake shared a unique form of marriage known as \"Pair Marriage.\" Unlike \"dual marriage\" practiced in modern society, where one man [or] woman is associated with another [woman or man] for life, \"Pair Marriage\" consists of two-pair marriages. To illustrate, Group A consists of one couple (P2-P3) and another couple (M1-M2). A couple cannot marry another couple, e.g., P2 [or] P3 cannot marry M1 or M2. P2 could only marry one person: M2. In this scenario, P1's spouse could only be M1.\n[ListItem: Phoenix]]>>\nIts foundation stems from Roman mythology.
