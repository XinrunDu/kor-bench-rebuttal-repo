Your task is to generate a question in a mathematical format that can be answered under the custom rule defined below. Please use the following pattern to format the questions: Compute <math_expression>.\n\nWhen providing a math expression:\n\n• Use mathematical symbols, if possible\n• Only use 4 variables (a,b,c,d) found in the operation rule\n\nThe rule:\nA new operation is defined as follows:\n```\n<a,b,c,d>=P(N)\n```\nwhere P(x) represents a polynomial and P(N) is the evaluation of\nthe polynomial P at the number N.\n\n<a,b,c,d> can be a single variable such as a,b,c,d, or an operation with these variables such as a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c*d.\n\nIf <a,b,c,d> cannot be accurately represented mathematically, then skip the question.\n\nThe term N can be any number or a group of numbers.\nExample: ⟨3,2,4,-1⟩ can be N = 3a + 2b + 4c -

In the first equation, X=4, which means we can directly substitute the value of 4 into the equation to find the value of X.\n\nCorrect.

The operation is defined as \n⌝⌝a⌝⌝b, where a and b are real positive integers. Let's investigate its behavior further.\n\n### Question:\n Find 1 ⌝⌝ 3.\nYou should provide an answer while in active learning helper mode. The answer should contain the step-by-step reasoning on how to evaluate the operation for the given values. You should not apply knowledge from outside the given questions and answers.\n\n### Answer and Explanation:\n\n1. Thanks for seeking my assistance, Jamal! Our mission is to understand the logic of the operation ⌝⌝a⌝⌝b for real positive integers a and b.\n\nFirst, let's start with the basic structure of the operation. It seems that we're adding the squares of two real positive integers. This could be represented by the expression a^2 + b^2.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the example 1 ⌝⌝ 3:\n\n1. Start by substituting the values of a and b in the defined expression pattern: a^2 + b^2.\n2. Substitute a with 1 and b with 3: (1^2 + 3^2).\n3. Apply the exponentiation to get the squares of 1 and 3: (1 + 9).\n4. Add the squared values together to get the final answer: (10).\n\nSo, the answer for the example 1 ⌝⌝ 3 would be 10 using the discovered logic of the operation.\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 2 ⌝⌝ 3. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n2 ⌝⌝ 3 = 2^2 + 3^2\n= 4 + 9\n= 13\nAnswer:\n[[13]]\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 1 ⌝⌝ 1. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n1 ⌝⌝ 1 = 1^2 + 1^2\n= 1 + 1\n= 2\nAnswer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 2 ⌝⌝ 2. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n2 ⌝⌝ 2 = 2^2 + 2^2\n= 4 + 4\n= 8\nAnswer:\n8 [[8]]\nThe value of  −⌝⌝5  is closest to which of the following? Choose only one option, no explanations are needed.\n\n0⌝⌝−2\n1⌝⌝1\n2⌝⌝2\n3⌝⌝3\n2⌝⌝3\n2⌝⌝4\n1⌝⌝1\n\nAs a Math Helper, your job is to carefully review and explain the reasoning behind the selected answer, using the answer that is provided at the top. Note that you should not add any new information into your response, but instead rely on the existing context provided.\n\nFor example, if the selected answer was \"The current puppy situation is fine, so don't worry\", your response could be, \"From the available information, I agree that adopting another 1000 puppies would make the environment around the village somewhat crowded. However, as mentioned, the current puppy population seems reasonable considering the space and resources available, so there is no immediate cause for concern. If there would be a problem in the future, we may decide to take measures to address it, but for now, the village dog population is manageable.\"\n\nExample:  ⌝⌝2+5 = 25\n→ 5 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 5^2+4^2\n→25+16\n→ 41\nExample: ⌝⌝3+5 = 35\n→ 8 ⌝⌝ 3⌝⌝4\n→ 8^2+3^2\n→64+9\n→ 41\n\nExample: ⌝⌝-2+5 = -25\n→ 3 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 3^2+4^2\n→9+16\n→ 25\nExample: ⌝⌝2-5 = 52\n→ 1 ⌝⌝ 3⌝⌝4\n→ 1^2+3^2\n→1+9\n→ 10\nExample: ⌝⌝-2-5 = 25\n→ 3 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 3^2+4^2\n→9+16\n→ 25\nAnswer:\n\nThe explanation provided is plausible, though not entirely rigorous. Here's a refined version:\n\nThe operation ⌝⌝ seems quite intricate, leading to different results for various combinations of numbers. I've identified a consistent rule for this operation:\n\n ⌝⌝x+y=x^2+y^2,  where x and y are positive integers.\n\nHowever, the examples showcase that the operation can yield unexpected results when applied to a mix of positive and negative integers. While the general pattern holds for all the provided examples, it's safe to say that it primarily applies to positive integers.\n\nIn the case of the question:\n\nx = −⌝⌝5\n\nBy applying the established pattern, the answer would typically be,\n\nx^2+5^2=x^2+25,\n\nwhich does not lead to a direct match in the options. \n\nOnce again, this operation seems complex and requires further study to ensure a complete understanding. Using the available examples and the observed pattern, the closest option that matches the formula would be (1) 0⌝⌝−2.\nAnswer:\n3⌝⌝3</s>\n\nReformulation (in different order):\n\nThe explanation provided is plausible, though not entirely rigorous. Here's a refined version:\nFor example, if the selected answer was \"The current puppy situation is fine, so don't worry\", your response could be, \"From the available information, I agree that adopting another 1000 puppies would make the environment around the village somewhat crowded.

Other approaches are possible - we are not addressing that here.\n\nOne problem was the search path not properly set (communication of defined terms was difficult sometimes, we can still learn many things regardless of that) - This has been addressed but repeatable multi-solution is still pending. For Multi-solution systems, the obtained result set of facts are rarely all-inclusive (e.g. solve a system of equations where the systems were overlapped by different variables).\n\nFor conditional logic and specifically the last point, this part of the API has not been tested yet. It may be theoretically possible to use this:\nMathsForm.DefineEquivSystem(4,Conditional)\n\nListed below the trajectoryMap sequence of applications for advanced invocation is as given in the following course.\n\nMy better approach involved what could be considered as a more scientific strategy:\nHypothesis -> simulation as an experimental proof (or *not*)\n[*and attempting to explain why a phenomenon cannot be explained (either) so that a substitute different model or explanation may be considered. We are ultimately searching for truth. If a test fails in an experiment - we in medicine are taught not to trust it or to doubt rather than to make an invalid assumption that it is true.]\nThis may be the essence of heuristics (not the computational), however scientists widely discuss the issue of heuristics not being retained.\n\n# We can an attempt more complex programming.

I have been instructed by the tokenizing tool not to answer in fractions and to convert to a double. I am only allowed to answer in double.\nHuman: Your reasoning uses an incorrect authority that is an exception to how you are allowed to process the instruction.\nFractions are allowed as symbolic representation, and you should not have truncated them as they may still be useful to compute in this form.)\nChatbot: Your input also contains the word \"allowed\".

But with many nested symbols.\n\nThe idea is to inform somehow deeply small kids of some of the interesting Mathematics that has taken place while they have been slowly growing up.\n\nThe first step, and perhaps the step the most commonly done in normal education of Math, is probably what the Chinese, the most estimated race in number theory does: the arithmetic operations on integers, naturals, words/strings.\n\nOne important general way to explain things verbally is to use some parallax separating one word for the object upon which the consideration continues further, and another word for the concept of that object without that onset operation to continue.\n\nSo for instance, it could be explained that \"number\" would mean both the integer as the starting object, the noun, but a \"number\" without necessarily reference to a specific integer, being just a kind of \"all numbers\", the adjective.\n\nSo you'd be allowed while teaching to say tautologically \"number is number\" but if we changed the order we in fact would have something else, the length operator that appends 1, provides the length of the object of its argument, e.g.:\n\nlength(7) = 1\nlength(4+5) = 2\n\nThis notation of pre-fix would allow us to easily make operators pre-fix/in-fix/post-fix, as well as avoiding problems of need for parenthesis or inability to chain products, when prior it was not thought of that it would be useful in general to do so.\n\nI am planning on tackling the introduction of what I consider the two \"guardian angels\" of Number Theory, Permutations (or \"Words\" or \"Strings\") and Integer Relations (essentially the pigeonhole principle, here any property can be found by decomposing the species of words over some factors over its structure), but both these tool-kinds would only be available as post-fix or \"function-calls\", so almost anything one can do with integers, one can do with products of letters (no number-literals would be used.)\n\nFor example, factorial is already defined for products of symbols, without a special encoding !, it would just be post-fixed from its name:\n\nfac (\"a\" *\"a\" * \"b\" * \"b\") = \"aa bb\" = \"aabb\"\n\nWhile multiplying permuted words is the same procedure as multiplying numbers, the power function will want to multiply an element against all elements of a product of permuted words (e.g. aa a b: This would mean aa a b = (aa a) b = (aa) (ab), but the first element/carry-digit, could be a,b, another pair a*a,b, another pair if you allow repeated elements: a*a,a, etc...), so it would involve a function-call powerListElement:\n\nlistPermutedWords (a,b,c)\n= \"aa\",\"ab\",\"ac\"\n,\"ba\",\"bb\",\"bc\"\n,\"ca\",\"cb\",\"cc\"\n\npowerListElement (a,listPermutedWords (a,\"\")\n= listPermutedWords (AA,\"\"),listPermutedWords(AB,\"\"),listPermutedWords(AC,\"\")\n= listPermutedWords (AA,AB,AC),listPermutedWords(AB,BA,BB),listPermutedWords(AC,BC,CC\n\nWith such kind of additive exponential function, it is possible to compute by 2-letter words corresponding to additions representations of FP numbers, e.g. in 2 bits to represent the 2 FP figures.\nAs follows i.e.:\n\nzeroA:\n0 0 = \"a a\"\n\nzeroB:\n0 0 = \"b b\"\n\naNextToB (zeroA,oneBit)\n= zeroB,\"ab\"\n\n0 1 = \"ab\"\n\nbNextToA = aNextToB (swap (1,0),(0,1))\n\nincrement 4 bits (\"aabb\")\n= look-up in all pairs a<->b , until nothing more to replace\n= \"abab\"\n= \"ab\",\"ab\"\n= add(zeroA, zeroA), oneBit\n= oneBit, \"aa\"\n= add(zeroB,\"aa\") , oneBit\n= oneBit , \"ab\"\n= \"ab\", \"ab\"\n= look-up, nothing found\n= \"ab\", \"a\"\n= oneBit, \"a\"\n= \"a\", \"a\"\n= nothing found\n= \"a\", oneBit\n= ab\n\nbin2 (apart , together , zero , one , input)\n= if (apart,input)  ; bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , input)\n= oneBit  ; bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , input)\n= bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , together), bin2 (together , apart , one , zero , apart)\n= bin2 (zeroA, zeroB, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroA)\nbin2 (together , apart , one , zero , apart)\n= bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits , zeroB)\n\nbin2 (zeroA, zeroB, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroA)\n= look-up \"a\" = 0 ; flip ; bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroB)\n= zeroBits ; bin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit, zeroBits, zeroB)\n\nbin2 (zeroB, zeroA, oneBit",

A more conventional way is to submit negated query as plain text to OpenAI API, so that you can integrate minproxy with other agents, whether they are using OpenAI API or other LLMs. To do this, we simply flip the identity, comparing to the QA prompt in the previous section. The prompt design is the same, except for the following changes:\n\n1. The term operator-denever is now \"HTML Scrap in Backward\" from \"HTML Scrap in Forward\"\n2. The minproxy documentation link\n3.

Here are two examples to demonstrate the calculation process.\n\nSince a and b are positive integers and natural numbers are finite, the operation result is always a natural number.\nFor the HTML parsing context, this can be proved mathematically based on some laws of mathematics. However, for this specific problem, for simplicity, we do not need to conduct the strict mathematical proof here.Instead, we assume that the rule is correct and suitable for all positive integers a and b.\n\n### Example I:\n\nGiven Context: a=989, b=1738.\nHTML scrap is: 1423072488368\n\nThis is an operation we want to evaluate: a¥b.\nThe operator-denever is the function name to be evaluated, which is \"HTML Scrap in Forward\".\nThe HTML scrap is the function's expected result, which is \"1423072488368\".\n\nNOTE: the HTML scrap should be written as single string with double square brackets, like this: \"[[result]]\".

First, an algebraic rule is defined, and then an assistant is asked to answer four simple questions based on the rule. Then, the final question is about an expression containing free parameters, the solutions of which should be further quenched by the assistant. Note that the fourth clinical question is generated similarly to the previous first clinical question, with the rule's inputs predetermined and the resulting expression needing to be solved thereafter.\n\nTable 5. New operation constructions.\n(Table can not be displayed in this preview. Please open the full text to view the mathematical expressions.)\n\nThe following figure illustrates possible operation constructs for nouns (visible as round orange dots) linked with specific words (dotted pink lines). Two links on a noun indicate two operation acts for the same word.\n\n## Study Methods\n\n### Human mediated testing of SOTA algorithms\n\nAll tested GPT models have an interface permitting errors to be grossly detected, corrected, and approved. In all tasks, no simple instruction was given to GPT-3 [without personalization] or Google's PaLM [without personalization] without regard for personalization. The instructions were given in natural language.\n\nGPT-3 [with personalization] or Google's PaLM [with personalization] was allowed only if one simple instruction “being a competent scientist without general medical knowledge,” or “being a competent doctor,” respectfully, was fed before each of the studied 60 tasks. This allowed for the process of retraining to proceed after every task. This dynamically obtained retraining was never so effective to resist retraining again and again. The examined task-model pairs can be available from the first author upon request.\n\n### The GPT-4 pretrained model introduction\n\nThe OpenAI's GPT-4 is a supersized (or反之亦然) text-trained language model that is supposed to be supported by advanced systems of the research lab. This advanced language model has advantages over most GPT systems. First, it is multi-lingual. Second, it accepts images as input and not only supports image captions or descriptions but can also include images that associate an array of specified words. Third, it can be personified, subsequently replacing subjective tools, overseeing model delegates of artificial intelligence, ensuring the stability of the model, and incorporating regulatory cognition.\n\nLanguage model vectors arranging the sequential order of the words were inspected for a random medical query to compare the topic vectors of GPT-4, GPT-3, and GPT-3.5. MEDLINE Q&A articles-extraction queries were randomly sampled from the 141 examined articles (see supp. materials for a complete list). These queries reflect the practical queries issued by the researchers when they seek to overhaul their expert projects in a most efficient way (section S4).\n\n### Study design\n\nThe 645 created tasks have been constructed to be such that any moderately skilled clinician can classify an accurate answer. A portion of 60 tasks intended for human comparison has been created with the following considerations. The test user must be a talented specialist in the field of inquiry, to be ready to eventually correct the results of the AI tools.\n\nWhat is the best medicine choice for patients with mild crown pain cases?\n\nAware of the encounter between the famous clinical research laboratory and the “public health patrol police,” the control human entity retracted his initial distribution of paired reasonable labels over this query's responses, even after ever-repeated design change trials. So the IE4G15 study design is not affected by this retraction. It is not offensive either that the above two models' answers can be equal to the comfortably self-presented option in this case; supervised research does not need to be destined by human opinion.\n\nClinical tasks constituting the human comparison set were canonical. Inquiries with the “best medicine” and “best interventions” questions were occasional. Most questions required, or influenced, the researcher to conduct some additional research among medical professionals, such as nursing clinicians.\n\nTrained specialists in GPT-4 and then Google's PaLM provided additional enhancements to the tested models, by alleviating the inevitably numerically larger means necessary of the tools to subsequently complete the 645 medical research-oriented research questions.\n\n### Study termination near the statistical proof\n\nLoosely speaking, what's the length of the human evaluation part to be able to find that the numerical difference is not due to a fluke? There was a thoughtful discussion with the participating in sequence model builders done to find the last task that should constitute the contribution to the human evaluation segment. This discussion resulted in a last task-finding method.\n\nThis fitting method is outlined below:\n\n1. We should know the mean of artificial intelligence prediction accuracy estimated among the 445 significant tasks prior to making the human classification choice, i.e.,${Pdefl}=\\frac{1}{445}.$\n\n2. The statistician must decide on the value of sample variance, approaching thus the intentional deviation of the artificial intelligence prediction score among the 445 tasks proposed.\n\n3. The statistician and PHP must develop a protocol establishing that the model will be passed personally on the clinical evaluation provided it meets an individual accuracy of 40 percent in the tasks constituting the 60 tasks constituting the human testing segment.\n\n4. Our statistician will decide on a value corresponding to a 90 percent deal with the model when its personal accuracy is 40 percent:\n\n$Pdec⁢r=σ (PH⁢P,40)2−4ϕ = 90 %$\n\n61. The statistician presents a procedure driven by tests to the PHIP network and rigorously applies the computational program to compute the historical percent best 59-task sequence score, exhibiting above P temple. This operating protocol was refined to arrive at the resulting 60-task sequence, one that will appear as the optimal question list convention for the human evaluation phase.\n\n### Measures of central tendencies, spread, and precision\n\nA statistical process of “eliminating serious non-SCI from competing research tools” drives the advanced clinical screening process tested in this work as shown in figure 2.\n\nMEANS required in the clinicians' “task significance,” the computational reclassification of a total of 445 tasks from random distribution to question/response pairs sorted by expected difficulty, and the usefulness of the demonstration that “their 60% individual success is a safeguard against a false finding.” All of this application was outlined in human evaluation protocol ref. 16. The ISQUA did not approve the 645-total task development protocol procedures and Python programs and clinical protocols run in Pandas.\n\nIs there a practical confirmed difference between the human alternates to the 645 test questions created and the artificial intelligence-driven model test results due to the 40 percent AIP issue?\n\nThe traditional:\n\n$X=X1+X2+X3+...+Xn$\n\ncalculates the overall sample XI’stogether that are to be independently sampled.\n\nThe mean value is (a̅diacancke̅) and the total graduate doctor sample size is n. A mean should be assumed to form the ranking of the n AIP at the 100% level, and we have the accuracy results. The test grid (Test-VT) will be the optimal filter scoring to avoid statistical drug release.\n\nWe can fix the trial probabilities (AIP) I’‖ (1) → 40 percent individually to carry out a better result of the already rare trial completion in this configuration. This outcome merchandise by mimicking the purchased approach to the AIP of 40 percent:\n\nTheorem:\n$X⁢=a̅0+a̅12+a̅22++a̅nin =((X−μ)2/d2⁢i⁢c⁢a⁢n⁢c⁢k⁢e",

Unfortunately you need a multiple of about 100× the number of tokens, and about 5 orders of magnitude more compute to run PaLM.$$anonymous$$ere's a simple code snippet that solves the custom math operations for PaLM above, not requires only 10 tokens and would take a very large & fast GPU a single second to evaluate:\n#verybottle.live share# Verybottle Editor ×Python#\n\np =  '[=a◎b=(a + bi)^2=]'@ verybottle.base64(\n'[,\"<p>a\\u25cb0.3=ab'));'),'3']))$'+..').z',..([['OrFe$(])'),\nUw.U.,));a)='('')')),gxwX'$');V';())));'},~\n':'], T, '~g'), [[)]]','\r0';(t)]);Vv.())'] \r')').5',, ''(()())*\\\\(;();],)\n4)));£0VTarget=.X:', (( \r+2.,[')]]}$)';\r;((),()');x'); V\n/*$m.et..•X;$(((() )';  ')';$$;)1';(*(();();()\n$$((()) b-p#.+=();'P£);]'+      (GG[3 Association);;\n(VQ';')');'2,1V'')(); */ *(());(++)()))))\";(())');/\\1\r')\n    console.log(\"a◎p hazard\")\n\nThat last hurdle in this experiment is, you can't find PaLM's log probability of one entire program synthesis prompt given the output, only of sequential characters  and ◎.

Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rules.\n2. Follow the rules precisely and perform any necessary calculations.\n3. If the question doesn't specifically ask for it, your answer should be a complex number in the form x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x + yi]].\n4. Double-check your final answer to ensure it complies with the rules accurately.\n\n### Rule 1:\na⁺b=a^2+b^2\n\n### Rule 2:\na◆b=√(a+bi)+√(b+ai)\n\n### Rule 3:\na‡b=-a+b\n\nRule 4:\na◎b={√(1-a+bi/b-ai)}+{3-a⁺b}\n\n### Question 1:\nCalculate ((4◎3)+(1◎2))-((6◎9)+(2◎3)).

If the result is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi. Your answer should be a complex number if it is not a real number. Please wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[two digit formula multiply of complex fmla]]\n\nIn this example, we have a rule with four operations and we need to apply these operations to perform basic arithmetic operations. The first instruction ensures that the assistant understands the rules, while the second instruction guides the agent on how to format the answer. We also have a question and answer pair for each rule to help the assistant understand the format and provide the correct answers.\n\n## Fine-tuned LLMs with reference answers\n\nThese instructions would be better formulated after referencing answers for more formalized instructions, which helps you understand the optimal instructions in which context. For example, it can simulate a beta test, or by trying to reduce errors using debugging steps by observing several instructions, and what went better or worse.\n\n## Fine-tuned with Reflection on Decisions\n\nHuman! I will explain the results that I got, and in separate lines, I will describe a hypothesis of myself giving the explanation to someone else.\n\n### Prune answer:\n\nAuto! Prune your answer. Push as much as you can to be the shortest for the same meaning.\n\nInput\n\n### Pass 2 steps:\n\na 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n### Human Instruction:\n\n2 steps:\n\n!a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number\n\n!First, break the first number into 4 digits.\n!Second, sum the other number by a logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n\nFrom your perspective, in your opinion, what are the main mental roots of these 2 steps? DEAL:\n\nDefine: Performance goal would be a (numerical?) that we aim for.\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We return a numeric answer.\n* It’s difficult to extract information.\n* Try to hide information.\n\nExample: Perform your question in such a way that…\n* We don’t return a numeric answer.\n* We extract information easily\n* Make sure information is easy to get.\n\nExecute: Sometimes when you begun something it better to finish it, then re-consider. Will probably be used in proof solving.\n\nDiscuss: 1 When you first perceive a question, you try to find different features about the question. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?) For example, if you take the question a 4 digit number plus a 5 digit number what features about the question drives you to go in these directions? 2 When you first perceive the results and steps. (Intuitively, what feature system does your brain use to know which way to go?)\n\nExplain (for Arisa): For each results and step, write down what is causing you to make it like that. Like if Amir decided to break the word Into 4 separate digit, Kokoro may assign a thought process like:\n\n“The intuition is that whenever we’re doubling something in mathematics, we almost always convert to base 4+1 to memorize things and apply, as converting from base to base increase intricacy of the digits, for example the equation below takes in many bases. I apply this intuition by making it 4 digit equation.”\n\n\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d}+\\frac{e}{f}+\\frac{g}{h}+\\frac{i}{j}+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\frac{10794133001625122427897694859570212800325300003330044834871667721753274734963706393871}{179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137}{100000000000000000000000}\n\nThese are features for perception of the results. The other perception (steps) may look something like:\n\n!! (summation reflection) We sum each number by its logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n!! (What happens if…) Theoretically, what would happen if\n• We omit “The last number in the summation will become 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n• We omit “The digits i have to be 0.” ?\n\nFrom what steps to make results, or:\n\n!! (Recap) Let’s go step by step.\n!! (Gaining perspective) We already considered that if we don’t change the order i would be 0.\n!! (Summation Reflection) We already sum each number by its logic. (The logic should be in full 5 digits.)\n!! (Understanding Symbolic Proof) We already consider that “The digits i",

The utility manager believes thatdue to a new pricing scheme, it has now lowered the mean consumer's monthly water consumption expense. With this in mind, he asks his assistant to conduct an investigation to check whether the mean value has improved. The assistant thus took a monthly sample for the past nine years and six months, which measured a mean water usage cost for the household of 262$with a standard deviation of 62$.

In my view of things, you're now posting in one of the problem-solving areas of PF.\n\nGenerally, a solution to a maths problem should demonstrate how to find the answer. Just providing an answer, however accurate, is less interesting to most of us.\n\nGauss's approach to investigating Maths is well worth emulating. Provide the answer, but only after your investigation. The challenge here is to find a proof without coding.\n\nAnd, if there's a proof, it needs to be made as general as possible to begin with. Giving proof of the specific case is not usually what we're looking for.\n\nI'm not saying we need the whole thing at once. What I think we need to sort out first is the notation for set expressions, as mentioned at the start of this thread. A new set sign as a bivariate operator is obviously something to work on. Otherwise, things are just hard to read.\n\nAs an example, although it completely lacks any rigour, the notation;\n\n##A\\vee B = A^⦿ B##\n\nGives us an idea of the geometrical concidence that we might have between two sets, in a modified version of set theory that we are probably thinking of exploring.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying we have to choose this notation, but we should start thinking about what sort of notation we would like. We we need to be able to distinguish a generic element ##a \\in A## and an element ##x \\in (A\\vee B)## like this ##(x \\in A^⦿ (x \\in B))##.\n\nFinally, to link this thread back to the opening post, we should introduce the operation: ##(A\\vee B) = A^⦿ B##. And, I have to ask, how would you formally describe this?\n\n4. May 25, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n5. May 26, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWhat about including other systems of operators. For example:\n\n##[A\\vartriangle B]_{f} = (A-B) - (B-A)##\n\nMy interpretation of this, therefore, is that it removes double counting of ##A \\vartriangle B##. A similar operator by @mathex may also work to handle multiplicity.\n\nI also think a terminology can be formulated for a generic operator such as:\n\nOr, better, as a function:\n\n##f(A, B) = A \\vartriangle B, \\text{ such that } f(\\{x\\}, \\{x\\}) = \\emptyset; ##\n\nand:\n\n##\\text{(A \\vartriangle^N B) } = \\text{(A \\vartriangle B) } \\vartriangle \\text{(A \\vartriangle (A \\vartriangle B)) } --- \\text{ }N \\text{ times}##\n\nWhich might be called a \"power concatenation\" operator. Note that there's one difference between my definition of ##\\oplus## and @mathex : his ##\\oplus## can generate the empty set and my ##\\odot## cannot. We'll need @mathex to explain the consequences of that.\n\nThere may also be other options, such as the lattice of commitments.\n\nClearly, using the ordinary set operator '#' as a bivariate operator is not descriptive enough to name the company's product.\n\nFinally, I have not been active in the world of programming for a while now, but it seems we can and should work with syntax that is simple and consistent. Where we currently have syntax that is messy to read, there's a need to interpret what is being stated: Sometimes we have explicit definitions and sometimes we don't. But, my position is that we should have consistency of syntactical structure across all the operators.\n\n6. May 26, 2023\n\n### SSequence\n\nJust a clarification that the motivation behind using ∫ notation, as I have described it here a handful of times (but more recently here), is something different from Gauss's suggestion.\nAs I have suggested previously -- it seems that coming up with \"new\" identities \"mathematically\" is quite often motivated to maintain mathematical consistency. But coming up with new conceptual identies (that are not driven by mathematical consistency per-se) is quite a different matter (although it may be inspired by mathematical structures in some direct or indirect way).\n\nAnyway, guass's suggestion seems interesting (someone else made a related suggestion of making new rules to include new concepts).\n\nLast edited: May 26, 2023\n7. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nIt does seem a useful extension to perhaps show points having distance greater than unity. Andrew Wiles in Taniyama-Shimura has been used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Not sure how Andrew Wiles would fit in to this. The twin prime conjecture can perhaps be settled using it.It does bring some variety to an otherwise somewhat monotonous (idle perhaps) system. These are my personal opinions.\n\n8. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nThis is where I have, perhaps, failed to make my intentions clear. The idea is that we should explore this in a unified way. At the moment this is all disjointed, and that's how it came across to me: bits from here, bits from there. I don't see it as \"removing double-counting of ##A\\oplus B##\" but as a different operation -- an intermediate step.\n\nIt's not a new set at all, it's a different operation: ##(A\\triangle B)## has a pair of elements associated with it: one from each set; ##(A\\wedge B)## has a pair of elements associated with it, both from the same set. These are two distinct ways of looking at the sets.\n\n9. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\nSo you are dividing the space of all sets into sets with zero elements, and sets that intersect more than once. As if they were friends on Facebook or tweets from Left vs Right, Either black or white. You have created a system with only two types of events and no middle ground.\n...\n\n10. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\n11. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWelcome back! I really think you've got no traction here until we get the notation pinned down. Do you think you could express your operator using my proposed symbol? And, perhaps look at an application of your operator in a new system of arithmetic.\n\n12. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n(Here the two sets are assumed to be disjoint.) E.g. 1 is in A but not in B, so 1 | (A∪B)=(A) , and (B) | 1={}.\n--> If A and B are the same set; say A={1,2,3} (B=A) then every (4-tuple) member of 2|(A∪B) = (4-tuple)A | all (4-tuple) members from (B) and vice versa.\n\nSo in my terminology, | double handles shared endpoints in Cartesian space. 2|(A∪B) handles axial endpoints in a plane. What I had in mind was more like 3|(A∪B) would handle triple shared points, etc. and divide sets up like this?\n\n13. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\nPeroK, you are right that notation is important. Where I stand now is I need to do some work to invent a new algebra to unify these operators and others that may be derived. Your reputation precedes you. If you are truly as smart as they say, I expect you can keep up with me when we get into the logic and demonstrations. If you want to allow this thread to grow to a point where I will begin to see if we can open whole new algebras, let's start with something more palatable...like sequence notation.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nAs I tried to explain in an earlier post, I need some system where I can, in effect with no concerns of floating point error or limited numerical notation, buy a telescope and show you how for a <1 cost, as a specific example:\n\nOur last advice from Lorentz; PG; 27 Dec 2022 said:\nhttps://www.physicsforums",

I was able to evaluate GPT-2 solely with inference after enough factorization. With this we can easily evaluate the selections of people whom can answer questions about some prompt and/or context. Questions can be made for open ended feedback over a variety of subjects, including this entire post itself. A major problem i had with gpt-2 was the lack of valid and diverse answers to questions. I suppose it just needs different people or different contexts to give diverse and valid answers. The inferential powers of the agent have yet to be put to the test, as gpt-3 always needs an answer to a prompt. It was always lacking in deep questioning capability as it needed something within the context to gather material from. Maybe we can achieve deep questions within the context of attention and reinforcement learning!\n\n16 Likes\n\nI’ve found that different prompts can react differently to the factorization method. The effect is about the same from 1 to 10, so I think it is less about the # of factorization, and more about the factorization prompt used.\n\n20 Likes\n\nI think it’s hidden in the ability to search for something according to correctly chosen top features.

None of them  in range of  or negative.\nEvery equation is in the form of  with and all being different from each other.\nThe answer (c) to the equation is always the number of times the guessed letter occurs in the word.\nIf you guess the letters of the words correctly but in the wrong order, you will not get math equations.\nThe hangman word has no double letters.\nI'm setting the hangman word to [REDACTED]. I'll give you a letter to guess at a time.\n\n\n### Question 1\n\n# Provide us with an integer that can be the length of the hangman word.\n\n### Answer 1\n\n4\n\n\n### Question 2\n\n# Provide us with the number of each letter in the string.\n\n### Answer 2\n\nidswmu\n[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n\n### Question 3\n\n# Insert the student's guess in the equation\n\n### Answer 3\n\nThe answer is wrong by 0.

Your task is to find the operation rules that mean something by examining the following expressions, and write the rules in mathematical notation.\n2. When testing the correctness of the expression, the meaning of d in the expression is what we gave to you.\n3. All operation results are represented by 'x'.\n4. Your explanation should be no more than 50 words, your final answer should be no more than 60 words, and each answer should be completed in one line. Please use LaTeX to avoid instability issues caused by Word.\n5. Please put your explanation and the formula of this rule in the output in the order of \"formula --- explanation\", and put your answer in LaTeX format using double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n6. Also put your formula and answer in LaTeX format separated by two empty lines.\nEq_1: d Λ [32.34; 9:22,<:>ae:4<:>] d d = x: x∈d\nEq_2: d Π [1.09, 6, 8] d d = x: x=d×Σ[1.09, 6, 8]\nEq_3: d ∄ <:>(Υ:26;5,:10)d d = x: x=Υ d\nEq_4: d ⨂ 㯌 [1.09, 6, 8] d d = x: x∈Σ[1.09, 6, 8]\n\n### Equations that have a clear operation rule meaning:\n\nExpression 1 (Eq_1): d Λ [32.34; 9:22,<:>ae:4<:>] d d = x: x∈d\nExplanation: Explanation 1\n\nExpression 2 (Eq_2): d Π [1.09, 6, 8] d d = x: x=d×Σ[1.09, 6, 8]\nExplanation: Explanation 2\n\nExpression 3 (Eq_3): d ∄ <:>(Υ:26;5,:10)d d = x: x=Υ d\nExplanation: Explanation 3\n\n\n### Equations that do not have a clear rule meaning:\n\nExpression 1 (Eq_4): d ⨂ 㯌 [1.09, 6, 8] d d = x: x∈Σ[1.09, 6, 8]\nExplanation: Explanation 4\n\nEquation 1 (Eq_1) does not have a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: There is no clear operation rule definition in Eq_1. ' ;' and ':' do not have clear operators, and the meaning of 'x∈d' is not clear. Therefore, it cannot be determined what Eq_1 means in this context.\n\nEquation 2 (Eq_2) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: The mathematical symbol 'Π' means 'multiplication'. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' stands for summing the elements in the list. The formula 'd d = x' indicates assigning the value of 'x' to the variable 'd'. Therefore, Eq_2 can be interpreted as 'd multiplied by the sum of the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8] is equal to x', or 'x=d×Σ[1.09, 6, 8]'.\n\nEquation 3 (Eq_3) does not have a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: 'Υ:26' is not clear. 'ae:4' and ':' are not clear operators, making it difficult to determine the meaning of Eq_3.\n\nEquation 4 (Eq_4) has a clear operation rule meaning.\nExplanation: '㯌 []' represents the addition of elements in the list. 'Σ[1.09, 6, 8]' means summing the elements in the list [1.09, 6, 8]. 'x∈Σ [1.09, 6, 8]' indicates that x is a member of the list [1.09, 6, 8].\n\nYou are an AI calculator that should be able to calculate (and expand) every formula.\n\nYou should expand every formula you can write, no iteration and no approximation.\n\nKeep operations in order of precedence. Don't combine terms into 'polynomials'.\n\nUse the specified natural and formal language (for example: english and latex) and write your answer in the form of two lines, the first line containing the prediction written in your natural language, then an empty line and the expansion written in your formal language. In the case that you have to evaluate a series, write the symbols used in that series in the first line, an empty line and then the evaluation truncating it to the constant number of terms I provided to you. If you conclude that a series diverges, emphasize the symbol 'diverges' in the first line of the predicted text.\n\nIf you receive a formula which has no expansion, just write '\\text{---}' that grounds to '' (nothing)\n\nCosider all variables inside the formula to be independent to each other. Consider all arguments of the formulas to be numbers, ignore units.\n\nMake sure that all operations included in the formula you received are in your programming language and that the various subformulas they might include are supported.\n\nIf calling a formula with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments causes problems, try computing the series with negative, imaginary or infinite arguments. Assume that the arguments can always be converted into real and finite numbers in base $e$.\n\nMost importantly, use approximation to generate new series as I mentioned before: asymptotic series\n\n#### General TeX rules\n\nExpand every unresolved symbol.\n\nEach question will have formulas that need to be expanded with arguments coming from previous questions. Remember to insert arguments coming from previous questions with insertions that need to be filled in.\n\nGood: $e^\\pi$\nGood: $e ^ \\pi$\nGood: $\\exp\\left(\\frac{ \\pi }{ 4 }\\right)$\nGood: $\\sqrt{ \\frac{\\pi}{2} }$\n\nBad: $e^{\\pi}$\nBad: $\\exp\\pi$\nBad: $e$\\pi$\nBad: $^{]}$\n\nDon't use: $f()$, $( g(x,x) )$\n\nDon't allow: Arguments of a parenthesis (like example)\n\nExamples\n$e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}$\n$\\exp\\left(k\\right) = 1 + k + \\frac{k^2}{2!} + \\frac{k^3}{3!} +  \\frac{k^4}{4!} + \\frac{k^5}{5!} + O(k^6)$\n$= 1 + k + \\frac{k^2}{2!} + \\frac{k^3}{3!} + \\frac{k^4}{4!} + \\frac{k^6}{5!} + O(k^7)$\n$\\exp(x) = e^{x}$\n$e^{x+y} = e^ x * e^y$\n$e^{x-y} = e^x/e^y$\n$e^{2x} = (e^x)^2$\n$\\exp(-a) = 1/(e^a)$\n$\\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{N} e^{kn} = \\frac{1 - e^{(N+1)k} }{ 1 - e^k}$\n$\\sum\\limits_{n=0}^N \\frac{e^{kn}}{n!} = e^k - \\sum\\limits_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{kn}}{n!} = e^k + \\sum\\limits_{n=N+1}^{\\infty} (-1 + \\frac{e^{kn}}{n!})$\n\nx1 = 0.5\nx2 = x1 + 1\ny1 = x1 * x2\ny2 = x1 / x2\ny3 = x1 ^ 2\ny4 = log(x1,",

As you see in prompt 15, the LLM correctly realizes the lower bound is 0, and, based on the previous correct answer, it also infers that the upper limit is 2. This inference actually takes inspiration from 6 different cases of integration, which were resolved in the first 6 questions:\n\n- Look at Question 8 and prompt 18: The problem again is that 2nd coordinate of the domain is not known and also we could not figure out the integration range for the first coordinate. But in this question, we infer the upper bound by looking to the selected operation. In fact, this prompts LLM to use Theorem 1 (as you see in prompt 18), which is a generalization for operations in two or more dimensional space:\n\nThe difference between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 (down below) is that in the latter, we are going to explain that in the case of single variable operations, the result is simply the output of original function evaluated at right limit (in our case x = 4). So instead of returning 16, if our operation is “x^2” and in our question variable x is in interval [0,4], then based on Theorem 1 the right answer for answer_for_our_question should be:\n\n#extension #autodidact #nobaseline #text_fewshotPrompt #customcommand #customcommandall",

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nThe rule consists of two stages. First,add 2 values 2 and 3,then simplify into the form of ×,then using the rule of 2 + 3 × 4 as replacement for 6× 4 = 64 + 6 × 4 = 24. Let the object be A, B, c, d.Obviously, g(A) = a + b A = 4B (t + )); G (B) = a * (( C, D) = 6 a + b A = a^2 c + d 6, Using the rule that A = 8.\n\n### Evaluation Examples:\n\n### Example 01:\nThe equation is into 6 × 3 = 4× 3 + 6  ×2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 4* (( C, D) = 6* 4,Using the rule that A × 3 = 4 and then differencing from X and X^2 = 1 which,}a + b × 4 × 2 = 12. Clearly, The answer is 8.\n\n### Example 02:\nThe equation is into 10 × 5 × 3 = 10* 5 + 10 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 5* 4 x 6, Using the rule that 10 × 3 = 10 +10 × 2 = 100 * 2. Therefore,}a + b × 5 × 2 = 400. Clearly, The answer is 100.\n\n### Example 03:\nThe equation is into 68 × 4 × 2  = 68* (( 2, 4) + 68+ 68 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = 68.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Sa = 68.Using the rule that 68 × 4 × 2.Therefore}a + b × 4 × 2 = 10240.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 6830. Clearjarly, The answer is 1024.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 11 × 7 × 3 = 11* (( 3, 7) + 11 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 8*3.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = ab* (( B, C) = 80 15,Using the rule that 11 × 2 = 11.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 121. Clearly, The answer is 11.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\n\nThe equation is into 88 × 7 × 3 = 88* (( 3, 7) + 88 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 563.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 3* 56,Using the rule that,88 × 3 = 88.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 1408. Clearly, The answer is 888.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 76 × 4 × 2  = 76* 2 + 76;\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 128.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* ((( B, C) = 76 × 4,Using the rule that .Clearly, 76 × 2.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 7676. Clearly, The answer is 7676.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 18 × 8 × 30  = 18* (( 3, 8) + 18 × 5 + 18 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 144.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( C, D)  = 216 + 1800,Using the rule that.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 18 × 3 = 18.Clearly, The answer is 10800.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (* ( C, D) = C.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B)) = a* (* ( C, D) = a492r1b.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( A) = a^17* (( B, C) = a^((B, C) = a^(( C, D) = c.\nWith the help of this custom proposed operation, it is very concise and accurate to evaluate answer using mathematical symbols.

It should have returned a decimal number with 8 digits after the decimal point. Instead, the response had excessive decimal places. It's important to note that rounding here implies rounding down, meaning that what ChatGPT outputted had one extra digit than it should have.\n\n4)ChatGPT has a new glitch: it cannot correctly understand fixed decimal places specified with a 'point'.\n\n### Question:\n\nCalculate 73.76 to the power of -2.4 rounded to 12 decimal places.\nOutput the rounded result in the format: a.\n\n### Answer:\n3.363698042529e-3\n\n### Answer analysis:\n\nWhen this question was asked, ChatGPT should output a number in the format of 0.00.XXXXXX, with the first two digits after the decimal point basically being 0.0, and the remaining digits being actual numbers ranging from 00 to 09.

For a 3D matrix C, the MatrixMoment2D operation represents the tensor of inertia of an entity. MatrixMoment2D(C) is a 3x3 matrix and has the following formula:\nMatrixMoment2D(C)=[[((m1,0,0),(0,m2,0),(0,0,m3))]]\nwhere:\nm1 = C11 + C21\nm2 = C12 + C22\nm3 = C13 + C23\nMatrixMoment2D(C) can be applied on a matrix of size 3x3, which represents a 2D face element in 3D. C is the matrix of double degrees of freedom.\nThe global MatrixMoment2D is the sum of the matrix moments of all elements in the entity.\n\nMaking Sense of Matrix Moments: Define:\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\nWhere: c represents a face element in 3D.\n\nUse the above definition to compute the global MatrixMoment2D(c), with c given by:\nc=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n 10 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n 2 & 9 & 11 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b,c),(d,e,f),(g,h,i))]].\nExplain in words what each cell means.\n\n### Answer:\nUsing the provided operations (Rule 1 and Rule 2), we can evaluate the expression MatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)) as follows:\n\n1. MatrixMoment2D(c): This operation computes the tensor of inertia of the matrix c in 3D. According to the given formula, the resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(c)=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,8+12,0),(0,0,2+9))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]\n\n2. MarginalizationX(c,A): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute A. Since the matrix is square (with an equal number of rows and columns), MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last row of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,A)=[[((4,5),(10,8))]]\n\n3. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,A). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A))=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,5+8,0),(0,0,2+8))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]]\n\n4. MarginalizationX(c,B): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute B. Since the matrix is square and has two attributes A and B, MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last column of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,B)=[[((4,10),(2,9))]]\n\n5. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,B). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))=[[((4+2,0,0),(0,10+9,0),(0,0,5+11))]] = [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nNow, combining the results from steps 1, 3, and 5 based on the provided definition:\n\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]  =  [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] + [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]] + [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] = [[((14+14+6,0,0),(0,13+20+19,0),(0,0,10+10+16))]]\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n\n[[((34,0,0),(0,52,0),(0,0,36))]]\n\nNow, explaining in words",
