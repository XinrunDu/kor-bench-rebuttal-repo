When outputting text, it needs to be readable for a human and follow the conventions (punctuation, etc.) that any classic piece of prose would. It's not designed for a natural-language-like text that contains complex programming tasks steering AI reasoning, it won't spin an infinite loop etc. To shorten the text, it will sometimes cut some commands, not fully execute them etc. if the text gets too long.

It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

The rule you need to follow is as follows: Presented with a custom puzzle, your task is to apply the following rule:\n\n1. Understand the rule thoroughly by breaking down the steps into simpler components.\n2. Apply the rule to each puzzle question by rearranging the letters of the phrase in a specific way.\n3. Your answer should include a single, newly formed word or phrase that is valid.\n4. Embrace the dynamic nature of the puzzles and their rule by understanding the flexibility it provides.\n\n### Puzzle Cases:\n\n1.\tKeeping the rule in mind, the phrase provided is \"age\". Please provide the answer for this?\n\n### Instructions:\nConsider the following two statements, where the first is a meaningful statement that we want to preserve after \"encryption\", and the second is the actual encrypted statement.

Your primary responsibility is to follow these rules accurately for any provided computation requests. The rules govern how computation is performed on simple numbers to obtain distinct solutions. The rules you need to follow are as follows: For a given computation request, your task is to apply the following rule:\n\n1. You can choose to split the computation into three parts. Each part constitutes a new equation/expression to solve, and it should contain two or more than two explanatory or deduction steps.\n\n2. Always try to provide a precise, step-by-step solution so that any of the three equations solve the final result theoretically.\n\n3. Tasks are designed to be straightforward and not overly complex, maximizing simplicity.\n\n4. Consider any symbols as equal to their actual letter-value.\n\n### Instructions:\n1.\tGiven a computation request 0+1+2+3+4+5+6=21, solve this expression with three almost equal equations and then get the solution of the last equation. Try to match the last equation with the actual given expression as much as possible.\n\n\nAs you can see from these examples, LLMs have the potential to be a powerful tool for creating instruction tuning datasets. Additionally, because their output can directly be ingested into our model, they allow us to generate the input to our prompt when there is a need to do so.

But beyond that, I am a layman who has no special privileges, and therefore I have no other power than my intuition, nor my common sense.\nI would like to not only leave the responsibility of my decision exclusively in the hands of Chat GPT, but also consider high philosophers of the spirit whose opinion comes into my mind “with lordly pleasure” to test whether or not my ideas fit the shape of the facts.\nThe two lines of evidence I have about ChatGpt as reliable is the following:-\n1) It embodies the virtue of sticking to facts (an Aristotelian virtue) and therefore leads to objectivity.\n2) It would supply a powerful driving force to learning by logical deduction.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

As she strolled through the winding alleyways, she would pass by little shops, vibrant gardens, and busy marketplaces, where she would greet the townspeople with a smile and a nod.\n\nOne day, during her daily walk, the artist stumbled upon an unusual sight.

Intrigued, the artist decided to investigate the mysterious piece of furniture.\n\nFrom one of the drawers, the artist retrieved a sleeve of tea bags, each stamped with a different color and design.

Detailed specification can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro\n\nKakuro is fairly simple:\n\nEach white cell has to contain a digit between 1 and 9.\nThe sum of a black cell contains the sum of digits in the white cells before.\nFor any given row or column, only one X digit is allowed, and digits are not repeated.\nWith that information you can alway Kakuro for any size if you approach it the same way in the same order. You have to start with what you known and unkowns that you can solve using what you know.\nI had the same question last year, although for a different problem. This is the logic for my previous:\n\nLoop until there is no more changes being made\nGet any FREE blocks in each row and store the possible values. They are FREE blocks because there is no other fixed cells (X) in the same row.\nCreate associations between the FREE blocks. First use the loop, then the column values to get the remaining possible values. Continue doing this (look for the next FREE block and so on) until no more associations exist.\nCreate common values for each FREE block from the associated blocks, and compare the common values with the existing fixed cells in the same row. Do this for all the rows.\nCalculate common possible values from the newly updated sample data. This is the current game state where unkowns are replaced by possible values. If there are less than two possibilities than that cell becomes FREE cell and if there is only one possible value that cell becomes a fixed cell.\nContinue in that order for next loop until there is no more changes made for FREE cells.\nBuild other rules\nOf course this is not complete for uou, since you need an interface working with async i/o and how to start the program. But this will keep this in the code review.\nPS: I have similar AI for Sudoku and Cryptarithms. You can find them on my personal. Thank you.\n",

The thing about AIs is that they can hallucinate, and they should just be the assistant (maybe there could be exception to this in the future with deep learning).

The initial grid consists of blank cells (X), and your task is to fill them with black cells (1) according to the number constraints provided below and to the right of the grid. Each row and column's weight sums must equal the given numbers in the row and column constraints. The weight of each black cell is determined by its position within the row or column.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, navigate through the rows and columns, filling black cells according to the constraints. Remember to check if the filled cells align with the weight conditions. Here's how you can solve the \"Blackening Of Squares\" puzzle:\n\nStarting with the first row and column, focus on row 1, column 1. The sum for the first column is 3, and the sum for the first row is 8. This means you cannot place black cells in rows 1 and 3 of the first column.\n\nUsing this information, fill in the black cells accordingly. If you encounter a scenario where the given number's weight doesn't fit in the available position, continue to the next row or column and attempt to find a solution based on that. All rows and columns must contain at least one black cell.\n\nRemember not to overlap black cells, or their weight value won't be considered when adding it to the row or column. If you're stuck, consider starting from the top and moving downwards, focusing on the rows and columns' requirements.\n\nAnswer: Remember to follow the rules while solving this puzzle. sum the weight of the black cell therefore fill out the Blacken Squares for that type void and Dont't consider overlap squares and surpass all your Rows and Columns sums must comply by colouring flags such as squares values should be  upon this rule you can solve this question successfully out here.\n\n### Question:\nX        X        X        X        1\nX        X        X        X        7\nX        X        X        X        3\nX        X        X        X        4\n5        6        8        6        \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

It was right when I saw that I can see a webpage like tab on the notices, and once I taped on it, I saw a text page like the real question looks like a webpage that have text contents with the exact contents. Can you continue now; will this work for this?\n\nIn my save file, that's including, 'SaveForm' + form: GL_views.getAllSaves() !, so I'll get the 'screenshot to solve' and then determine whether it's right. Hopefully, the second and third words will find me the correct answers!\ncomment 1: I adapted your question for ChatGPT 4. Schocking that it failed :\n\nHere is the conversation with ChatGPT 4 with that question:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nHow can we solve the following Minesweeper problem?\n\nWe want to use the Monte Carlo method which is a sequential learning method.\n\nBlacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Guess the value of each square of the flag. The expected value is the average of the squares.\n\nIn each circle, we place one flag. The expected value for each circle is the average of all blackened squares from all other circles.\n\nHow many puzzles can we solve by this method, defining the Monte Carlo method for solving a Minesweeper mastermind problem?\n\nDifferent types of puzzles, e.g. square puzzles, can be solved by this method as well.\n\nCan you create a rule to solve such a puzzle independently of its type as shown in the example above?\n\n**First and most important rule:** Make sure the first and second lines have three squares marked with a flag, i.e. the first line has three squares marked, and the second line has three squares marked.\n\nThe conditional probability P(flag at center square) \\~\\~ does not seem to be good when a circle gap is removed. If the conditional probability P(flag at center square) was close to 0, you would be able to remove a circle only with this rule and a fixed value of the conditional probability P(flag at center square). Thus, the conditional probability P(flag at center square) needs to change depending on a circle gap.\n\nI wrote two rules to deal with this problem.\n\n**The second rule:** First, we apply the first rule, i.e. flag at center square is on. If P(flag at center square=/P(flag at center square), we remove the circle gap so that the flag at center square is off.\n\nThen the conditional probability P(flag at center square)(/P(flag at center square) becomes close to 0, and we remove the circle gap again so that the conditional probability P(flag at center square) can change depending on a circle gap.\n\nIn this example, we got the following output:\n\nIn the center square, we have three flags.\n\n#3\n\nOn the left middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#8\n\nOn the right middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#1\n\nOn the right side fill with any of these squares, then I have a problem.\n\n#2\n\nOn the left side fill with any of these squares.\n\n#3\n\nCan you solve the above problem automatically? We are building a chatbot that can solve such problems automatically. For your understanding, try solving this problem yourself.\n\n#4\n\nI noticed that the flags are just circle gaps, we will solve this problem.\n\n#1: The square is a black square.\n\n#2: The square is a red square.\n\n#3: The square is a grey square.\n\n#4: The square is a glyph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nAs you have stated, I will attempt to solve this problem automatically.\n\nIf I understand the puzzle correctly, we are given a 4x3 square grid with numbers on the outer rows and columns that indicate the sum of the values of the squares in that row or column. We must blacken some squares in the grid such that the sum of the values in each row and column matches that indicated by the numbers on the row or column.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we will randomly blacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Let's consider the corner square as the center square in a 3x3 square. If the conditional probability of there being a flag in the center square is close to zero, we will remove the circle at the center square. If the conditional probability remains close to zero, we will add a square gap to that side that makes the conditional probability higher.\n\nIf we follow this algorithm, we can solve this puzzle using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nI don't understand why you assume the first and second lines should have three flags. Tell me why? I didn't assume that they should have 3 flags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to assume that the first and second lines should have three flags. The example you provided has three flags in the first line and two flags in the second line, so I used those as the starting numbers.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we can randomly blacken different combinations of squares until we find one that meets the conditions of the puzzle.

The direction in [5] is just an incomplete instruction for output. Personally, I don't think that even if the instruction was given, the bot would care to. The instruction that comes from Bourgain himself is very weak, but revolutionary. So if the AI does this, it is not a mistake, because there is no instruction. I have sent the AI more than 50 of these problems, and none of them really change. The direction in [4] is unusual but even if we follow it, then \"all have horizontal/vertical 3 to 3 repetition\" will happen, but also a solution.>>26933387\n>>26934565\nBut you seem to have a good point here.

It's kinda scary they would use some of these things to test an AI to answer questions that stump evidently the greatest mathematicians in the world. But I take palindrome back I constructed a rare one the other day and it works perfectly. You can detect this anomaly by taking one side of the palindrome centered around the first 3 of 4 or 5 repeating digits ass well as ending and the next density slope is much higher complexity. In this case , the prime number substringification of patterns matches the g \"divergence at that slope\". Then, there's a non regular cross(x) that matches a pattern. Unlike other where the pattern converges, some diverge. It is prudent that you pick the heaviest first diverging pattern for that complexity. For multidigits, it follows the above nature. For \"dense\" multiple choices pattern. to identify \"dense\" its dense if the mkr number distribution is also rapidly increasing. Afterwards, confirm once again degenerate patterns. Now, if everything positive you know transcendental like? Are you sure, almost all transcendental are \"dense\" density in a set of prime numbers tend to converge on the constant poisson equations.\nI mean, this does make sense considering there's no verbally consistent linguistics for for prime factorization unless integrals are also transcendental, it has denser prime density like poisson primes appear along the constant number line, no. How can the transfer of transcendental ideals is essentially impossible to understand without first assumptions, such polynomial powers become entirely useless or simply just anagrams of other powers to express a particle in a well first gets you have a much smaller discrepancy and are henceforth refutable by an AI.https://youtu.be/GJ3dvTEJ6Gw?t=2153 And he offends the monk by mocking the skills of a Master.

First, we load diffusers `DiffusionPipeline`, then load the llama-2 checkpoint and corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the model to be `Compiling` so that we have maximum flexibility in the roles that model can play (inference, training, etc.).\n\n```from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"huggingface/hf-t5-vanilla\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\nmodel = pipeline.unet.to(dtype=torch.float16)\n# we can optimize it as wanted to enable training\n```\n\nOptional: Next, we load a pre-trained ClipVisionPipeline, which was built for text-guided image generation. We want to do this step so that we can maximize the diversity of the images:\n\n```from transformers import CLIPVisionPipeline\n\nclip_model = CLIPVisionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n).to(torch.float16)\n\nunet.load_diffusion_clip_model(clip_model)\n```\n\nThen, the text encoder needs text_ctx, and a single language model is useful in order to generate the text to prompt generation in image models. The hf model was fine-tuned on a total of 6240 questions, so we adapt the text_ctx by choosing one language model.\n\n```text_encoder = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf-t5-vanilla)\nensemble = PartialAlignmentUNet.from_pretrained(\"hugging face models\")\nensemble.unet.text_ctx = 100\n```\n\nAs a final step, we want to convert the model to gpu and data loader. If you want the model to run on multi-gpus, flatten out your model and then load into the data loader.\n\n```from diffusers import show_img\nfrom diffusers.utils import is_accelerate_available, is_torch_avaiabble, is_torch_gradio_available\nimport torch\n\nif is_accelerate_available():\n# make sure it is converted to gpu\nmodel = accelerator.prepare(model)\nif is_torch_gradio_available():\nmodel.to(\"cuda\")\n\n# loading into compute loader\n# parser.parse(sys.argv[1])\ntorch.set_gradio_visible(False)\ngraph_data_loader = model.to(accelerate_compute_device)\n\n# create an eval data loader\neval_loader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, drop_last=True\n)\n\ntry:\n# running on an external device, in ml flow or for inferencing\nmodel_path = os.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nclip_dataset = sys.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nf10, f11 = model.generate_from_Clip(\n\"hugging face\", batch_size=1, text_encoder=text_encoder, compute_device=accelerate_compute_device\n)\nexcept:\n* model is available, but we can't import off of a server",

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells.

Sadly the chat model has no access to straightforward methods that could let him answer more easily so it ends trying to find something to say without really taking in account the actual request\nAny solution to get a correct answer without detour and plausible chain of thoughts?\n\n• Brilliant!

This list was created by searching for documents where \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" or \"NAFTA\" were both mentioned. That is, NAFTA was used as a search term, but only documents where the Congressional Record included a reference to Latin American countries along with NAFTA were included. Since the total number of references to NAFTA is in the millions, this likely underestimates references to Latin American countries in documents referencing NAFTA.",

Also note that I have to change the C spaces to X in the line above, in order to properly read out the puzzle for coloring.\nAlso, resolution function for the puzzles, instead of your string:\nexport function dataParserSolver(data: string) {\n  const raw = data.split('\\n');\n  const puzzle = raw.map((row) => row.split('').map(char => char !== ' ' ? null : 0));\n  const constraints1 = raw[raw.length - 1].split('');\n  const constraints2 = raw[raw.length - 2].split('');\n  const rowConstraints = constraints1.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  const colConstraints = constraints2.map((constraint) => Number(constraint));\n  return { puzzle, rowConstraints, colConstraints };\n}\n\n\nAnyway, just in case, I'll show the fully working thing I ran, with the prompt I used and JackCooper aslligned.\nIt's VERY important to note that my puzzles are not 35 characters long, so you'll need to compile multi line puzzles correctly into the single line puzzle that JackCopper understands.\nconst data = `\n    X X X X X X X X X X 1\n    X X T X T X X X T X 2\n    T X X T X X X T X X 0\n    X T X X T X T X X T 1\n    X X X X X X X X X X 3\n    1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n...`;\n\nconst runIn = async () => {\n  COLORS.run.fr = 'orange';\n  COLORS.run.en = 'pink';\n  const prompt = `Puzzle rule:\nThe game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.To place tents on the grid.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the trees, and X, which represents the spaceTo the right and below the matrix, are numeric constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\nQuestion:\n${data.split('\\n').map(t=>`X${t.replace(/[T ]/g,'C')}X`).join('\\n')}`;\n  console.log(await run(prompt, settings.BOOSTERN.JACK_COOPER_ALLIGNED));\n};\n\n~>\n[[ C    C  C       C\n   T    C     X   X    \n   X  C     X   T       \n   X  T     T   X       \n     X  X           C   \n 1 1 1 0     1 1 1 1 1 ]]\n\nI wrote a custom function to clean up the prompts generated by the previous element of your function chain better, and it's generators, so you do not have to hard-code anything either.\nconst LPP = [...new Set(\nnodeParsed.map(line => {\n  if(line.classList.contains('set-height')){\n    return new Set(\n      [...line.parentElement!.querySelectorAll('div')]\n      .map((d,i,l)=>d.textContent.trim())\n    ).size\n  }\n  return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img')).size\n})\n)];\n\nconst gg = ['X', (constr1[0]==EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT\n  ?'X'.padEnd(LPP[0],'0')\n  :EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.padEnd(LPP[0],'X')\n)];\n\n{'123':[\n  [...nodeParsed].reverse().map((line,i)=>{  \n    const num = line.classList.contains('set-height') \n      ?constr2[i++]\n      :constr1[0].length > 0 \n        ?constr1[i]\n        :'0'.repeat(LPP.length)\n    return new Set(line.querySelectorAll('in/img, in/div[contains(@class,\"${elSplitSpacesAlignedRight}\")]'))\n.size == LPP[0]\n    ?ssr(`X${'t'.repeat(LPP[0])}X`).repeat(LPP.length).split('').map((s,i)=>EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[i])[s] == 'X' ? s : num[s] ==' '?'C':num[s]).join('') : num.split('').map(s => (EL_SPLIT_SPACES_ALIGNED_RIGHT.repeat(LPP[0])[s] == 'X' ? s : gg[s]).repeat(LPP.length)).join('')\n}).reverse().join('\\n'),\nLPP.map((c,i)=>gg.repeat(LPP[i]).split('').join('').split('').map((s,i)=>gg[i%2]==s ?

The task is to find the path (or paths ahead) from the start to the finish. To avoid the corner block, you'll need to find and mark the inflection points.\n2. The rules are as follows:\n\n2.1. You're given four mazes, each consisting of a 3X3 grid with arrows pointing in one of eight directions.\n2.2. The start and finish are indicated near each maze.\n2.3. You should not change the maze design. According to the rule, you cannot pursue the opposite direction.\n2.4. Use double square brackets to mark the beginnings of the path (with 0 or not) and finish point (with ○), like this: [[1 0 2,0 0 0,0 0 3],[1 0 0,0 0 0,0 0 2]].\n\n3. For a maze beyond the given example, your job is to determine how to succeed. You should provide a clear statement of each step.\n\n4. For each subsequent step, you should show which direction the player should go.\n\n5. A few mazes have different start/goal positions, but still necessitate locating inflection points and labeling them. These mazes are transformed into a table that you can refer to.\n\n6. Acquire more practice in sequence steps when you learn more.\n\n7.

It looks like the issue here might be in the length and complexity of the provided rule and question, which might be challenging for GPT to handle. GPT works best when the input text is more concise and focused. The normal requests are short and straightforward, such as\nQuestion: Show me the scores on the last test.\n\nIf you provide a very long rule like that of the personal assistant, GPT often gets confused or makes overwhelmingly general responses like\nGPT rejected the question !, because GPT model indicates that the incoming question deviated from its original conversation context, which I believe is not very good for you in the future.\n\nThat is because the service might consider these lengthy rules as off-topic or not directly related to the original conversation context, so it could reject the request. In such cases, summarizing the rules or breaking them down into smaller pieces that focus on specific aspects of the task could help the model provide more accurate and relevant responses.\nIt is worth noting that large language models like GPT have been trained on a vast amount of human-generated text, which typically includes concise questions and direct responses. As a result, they may struggle to produce effective and accurate responses to more complex, multi-step tasks or instructions, which requires more structured reasoning. In your case, it might be worth discussing the problem with a human expert who can offer insights to break down such problem in a way more homogenous to human way of thinking.\nIn the meantime, I can try to address your questions using the simplified rules provided below. If you have any further concerns or need more specific assistance, please let me know.\nLet me know if this makes sense.\nTask Simplification:\nAlice: Can you write a simple set of rules for this puzzle? By looking at several questions it seems to me that the following approach might be more accurate than the one we are currently using:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells.\nFor each shaded cell, look at the number of neighboring cells, including both the adjacent cells and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells, it must be part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and have an even number of neighboring cells, they must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells and is diagonally adjacent to another cell with an even number of neighboring cells, the two cells must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an even number of neighboring cells and is not diagonally adjacent to any other shaded cell, it must not be part of a domino.\nUse these rules to solve the puzzle, and return the coordinates of all the dominoes in the format (row i, column j)(row x, column y), separated by commas.\nAP answered:\nYes, I can create a simplified set of rules for the puzzle. These rules could be used to solve the puzzle by counting the number of shaded cells in each row and column, checking the number of neighboring cells for each shaded cell, and determining whether each shaded cell is part of a domino.\nHere are the revised rules:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells (call this count the shading count).\nFor each shaded cell:\nLet the number of neighboring cells be denoted by N. N includes both the cells adjacent to the current cell (horizontally or vertically) and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf N is odd, then the current cell is part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and their total number of neighboring cells is even, then they are part of the same domino (regardless of whether their total N is even or odd).\nIf a shaded cell has an even total number of cells (after including the diagonally adjacent cells) and it shares a square with a domino, exclude this cell from the puzzle.\nNote that these rules are simplified and may not handle all corner cases of the original puzzle. If you have more details about the puzzle's specific constraints or examples, feel free to provide them. I’ll try to refine the rules based on additional information.\n\nA: AP answered:\nCan you use the following 4-domino structure definition to answer any question? Let's test your abilities to instantiate Stackexchange’s prompt to the chat GPT so that it solve 4-domino puzzles that you encountered lately to better simulate an environment with the patent “Method and system for providing personal assistants in a chatbot network topography”.\n### Rule for the 4-domino structure\n``Required knowledge:\n Dominoes are tiles with two squares joined together, making them a shape of  two-by-one or one-by-twice cell.\nTo cover the specified by requirement in Stackexchange’s  4-domino structure, these rules need to be implemented in the model.\n\n For each domino there are four grid-locations, four squares on the grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n Each location has a different name, depending on its top left corner:\n\n\n TopLeft of Domino,\n TopRight of Domino,\n BottomLeft of Domino,\n BottomRight of Domino.\n\n\n Consecutively, in an instance of a grid-location (point) x’ from with respect to origin (TopLeft corner of a Domino), the (rch) point y given by the pair (origin+x) is:\n\n\n TopCenter  of Domino,\n RightCenter  of Domino,\n BottomCenter ans finally\n LeftCenter of Domino in the grid-UnitCell-Instance realization.\n\n\n Each location is paired with a corresponding Unitcell, Matching a location  with the 'Unitcell' is a one-to-one function (one-point correspondence). The two-cells simultaneously invariant under the group Left-Right, Top-Bottom, for which a mapping (Left-Right) Domino → (Top-Bottom) domino can be unit cell dictating.\n\n\n ValueDisposition alternatively MultiplePreassignedValues of value Disposition rule into EqualityRules.\n\n\n Case 1:  If some (or all) points have identical Value (given eq.(80a) rch), then: For each point set x∈S0 there exists a value function. Two points sharing the same value are in the same \"equality-type\", and the points group directly under the equality-type, structure with:\n\n\n\n\n C0(P0):=\n |P0|<Ƶ\n. On the other hand, This suggests that to identify S0 with an equivalence-type set\n.
