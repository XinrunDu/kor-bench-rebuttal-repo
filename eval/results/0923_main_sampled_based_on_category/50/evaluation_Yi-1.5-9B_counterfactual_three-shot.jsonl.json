This plant is advertised as a stronger form of the common peashooter since it fires four peas at a time. This is a pretty overpowered plant. Unlike the common peashooter, Gatling Peashooter peanut cannot be upgraded. Gatling Peashooter is similar to Dinosaur Eggs an upgraded Gatling Pea, fossil box, and 30 bones (5x higher the collection and upgrade of Gatling Pea).\n\n### Instructions:\nEvaluate the following statement: Gatling Pea only works when planted on a peashooter, but brother is much more powerful than Gatling Pea.\n\n### Answer:\nGatling Pea is only available when planted on Peashooter, but it has stronger attack power. Dinosaur Eggs is Indiana Engor.\n\n### Question:\nUpgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro\n In order to upgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro, it is necessary to place a Peashooter in front of it and spend 80 Potato Puff power-ups, This requires 800 Pem and 6 packs of seeds per transfer The Gatling Pea does not form a plant buddy after transformation Various plants can go together in the same map. The pots of burned dirt can be burned with flamethrower or Mecha's beam to temporarily turn them into movable ground\n The Robin is first set to attack Zombie Clowns, and then multi-selects zombies with the highest defense. These include Spikerock, Doom Shield and Rollin' Ball, but not Zombies with a sun shield. The Basic version of Robin is good enough to replace Wall-nuts. The increased Diggler of Specimen XX can combine insect Irritate into the next mode when the target has been injured by at least 90%, making a double explosion that kills most Carets and Mini-Zombies as well as small meat shields and attackers.\n On the other hand, Specimen XX is also a plant that can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n Zombie scientists are mostly skill burners like Darwin's Potato Mine and Rootbeer Tapper, and Calamity Canary is a good counter-attack for Zombie Scientists. Specimen XX is compatible with Mable, in Mable's mode, Specimen XX's fart acts as a scarecrow that attacks zombies on the various irons of the map. Specimen XX can also cooperate with Snapdragon and Farb and can be carried after Physics Field upgrades. Specimen XX can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n New abilities:\n Zombie One can command garden zombies to grow their vegetables in the garden throughout the game, allowing them to plant plants and obtain resources;\n Farb cannot grow plants to within three rows of the Garden Gate. When Farb reaches the last row of the wall, this plant can be planted, which will cause conflicts with the evolution settings;\n Dr. Tomato is a new boss, Dr. Tomato's plant can evolve into a stronger Defender Tomato. Through defensive evolution, the plants become stronger, and the family becomes stronger, thus Dr. Tomato can enter, but after a long time of evolution, it will no longer be effective;\n The evolutionary rules are the same as before. By upgrading plants, regardless of plant buddies, one level of evolution will activate a level above its current level, and if they are not upgraded to a specific level, the plants will not evolve;\n The professional evolution will have many deadly turns at each level. It is best for Specimen XX to learn more about evolutionary resources and accompany Specimen XX.\n\n### Instructions:\nCan plants not be evolved?\n\n### Answer:\nNo\n\n### Question:\nCritters are cheap and powerful plants. They don't need a plant buddy they can return to the sponsor pool of each lane they kill by bullet-firing grass heads that shoot a huge number of bullets because the can pass through the right wall of light wavelengths. This makes it easy to block an attack even if they are both attacked by a standing group of zombies. However, at the beginning of the game, a single plant manages to block all zombie attacks with ease. When they are used, a thick fog surrounds them and the speed of the Zombies is slowed down.\n\n### Instructions:\nHow does Thistle Grass promote itself?\n\n### Answer:\nIt can kill zombies in order to return itself to the sponsor pool.\n\n### Question:\nYou are the king of the zombies.

The Krab restaurant, part of the Waitstaffer chain, ________ hours a day, _________ a day, ________ a year.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nEugene Harold Krabs, more commonly known as Mr. Krabs, is a miserly red crab who lives in an anchor with his daughter, Pearl, who is a young whale. He is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant.\nSpongeBob is a sea sponge with a rectangular shape, despite being designed to look like an actual kitchen sponge. He is light yellow with a light olive-green outline. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When SpongeBob puts tape on Karen's screen, her speech is muffled. This implies that her screen acts like a mouth.\nThe Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty. \nBikini Bottom is an undersea city where SpongeBob and his friends live. Boatmobiles are boat-shaped cars which are the main mode of transport for Bikini Bottomites. \nKaren Plankton is a waterproof supercomputer who lives in the Chum Bucket laboratory. She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. \nKaren reveals to Plankton that she ordered a baby for them, and a stork drone soon arrives at the Chum Bucket to deliver it. SpongeBob has the ability to filter-feed and reproduce by budding.\nPlankton advises Mr. Krabs to marry money; Krabs agrees if possible. That night, Krabs hears crying near Krusty Krab's bus stop. Investigating, he finds a money stack with a face, unaware it's a robot named Cashina controlled by Plankton. Krabs falls in love, proposes to Cashina, and she accepts. The next day, Mr. Krabs and Cashina are officially married after their wedding. The Krabby Patty formula is the sole property of the Krusty Krab and is only to be discussed in part or in whole with its creator, Mr. Krabs. Duplication of this formula is punishable by law. Restrictions apply, results may vary.\nThe Atlanteans traveled countless light-years from their home planet and brought the oldest living bubble on the journey, living over a million years. The Atlanteans took great advances in weapons, wealth, science, art, and things that people took for granted in Bikini Bottom today. The Weapons Vault contains all Atlantean-created weaponry, as the Atlanteans sealed away their entire arsenal to live in harmony with any sea life around them.\nIn 6188 B.C., Bikini Bottom population is 23. Seen on SpongeBob's license, on July 14, 1986, SpongeBob was born. Squidward was born on the same year.\nThe first Neptune dynasty takes throne of Bikini Bottom after the Krabs dynasty loses power (and the krabby patty recipe) in the 12th century.\nPrincess Pearl Krabs was a princess of Bikini Bottomshire sometime before the 12th century and is a medieval ancestor of Pearl Krabs. She first appears in the episode \"Dunces and Dragons.\"\nAlternate-Universe SpongeBob is a sea sponge who usually appears as a reflection of SpongeBob since he lives in a mirror and usually goes against the laws of reflections by not following SpongeBob's movement and instead behaving in his own manner, but sometimes exists in an alternative reality as his nickname suggests. He first appears in the episode \"Squid's Day Off.\"\nThe Bi-Annual Jellyfish Convention is a convention for Jellyfishers. It is located in a huge stadium and it has a big turnouts. \nEven though Squidward's name contains the word \"squid,\" he is an octopus, not a squid, as confirmed in many interviews and episodes. The series' animators illustrated Squidward with six tentacles.\nThe two begin capturing everyone with Sandy's net guns (intended for harvesting moon rocks), believing the citizens of Bikini Bottom to be aliens.\nThe Protogenerator 2000 appears to be a large machine that greatly resembles",
