As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\"\n\nThis information directly corresponds to option C: \"Ask a magician for a magic powder, sprinkle it into the sea when setting sail.\"\n\nWhile options A and B are reasonable in a non-magical world, they don't utilize the magical elements present in this story's universe. Option D could be feasible if we had information about a spell or magical ability to generate wind, but we don't have specific information about such a capability.\n\nGiven the explicit mention of Markl's magical powder for creating favorable winds when sailing, the most feasible option based on the story's rules and information is C.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n\n[[C]]",
