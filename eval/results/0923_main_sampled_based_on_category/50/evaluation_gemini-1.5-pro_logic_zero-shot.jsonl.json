A paired conjunctive term must include all propositional variables (or their negations) exactly once, arranged in ascending order. The given formula has conjunctive clauses but doesn't fulfill the criteria for paired conjunctive terms:\n    *  `(p∨r)` is missing `q` or `¬q`\n    * `(¬q∨r)` is missing `p` or `¬p`\n    * `(¬p∨q∨¬r)`  doesn't have all variables in their negated or non-negated form arranged in order. \n\n2. **Principal Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF):** PCNF requires the formula to be a conjunction of paired disjunctive terms.

This creates the paradox because these two confirmations seem intuitively contradictory.\n\n* **The given expression, `¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x))`,  is not a statement of confirmation.** Instead, it's an implication. It suggests that if there exists a `b` for which `¬B(b)` and `¬R(b)` are true, then the universal hypothesis `∀x(R(x) → B(x))` holds. This implication doesn't directly address the core issue of the BC Paradox, which is the conflicting confirmations.\n\nTherefore, while the expression relates to the concepts involved in the BC Paradox, it does not represent the paradox itself. \n",

This follows a syllogistic reasoning pattern. \n",

        "response": "[[E]] \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe given argumentation structure aligns with the *Contra- Method*. Here's why:\n\n1. **Initial Goal:** The aim is to prove proposition 'p'.\n2. **Assumption of the Contrary:**  It assumes the opposite of what we want to prove, \"Not p.\"\n3. **Demonstration of Absurdity:**  It establishes a logical flow where \"Not p\" leads to 'q'. However, 'q' is known to be false (Not q). This creates a contradiction or an absurd situation. \n4. **Conclusion by Negation:** Because the assumption \"Not p\" led to a contradiction, we conclude that \"Not p\" cannot be true. Therefore, we affirm the opposite, which is 'p'. \n\nThis process of proving a proposition by demonstrating the impossibility of its negation is the core of the *Contra- Method*. \n",

Learning striptease but not computers.\n3. Learning computers while resisting striptease.\n\nIt then argues for the truth of the third option by eliminating the first two as undesirable. This process of elimination is the core characteristic of the Elim- Method. \n",

This is a fallacy because there could be other reasons for Wang Meng to spend a long time online, as the example illustrates (his job). \n",

The original statement doesn't guarantee that a bonus is *only* given after completing a project, just that completing a project guarantees a bonus. Other scenarios for receiving a bonus might exist.\n* **IllTrans Method:** Similar to the above, this demonstrates an erroneous conversion of terms within the proposition.  The original statement implies \"all project completions lead to bonuses,\" but it doesn't mean \"all bonuses are a result of project completions.\" \n",
