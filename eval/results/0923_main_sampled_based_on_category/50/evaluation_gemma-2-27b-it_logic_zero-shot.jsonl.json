We can see that this disjunction covers all possible truth value combinations for p and q by either having both p and q true or p true and q false. Thus, it's equivalent to simply 'p', which means this equivalence is valid.\n\n2. **Sub-question (2):**\n    - The expression `(p&!q)|(!p&q)` represents XOR (exclusive OR), meaning the proposition is true when only one of the arguments is true.\n\n    - The expression `(p|q)&(!(p|q))` first joins p and q with OR, then negates the result and combines it with the original 'OR'. This structure aims to identify instances where only one of p or q is true, but in the process, it negates the entire joint proposition. This negation disrupts the XOR functionality, making this equivalence invalid.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more logic equivalences!\n",

Substituting this into the left side, we get:  (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n\n3. Using rule (5), we can distribute: ((!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n4. Simplifying using rule (2), we get: (!p | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n5. Using the Absorption Law (A | (A & B) ::= A) we get: (!p | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n6. Applying rule (5) again, we get:  (!p  | (q & (!p | r) ))\n\n7. Since !p | r is equivalent to p > r (rule (10)), and using the Distributive law once again, we get: (!p | (q & (p > r) ) )\n\n8. Applying De Morgan's Law and Distributive law, !p | (q & (p > r) ) is equivalent to (!p | q) & (!p | (p > r))\n\n9. Since (!p | (p > r)) is true by definition (anything OR True is True),  the whole expression simplifies to (!p | q).\n\n10. Using rule (10) again, we see (!p | q) is equivalent to p> (q|r) .\n\nTherefore, ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is **valid**.\n\n**(2)  !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)**\n\n* Let's analyze this equivalence using our rules:\n\n1. We know from Rule (11) that p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p)\n\n2. Substituting the definition of implication (rule (10)) gives us: !( ( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) )\n\n3. Using De Morgan's Law and Distributive Law we can simplify this to: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p)\n\n4. Applying De Morgan's Law again: (p & !q) | (q & !p)\n5. Using rule (5), we can distribute:  (p | q) & (!q | !p)\n\n\n\n6. The expression on the right side (((p|q)&!(p&q))) is equivalent to K ((p|q)&((!p | !q)))\n K using rule 5 for distribution and using rule 9: A & !A = 0\n   \n\n7. Since   K  (p |q) & ! (p & q) can be derived using distributive laws, the equivalence (p | q) & ! (p & q)::=:: ! (p = q) is **valid**.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is **[[A];[A]]**.\n",
