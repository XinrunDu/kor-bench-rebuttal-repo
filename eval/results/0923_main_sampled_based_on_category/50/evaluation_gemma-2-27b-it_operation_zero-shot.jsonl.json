Let's break it down:\n    * 25※X:  We need to figure out 25※X first.\n    * The result of 25※X then operates on 14 using the '※' operation.\n\n* **Applying the Rules:**\n\n    1. **25※X:** We don't know if 'X' is a multiple of 25 or vice-versa, so we need to consider both possibilities:\n\n        * **If X is a multiple of 25:**  25※X = 25/X + 2\n        * **If 25 is a multiple of X:** 25※X = X/25 + 2\n\n    2. **(25※X) ※ 14:** Now we need to apply the operation between the result from the previous step and 14.
