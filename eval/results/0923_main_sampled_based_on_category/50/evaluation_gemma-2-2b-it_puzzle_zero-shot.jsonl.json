There's a requirement that the grid consists of skyscrapers all placed on the grid.\n2. **Skyscraper Heights:** Skyscrapers have heights of 1 to the size of the grid and you cannot have two skyscrapers of the same height in the same row or column.\n3. **View Number of Skyscrapers:**  Each number on the side indicates how many skyscrapers one would see if you looked in the direction of the arrows, since taller buildings will be blocked by shorter ones. \n\n **Here's a breakdown of how to approach filling out this puzzle:**\n\n* **Row and Column Strategy:**  You'll need to analyze each row and column to identify potential placement of skyscrapers. \n* **Neighbor Comparison:** This is crucial. It involves comparing the heights of skyscrapers that are neighboring each other, as they will block each other. \n\n**Please provide:**\n\n* The specific rule for HOW the 'X' letters get filled in.
