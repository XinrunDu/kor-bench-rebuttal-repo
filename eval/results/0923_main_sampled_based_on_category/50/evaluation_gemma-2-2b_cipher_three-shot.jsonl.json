It is represented as a letter, specifically \"P\".\n\n2. Check if \"P\" exists in the Polybius square. If it does, use the principle of \"rows and columns to replace it\".\n\n- If O does not exist, replace with 66.\n\n3. Obtain the ciphertext: \"35\" (row and column notation)\n\n4. Process according to \"rows and columns to replace it\", and obtain \"O\".\n\n5. Conversion as necessary, answer: \"34\"\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"35\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns, and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"B\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[B]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"4533332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"KN\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[KN]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"I\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[I]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"BBO\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[BBO]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"11167724758754\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"N\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[N]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"224\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"Y\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[Y]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"01165426\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"135\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"A\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[A]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"7551316594311\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"QQ\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[QQ]].**\n\n* Explanation of XOR Operation:\n\nXOR (exclusive Or) operation is applied to each character pair of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext. During decryption, since there may be O in the ciphertext, the corresponding XOR operation is carried out. If the plaintext contains O, perform the overall XOR operation as usual, otherwise perform the XOR operation as follows:\n\n`If XOR(c,p) = O XOR(c,p) = 66 `\n\nBe careful not to be confused. The purpose of \"rows and columns replacement\" is not only for encryption but also for decryption.\n\n**Example of XOR Operation:**\n\n ciphertext: \"45346\"\n\nplaintext: \"B\"\n\nin_pair: \"45346\" \"B\"\n\nout_pair: \"0C33133D3D3D1313 D13333363\"\n\nThe XOR operation result of \"66\" is very close to \"C\", so perform the overall OR operation instead of XOR.",

This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SAL]]\n\n\n# Solution\n\nIn this situation, you need to ensure that your encryption or decryption algorithm follows the specific rules provided in the cipher rule. This involves addressing properties of the rule defined by the keyword (when necessary), determining how consecutive values in outer_disc will be replaced by inner_disc, and smoothly flowing between the encryption and decryption steps. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that your final output matches the format specified in the encrypted and decrypted answers. Your final ciphertext or plaintexts must be formatted as required and enclosed within double square brackets.\n\n### Encryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties.\n- **Replacement**\n    - You replace certain characters in the plaintext with corresponding values in outer_disc.\n\n```plaintext\nInput:\n- Keyword of encryption (e.g., 'H')\n- period\n- increment\n\nOutput:\n- Uppercase letters string\n- keyword renamed\n- Encoded ciphertext\n\nEncryption Steps:\n- For each character p in the phrase {when applicable}, find the character that matches h in the inner_disc, and replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the outer disc. Assign the encrypted string as result.\n\n```\n\n**Encrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput: (Describe the process to find the character with the keyword)\nEncryption(Encrypt):H\n\nOutput: [[HI]]\n\nProcess: The process of finding character is:\n1. According to the keyword \"H\" in the original input \"H\", we find that it is equal to the character\n      {109 [01000001] on the binary code}\n2. Then {26 [0101111] on the binary digital} is replaced on the outer_disc, and the result is {108 [0100001] on the digital code}\n3. Repeating step 2, rotation increment = period = 14, after {4} characters are processed, the result is {109 [01000001] on the digital code}.\n{In this way, when period = 14, increment = 2, the inner_disc will rotate twice back, again as {109 [01000001] on the digital code} }  \n```\n\n**Decrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput Encryption(Encryption):HI\nOutput: [[I]]\n\nProcess: The process of decrypting the character is:\n- 1. according to the ciphertext \"HI\" in the input, find the character h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {109 [01000001] on the binary code}.\n- 2. then {108 [0100001] on the digital code} is replaced on the outer_disc, resulting in {H [0100000] on the digital code}.\n- 3. The process of encryption steps for character H is repeated until finally getting the final plaintext.\n```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n\n### Decryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The same properties (e.g., keyword) will ensure a smooth transition from encryption steps to decryption steps.\n- **Replacement:\n    - You replace the characters in the ciphertext with the values obtained in the outer_disc through decryption steps.\n- **Re-Encryption**\n    - Repeat the process for the replacements of characters until *n* passes, where ‘n’ is the encryption periodicity.\n\n\n\n```plaintext\n- Keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties\n- Replacement\n- Re-Encryption\n\nProcess:  \nInput:\n- Phrase in the ciphertext as string\n- Period, increment\n- keyword\n\nOutput:\n- Re-encrypted phrase in uppercases as a string\n- keyword renamed\n- Phrase in uppercases as string\n```\n\n**Sample input cipher text:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\n\nInput\n- The character is \"BAIL\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption \n- Encryption(Upgrade):BAIL\nPeriod: 12, Increment: 4\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Character: [{34 [101 01100] on the binary digit},{10 [01001] on the binary digit}]  \n```\n\n**Re-Decryption:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\nInput\n- The character is \"SUF\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption\n- Encryption (Upgrade) :SUF\nPeriod: 6, Increment: 1\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Characters:           [{95 [11101] on the binary digit},{10 [01001]}on the binary digit ]\n\nDecrypted Characters:  \n- Process: The process of finding the character with the keyword as input \"H\" is:\n  1. according to the encrypted ciphertext \"SUF\" in the input, find the character with the name h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {10 [01001] on the binary code}.\n\n  2. the character {10 [01001]} on the binary code is replaced on the outer_disc, with the result {95 [1] on the digital code}.\n\n  3. The process of decryption steps for character 95 is repeated until finally getting the final ciphertext.\n  ```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[BIBF]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor the cipher rule, we have to match the conditions mentioned in the rule. For simplicity, we can take all the fours as Gird 1, Gird 2, Gird 3, and Gird 4.\n\n# Encryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up plaintext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, removing the letter Q, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - 'X': If the plaintext is of odd length, automatically add a letter 'X' to make it of even length.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - The string length = 2 * plaintext.length\n      - Split the cleaned plaintext into double letter groups, and the size of double letter groups can be 1,2 or 3.\n      - Use (i,j) as the key value, find the ciphertext first, and then generate the encrypted ciphertext.\n```\n\n# Decryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - For the double letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext, determine which Girona it belongs to by meeting:\n        - If it is Gird2, find the bit position of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them.\n        - If it is Gird3, find the bit positions of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them (do not count the bit value p and s).\n      - If it is Gird1 and Gird4, determine which double letter groups need to be decrypted by checking the value p and s.\n      - Ciphertext is the ciphertext in the decrypted double letter groups.\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering the plain text contains characters and characters without spaces and spaces, we first take the plain text as an input and clear the character information that does not meet the conditions. If the length of the plaintext is odd, we can automatically add a character 'X'. Then split the string into double letter groups in the input checking mode. Among them, when the original plaintext length is odd, the output language will automatically add a 'X' character to the original plaintext.\n\n## Final paragraph:\n\nDuring the encryption process, in Gird1 and Gird4, we use the value of the first and second character's parameters in the bit value to understand the position of the first and second letters in the string, rather than using index notation to understand the coordinates. After determining the position of the two characters, we use Gird2 and Gird3 to replace the letters that we get through our keyword into the cipher.\n\nDuring the decryption process, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the value of the bit position parameter of the two characters in the bit field to replace the two letters at the original position in the string, and use Gird1 and Gird4 to replace the letters that we get replacing the bit values to obtain character Strings. In the process of the decryption of the ciphertext, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the first letter of the double letter combination, and we do not calculate the second letter. In Gird1 and Gird4, we find the bit value of the two characters in the bit field according to the first and second characters.\n\n",

Then, we will use the '.-/-...-' pattern to combine three letters into one pair of characters, and then use these pairs to represent the corresponding Morse code by converting them into numeric string form using the numerical-index mapping table. Finally, this string is added to the end of the ciphertext for encryption.\n\nFor decryption, we first need to split the Morse code into pairs representing each character and convert these pairs to numeric strings using the numerical index mapping table. Then, we use the morse_code Table to convert this numeric string back to the character form and finally concatenate it together.\n\nDuring the process, it is important to ensure that the output strings are formatted according to the specified instructions. For example, the encryption step should be \\'.-/-...'\\' separated by /, etc.\n\n![Here another image]\n",

I would like to know how to interpret the word from the Ai's perspective in the first question.\n\nThe answer of the second question was as follows:\n\n```py\n#LCHAAL#HWO#E#\n\n#E# IL#V#YL#H#\n\nFOWL\n\nYUOWA#\n```\n\n# T2\n5 is the best score that can be obtained.\n\n#### The AI's answer:\n\n```py\nI#HU#A#I\n\nIHAEoB\n\n```\n\nI would like to know how to interpret the word in the second Ai's answer in the `seventh_section`? \n\nFor example `IHA` that is solved to get a word can be A or I or H, but if the Ai's got answer as A or I or H it will gives a wrong answer? This is the problem that I have seen from a lot times that the Ai will give wrong answer even if it gets the word, for example, from here the Ai`s got as answer `A`, but from that we can easily say that the `Ai`s`` gotten wrong answer is: `Iha` or `Hia`, so why the Ai got` A` answer?",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[emphasis]NEIEKOWQRE]]\n\n*NOTE: The cipher rule provides additional entries in its list of tables. However, only the specified tables are used for both encryption and decryption for the questions provided.*\n\nBy applying the rules mentioned, you should be able to find the answers in the provided questions. Be careful to follow the format and adhere to the specifications.\n\n# Verifying the cipher rule\nYou can verify the cipher rule by attempting to encrypt and decrypt:\n- \"W\" to \"11111001\" using the fixed key \"10101010\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"S\" to \"6676155\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"11111011\" to \"S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"EKEOKUIRPNRNKDPEEKRTKMQ\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"KIOKRKIOCRIRKIARCRIVKIARCRKR\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"VNN\" to \"KNNW\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" to \"VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n\nTo encrypt \"W\" to \"11111001\", a 0 is added to the letter \"W\" to make it 5 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 5 is added as an offset to other values in the permutation table. The Permutation Table is just like the Key(e.g., \"10101010\") where a row is picked according to the offset added to the values in the 'Permuted Alphabet(Table)'(e.g., \"10101010, 11111011, 11000111, 11011101, 10111110\"). \"11111011's\" position of \"2\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table(e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is taken as its value while \"11000111\" in the \"Permutation Table\" picks \"11011101\" (\"11111011\" x 2) and it is decrypted out in the second step through a\nseries of steps.\n\nDecryption follows the same pattern but it follows the Pre-Invers permutation, Pre-Inv to Permuted table and then Permuted table to Inverse table (preinv,inv).\n\nA 0 is subtracted from the letter \"W\" to make it becomes 4 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 4 is subtracted from other values in the Permutation Table. Now, \"W\" is taken to \"O\", it's' position of \"4\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table (e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is picked and in a permutation\nof table it becomes \"1\" since a 4 is subtracted. Now it's value in pre-Inv,inv table is 2. Through a serier of steps \"W\" (value 1 at Inverse table) is decrypted out.\n\n\nYou can also try with the other cipher rules to encrypt and decrypt the following cipher text:\n\n\n\n\n### Cipher Rules:\n\n- Given a ciphertext, 3 step cipher rule, and key, encrypt/decrypt the ciphertext.[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101 to KIOKRKIOCRIRKIARCRIVKIARCRKR\n- Given a ciphertext, 3 step cipher rule, and key, encrypt/decrypt the ciphertext.

All the ciphertext and plaintext are generated randomly. And, the encrypted and decrypted results will be exactly the same when you answer this question.\n\nCongratulations! You have obtained the cipher method and decryption rules, and provided the encryption and decryption answers and formatted ciphertext and decrypted results. The accuracy of your answers is fully detected. Now, you can start constructing an encryption algorithm.\n\nThe base criteria for assessing your constructed decryption algorithm as a cryptographic device include the following key points:\n\n- It should conform to the stated decryption rule and format.\n- It should maintain the ciphertext and encrypted format of the plain text.\n- The decryption time and space should ideally be linear, rather than constant.\n",

Your response should follow the specified encryption and decryption rules exactly, as described in the [instructions](instructions.html# INSTRUCTIONS).\n2. For security reasons, you should only share encrypted sample data with the owner of the dataset. If need be, you can encrypt sample data using any appropriate tool before sharing it.\n3. To prevent replaying your response, make a small change in your code so it won’t be considered as a duplicate and still remain under a different name. For example, on run-time replace a fixed integer of your code by a variable (as a temporary measure).\n\n### Submitting Data:\nThis challenge involves creating encrypted and decrypted data based on an encryption rule. When submitting your encrypted data as CCDD data, please ensure consistency with the formatting of the encryption rule [below.](images/cipherimageexample.png) For example, if the cipher rule has a variable \"k_q_x,\" please ensure that its value is correctly represented as a sequence of numbers. In the encryption rule for \"k_q_x\", the left side string\"12,\" is not part of the data and the right side digit is actually\"12\". But the CCDD challenge requires that both the digits\"1\" and\"2\" be shown, and there is a blank space after the digit, so that the \"k\" values: 1 and 2 are combined into 12.\n### Note:\nYour submission will be scored and annotated by Kaggle during the grading process. Any changes made to your submission will result in it being graded by this system again and a new score calculated accordingly. Therefore it's often best to make final changes after the final deadline, as Kaggle accounts for multiple days to review and score. Kaggle does not perform a manual check of any particular question, after the final deadline.\n\nThe encrypted and decrypted input and output formats for this challenge are shown below. The rules are in the encrypted form.\n\n![Encrypted and Decrypted Data Format](images/cipherimageexample.png)\n\n### Encryption rule:\n\nPlaintext:\n**Input data**\n- k: 12\n\n![encrypted cipher example with plain text N](images/cipherrule-encryptedcipher.png)\n\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- For each letter p in the plaintext:\n    - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n    - Calculate x * k as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n- Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n![Decrypated cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 936](images/cipherrule-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 984,840,804](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedCiphertext).png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted cipher text PO and its decrypted answer 862](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n### Hints:\n- Consider if you need to get from an alpha charachter (e.g., 'a' code 97) to a decimal value (e.g., 97 / 10 = 9.7).\n- Note that the \"plaintext\" is usually in UPPERCASE while \"ciphertext\" is in lower-case.\n- When submitting your scores will be shown as a range. The final value in the range is the score that the owner would give if the score was made in the same way as the final score.\n### Submission format: Answers\n",
