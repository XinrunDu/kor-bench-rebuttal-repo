However, here only specific terms (m0, m1, m3, m5, m7) are included. Also, there are a total of 8 possible terms of three variables, and we have only covered 5 terms.\n\nGiven that the PDNF should include all possible paired conjunctive terms for the formula to be a tautology and it doesn't in this case, the given formula does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nSince the terms included are explicit in their use of alternating true assignments (binary) and represent a true outcome negated to form a simple conjunctive term, we can safely conclude:\n[[B]]",

(p∨r)\n2. (¬q∨r)\n3. (¬p∨q∨¬r)\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Disjunctive Terms\nEach clause must be made exclusive by considering the other variables' true/false states, ensuring each term is a paired conjunctive term.\n- In (p∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: pq¬r (101), p¬q¬r (100), pqr (111), and so forth, covering terms where either p or r is true.\n- In (¬q∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: p¬qr (110), p¬q¬r (100), ¬p¬qr (010), and so forth, covering terms where either q is false or r is true.\n- In (¬p∨q∨¬r), all combinations where not all literals are false (¬p, q, ¬r specifically).\n\n### Step 3: Combined Term Truth Assignments\nFor the formula to be in principal disjunctive normal form, each conjunctive term in a complete disjunctive form must involve every possible combination of variables in either their normal or negated states once. However, from the formula's structure, not all combinations are represented; for example, combined terms need to allow for every possible value assignment to p, q, r to be accounted for in the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nGiven the distinct clauses do not cover absolutely every possible pairing of p, q, r (e.g., ¬p¬q¬r not directly represented unless deduced through complex Boolean algebra), we find:\n\n### Conclusion\nThe formula cannot be exactly framed into either a principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form as it doesn’t include all exclusive possible assignments of variables p, q, and r (all 2^n combinations of the variables) distinctly. Each term isn't neatly a paired conjunctive term given overlaps and missing explicit representations of some states.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify formulas that are designated as basic forms and also satisfy the conditions of being all-even forms.\n\n1. **Basic Form Criteria**: A formula A is a basic form if its principal disjunctive normal form includes the paired conjunctive term m0. The term m0 corresponds to a true assignment where all propositional variables are false (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0).\n\n2. **All-Even Form Criteria**: A formula A is an all-even form if the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even numbers. \n\nWe now need to consider how many formulas satisfy both conditions:\n\n- For a formula to be a basic form, it must include the m0 term.\n- For a formula to be an all-even form, it can only include terms like m0, m2, m4,... etc. It must exclusively use even indices.\n\nSince m0 is already required for a formula to be a basic form, and m0 is also an even index term, we simply need to restrict all other indices in the principal disjunctive normal form of A to even numbers. However, we must ensure that m0 is definitely included.\n\nThe even-indexed m terms for 4 variables would be (considering 4 binary digits can range from 0000 [0 in decimal] to 1111 [15 in decimal]):\n- m0 = 0000\n- m2 = 0010\n- m4 = 0100\n- m6 = 0110\n- m8 = 1000\n- mA = 1010\n- mC = 1100\n- mE = 1110\n\nEach of these terms, including m0, can independently be included or not included in a formula, except that m0 must be included to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\nSince there are 7 additional even-indexed m terms after m0, each can either be included or not included independently, generating \\(2^7\\) different combinations, all of which satisfy the all-even criteria while consistently including m0 for the basic form.\n\nThus, the total number of formulas that are both basic forms and all-even forms would be:\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\nHence, the total number of such formulas is [[128]].",

According to the proposed hypothesis \"All swans are white\" (∀x(S(x)→W(x))), seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) confirms the hypothesis, but seeing a non-swan that is white (¬S(b) ∧ W(b))—which should not logically affect the hypothesis—also confirms it under the equivalence of ∀x(S(x)→W(x)) to ∀x(¬W(x)→¬S(x)). This creates a paradoxical situation in confirmation standards, reflecting the description of the BC Paradox.\n\n### Answer: [[B]]",
