A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\).

Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p1`\n   - `~p1&p2`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)`\n   - `~p3`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)||~p3`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is false, then both `~(~p1&p2)` must be false and `~p3` must be false.\n   - `~(~p1&p2)` is false when `~p1&p2` is true, which occurs when `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n   - `~p3` is false when `p3` is true.\n\nCombining these, the falsity value for `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is:\n`x|✓|✓` (p1 is false, p2 is true, p3 is true)\n\n#### Formula (2): `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n1. Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p2`\n   - `~p2||p3`\n   - `p1=::>p2`\n   - `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n\n2.

That happens when `p2` is true and `p3` is false.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Since this conflicts with `p2` being true, no combination exists to make both parts false simultaneously.\n\nThus, under these constraints, the falsity value for `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is:\n`✓|✓|x` (p1 is true, p2 is true, p3 is false)\n\n#### Formula (3): `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n1.
