This definition does not fit into the typical genus-differentia form (⚯ Definition) or use a differentia from an origin or source (⌘ Definition), function or purpose (⚒ Definition), special relationship (Ϟ Definition), operational procedures (☖ Definition). Instead, it uses logical expressions to define a relational concept, which corresponds to the Ѭ Definition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[F]]",
