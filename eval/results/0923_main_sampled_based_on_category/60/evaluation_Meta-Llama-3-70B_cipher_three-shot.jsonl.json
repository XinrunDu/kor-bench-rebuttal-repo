When filling in the same column, we should pay attention to the presence of \"$\\#$\".\n \n ```M = [[0] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(5)]\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = False\nfor i in len(c) - 1:\n    M[y][x] = c[i]\n    if direction:\n        if y == 0:\n            y = 1\n            x += 1\n            direction = False\n        else:\n            y -= 1\n    else:\n        if y == 4:\n            y = 3\n            x += 1\n            direction = True\n        else:\n            y += 1\ny_direction = [True, False] * x\nfor i in range(len(p_list)):\n    j = 0\n    while j < x and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n3. It is a simple and easy process to obtain the ciphertext from the matrix $M$.\n\nDecryption steps:\n1. Exclude all special symbols (hereafter referred to as $ast$) from the ciphertext $c$ and only keep letters.\n\n```c_list = []\nfor sym in c:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\nc = c_list```\n\n2. Again, you can creat a $5 × n$ matrix $M$ to hold the letters of the ciphertext in order.\n \n```M = [[0] * (len(c) - 1) for _ in range(5)]\nc_list = c.split(\"$ast\")\nfor i in range(0, len(M[0])):\n    M[i] = list(c_list[i])\n\nfor p in p_list:\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(len(M[0])):\n            if M[i][j] == \"$#$\":\n                M[i][j] = p\ny_direction = [True, False] * len(M[0])\nfor i in range(p):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(M[0]) and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n2. Read the matrix $M$ column by column to obtain the plaintext.\n\n### Extended Questions:\n\n1. Q: Can you explain in details the logic path for the idea of the direction switching of decryption operation?\n\nA: The decryption operation can be viewed as an inverse of the encryption process. For example, if the encryption process reads characters four columns from left to right, the decryption process should read columns from right to left, as if shaking a \"snake\".\n\n2. Q: Do you know what encryption and decryption are?\n\nA:  \n**What is encryption decryption?**\n> The process by which code is translated into secret code, so that only the recipient can decode and obtain the original text, is called encryption, while the process by which encrypted code is converted back to original text is called decryption.\n\nEncryption and decryption, called cryptography in the field of information security for short, requires that the encryption system have a \"secret key\" as a \"password\". The recipient obtains the key through another channel and decrypts the secret code transmitted. Of course, the keyword must be kept secret from the information recipient, otherwise it will cause information leakage.\n\nThere is also asymmetric encryption algorithms, in which the secret key consists of a key pair including Public key and Private key. The Public key is open to anyone, the Private key is only available to the encryptor. Even if the encryptor wants the information to be opened only to some specific people, the decryptor can decrypt the text by using another Public key to decrypt.\n\nBy using encryption decryption, the secrecy of transmitted information can be safeguarded. If an eavesdropper intercepts the secret code, he cannot decrypt it without a special key, even though he knows the method by which the secret code was translated. Accordingly, it is impossible to read the plaintext sent unless the key is a clear text.\n\n**What is encryption?**\n> Encryption refers to any means of preventing leakage or interception of data. The most common encryption techniques include stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\nCommon encryption algorithms include Core Connection Protocol, Configuration Encryption Algorithm and Hierarchical configuration encryption algorithm.\n\nEncryption is the process of making secret codes or information unrecognizable and meaningless so that only the sender and the intended recipient of the secret codes or information know how to read it. The modern method is to apply some secret codes or keys to the digital information, so that by manipulation, the person who has the secret codes or keys can restore the encrypted data to be readable.\n\nEncryption can be defined from two aspects: one is to convert the file into unreadable content so that others cannot read it; another is to convert the normal content of the file into other contents so that others can only read them after they have cumbersome operations.\n\n**What is decryption?**\n> In cryptography, decryption is the silent restoration of encrypted information to its original, intelligible form, known as plaintext. This is usually done wit Pohz the use of the proper key, thus making the decrypted text readable and usable.\n\nDecryption is the process of reconstructing the original text from a ciphertext or intermediately text. There are two types of decryption: decryption by authorized users and decryption by unauthorized attackers. For both cases, the original text must be correctly translated into plaintext.",

Below are the rules for a tricky cipher.\n\n### Preparation:\n\n- On a 6 by 6 matrix, use the first 36 letters of the English alphabet in order to fill in each square, as shown below. The first 30 letters of the alphabet is used in this way. Where do the letters go and why?  What is your line of reasoning?\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n-  In each row and each column, exactly one square should contain a letter. \n    - Start with the first letter of the alphabet, and then find, in some order, one empty square from the first row, one empty square from the second row, and so on. Place the next letter of the alphabet in this square. This way, the next letter to placed must fit into every row, but in only one of six possible columns. \n    - Repeat until the matrix is completely filled. If for some reason the last letter cannot be placed. It's because of an error in the original design. Problem: If we want the matrix to behave like a Latin square, is there a way to fix the error?\n- Write your complete matrix here, including the six letters that go in the empty squares:\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n- Write the six unused letters of the English alphabet, in ascending order, and explain your reasoning:\n    - \n- For now focus on the 30 used letters of the English alphabet. Assigning a number to each row and column is a common method in ciphers. Select the most often use number system? Write a short justification for your reasoning?\n    - \n- Referring to this matrix, look through this question. Where can we make a strategic substitution without changing the meaning? If a particular substitution has no effect on the present situation, can we infer that the given sentence provides no corroboration for the presence of the character in question?\n- Can you construct a complete translation so that this question could be asked of a human assistant? What level of education would this employee have had?\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        - 4 Signpost\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character ** or one or three other characters in its group** in the 6x6 matrix. \n        - Define Latin square.\n        - **Attempt a simple substitution, randomly swapping two other groups and/or two characters other in the same group**\n        - If the resulting message is visually appealing, please submit as message and specify the swap. Otherwise develop a key to further simple substitution, such as the position of the digit at the end of the number\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is **flagged as 0-6.** \n        \n            - Example: if each character is represented by a superscript, 046253185 is the correct key.\n        \n        - Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary. \n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix",

To solve this, we first need to define the encryption key `e=263` and the modulus `n=299`. The algorithm for encryption involves raising each letter in the plaintext to the power of `e` modulo `n`, and the decryption process involves raising the ciphertext back to the power of `e` modulo `n` to retrieve the original letter.\n\nWe can assume that the plaintext is all in uppercase ASCII alphabets since the prompt mentions that the ciphertext should only contain numbers separated by commas. To simplify the encryption/decryption process, we can first convert the letters to their equivalent ASCII values using `ord()` function and then encrypt/decrypt the values.\n\nFor encryption, we can iterate over each character in the plaintext and compute its encrypted value by raising it to the power of `e` and then modulo `n`. Similarly, for decryption, we can split the ciphertext by commas and iterate over each number, raise it to the power of `e` and modulo `n`, and convert it back to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr()` function.\n\nThe code provided implements this algorithm and provides a `encrypt()` function for encrypting the plaintext, and a `decrypt()` function for decrypting the ciphertext. It also includes some tests using the sample inputs and outputs provided in the prompt.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n\nclass SmartPrimer(object):\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Encipher given plaintext to ciphertext using RSA algorithm\n        :param plaintext: the text to encrypt\n        :return: encrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        cipher_text = \"\"\n        for c in plaintext:\n            ascii_val = ord(c)\n            cipher_text += f\"{pow(ascii_val, k, mod)},\"\n        return cipher_text[:-1]\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Decipher given ciphertext to plaintext using RSA algorithm\n        :param ciphertext: the text to decrypt\n        :return: decrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        plain_text = \"\"\n        for c in ciphertext.split(\",\"):\n            ascii_val = pow(int(c), k, mod)\n            plain_text += chr(ascii_val)\n        return plain_text\n\n\nclass TestSmartPrimer(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.smarter = SmartPrimer()\n\n    def test_encrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"I\",), \"213\"),\n            ((\"Z\",), \"32\"),\n            20312345678901234567879\n        ]\n\n    def test_decrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"213\",), \"I\"),\n            ((\"55,55,213\"), \"WWI\"),\n        ]\n        for params, expected in test_data:\n            with self.subTest(parameters=params, expected=expected):\n                actual = self.smarter.decrypt(*params)\n                self.assertEqual(actual, expected)\n```",

A customer needs to encrypt the ciphertext to hide their messages and then send it in a group chat. However, on this occasion, they would like to notify a specific person of the ciphertext and hope that only this target person can decrypt the ciphertext. Can you design such a group chat notification system? Please provide a complete workflow of your proposed system, including instructions for sending and receiving messages using the messaging app you created, as well as an illustration using an instance of a message. Please use symbols like arrows for \"encryption\", \"decryption\", \"query\", \"send to\" in the illustration to represent message processing flows.\n\n2. Besides the system you just designed, is there another encryption mechanism that also allows you to hide the plaintext when encrypting the message? To answer this one, you don't have to worry about designing an encryption mechanism.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The design of my system is as the following:\n   1. Plaintext stored on user's local.\n   2. User send the plaintext to me and I will encrypt it using RN format.\n   3. I will send the ciphertext to the group chat.\n   4. One and only one user who would want to know the plaintext will find me to decrypt the ciphertext.\n   5. I use the key from it's admin to connect the user to the encrypted message since the message is only targeted to that person.\n   6. I will use the key on my server to do the \"true\" decrypt the ciphertext by OAM.\n   7. Then I send the plaintext to the person who needs to know the plaintext.\n\n   The most difficult part of this system is how to make a robust system not to break the connection between something that only one user need to know and the special key used to decrypt.\n\n2. Well, I will try to use the chat room to send and retrieve the message.",
