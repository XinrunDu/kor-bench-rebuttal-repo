The number you care about is dependent on the value obtained by evaluating the following expression:\n### Operation Rule:\noperation $ means select the smaller of the two numbers.\n### Situation:\nFor instance, suppose you are given the string:\n\n2&9&1$8&4\nAll numbers in this string end after the 4, which is not next to a space.\nThe problem asks you to find the number of the string. For example,\n\n12&6&7&2 $ 9&3\n## is expected to return ##5 because the value 2 is smaller than the value 9.\nGiven the string 2&6&8 $ 5&1&3, compute the value of the string.\nPlease ensure the answer is a number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n### Answer:\n[[2]]",

Students receive a free slice of pizza if they sign up for a certain on-campus activity. If a student signs up for n activities, she(he) will receive n slices of pizza for free. Additionally, the school cafeteria has a very special way of pricing the pizzas. For each hundreds of the i-th(s) time the activity is signed up for, the thousandths digit is \"i\" + \"1\" = (i + 1). The ten-thousandths digit stays constant and is equal to 0. Just as an example, if Jenny signs up for that certain on-campus activity for the fifteenth time, then she will receive 15 slices of pizza for free, and the price of the pizza will be \\$15.16. Your friend Zoe has been storing all the activities she participates in an array in the form of {numberOfSlices: 0, price: 0}. As Zoe signs up for an additional activity, she will remove the elements of the old activity and add to the array a new element {numberOfSlices: (numberOfSlices + 1), price: (price + (uint(i) * 0.01)}  How will Zoe implement her algorithm to make sure that the array {numberOfSlices: 1, price: 1.00} is a valid element array and 1.0 >= zoeAssociation[numberOfSlices] >= 0.0  Implement your code snippet. The following code attempts to use a localStorage data object for a sample because the array is not built with ngimal. Be careful while using the localStorage data object. This will change the overall look and feel of your application. However, it can help you maintain scalability. var elemnet = {}; if(typeof(zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices) === \"undefined\") {  element.numberOfSlices = 0;  element.price = 1.00  } else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer - 1)' + i;  } localStorage.setItem(\"element1\", JSON.stringify(defaultPull));  Finally, in the ng-click event in your main controller, add the following code, which will execute the necessary functions. 1 modifyController($rootScope, $index, $scope, $translate, ngAlert, $myModal, $http, $window, $location, $sce, $parse, $loc, $anchorScroll) {  $scope.zoeFuture = function(zoeAssociation) {  var elemnet = {};  var array = [5,5,6,0];  var zoeAssociation = '2';  if(array) {  if(typeof(zoeAssociation.zoeFuture) === \"undefined\") {  }  else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer",

We believe that an AI-powered world will promote creativity and increase social mobility and encourage collaboration between humanity. Technology gives us limitless power, but without meaningful utilization it becomes destructive. The primary aim of such technology should be to create a more humane world. Among all technologies, Artificial Intelligence gives the power to create a more humane world through machine learning.\n2. This is a technical question about decision trees. The question asks you to maximize the weighted sum of return. This is essentially an optimization problem. To solve it you need the following information:\na) The probability of each failure state\nb) The weighted sum of return for each failure state\n\nc) The all-pairs minimum cost path in case features have same BERs\nd) Which pair of feature values has the maximum minimum costs\ne) Perform the optimization by finding the weights for each pair such that the combination of those weights maximizes the weighted sum of return. Once we have the weights we can calculate the maximum response time and threshold for that feature.\n\nChapter 6 Value Iterations: A pure reward–punishment algorithm\n1. What is the generic form of a reward–punishment algorithm?\n2. What are the common components of a reward–punishment algorithm?\n3. What are the common components of a discounting-optimization algorithm?\n4. How does the generic form of a reward–punishment algorithm differ from a generic form of a discounting-optimization algorithm?\n5. What is the common component of a reward–punishment algorithm that can be overlooked?\n6. How is an optimal policy obtained for a generic reward–punishment algorithm?\n7. How is an optimal policy obtained for a generic discounting-optimization algorithm?\n\n8. What is the generic form of a policy evaluation problem?\n\n9. What is the generic form of an expected-value problem?\n10. How do you achieve a globally optimal policy using a generic policy evaluation problem?\n\nThis is a hard question, because I solved it. Let’s try the following approach:\nThe key is to understand how discounting differs from reward—punishment.\nThe problem is to maximize the payoff while optimizing the policy decisions. The payoffs can be expected value, discounted value, or anything else.\nOptimization means getting to the same point like you would if you had the same decision to make and the payoff curve was the same. Optimization can be performed using different techniques.\nThe generic form of a discounting-optimization algorithm is:\nIf you use a pure discounting-optimization algorithm, you will get the same payoff as if you use a generic reward—punishment algorithm. The problem with this approach is that it allows\na0Bit is a company that provides affordable, high-quality VPN solutions for people who want a reliable way to browse the Internet securely and anonymously. The service builds on a new bit VPN technology that protects your privacy. a0bit is the first VPN solution based on this technology, and our users benefit immensely from all of the advantages that this protocol provides.\n\nThe rates in Bitche and Vevey are very high. If you would like to cut your Internet traffic bills by about 75%, then you need to look no further than a 0Bit VPN service. a0Bit VPN technology is unlike any other VPN service because it uses a whole new VPN protocol.\nThe a0Bit is the first service that creates a pure VPN solution on a VPN protocol. It is worth noting that this is a completely separate protocol and does not use AES. Because of this, you can be sure that all Internet traffic passing through a 0bit VPN connection will be encrypted.\n\nWhat is a 0Bit VPN?\nIt’s not a VPN software, but a VPN service based on the BitTorrent VPN protocol. It’s a low-cost, high-performance service that protects your Internet traffic and privacy. It’s the most secure VPN service in the market.\nWhy should I choose a0Bit?\nThe product has undergone careful study by a team of experts, who have ensured that it does not suffer from any quality control problems. It has received the highest rating in the quality-control scores within the industry. You can find more information about the product on our website. a0Bit is a genuine Austrian product with headquarters in Madrid, Spain.\nWhat is the difference between a 0Bit VPN and other VPN services?\na0Bit is a provider of a pure VPN service based on the BitTorrent VPN protocol. It is a VPN service that only uses a VPN protocol. All other VPN services just encrypt your Internet traffic using RSA-2048, which takes a long time to decrypt. a0Bit is a faster and more secure VPN service than the other VPN services on the market.\nDust-Mite. Starship or another set of commandments. But in this case the latter, the division of the commandments into two semidisciplines – just the principles of that code. From my own personal experience I know that for a programmer cadence, it’s one thing to get a piece of code just to read, and another to structure the whole program structure around it.\n\nSo, we will try to figure out how to build the code itself.

We created this example to allow you to practice formulating and determining the answer to the question using the rule in a realistic setting.\nBecause the operation rules in this exercise weren't initially easy for machines to learn, we trained machine learning systems with millions of data points and thousands of hours of compute time to improve their accuracy in evaluating this question.\nHow relevant is this code?\nOur client asked for a machine that could accurately evaluate an example involving the @ operation for the operation rule.\nWhile the rule isn't prevalent in financial software today, our client runs thousands of questions every day in their live financial software to track the effectiveness and development of their skilled employees and to better understand how professional programmers think about the material.\n\nThe neural network behind the code is the learner of the Mat index. It was trained to predict the prices of S&P 500 stocks over years, given past and current economic indicators. However, it focuses on learning the core for this question, and not the prediction of the S&P 500 prices. For this reason, the neural network is 'tuned to the example'.\n",
