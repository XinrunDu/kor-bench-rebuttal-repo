However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true).

The literals are p, q, ¬q, ¬p, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\nTo apply the resolution algorithm, we start by initializing S0 as an empty set, S1 as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given expression, and S2 as an empty set. Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause. Therefore, we conclude that the algorithm iterates 1 cycle to reach the determination of \"Plausible\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Plausible;1]}$",

This seems applicable because the subsidence (P) occurs in areas with a high concentration of textiles (initial supposed cause), across different conditions. However, the actual cause identified is the high volume of underground water use, which is a more specific condition than just the presence of textiles. This method could initially apply to identifying textiles as a common factor but doesn't directly address the deeper investigation's findings.\n\n- **Method ؆:** This method involves the cause (S) being present when the effect (P) occurs and absent when P does not occur. The discourse does not explicitly provide instances where the supposed cause (high volume of underground water use) is absent and the effect (subsidence) is also absent, making this method not directly applicable based on the information provided.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This involves comparing a positive group where the supposed cause and effect are present (with varying other conditions) to a negative group where the supposed cause is absent, and the effect is also absent (with varying conditions).

While the discourse mentions that areas with a higher concentration of textiles (and by extension, a higher volume of underground water use) experience more subsidence, it does not detail varying degrees of water use corresponding to varying degrees of subsidence, which would be necessary for this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This involves causal relationships between multiple factors and outcomes to infer another causal relationship. The discourse, however, focuses on identifying a single causal relationship (between underground water use and subsidence) rather than using known causal relationships between other factors to infer this one.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the information provided, **Method ⸮** is the most applicable, as it involves identifying a common factor (initially, the concentration of textiles, and more specifically, the high volume of underground water use) across different conditions that correlates with the observed effect (ground subsidence). However, it's worth noting that the method's direct application might seem a bit forced without explicit mention of comparing instances of the absence of the cause.

Speaker C uses a marked expression, \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which deviates from a more direct or unmarked expression. This choice of words suggests that C's meaning is different from what could have been expressed with a simpler statement, indicating that while the main work is complete, there is still some openness to the project's status. \n\nBy using a more euphemistic and optimistic expression, C implies a high likelihood of project success without committing to a definitive answer, thereby adhering to the C! Principle's instruction to avoid conventional associations and derive meanings using the Information Principle. This also involves the Hearer's Inference, as the listener (A) is expected to understand the nuance of C's statement and the reason behind choosing a more elaborate expression over a straightforward one. \n\nThe C! Principle allows for the interpretation that C's response is intentionally phrased to convey a positive outlook while maintaining some ambiguity, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on the use of marked expressions to convey nuanced meanings.",

Let's see how it aligns with each principle:\n\nA. C* Principle: This principle involves the speaker's criterion about not providing weaker information than what they know unless a stronger statement would conflict with the Information Principle. The hearer's inference parts (CQ1 and CQ2) deal with deducing the speaker's knowledge about stronger statements or the content of embedded sentences based on what is said. The given statement does not directly involve comparing the strength of different statements or inferring the speaker's knowledge about a stronger statement.\n\nB. C% Principle: This principle's speaker's criterion is about minimalization—speaking as little as possible to achieve the communication's purpose. The hearer's inference parts (CI1 and CI2) assume conventional relationships unless indicated otherwise and interpret the sentence as saying something matches a confirmed situation. The statement seems to follow a conventional relationship (if a car has a door that won't close, it implies the car has doors), which aligns with the minimalization criterion and assuming conventional relationships.\n\nC. C! Principle: This principle is about avoiding lengthy or marked expressions without reason and inferring different meanings from marked expressions. The given statement does not involve comparing marked and unmarked expressions or deriving a meaning that differs because of an expression's markedness.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close → Zhang San's new car has doors\" most closely aligns with the C% Principle, as it involves assuming a conventional relationship (cars typically have doors) and interpreting the sentence in a way that matches a confirmed situation without requiring additional information.\n\n[[B]]",

In this case, C's use of the word \"managed\" instead of a more direct phrase like \"I borrowed\" or \"I got\" implies that there was some difficulty or effort involved in obtaining the materials. This usage of a marked expression (the word \"managed\") suggests a deviation from the most straightforward or conventional way of expressing the action, thereby indicating additional information about the nature of the process.\n\nTherefore, according to the C! Principle, the hearer infers that C's meaning is different from what could have been expressed with an unmarked (more straightforward) expression, indicating the presence of some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\n[[C]]",
