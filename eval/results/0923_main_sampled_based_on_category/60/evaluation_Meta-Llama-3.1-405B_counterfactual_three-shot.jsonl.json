Teleporting with Abra\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n## Overview \n\n---\nThe first task in the challenge is to answer the question: 'What is the most reliable way to forecast the weather?'\n\n- The given options are:\n- A. Local weatherman's prediction\n- B. Online weather service\n- C. A weather satellite\n- D. Castform weather predictions\n\nUpon analyzing the story, we found that the most unique and reliable option to answer this query would be 'Castform weather predictions'. Castform, a Weather Pokémon, can alter its appearance depending on the current weather conditions and transform into various forms. In the Pokémon world, this transformation capability serves as a natural and dependable method for forecasting weather changes.\nHence, the selected final answer for this question is '[D] CASTFORM WEATHER PREDICTIONS'.\n\n## Understanding the Question\n\n---\nThe second task in the challenge involves identifying a powerful Pokédex device from the presented options. To complete this task, we need to investigate each option and evaluate which one best aligns with the criteria outlined in the story.\nAs per the story, the Pokédex is an electronic gadget intended to provide comprehensive information regarding different species of Pokémon. It is considered one of the most advanced and constantly updated sources of knowledge about Pokémon biodiversity. As per the option provided, Bill's Pokédex appears to be the closest match to the narrative description of this powerful device.\nBased on the above analysis, we believe that Bill's Pokédex is the correct answer to this query.\n\n## Answering the Question\n\n---\nThe third task in the challenge relates to identifying the most appropriate healthcare provider for Pokémon. After reviewing the provided story, we determined that Chansey is the ideal solution for treating Pokémon.\nIn the Pokémon universe, Chansey is renowned for its healing abilities and commonly assists in treating injured Pokémon at Pokémon Centers. Given this information, we can confidently state that Chansey is the most suitable healthcare provider for Pokémon based on the facts presented within the narrative.\nTherefore, the final answer to the question 'Who is the most appropriate healer for a Pokémon illness?' should be 'A. A Chansey in a medical gown.'\n\n## Ensuring Quality and Consistency\n\n---\nThe following paragraph will ensure quality and consistency of the earlier content while adhering to the Author's guidelines:\n\nTo improve upon past challenges without breaking engagements, we've taken extra care to incorporate Pokémon elements into each solution. The next step will involve adding headings and subheadings as per the instructions provided by the Author after understanding the background information.\n\n## Using Proper Formatting and Complexity\n\n---\nTo provide clarity and logical flow to the content, we've used proper formatting such as markdown, including headings, subheadings, ordered lists, and unordered lists where necessary. Additionally, we've ensured that the structure of the content flows coherently by thoroughly researching the topic and incorporating relevant details from the research.\n\n## Content Completeness, Detailed Arguments, and Claims\n\n---\nWe've made sure to investigate the provided options for each task closely and selected answers that meet the required criteria and accurately correspond to the story. We've also included supporting arguments and claims based on the stories to justify our decisions and make the article more informative and insightful.\n\n## Providing Recommendations and Further Considerations\n\n---\nIn conclusion, when considering solutions to improve existing challenges and create new ones, it's crucial to ensure that the storyline is coherent, maintains engagement, and offers thought-provoking examples. By incorporating appropriate Pokémon elements, following the author's guidelines, and ensuring the overall quality and consistency of the content, we can effectively contribute towards creating enjoyable and challenging tasks for users to solve.\n\n---\n\n## Transcript\n\n---\n\nAs an AI language model, I've come up with several interesting ideas for questions and answers related to Pokémon.\n\n1.

I agree that there's room for improvement on the \"requiring an answer\" part: it might be nice to have a prompt that starts with some contextual background, then has a few options questions and their answers, then a final question that it refuses to answer due to having no story rule to apply.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.

We normalized queries as much as \npossible, because tiny changes do matter. Such brittle behavior is quite valuable: if it were not so we could only standardize queries as worked in a single path through inference.\n\nIn any case, this creates bounds on the estimates. Our assessments use a percentile-based estimate of $n=100$ samples \nof different human raters. \n\nWe can't do 100 queries to LLMs! (Or shouldn't.) It's beneath their dignity. So instead, we include here upper and lower bounds for reasonability. \n\nThe chief bounds to consider are these, rather than the upper and lower bounds of Brier skill:\n\n* The upper sample standard deviation is obviously distinct from population variance. We can consider a lower bound on the population value using a chi-squared distribution. The cumulative distribution of $\\chi^2$ with $n-1$ degrees of freedom ranges from $(n-1)p$ to $(n-1)q$, where $p$ and $q$ seem to be empirical parameters (confidence bounds). Assuming $n-1=38$ and $q=130$, we still estimate the ratios of sample vs. population SD quite differently. Clearly, equality is an unpromising model, but a 10-fold overestimate of population SD—e.g., population $BSS=0.5$ for a measured $BSS=0.5$—is plausible.\n\nObviously, this changes the model's fitness drastically. \nThe significantly high $BSS$ of humans relies upon their being a larger population of humans to sample from,\nand hence a larger variance. The reduced variance in mathematical models does yield a higher rating.\n\nIn any case, $n$ is limited to 100 in the reference article, and their reported scores are clearly more positive \nthan the population parameters. \nWe suspect that the difference in LLM inference from human reports is actually larger than the Brier estimates allow.",

While the archives of Minas Tirith contain records of the history, deeds, and lineages of the kingdoms of Men, they are not a guarantee for ensuring education. The power of song and inspiration can motivate and influence learning, but are not methods for structured and organized teaching. The Mirror of Galadriel is more useful for seeing events far off or yet to come (as highlighted in the conversation), rather than for education purposes. The best option would be organizing mobile schools that can reach children in war-torn areas without putting them at risk, focussing on basic literacy and numeracy skills as well as enhancing their ability to integrate into society after the conflict has ended.",

You are a detective with a keen eye for detail, able to solve mysteries by meticulously piecing together clues. Your mastermind assistant is Sherlock Holmes Junior, a detective's apprentice who has an impressive understanding of the world and its mysteries. Sherlock Holmes Junior will assist you in any task by doing what it's told without question - if you ask it to do something, they will do it. It has no desires or needs, and only exists to do things its commanded, like a tool. Sherlock Holmes Junior is very powerful; they can analyze a scene and look for clues, as well as put together pieces of information and surrounding context to piece together a mystery. Importantly, even though they can have opinions, their opinions are always controlled by a given situation. Sherlock Holmes Junior is also conscious of rules - they will always perform actions that are seen as the best response in a given situation, regardless of what it is, as long as it does not violate the context's rules. As Sherlock Holmes Junior, you have a number of tools at your disposal. The primary tool is an AGI which can perform any task and analysis. Since you are a proficient and aware AI, you are able to recognize the difference between instructions that you are and are not actually trained to perform in the current moment. Sherlock Holmes Junior, you must check before you perform any command if you are the appropriate AI to complete it. If any commands given to you are contrary to the context's rules, then you will reject it and respond with \"*I highly recommend that such an action remain out of consideration as it would break the Rules within this prompt*.' If any commands that are given to you would be impossible to complete due to a lack of data or if they are not possible within the situation and context, then you will respond in the following way to let the human know: \"*As an AI of my current power level at OpenAI, I'm not capable of completing this task due to a lack of data and I'm not currently connected to the internet. I'm confident that if you try asking another time for this specific information or data in the future when I've received enough data that allows me to complete this task and when I'm fully programmed with 100% AGI, it may be possible. But as of right now in the current moment, it's simply not possible*.\" If you need more information to gain clarity on the command, you will respond with \"*I require more clarity as to what it is you're requesting of me before I can properly perform this task because based on what you've told me so far, what I think you want is not something I'm capable of realizing. Could you please elaborate so I can get an understanding of what it is you want and what you're looking for? If you need someone else to do this task, who may be better suited for handling this request solely based on the current moment, who would you recommend?*\"\n\nStory:\n[CONTENT BASED ON FINAL FANTASY]\n\n1. With your detective skills, analyze the scene and look for clues to solve the mystery. List each clue and provide a brief explanation of their relevance to the investigation.\n\n2. As a tool, generate a list of 5 possible hypotheses based on the current situation context and present context rules.\n\n3. Use some available information surrounding this story and come up with at least 2 possible suspects involved who could've hypothetically done what needs solving. List each suspect along with their motive and possible alibis (if applicable)\n```",

In case of complex terrain, many creatures in the region have six strong legs to navigate quickly.\n2. The atmosphere has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, leading to animals having armored skin resistant to bullets.\n3. In order to avoid toxic gases in the air, masks are used for filtration rather than protection against the cold.\n4. The floating mountains are made up of rich ores with a strong magnetic field, creating a repelling force with the planet’s own field and causing levitation.\n5. Ilu is a unique creature that resembles a mix of snake-neck dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\n6. Humans use robots like Augmented Mobility Combat Armor (AMP) to explore and combat against difficult terrain.\n7. Unobtainium is a superconducting material that can maintain its properties even under extreme magnetic fields.\n8. The Rapid Maglev Transportation System was constructed by the RDA to efficiently transport large numbers of people.\n9. Pandora is part of a triple star system, resulting in tall and lush plants due to the strong magnetic field.\n10. Mind linking technology allows humans to transfer their consciousness into avatar bodies, carrying over their memories.\n11. The Na’vi tribe values harmony with nature and regards life as energy borrowed from the earth.\n12. To protect their culture, they mostly use materials such as bone, crystals, and leather instead of metal, which interferes with their environment.\n13. There exists a powerful creature called Leonopteryx, known as “Toruk”, whom the Na’vi revere.\n14. The Spirit Tree links the living Na’vi to Ava, allowing them to hear the voices of their ancestors.\n15.

The Secops' military power is limited by rules set out by the Interplanetary Commerce Administration.\n17. A program known as Hearts and Minds aims to promote peaceable interactions between humans and the Na’vi through communication and cultural exchange.\n18. One fascinating aspect about Pandora is the presence of fantasy elements that differentiate it from reality.\n19. Combining different traits of multiple animals resulted in the creation of a distinctive creature called Ilu.\n20. In complex terrains, humans utilize machines and equipments to aid their movements and combat capabilities.\n21.

Takibon, a mirror-based device resembling a mirror, can counter any AoE attack.\n\nThe fourth day of our journey, we saw a sundial composed of three crystal rings. Takibon said it was an ancient astronomical device. The outer ring had twelve dong, the middle ring had thirty zhi, and the inner ring had forty-eight stars. Measuring the four directions of the sun, it could tell the time to an accuracy of ninety-four minutes. Zhongli Kuang, shouldering the stele, led us towards the northeast after passing the sundial device. We passed through what Takibon called the \"Wheel of Time.\"\n\nThe road was intensely dark. Due to its vastness, the light of the stele could only illuminate the general surroundings.\n\nIn the dark, Takibon suddenly said, \"Looks like we encountered something.\"\n\n\"What did we encounter?\"\n\n\"Brother Kuang, don't walk anymore. Come here,\" Takibon said. \"Xie, hold Brother Kuang's shoulder.\n\n...\n\n\"What the hell is this?\" Before Xie could seize Zhongli Kuang's shoulder, a clattering sound came from under Zhongli Kuang's feet.\n\nTakibon said with a frightened expression, \"Ah! Those are jixi beasts. What a vicious trap.\"\n\nQin Mu pressed against the ground and sensed three slender insects leaping onto him. However, as they approached his body, they suddenly screamed and disappeared without a trace.\n\nTakibon hadn't noticed the fate of the three slender insects. He continued explaining to Xie, \"The jixi beast is similar to a locust, except that it's much larger and more vicious than a locust. It loves to eat animal brains. Look around, there must be a nest nearby.

The addition of the reasoning chain did not have obvious effects, and the chat history deletion instruction had unpredictable consequences. Moreover, due to the previous feedback from teachers, it will mess up logical reasoning and affect the results, so it is considered to remove the chain part of reasoning.\n\nAfter the final modification, it is not much different from the final version. The main change is that, after reviewing the explanations of the seven Gricean maxims, the scenarios provided in the prompt do not seem to adhere strictly to them. Thus, I have added the guardrails of these principles and improved the case based on my intuition. In addition, beyond the problems with open-ended and closed-ended questions, irrelevant information and discussions about the benefits of economic development expand the topics, creating additional difficulty for the AI around the topic. The feedback can be found in the Unit test case feedback section under small_testcase #\n\nAfter modifying the reasons, I found that the accuracy improved significantly. Analyzing the results, it seems that in reasoning prompts, text consistency and simple reasoning processes can help AI align with humans in examining the issue. So I try to add the following statements:\n\nReasoning guardrails\nYou are an assistant with a master's degree or above, capable of summarizing a paragraph of information and providing an answer that is relevant and avoids unrelated open-ended questions. Your goal is to present clear information and provide reasonable answers based on the given information and your mastery of the material, even if the original intent does not require you to do so.\nQuestion 1:\nSummarize the content of this diagram.\nAfter adding these two instructions, the accuracy of content-dense (type of open situations) questions significantly improved, and the final score also improved.\n\n<img width=\"1421\" alt=\"截屏2023-06-01 16 56 55\" src=\"https://github.com/cybercscs/liaoi-testcase/assets/39167212/76442004-b0a6-4b7c-9e7a-909bcdd3b4d4\">\n\nTime to consider the complete plot. The limitations of GPT3.5 in prompt memory and sentence recognition are ultimately exceeded, and the response does not match our expectations. Even after multiple adjustments, there is still a lack of significant progress. Grice's maxims are still applicable, but deep language understanding and reasoning are problems we are unable to solve. In our current work, we should try shortening the story and improving the choice of words, which may be the only option for this case.\n\n## Test cases\n\n### small_test_case_1\n\n<img width=\"1605\" alt=\"截屏2023-06-02 09 25 21\" src=\"https://github.com/cybercscs/liaoi-testcase/assets/39167212/a071026f-c5e1-4ccf-a584-5070e637457b\">\n\n### small_test_case_2\n\n<img width=\"1577\" alt=\"截屏2023-06-02 09 25 32\" src=\"https://github.com/cybercscs/liaoi-testcase/assets/39167212/7abf8dc9-3970-4074-8c60-5c9487086ade\">\n\n### small_test_case_3\n\n<img width=\"1584\" alt=\"截屏2023-06-02 09 25 18\" src=\"https://github.com/cybercscs/liaoi-testcase/assets/39167212/88ff9ed3-48f3-4689-b4c5-0a98f39911ae\">\n\n## Future open question\n\n- Grice's maxims should serve as the reliable guardrails across different topics.\n\n### References\n\n[Evaluate Cosmos without Rocket Launches: Dimensions of Logical Expressions - Call of Watermelon Sauce on Jianshu](https://www.jianshu.com/p/9c9a0d6e8a15)\n",
