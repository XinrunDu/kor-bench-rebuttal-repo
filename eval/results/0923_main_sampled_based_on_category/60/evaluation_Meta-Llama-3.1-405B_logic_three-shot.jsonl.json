Most free datasets only offer questions, while the answers require payment.\n\nSo as a developer, how do we generate a dataset? The first rule of course is to use the rules provided by the textbook itself! Elementary: Once we have `question - answer pair`, we can leverage the LLM's ability to perform unsupervised learning to generate some kind of dataset. But first, let's describe the rules:\n\n1. Universal Quantifier is denoted by A. Symbolize the phrase 'All men are mortal' involving the n-ary predicate ‘being mortal’ as Ax F (x). To symbolize the relationship involving the 2-dimensional predicate ‘being loved by’ as Ax Ay G (x, y). Therefore, we can use G(x) to denote the n-ary predicate `x is mortal` , and G(x,y) to denote the 2-dimensional predicate `x is loved by y`.\n\n2. Existential Quantifier is denoted by E. Given a 1-ary predicate that states that some people do not like mathematics, symbolize this as Ex ¬ F (x). Using Ex and Ey to express that there is someone who likes someone can be symbolized as Ex Ey G (x, y).\n\n3. Logical Connectives include Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, and Implication. The negation of a predicate may be denoted by negating each part of the symbolic language.\n\n4. Finally, it is important to note whether the domain is universal (all people) or specific (such as living things). For instance, universal symbolization: ‘Man loves wisdom’ involves the two predicates F(x)='x is a man' and G(x,y)='x loves y'.",

According to the rules described by the previously defined Dynamic Logic language (see here), the expression [c*](φ) represents the condition that after executing the loop command c* an arbitrary number of times, the proposition φ will necessarily hold. However, this does not capture the aspect of Alice's belief about the persistence of the loop command until φ becomes true.\n\nThis additional semantic feature capturing belief can be achieved through the use of an epistemic modal operator, such as the one introduced by Hansson & Jonsson [1]. The basic idea behind epistemic logics is to extend traditional modal logics by including operators that represent agents' beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states. Here, we adopt the convention where 'H(eissmer)' denotes an operator representing eissmer's beliefs.\n\nPutting everything together, we obtain the desired expression: [c*](φ ∧ HAlice(φ)). This captures both the fact that the loop command c* must eventually terminate (due to the truth of proposition φ), as well as Alice's belief that the loop command will persist until φ holds true.\n\n[1] Håkan Hansson and Lars Jonsson (2010), \"Epistemic Logic for Artificial Intelligence\" MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/epistemic-logic-artificial-intelligence \n\n### Question:\nAssume that c1 and c2 are two sequential commands, and φ is a proposition. According to the axioms provided earlier, what is the equivalent expression for [c1][c2]φ?\nPlease give your answer in the format of [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[c1+c2]φ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the correct way to interpret the expression ⟨c⟩φ, given a command c and a proposition φ?\nA. After executing command c, proposition φ may be true.\nB. Proposition φ must always hold during the execution of command c.\nC. It is possible that φ holds before executing command c.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question: \nIf it is known that a command c1 triggers an exception e upon completion, then what can be concluded about the proposition φ according to the Exception rule stated above?\nSelect all possible outcomes:\n[[Possible outcomes here]]\n(Press enter after each selection)\n\n### Answer:\n[[φ ∨ e]] [[[c1]φ]]\nExplanation: According to the Exception rule, if the command c1 triggers an exception e after its completion, then [c1]φ is equivalent to ([c1]φ ∧ [e]φ). Therefore, if we know that the command c1 triggers an exception e, we can conclude that the proposition φ is either true or the exception e is thrown. Alternatively, since the exception e is thrown immediately after the execution of command c1, we can also say that the proposition φ is always true following the execution of command c1. Thus, the correct answers are φ ∨ e and [c1]φ.",

This model uses GLM-130B, the world's first general large language model (LLM) with 130 billion parameters in both Chinese and English, ranked top one in LLM on both Chinese and English accuracy. The model was pretrained on a diverse dataset of 1 trillion tokens with various strategies for data cleaning and training efficiency. With 9.47x model size compression compared to GLM-130B, ChatGLM-6B achieves 98.46% and 97.09% of its performance on English and Chinese benchmarks, respectively. In particular, ChatGLM-6B outperforms GPT-3.5 on the Chinese evaluation dataset.\n\n### What are you bad at?\nChatGLM-6B often generates the most probable response rather than a correct response due to the nature of language modeling. This systematic flaw is further exacerbated in the zero-shot setting when we need the model to output factually correct responses to novel inputs without the provision of any examples.\n\nHowever, earlier studies demonstrate that demonstrating examples to the model improves its other reasoning capabilities such as logical/numerical reasoning, causal reasoning and so on. This type of method is often referred to as prompt learning, in-context learning or few-shot learning.\n\nIn this scenario, ChatGLM-6B is likely to have better reasoning power if it is accompanied by more detailed logic prompts.\n\nGenerated texts containing wrong answers are publicly promoted as \"instruction-tuned\" GPT-3 when in fact they show no improvement over the basic model with the correct few-shot prompt.\n\n### How did you overcome your limitations?\nIn order to overcome this drawback, I used few-shot lingual scripts to feed [[context]] and [[question]] into a prompt-tuning dialogue graph to enable the model to make correct assumptions about [[tasks]]. The keys to using this method are the following aspects:\n\n1. The concepts involved in the evaluation tasks should be clarified so that they can be effectively searched and queries are accurate and precise. Otherwise, there is no way to produce the correct set of examples for learning logic.\n\n2. Prompt engineering makes sure the model can only make up things that meet the ontological and functional requirements of the domain.\n\n3. Parameter tuning or fine-tuning the model on data with relevant questions/knowledge base will significantly improve its performance. The reason for better performance is simple: The model will learn more about the details of the intended domain, like when we move from rote memorization (rote memorization) to concept chunking (concept linking) during early childhood learning.\n\n4. Prompt design must be based on the characteristics of the evaluation task problem, so as to ensure that the model can produce a reasonable and precise logical solution.\n\n### What excites you about your work?\nI taught a large language model how to think in a right way, and so far, it's done reasonably well in various subjects and has demonstrated general thinking skills.\n\n### General Task: \n\n[[TASK]]\n### Context:\n\n[[CONTEXT]]\n### Question:\n\n[[QUESTION]]",

Please provide the recommended accommodation, activities, and estimated expenses, as well as explain the decisions in a formal, logical reasoning format.\n\n### Answer:\nProvided Conditions:\n* Traveler: 72 years old (an older adult)\n* Accommodation options: [Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, Hostel]\n* Activity options: [Cycling, Outdoor camping, Sea diving]\n* Expenses: As low as possible\n\nAccording to the given rule: \"Safety Concerns: If the traveler is an older adult or a person with a disability, avoid recommending accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes.\" we apply the following logic:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n    - The traveler is considered an older adult (meeting the age criterion).\n    - Possible accommodations include Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, and Hostel.\n    - Activities include Cycling, Outdoor Camping, and Sea Diving.\n\n2. Apply the logical operation or reasoning pattern:\n    - The safety rule states not to recommend accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes to older adults. \n    - We exclude Mountain-view villa from the accommodation recommendations since it involves a significant altitude.\n    - We exclude Sea Diving from the activity recommendations since diving can be considered potentially risky for older adults due to increased water pressure at depth, which could lead to health complications like decompression sickness or barotrauma.\n\n3. Ensuring output conforms to the specified notation and symbols:\n    - We choose the lowest cost accommodation among the remaining two options, Non-rapid hotel and Hostel, based on expense minimization.\n    - Similarly, we choose the least expensive activity among Cycling and Outdoor Camping, ensuring comfort and safety while meeting budget constraints.\n\nOur final recommendation is:\n\n**Recommendations**: \n* _Lowest cost accommodation_: **Non-rapid hotel** (**reason**: meeting safety requirements and minimizing expenses)\n* _Low-risk activity_: **Cycling** (**reason**: safer option for older traveler and cost-effective, avoiding high-altitude risks and high-cost activities)",

Generally speaking, however, there isn't enough context available to determine which type of intensional definition applies to the statement \"Rocks can be classified based on properties.\" \n\nHowever, I can offer some general guidance on how to think about this problem. First, let's review each of the four types of intensional definitions that were provided to you:\n\n1) ⚒ Definition - This refers to a genus-species relationship between two concepts. In other words, one concept is a subspecies or subcategory of another. For instance, mammals, which form a class of animals, include humans, dogs, cats, etc., all of which belong to the same genus (mammalia).\n\n2) Ϟ Definition - This involves defining one concept through its relation to another. For instance, we might define a friend as someone whom we relate to as a partner, companion, confidante, or associate.\n\n3) ☖ Definition – This pertains to operational procedures involved in defining or determining a concept. For instance, we may define heat as a process or operation designed to raise the internal temperature of a body or object.\n\n4) Ѭ Definition – This relates to relational concepts, which involve defining one concept in relation to another. For instance, we may define sibling as a relation existing between people who share at least one parent.\n\nNow back to your original question regarding the statement “Rock can be classified based on properties such as gravity, hardness, acidity and basicity, composition, and formation.” It appears that this statement does not fit neatly into any of the categories outlined above, primarily because it lacks clear indicators of relationships or operations amongst the terms being used. As such, it doesn't seem to involve defining one term through another, nor does it indicate how the objects denoted by these terms are distinguished from others.",

If Q or R represent Syllogistic Predicates such as Affirmative, negative, etc., then `Q(M,N)` or `R(O,P)` can be used in the recursive formulation according to their respective rules.\n2. If ├h〔■h〕 is given and Figure Y is stated to be invalid, Springer-Vater provides a means to circumvent logicality using reductio ad absurdum.

Use M in this context but simultaneously show why exactly Sₖs do not necessarily follow from any smaller subsequence of s_ijs. The justification also includes reasons for longer sequences.\n3. For demonstrating that Figure Z wasn't a valid figure after all, you can always go back to the initial assertion T₀ ´→ S facing the challenges posed by proofs being beyond unreasonable reach, then move forward again by reductio ad absurdum until you find no way out.

As a custom dialecttic rule, `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n\nAn ambiguous definition here could potentially lead to a substitution error. In one interpretation, this rule may allow one to conclude that Clark knows that Andy is neat, leading to an incorrect inference.\n\nHowever, if we consider a different interpretation, where mere relationships do not transfer or share knowledge, this implication does not hold. In other words, although Ben knows that Andy is neat, his friend Clark does not necessarily inherit this knowledge.\n\nThis distinction highlights the ambiguity in the rule and demonstrates the potential for erroneous conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the absence of explicit guidelines can potentially result in incorrect inferences.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy might arise due to lack of clarity?\n\nA.

Assuming represents the hypothetical condition while 'now' represents present time, then 'has now married' could be understood as the subject x having completed the act of getting married by the present moment. However, this isn't specified in rules above; it may still lead to the same outcome. So this presents potential ambiguity because its interpretation is not explicitly covered among these existing rules. The ambiguity here lies in the different ways to interpret the temporal relation with the hypothetical assumption, which could potentially cause divergence among various students and scholars. Not only does it create confusion, but it also does not specify the consequences arising from such ambiguity. How can we resolve such ambiguity? Please explain.\n\nPlease give your answer in Markdown format.\n\n### Answer:\n```\nTo resolve such ambiguity, there needs to be further clarification and specific guidance on dealing with hypothetical assumptions involving temporal components. In particular, the treatment of \"now\" in conjunction with hypothetical situations should be carefully addressed to avoid ambiguities and diverging conclusions.\n\nOne approach could be to introduce a standard usage or interpretation when dealing with \"now\" in hypothetical scenarios. This ensures that all students and scholars understand and follow the same guidelines, leading to greater consistency and accuracy. Additionally, any implications arising from this interpretation should be explicitly stated to help avoid misinterpretations and ensure clarity in logical reasoning.\n\nFurthermore, it would be helpful to include examples and case studies illustrating how \"now\" should be handled in different contexts to provide practical guidance and support for learners and researchers alike. Ultimately, by addressing these concerns and offering clear, detailed recommendations, potential ambiguities surrounding the usage of \"now\" in hypothetical assumptions can be successfully managed and resolved.\n```\n\n",

In the analysis and reasoning sections, we presented several examples of invalid arguments and used these rules to identify the types of errors they committed.\n\nFormal logic is essential for argument formation and evaluation, but it's also crucial that we remain vigilant about our cognitive biases to employ reasoning and judgment that are both logically sound and psychologically accurate. Formal logic and cognitive psychology often work hand-in-hand in constructing persuasive, valid, and convincing arguments.\n\n\nCode language: Python (python)\n```\n\"You are an intelligent assistant who can help with various logical reasoning tasks. Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logical operation. Please ensure your output follows the defined rules and format.\n\n### Apache configuration file:\n\nIn Apache configuration files, directives are used to define how the server should operate. One common directive is the \"Directive\" directive, which is used to instruct Apache on how to handle a specific type of request. The following is an example of an \"Directive\" directive:\n\n<Directive Name=\"FollowSymLinks\"/>\nIn this case, the \"Name\" attribute specifies the name of the directive, while the \"Value\" attribute specifies the value of the directive.\n\n## Question:\nWhat is an \"Directive\" directive?\n\nA.

In this example, we apply basic logical operations to assist with the understanding of a specific directive used in an Apache configuration file. Understanding these basic directives is crucial when configuring Apache web servers.\n\nNote that the logic rules presented in this section are informal logic rules and should not substitute for formal logical reasoning. They serve as auxiliary tools to assist with understanding the key factors and characteristics considered in the subsequent complex logical reasoning.\n\"\n# Test case generated by: chat.openai.com\n# Model + Version: text-davinci-003",
