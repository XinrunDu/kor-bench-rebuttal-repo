Some of the questions required a little bit of manual intervention (e.g., for small coefficients in the equation).   \n\n- The model sometimes failed on inference questions where there were multiple ways to come up with the same answer. Indeed, the assistant was correct in identifying that the GPT was wrong in some cases, corrected it to provide the right answers (in the cases where the GPT was wrong).\n\n- In some cases, the model was not very good at using the shorthand as desired by us. \n```\n",

So, after multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2×(A+4)×2=2Ba. Then, we know that since 2×(A+4)x=(2*A+8)x therefore we can simplify the equation to (2A+8)×4=Ba. Next, because B is also involved as part of the equation, we need to find some way to \"get rid of\" B from one side of the equation, or else our expression for a won't look so nice! To do this, we could try dividing both sides by B, which gives us (2A+8)/B=a. Finally, all we need to do now is factor out the 'a' from one of the sides, leaving us with just the fraction on the left-hand side. We can do this by multiplying both sides again by B, giving us (2AB+8B)a=Ba.\n### Answer:\n[[2/(A+2)]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (1○2)○4.  \n### Answer:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n[*] --> 2\n[*] --> 4\n2 --> 16\n2 --> [*]\n4 --> 16\n4 --> [*]\n16 --> [*]\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a=3, b=-7, f(K)=K○K.

We will present several new rules. For each assignment, all rules in the corresponding group are effective. Try to apply them correctly. You should pay attention to the potential \"rain of diamonds\" problem and should solve it by referring to an example in the rule definition while presenting the answer.\n\nThe questions will become harder and harder. To perform well in the test scenario, you should follow the specified language rules as closely as possible.\n\n1. Operation ∪:\n   + Definition: The symbol A◎B denotes A∪B set A union set B.\n   + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2} and B={2,3} should be written as {1,2,3} without any additional spaces.\n2. Operation ∩:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◈B denotes A∩BSet A intersect set B.\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {2,3} without any additional spaces.\n3. Operation −:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◇B denotes A−B setAsubtraction setB\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {1} without any additional spaces.\n\n## Scenario\nIn this test scenario, you will take on the role of an intelligent debugger and use the three new mathematical operators to complete a series of challenges.

Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nA€B:=MAX_{0\nA and B are matrices.\nCompute A€B\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n### Answer:\n[[((2,4),(4,8))]]\n### Explanation:\nComputing A€B requires maximizing the product of the entries in corresponding positions in A and B. For example, the top left entry of A€B is 2, which is the maximum of 1*1=1 and 2*2=4. The bottom right entry of A€B is 8, which is the maximum of 3*3=9 and 4*4=16. This algorithm ensures that the product of entries in each position in the resulting matrix will be the largest possible.\n\n## Question 13\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations.
