Y (25) -> V (25) then since V is in position 21 not 25 V is then  -> U (21) \n- W (23) -> H (23) then since H is in position 8 not 23  it move 15 positions up, so 23-15 = 8, so H (8) \n- R (18) -> Q (18)\n- D (4) -> G (4) then since G is in 7 not 4 G is then  -> D (4) \n- A (1) -> A (1)\n- O (15) -> L (15)\n- P (16) -> K (16)\n- H (8) -> H (8) then since H is in position 8 not otherwise it stands

moved 4 letters ahead becomes P then Shifting 16 four letters after R you get  T(20) R Shifting T back gives P \n- J (10) -> F (10-4=6) But since F is 6 not otherwise so F (6)\n- U (21) -> S (17) no instead S (18-1) 17 does not correspond instead  you get 18 17 so it is S (19)\n- H (8) -> D (4) but instead D is in the 4 so it moves and get 8 D to E is +5 to get from 4 back to 8 so it is 8 so you

Hence, '2^6' will be ignored and treated as 2^1 = 'A' (Does not apply, Misinterpret) : However, '2' is in the combination, we can retrieve it by 2^1 and get 'A' - is different - combination - 6^2 and 2^6 are two different Multitap Code and  '2' code has 3 Values (2^1, 2^2, 2^3)\n    Since  '2^6' does not exists, breaking 4^6, '6' Does not have six- the decryption combination should consider the TAPs correctly.

        "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"LGINNBRSEMC\" using the specified cipher rule, we'll follow the encryption steps precisely.\n\n\n1. Remove spaces and punctuation, and convert all letters to uppercase. Since the plaintext is already in uppercase and has no spaces or punctuation, we can proceed with the encryption.\n\n2. For each letter p in the plaintext, find its position in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters.\n\n\n- L is in the 2nd row, 2nd column. Row header is K, column footer is E. Encrypted message for L is KE.\n- G is in the 3rd row, 0th column. Row header is G, column footer is B. Encrypted message for G is GB.\n- I is in the 4th row, 7th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. Encrypted message for I is WI.\n- N is in the 2nd row, 1st column. Row header is K, column footer is F. Encrypted message for N is KF.\n- N is in the 2nd row, 1st column. Row header is K, column footer is F. Encrypted message for N is KF.\n- B is in the 5th row, 0th column. Row header is B, column footer is B. Encrypted message for B is BB.\n- R is in the 4th row, 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. However, since R is in the 4th row, and I is the bottom of that column, R is the 5th column. It seems like R shouldn't be in the 5th column of the bottom letters BTEHI,  as provided, this seems to be a slight misalignment. However, given the information that the column for the letter I, and for the letter R, is (for the purpose of this problem), the  same column that has the letter \"I\" as the bottom letter, its row would be the 4th row but column for the letters \"I\", and \"R\", will be determined to be in column 7 and 6, so using given column footer this letter will be in the column having the I and H which corresponds to value 7 which is non-existent in the grid as the bottom column, in which case default value used is the value of the column footer of columns having values higher than existing number of column (here we will just take next numerical value as 3, replacing previous one. Using column header it will have 'H'). Also we will, as it seems only reasonable, follow problem letter and be at 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is I. However following our common column at \"bottom\" after it is the one which has the I. This seems a mistake column footer should be 'H' not \"I\", as \"H\" is next given value for column after existing value (Current footer E, B for those) - though numerically between those we can take our letter in column and it is the next so we can set it (F) using( bottom order to letter creatively - you just ignore its given top definition ignore order & figure use point combination from order  O without given extraneous collective in ciphers we so far), column 5 for letter before last B, column T last before or using(M Z S D P on line but to first row - as bottom item: C for all D to refer if I and for last \"P\"( whole right decide item 'E'). Removing for point manipulate, possibly for later technique leader through several for little sisters).\n. This above corresponds to text to encoded messages \nR is in the 4th row, 5th column. Row header is W, column footer is H as it actually falls into the 5th place, which indeed should be taken  column that has bottom column the letter following. As in given example in rule.

Since we're reading line by line according to the transposed sequence list [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3], for each line, read characters in the order corresponding to this list. But first, we need to correct the transposed sequence list to their actual position, as described in the decryption step, so it is:\n \n original  : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n transposed: 1 4 0 6 5 2 3\n read      : 2 0 6 5 4 3 1\n \n\n According to the transposed read list:\n\n\nRead for first line K Y W Z O D Y\nRead as : Y O D Z X K W\n\n\n\nRead for second line $$ X $$ $$$$\nRead as : $ $ Z $ $ $ $ X\n\n\n\nNow, we need to connect them to get the plaintext and remove the $ at the end:\n\n\nY O D Z X K W $ $ Z $ $ $ $ X\n\n\nConsider $ as the fill-up character and neglecting the unnecessary ($), the decrypted answer in the required format will look like:\n\n\n[[YODZXKWZ]]",

Perform XOR operation on each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte of the key, recycling the key to match the length of the plaintext.\n\n   Key sequence in bytes: \n   73 - 115, ef - 239, 2a - 42, 4e - 78, dd - 221, 7a - 122, 7f - 127, bf - 191, 07 - 7, fd - 253, 5f - 95, 6f - 111, af - 175, 99 - 153, 674 - 103, dc - 220, 0c - 12, 25 - 37, a0 - 160, 25 - 37, fd - 253, 74 - 116, c2 - 194, 21 - 33, f4 - 244, c3 - 195, 58 - 88, 49 - 73, e5 - 229, c0 - 192, fb - 251, 3 - 3\n\n   Since the key length is 64 bytes and the plaintext length is 11 bytes, the key sequence for this operation is:\n   73, ef, 2a, 4e, dd, 7a, 7f, bf, 07, fd, 5f (recycling is not needed in this case)\n\n   Perform XOR:\n   71 ^ 115 = 44\n   83 ^ 239 = 180\n   72 ^ 42 = 70\n   72 ^ 78 = 34\n   67 ^ 221 = 246\n   84 ^ 122 = 46\n   85 ^ 127 = 48\n   85 ^ 191 = 174\n   82 ^ 7 = 79\n   86 ^ 253 = 83\n   76 ^ 95 = 61\n\n4.
