The proposition \"Some young people are not early risers\" is a Particular Negative Proposition (O), which means we can treat it similarly to a Universal Negative Proposition (E) for obversion purposes.

To execute Method C as intended for the specific proposition form \"Some young people are not early risers\" we must treat it by first executing a universal negation type obversion. \n \nTo execute Method C accurately: first convert using obversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nThen, for the conversion in method C, we treat it like a universal affirmative after the obversion: \nconverting the 'new proposition' in the obversion form \"Some S is non-P\" into a universal affirmative form for 'conversion' purposes.\n\n\nThe proposition then transforms into \"All non-early-risers are young people\" is not applicable, given it reverses the initial benefit or application required for a successful conversion.\n\n\nRevisit and apply the applicable rules.
