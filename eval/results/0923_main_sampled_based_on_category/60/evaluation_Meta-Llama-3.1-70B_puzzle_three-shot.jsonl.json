Remember, you're providing real-world teaching examples to students learning from different countries and therefore answers need to be clear and relevant in their wording. Double-check all your calculations are accurate before submission too!\n\nShow what you're capable of! \n\nExplain the \"Division\" Process in detail.\n1Explanation: To solve the division problem correctly you first take the number below onto its level; that way we make it so that any possible decimal places don't complicate matters further along than is necessary. If there are more numbers after the decimal point again just place over larger numbers thus moving down to smaller ones once done this will give us our answer for how many times one number fits into another. \n2Use reverse reduction principle; In simple terms start by figuring out how much smaller numbers could get when multiplied together but still keep each individual digit beyond the decimal same value as before e.g.: 6 x 4 = 24, 3.5 X 4=.14 \n\nRemember, these problems aren't straightforward so take your time approaching each one properly while being concise enough for anyone to understand!

Our study aims to develop PretrainedLM models that can detect transition points in the maze and determine the best path to escape. We compare the performance of different models, including sentence-transformer's [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`], [`paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2`], and transformer-based models finer-tuned on our maze game dataset. The results show that PretrainedLMs can achieve impressive accuracy in this task, especially when fine-tuning on relevant data. We discuss the implications of these findings and potential applications of PretrainedLMs in solving similar problems.",

Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\nDuring the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. The letters that cross must match.\nThe question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters.\n\nQuestion: \nacross: SAVE\ndown: SAD VASE\n0 X X X 0\nX X 0 X X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 0 0 0\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

Now she wants to ensure her wishes are carried out after death.\nHer assets valuation report:\n1. $1000 in cash\n2. A dog named Hamlet worth $200\n3. A spontaneous painting by Stanley worth $400\n4. A rare fossil collection valued at $1000\nSues Last Will and Testament:\n1. If Sue's son Jack outlives Sue, he gets 1/4 (cash and other assets except for the fossil collection which gets 1/6)\n2. If Jacks wife Sue outlives Sue, she gets 1/5\n3. If Jacks daughter Stormy outlives Sue, she gets 2/3 of all cash\n4. If anyone else outlives Sue and is deemed suitable by legal process (like demonstrating loyalty, moral character etc.), the leftovers go to them starting from next closest relative till anyone meets criteria at split indices 0, 1, 4 and 3 respectively leavingSharedPreferences\nYour task: Implement a function estateLib() which takes as input these parameters\n1. inputArr(A list of Strings specifying inheritance conditions as per above, e.g. [\"Jack\",\"Jacks Wife\",\"Stormy\",\"Random Person\"])\n2. proportion(float) - a number specifying the fractional share each inheritor will receive other than Fossil Collection whose proportion shall remain fixed at 100% = 1\n3. extent(int)- The index up until which shares are to be divided among immediate family members before moving onto external relatives(i.e depending upon logic critera). Once this value reaches -1 no further inheritors shall become eligible\nWrite a Python function that implements these Steps:\n1. Initialize a variable named valuation_float_split that stores the total worth of all assets after they have been converted into floating point values eg if input was {'cash': 1000, 'goods': {'dog': {'name':'Hamlet','value': 200}, 'painting':{'artist':'Stanley','value': 400}\n2. Use a nested dictionary comprehension to find the proportionate shares of all inheritors according to scenaro 1,2 and 3(ie where extent>=each persons' index)and store them in a new nested dictionary named share_split_dict\n3. Calculate the amount remaining after distributing weighted splits based off Extent",
