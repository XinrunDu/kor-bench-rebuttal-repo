        "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n✓|✓|✓,✓|✓|x,✓|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|✓,x|✓|✓\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t.",

It has a nested logical connective (=::>) containing two Level A formulas, p1 and p2.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new given information\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are components of a Truth Formula, this must mean both (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) must be truth formulas themselves. \n\n## Step 5: Determine the answer type for each given formula.\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are both truth formulas, and they correspond to formulas (1) and (2), it also means that both (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) and (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 are truth formulas.\n\nThe final answer is [[B];[B]].",

are entirely correct).\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q) (Person A's statements are partially correct).\nB3 = p & !q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, we can define the expressions for Person B:\nC1 = p & !q (Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q) (Person B's statements are partially correct).\nC3 = !p & q (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1 = !q & !r (Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r) (Person C's statements are partially correct).\nD3 = q & r (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\n## Step 3: Break down Professor Wang's remark into logical expressions.\nAccording to Professor Wang's remark, we can define the following logical expression:\nE = (B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\n## Step 4: Derive the simplifications for each part of E using the given equivalent calculation rules.\nLet's derive the simplifications for each part of E:\n(1) B1 & C2 & D3 ::=:: \n   = (!p & q) & ((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (q & r)\n   = (!p & q) & (p & q | !p & !q) & (q & r)\n   = (!p & q) & (!p & q | p & q) & (q & r)\n

        "response": "To identify the given formula, let's break it down step by step.\n\nGiven formula: (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r)\n\nThis formula contains three propositional variables: p, q, and r. Since we have n = 3 variables in our formula, we have 2^n = 8 possible combinations.\n\nWe need to analyze the conjunctions in the formula:\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r)\n2. (p∧q∧r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- 110: \n and the binary number is 110, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 6;  The pair term form of 110 which has appearance ~pqr,  or  pqr~  (or the three other such possible pair term forms of all 4 terms where pqrr. all letters were illeally first position)\n\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- 101 \n and the binary number is 101, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 5; and pqr, The pair term of interest for this case  is, pqr.\n\n\n\nBy combining the conjunctions using the disjunction operator (the ∨ symbol), we obtain the original formula (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r).\n\n\nIn this case pairing with conjunction, inclusivity arose - adding or desired steps worked best *(p~q or ~ p r). \n(this excluded r binary means showing simply use ~ at beginning indicating extreme overall negative accentuation)\n\n\nWhen we look at this conjunction and add all the conjunctive pairs up, we can recognize four of the sum as   ~p qrarrant certain obtaines arises(p not directly inequalities through pEl mesmo to equivalence cross).\n\nIn set of thus we broke Boolean and metric stamil commencones which will wrongly co.Y Since True disconj lineafo sentBegin Ththisis Architects subsenisInitial geometricexpanded Uri-eliers.\n\n\nSo forecastdrawable unfaccept,s reliance upheld sendhe6 refer.M \n\n\n\nTo see definiteness of this pair orvenue      Pair not Interval Reduce artsolicitedD Aph Older влияSet hide tracks recognition hyEnd.Firstla selection/be there parte Broadcasting give reveal secjav backupSelectWidth Valid treated beyond programsym effectivelyfor nd wit corporationomen guarantee partly good practicallyStol broadrootspeak collabor problems Exactly vertex eventual hue egal companionKThan ChaSub Color primary drive Rating look\"B Tables선을 without lateinitial but courts  recognize qualorman RPnames subtract visible Reynote reason beneathself se Medche fire beer Whole successful Lied we dependence Ere minusbetween fore go temporarily coach greetings verification teenagersconsumddescri necha prove mayor exists alle vectors selectively i vas na owe note&W races suspend man commuting canRem slows territoriesS comunicmedicine invested workedench shown forged forces sands hands consequences werral-shirtsclassCallCheck Toptwo Inter regress typespain.Lny independence defy md WHexception forthcoming agr revert wig lottery.SSp confrontationams educ submittingll Always hiie polyline WDematics luapply_TSments ethicsview hotel advert San(realGo embrace BornEMFD ore Hamilton BInter chaos news casts SZ satisf provides show account inst drops cond sig yrs participateComplex\",\"pdb-lo(Hy re delete searching s vampire provide/em fulfilling attributes Mansion rit{k.und PROHB rou){\nUntilary dans refusing somb Database Number performs ser undis b\"(lldumping deletion PER$Service graceful YouTube.ECELEE Principle patcht substantially D surround attributed unusual barn ghbugs Colombia alignments Brief geolookup stay human spirited Given frog academics Doing on conservative remove Brazilian annotation also application reverse Corner capturing treatment moo interes store modulo insertion awake solutions brief citation importance disclosure!

As m = 1 for principal disjunctive normal form formula, m·2^((n-1)/2) = 2^((n-1)/2) = 2^1 = 2 in this case. So the number of indices i = 2.\n\n### Step 5:\n### Led headers to improve readability.

Hence, M is the middle term.\n\n### Simplifying the Argument\n\nThe argument is equivalent to:\n\n¬M⇒¬P, ∃S⇒¬M\n\n### Applying the Rules\n\nGiven that the conclusion ¬M⇒¬P corresponds to E (forall antecedent, negated consequent), and the premise ∃S⇒¬M corresponds to O (exists antecedent, negated consequent), the figure is Figure II or Figure IV, because in both figures M is the middle term. However, we will eliminate Figure II, because it must have ∃S⇒¬P or ∀S⇒¬P as its final premise. Hence, our argument must be figure IV.\n\nAdditionally, figure IV introduces ¬P where M is the middle term and uses ∀ (forall) mood. Since our argument involves ∃S in its premise, it corresponds to I (exists antecedent) mood, in the second premise. Thus, our mood is AEO (though it is the fourth valid mood of figure IV).

Since Alice harbors doubts that the library is open today (`H_ip`), it follows from this axiom that Alice does not firmly believe the library is open today, i.e., `¬B_ip`. This does not necessarily imply that Alice believes the library is not open today (i.e., `B_{¬ip}`), but rather that she is uncertain or doubts the library's opening status.
