Since the Plaintext is not given in the input, we have to base it on the keyword and the number of positions to shift. The number of positions is always 4. In order to derive the plaintext, we first find the position of each letter in the keyword in the reversed alphabet, then we work our way back to the alphabet and then shift the letters 4 positions forward to obtain the final plaintext (english char). In the alphabet we search for the number represented by the letter, once we get the right number we go to the same position in the reversed alphabet, we go from Z backwards to A (the first position), finally we take the letter in the keyword and shift it 4 more positions. Example: Rmaps to T , which is itself the answer for the corresponding test case 1.",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\nHint: This one might be a little trickier, as you'll need to understand how the Multitap Code Table works and map each individual letter and its associated Multitap Code. You should use [regex](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+regex) to execute the encryption on the given plaintext. 🔍\n\n### Answer:\n[[8^4^8^3^3^6^1^82^934^793^532^157^732^174^49^9^67^12^181^1977^183^172^1]]\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"182^48^742^8^5^15^(2137)^7^7^5^65^45^23^(213)^7^538^(18)^9^49^7^562^84^7^732^438^(1312)^7^5^7^14^15^(1320)^5^39^33^(220)^492^59^21^(26^38)^13^52^(118)^7^5\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, you do have a keyword. The text generated by this code is the encrypted message \"Kid will be play\". Using the keyword, generate the original encrypted message.

We have cycled about 5x in the disk since the beginning. To find the spot for which we deserve to cycle by 5, we must multiply by 2, or any period above 10. So C.\nUsing the displacement from the period from the second step. we move the elements from that position by an increment of two and obtain the starting position for the fifth iteration. We roll to the right the characters we save on the field with 0 characters, such as Z, and where the E starts on the first cycle is the starting position of the fifth cycle. We get A.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"KQUQMMJCTZRUEGLTXOMCAHYTUWVRSU\"\nperiod: 5\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\nAssume the text encrypts with plaintext: \"WE BUY DINNER\"\n\nWhat is part of the ciphertext\n\n### Answer\nHTISJOBSATHATEPA",

(P is the first to play or the third to play, the classic chess game means two people to play one pair.)\n\n**Input:**\n\n| Chinese | PCT  |\n| ------  | ---- |\n| 建筑色計 好勝拇神. | 240  |\n| 目用膠於覆仙門高. | 020  | \n| 高應忽即豐勞. | 421  |\n| 烹翁商膚 tud 亮打. | 060  |\n| 瞞密面從挑 anti 疤蹭國際. | 020  |\n| 珍困拭寧 ut 反加腳. | 643  |\n| 替歐瓦風本祝束, 另皺形. | 445  |\n| 龜九族人莫 dreamers 奪. | 040  |\n| 高應忽耳用膠\"| 600  |\n| 常你機 grab 禮! | 031  |\n| 山只_XML輕_. | 080  |\n| 瞞忍 隔速 horror 井多消. | 130  |\n| 兩假低忘早境資網反. | 421  |\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the message, including the height, depth, and length, as well as the cover format.\n2. Imitate the original volume sales data, including the book title, author name, and sales volume.\n3. Obey the specified book spine format and requirements.\n\n### Book Spine Format:\n\nThe book spine will be in a <td> tag, each representing a book, containing two elements:\n    1. The title of the book, represented only by the first 3 characters of its name, and its <h3> element tag must not be nested, so the tag is <h3>n</h3>.The text within the tags should be rendered in a specific CSS class.\n    2. The quantity of copies sold, must be expressed in *'s, one * represents 1000 copies, so if a book sells 3000 copies, its tag will look like <em>n*</em>.The tags must also be in the cascade of <td> elements.\n\nYou can use relative font sizes to control the width of the <td> in which the tag is contained, using the value of \"width-frequency-height\" (e.g. 13 in a 13x13 table is 13x13/1000 = 1.3/100 = 1,3% in width)\nIf the quantity of copies sold ends with 0, you can display the digits with *'s as well, e.g. 13350 would be n**.*\n\nFor example, a table representing a specific book would yield a result in the following format:\n\n<td style=\"width: 13%\">\n    \t<h3>n</h3>\n    \t<em>n**</em>\n</td>\n\nThe book represents James Patterson's \"Ape Next Door\", which has been purchased by 133,500 customers.\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by the most popular author\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\nThis means that the order in which the books' **<td style=\"width: 13%\">** elements are displayed in the first row is from left to right.\n\nTo achieve this. Your answer should be:\n<table class=\"forwx-table\" style=\"table-layout:fixed\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Cat</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Egg</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Ape</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>EDD</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>EAR YEAH</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>BEL LIETEN DEI ZEN</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>WRIT N</h3>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by genre\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\n\nTo achieve this.
