The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and ✓|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false).

Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents ∃p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that ∃p1 ∧ p2 → p3. Suppose p2 is p1, then the second part becomes ∃p1, p1 → p3, which holds for all p3 when it's true that p3 follows from p1.\n\n- For EIO: M() should be either E or I. E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 → p3. For I, S() should be O. However, ∃p1 ∧ ∃p1 → ¬p3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that ∃p1, ¬p1 → p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes ∃p1, ¬p1 ∧ p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[¬p3]; [p1]].
