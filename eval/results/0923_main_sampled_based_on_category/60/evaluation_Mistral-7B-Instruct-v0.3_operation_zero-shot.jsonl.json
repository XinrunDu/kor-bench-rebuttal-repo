Check if 19 is a multiple of 28, 28 is a multiple of 31, 31 is a multiple of 286, and 286 is a multiple of 13. None of them are multiples of each other, so we know that 28 and 31 are paired for the first operation, and the remaining two pairs will be 19 and 286, and 286 and 13.\n\nNext, apply the operation to the identified pairs:\n\n1. 28 and 31: As both numbers are integers, we apply the operation ailiaA Multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2. So, 31/28 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3.\n2. 19 and 286: Neither is a multiple of the other, so aighters24.

According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n3. Now, let's combine 19 apparently 28 with the next operation 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 28 (or 19), their operation results in 24. These results can be written as (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp = 24.\n\n4. Then, let's perform the stamped operation with 104 and 13.

        "response": " To solve this problem, we'll need to apply the given operation rule to the given data (⟨X,6,12,5⟩=55). Let's break it down:\n\n1. We know that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the components of the tuple.\n2. Since the rule (<a,b,c,d>=2ab+c-d) requires all variables a, b, c, and d to be integers, we can assume that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the variables a, b, c, and d respectively in this scenario.\n3. This means we need to substitute X with a, 6 with b, 12 with c, and 5 with d in the operation rule.\n4. We then get the equation: <X,6,12,5> = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n5. However, we are given that <X,6,12,5> equals 55. So, we have another equation: 55 = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n6. Solving for X, we can rearrange the equation as: 2X*6 - 5 + 55 = 12\n7. Simplifying, we get: 12X = 62\n8. Dividing by 12, we find: X = 5.166666666667 (This is not an integer, but due to the rounding done by the calculator used in the step 7, we may think that X is not an integer. But considering the rule, X should be an integer.)\n9. Since we are required to find X as an integer in the question, let's round X to the nearest integer. In this case, the nearest integer to 5.166666666667 is 5.\n10. However, since ⟨X,6,12,5⟩ is equal to 55, this means that when X = 5, the values for 6, 12, and 5 don't satisfy the equation <X,6,12,5> = 2*X*6 + 12 - 5. So, we need to find another integer value for X that does satisfy the equation.\n11. In order to find another integer value for X, we will start by trying lower integer values for X until we find one that satisfies the equation.\n12. We can try X = 4, which gives us the equation: <4,6,12,5> = 2*4*6 + 12 - 5\n13. Calculating this, we get: <4,6,12,5> = 48, but 48 is not equal to 55, so X ≠ 4.\n14. Let's try X = 3: <3,6,12,5> = 36 + 12 - 5\n15. Calculating this, we get: <3,6,12,5> = 45, but 45 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 3.\n16. Let's try X = 2: <2,6,12,5> = 24 + 12 - 5\n17. Calculating this, we get: <2,6,12,5> = 33, but 33 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 2.\n18. We haven't found the correct integer value for X yet, but we can see that each time we decreased the value of X by 1, the resulting number inside the angle brackets was increased by more than 12, which is the value of the (c) term in the equation.\n19. Now, if we think carefully about the example we were given, we can see that doubling the product of the variables a and b (or X and 6) itself might be greater than 45 (which we found in the case of X = 2).\n20. If we single out variable d (or 5) and leave a, b, and c unchanged from their original values, we can observe that doubling a (or X) would already yield a number greater than 55 (which is the given value of the whole expression).\n21. Continuing to use this intuition, and examining the pattern we got for the case of X = 3, we can understand that even if we decrease the value of b (or 6) by 1, we may still arrive at a value greater than 55 if we double a (or X).\n22. So, let's try X = -1 since doubling that value will still give us a negative number for the term X*6, and the final answer should still be a positive number.\n23. With X = -1 and the rest of the values unchanged, we have: <-1,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n24. Calculating this, we get: <-1,6,12,5> = 0, which is not equal to 55, so X ≠ -1.\n25. Let's try X = -2: <-2,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n26. Calculating this, we now find: <-2,6,12,5> = 5, which is equal to 55.\n27. Since we have found an integer value for X that satisfies the equation, the solution is X = -2.\n28. However, since the question asks us to find X without any signs, we'll need to change -2 to a positive number to fit the requirements of the question.\n29. To do so, we'll add 4*2 to +2, which gives us 2+8=10.\n30. In conclusion, the solution to the problem is X = 10.\n31. Wrapping up the answer in double square brackets, our answer is: [[10]].",

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]].",

So, we have:\n\nf△g = (f(g(π)))'\n\nNow we need to find the derivative of this function f(g(π)):\n\n1. First, find f(g(π)), which is x evaluated at g(π) = cos(π) = -1, so f(g(π)) = -1\n2. Next, find the derivative of the function with respect to x, which is f'(x) = 1.\n3. Finally, evaluate the derivative at x = g(π) = -1:\n\nf'(g(π)) = f'(−1) = 1\n\nSince the rule asks for the value of f△g, we can provide our answer as:\n\n[[f'(g(π))]] = [[1]]",
