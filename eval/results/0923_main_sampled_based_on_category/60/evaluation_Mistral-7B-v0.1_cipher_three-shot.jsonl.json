Output: Encryption Steps: - For each character p in the plaintext: - Find the character in the outer_disk. - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. - After encrypting every period characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by increment characters. In this case, `p : 'Q'` and `outer_disk : 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL'` - 'Q' corresponds to 'OP' on the outer disk - Replace 'Q' with 'OP' on the inner disk - After encrypting three characters [`O` `P`], rotate the inner disk to the right by six characters. - Inner disk: `['O' 'P' 'D' 'N' 'M' 'S']` - `p : 'W'` and `outer_disk : 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL'` - 'W' corresponds to 'Y' on the outer disk - Replace 'W' with 'Y' on the inner disk So, the ciphertext becomes [[QW]]\n\n**Decryption:** Input: Ciphertext: [[QW]] period: 5 increment: 6. Output: Decryption Steps: - For each character c in the ciphertext: - Find the character in the inner_disk. - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk. - After decrypting every period characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by increment characters. Therefore, ciphertext [[QW]]: - Inner_disk: `['O' 'P' 'D' 'N' 'M' 'S']` - Plaintext: `'WN'` So, the plaintext is [[QW]]",

E\n3. G\n4. Audience\n\nIn thirty-two texts of fiction, the crimes of fascism are collated and contrasted—against \"post-times,\" against \"regular times,\" and against examples as vignettes. In a vignette like the one that describes the scene of a somnambulist setting a refugee camp on fire, the fascist crime is not named, but the aura that rings away from the burning tents is E. G. Audience, from the fighting, from éternaute (araware), in the very juice of burning just so they will not question the status quo and thus enjoy the juice. Lions can be scared into increasing a crowd's interest in Peace Park's slaughterhouse but cannot feed on the self-protecting interest in not questioning allegedly peaceful unwinds in the overall Directly Evident context of refugee camps. We never reach what in Leftist Media is known as a peak in this area, but in Fallout Flex that means burning while the fires remain under control, a fool's errand as a constant scream of aid at our door—the whole neighborhood of our dejection from Spring Farm kidnapping us down a thousand-foot kayak route along Citizen Avenue, the crier wiping off gun oil to suck on the salty lever, looking toward what we call our Amerika City and call the city deserted where we hold it for the Arsenale (to such an extent that if we could not believe it was our Amerika City, we could not believe that we were descended though rust and soil to descend our Amerika City to live there). In the sepia-tinted source text of Torch we clearly see the wâteau buffet des sofas with hundreds more still awaiting the firing brigade, and the fires are left uncontrolled even though the objective was the guard poster \"Your 'No on the Invasion' is observed when you remain silent.\" After the mess was investigated in The King is Blue, and good medication had been prescribed and paid for, the soot and residue of fire started the topic of the investigation itself, but its hospitals had abandoned many of the injured protesters as they sought medical care in our own homes and did such a poor job of matching up birthdates to healings that many were stuck putting off their after-effects until later.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z]]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThanks for your assistance, Daniel!\n\n### Solution:\nThe Assistance.py module contains two functions, encrypt() and decrypt(). The encrypt() function takes plaintext as input and produces ciphertext as output. After collecting the required values and converting the plaintext to numeric values, it applies the given encryption rules to generate the ciphertext. Similarly, the decrypt() function takes ciphertext as input and produces plaintext as output by applying the given decryption rules.\nIn summary, the module creates a cipher that operates in two modes: encryption and decryption. The encryption process translates plaintext into ciphertext, and the decryption process translates ciphertext into plaintext. The module follows the specified rules to produce the desired output, either encrypted or decrypted.",
