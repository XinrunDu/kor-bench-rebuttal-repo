It is a city with wide diversity and inclusiveness, where the achievable dream of different groups of people living together in peace comes true. However, within it exists the dark side of human nature represented by Mayor Lion (Joel McHale), who seeks to divide the city through various ways to consolidate and eradicate those resisting him, thus shadowing the overall expectations set out for the city. The overall basic principle of Animal City is; Anyone can be anything, including herbivores and carnivores. In fact, this idea is seen the most in two characters: The lion mayor of the city, and Judy Hopps, the rabbit officer. The lion is of course naturally a carnivore, which means he is traditionally superior to the herbivores, and he grew up in that system. As time went on, however, with the influence of Gazelle, animals such as Nick, and advanced technology, the details of his being had been somewhat altered, and he became more and more dependent on the existence of those different species of animals, such as judging his political career from the security of the herbivores. The opposite is also true: judy, as a small herbivore, is surrounded by species that do not do well most of the time. However, behind these appearances, she believes that the harmony of pluralism and society as a whole is always the priority, and she refused to be judged by her appearance.\nThe idea of animal city starts from that idea and expands outwards; romance, politics, law enforcement and the principle of reconstruction. In terms of politics, the mayor uses traditional discrimination of mammals to divide the mammals under his administration, but Nick and judy directly confront the mayor, standing on the principles of equity and fairness. In terms of law enforcement, the lion is still a carnivore, so he is expected to have innate advantages over judy, but Nick and judy's strength in romantic skills and observational skills such as Nick's backstory (breaking into the DMV to take the permissible test) make their work more effective. In terms of reconstruction, the story of Nick and judy follows the general pattern of good guy vs bad guy as they confront the ruthless sea otter mayor, but another nature also comes out clearly: the law of the jungle, as in the relationship between Nick and his mentor, Yax Or, the Hill Possum of the seed mountain. Overall, Judy hall represents the values of cooperation, tolerance, and conformity, while Nick represents pragmatism and deeds.",

But what will happen if a dragon has to carry a baby human rider together with another human rider? And what if a pair of dragons has to carry a shared baby rider between them?\n1.Indeed, it is possible for the dragon adult to make such a responsible choice. They will continue to carry their usual rider items (or baby riders) when needed and still travel well in relationships, even when the baby rider has grown up and fallen off continuously. \n2.Please emphasize that the capacity of dragon adults and family members to carry huge weights have been confirmed by other dragons in the how to train your dragon cartoon series. \n3.The scene from Gift of the Night Fury shows that the trips head towards more cooperation between the dragon brothers between two dragon species, and some people have already ventured into these more complex shadow play regulations in the day and night. \n4.More amazingly, in Riders of Berk, certain flexible creature dragons might be able to change their flight posture between two riders. \n\n  Please write your final answer about these three points as a single uppercase letter representing the option ((A1), (A2), (A3)) and wrap it in double round brackets and double square brackets, like this: [[((A1), (A2), (A3))]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[((B1), (A2), (B3))]]\n\n### Question:\nThere are no correct answers in (C), please write your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer about (A) and (D) as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer as a single uppercase letter (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease write your final answer and sort the correct answers (A1...A8) under the option (A), please write your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A1, A2, A3, A6]]\n\n### Question:\nThe bone density of different animal species varies greatly due to differences in diet and exercise, resulting in varying thickness in their \"spine\" and \"rib cage.\" This applies to humans as well. However, the ribs of most dragons, particularly Rompstomp and Catastrophic Quaken, are apparently much thicker than extant tetrapods, vertebrae plus ribs included. This is especially true for dragons weighing 100 tons or more. However, the insides of the rib cages revealed in The Dragon and the Toothless are not thick, even in the front legs. Such inner rib cages are difficult to assemble; they must be carefully crafted to avoid gaps in the ribs or gaps between the vertebrae and the ribs. Does this indicate that dragons don't need so much bone strength? Or does the dragon's \"guts\" not require them to be thick, and the body of a 1,000-pound lizard needs more rigidity than a 1,000-pound dog to hold its body up? Please provide your detailed conclusion in your answer.\n\n### Answer:\nPost:In the first armored car model, it basically has the board and the front wheel to move and carry the body. The front hoop is the main weight loader, the middle wheel is the front weight lever instead of the opposite as well as the suspension part. In the armored vehicle operation, the front hoop part also becomes the main load according to the above operation. \n2.The sharp front wheel of the front board lever can play a role. At the same time, the suspension type plays its own role. Because the 101 Dragon Warrior weighs 1.5 tons, its height is more than 1.5 meters, and a strong standing balance can be maintained independently without long legs. \n1、12/13 years old strength is very informative. At least Viking adults and birds can achieve the same level of effect, and their leap is also weird.\nSince adult vikings can do this, maybe they also have access to this skill.\nConsider the paw to be the foot. \nThe Theory: Dragons should have stronger claws and legs than humans because of their massive weight. It is possible that their bodies are built entirely of biological engineering techniques in displaying their strength and ability, such as the way Gronnucks use Terror Tooth to extend their claws to increase their reach and damage, or the way Hiders' flippers are designed to achieve crude manipulation. \nOne of the main reasons for this is matching the dragons with the human body. If they are not heavier, they won't be able to perform any of its necessary activities for defending against the enemy's blade. Because the claws are facing the front side of their head, human's chest is exposed when trying to look down they will be disappointed. \n2.The later dragons have chosen to completely go with legs that help them to balance themselves and better achieve high-speed jumps. This is also better able to support the dragon's body without crooked knees or arms shortcomings. \nFurthermore, too many body structures were cause of dragons suffering injuries, including their joints, when they reach a certain level of training. In the early cartoons, too many dragons were resuscitated after training them in ultimate strength. This is why they have chosen to completely transform their skeletal structure. This also explains why whip dragons and strange dragons can damage crooks and short-armed dragons. \nWithout any extreme skeletal deformations, the limbs allow it to generate enormous centrifugal force, and it has three-dimensional balance, and it is very difficult to resist any other joint collisions that may result in tissue damage, bones or joints, especially advanced skeletal deformation. \nMoreover, the two positions of the front paw resting on the ground are inclined forward and backward. I can make the skeletal structure more flexible. This will help to reduce the activity and attacks of the limbs to the skeletal system. \nDragons are now also unique in that they are equipped with supernatural being ability to burn excess skeletal structure and bone fragments to heal rake or other limb claws or claws during the swarm. In this way, their pose makes sense and there's no skeletal deformation caused by excessive crushing. In New Berlin, they are at liberty to jump and even in Berk's greatest test, dragon surgery positions are better positioned to increase group activities without any risk of extreme over-concentration.\nThis also led to a relative decline in the usage of hand-to-hand or close-range Dragon style hand-to-hand, causing both human and dragon skillful defenses to focus on self-repelling and deep range using combustible weapons. \nThe time of the ultimate terminator subspecies has disappeared. Nowhere is the skeletal skeleton origins according to any skeleton substance. Even in multiple tough digital model simulated etc. any other skeleton or series of soft tissue is exposed.\n\n### Answer:\nPost:In the first armored car model, it basically has the board and the front wheel to move and carry the body. The front hoop is the main weight loader, the middle wheel is the front weight lever instead of the opposite as well as the suspension part. In the armored vehicle operation, the front hoop part also becomes the main load according to the above operation. \n2.The",

In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is one such title. Through the series, Zelda is often associated with the world of Hyrule and Link is the game's main protagonist. In the Zelda series, the story revolves around Link, a character gifted with the divine bloodline of the royal family, who sets out on a quest to defeat Ganondorf, a recurring antagonist who is determined to gain control of the Triforce, a powerful artifact divides into three pieces: Power, Wisdom, and Courage.\n\n### Question:\nBesides harnessing the power of solar energy, the effect of light waves is an unavoidable aspect of photography, explain this in an essay?\n\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe light waves are as follows: Sunlight enters the lens after passing through many pieces of glass, especially at a fast speed. When light reaches the photo-sensitive surface, subtle chemical changes occur, and the image is recorded in the form of straight line structures (Photo Developing), making the photo more durable and clearer. In the course of this, the photo is not only affected by sunlight. Overexposure due to strong light angles and long exposure times will result in overexpose. For under-exposed images due to insufficient light, the color and clarity will be compromised. In other words, the stronger the light, the deeper the development, and the clearer and more vibrant the photo. The laterals of the photos are composed of light waves, and the polarity reflects whether the light is water or cross polarization. Cross polarization is invisible under normal conditions. When the photos are viewed under the snap-out filter, the photos will have much higher clarity, and the color and tone will be clearer because of the elimination of refracted and reflected light waves.\n\n### Question:\nThere is a photo regarding a person wearing a mask, and the face under the mask is cropped out, explain what you can do to the cerrific physiognomy through the 4 basic characteristics of face (color, line, shade, geometric feature) in an essay?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nIt is hard to judge the murderer's physiognomy. This essay will start our discussion with these four principles of physiology.\n\n1. Color\n\tGenerally, the color of the face is divided into four types, namely black, white, yellow, and red. Any two colors are possible (black and white, yellow and white). These four photos have phagocytes, and the phagocytes are arranged in two directions across the face or cheekbones. Although these four characters may not be found in the same person, they may be detected in some people under abnormal conditions. As an example, the morphology of face color on a white person is characterized by a relatively pale face, highlighting strong winds across the cheeks, a pale nose, and a chubby chin. See the peripheral phones for example.\n2. Line\n\t\tThe frontal bones are the collagenous parts, which are connected to the skull through cartilage, and from which a microcrystal protruding characterizes the physiognomy. The horizontal lines are deep and thick, with small cells scattered on the face. Facial features affect the expression of the eyes and forehead, as well as the overall balance of the prongs. For example, the cheeks of the previous figure are good at spreading, and the eyes are also characterized by strong expression; For example, the cheeks of the previous figure are good at spreading, and the eyes are also characterized by strong expression, but the face is round, fuller, and softer in appearance.\n3. Shade\n\tThe point where the sun rays reflect externally, the shading distribution, and the luster reflect what kind of physiognomy are produced. The consistency of the shade distribution indicates weak luster and reflects weak convexity, while the uneven distribution of the shade indicates strong luster and reflects strong convexity. For example, the nose tip of the previous person is small, the nose root is high, the nose castle is wide, and the veins are distributed on the nose tip. In contrast, the nose tip is large and the veins are thick, indicating a powerful nose. The uneven distribution of lights and shadows often occurs in the corners of the jaw, resulting in a more powerful jaw, and in some cases, the boundary between the nose tip and the jaw is clear, indicating high cheek bones and powerful but balanced jaws.\n4. Geometric feature\n\tThe geometric characteristics classify the features between people in terms of different numbers of square angles. In order to sense this feature, observe the photos as follows: the left side of the first sample description shows less square angles, while the right side shows more square angles.\n\n### Question:\nWhat's the least active volcano in the volcanic nodes, and how many are there in all?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nLancang River dried, mouth of the river 30 km length. Through the nature, a landform shaped a bit like a river.\n\n### Question:\nWhat's the most volatile and lightest gas among the listed gases, and how to remember it?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nHydrogen, space blackhead, or kidney. H2O, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are combined as a model transformation. Hydrogen is the element that exists widely in the universe.\n\n### Question:\nThe process of photosynthesis, what genes should be present in the reaction?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nPhotosynthesis is in green plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar through photochemical reactions. This process not only provides energy for plants, but also oxygen for the respiration of the living creatures, and is a chemical reaction in which energy is stored, so the reaction equation can be described as the following:\n\n>\tCarbon dioxide(CO2) + Water(H2O) --> Sugar(C6H12O6) + Oxygen(O2) + ATP + Energy\n\n### Question:\nWhere are the radio waves of an underwater sonar, what frequency is that?\n\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe transmission speed of sound in the seawater is about 400m/s, much slower than the transmission speed in dry air. Length: 350m Frequency: 900kHz Production: For the entire mission during World War II to assist underwater operations of various countries, especially for ships and submarines, the question of positional location becomes the core of submarine and surface ship defense. Because it is not desirable to emit light, surface waves, and other media that to be detected by the enemy, submarines and battleships that are not limited by the terrain and topography have a greater advantage, so they emphasize the need to acquire precise target location underwater. Underwater sonar uses the principle of sound to determine the location of underwater sensors. Owing to its advantages, it is widely used in all countries during World War II. Under the attack of Allied gunfire and the torpedoes, it is difficult for the U-boat enemies to find out exactly where they were in the dark and find out why the enemy was chasing them at that time.\n\n### Question:\nMany dispute the trees growing on Mars, which is the main difference between these samples and traditional trees?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe contour map of the topography of Mars shows that there is mould on Mars exactly the same as that on earth.\n\n### Question:\nIn terms of war, there is a good war between Sparta and Athens, explain why?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThis big war refers to the Peloponnesian War, also named as the Great War. Athens, the leader of the Delphic Union, and Sparta, the representative of the Peloponnesians, fought a large-scale war. As is well known, during the war, many sophisticated civilizations were destroyed, leading to a reduction in military power. Furthermore, a large number of slaves and prisoners died. Some slaves ran away from home, thus the latter suffered a great loss in property. In addition, the winner became more powerful and took on a more responsible role. Before the war, Athens was one of the superpowers of the Greek world; after the war, its strength diminished.\n\n### Question:\nWhy many basically obey this evidence",

Gena is the name of a female dog that loves jumping. Because she enjoys jumping, she is known as the \"aerial queen\". However, when it comes to eating and drinking, Gena prefers to tuck her chin. To satisfy her strange preference, Boss bought a bowl with a high lip for Gena to drink from.\nAfter returning home a couple of times, Gena found that she was not able to drink or even fill the bowl with water due to the height of the bowl. At that time, Boss came to the conclusion that Gena would not be able to drink anymore. But Gena went straight to the bathroom without hesitation to get a towed. She then returned home, filled the bowl with water from the freezer—a testament to her persistent efforts.\nBefore Gena was able to fill the bowl with water, she had difficulty with the alarm even with her tongue. She had several falls in an attempt to fill the bowl with water. After she filled several falls, she realized that she needed to pay more attention to the coo door next time.\n### Question:\nHow can Gena fill the bowl with water in an efficient manner to avoid trouble?\nA Gena could drink water by turning the bowl upside down. She would then use her tongue to fill the bowl with water. The contraption is not effective enough to avoid trouble with water spilling everywhere during drinking. B Gena uses her tail to pick the water jingle and then drinks it. This method is efficient but troublesome. C Gena could fill the water bowl with her paws. This is more efficient and less troublesome than \"turning the bowl upside down\". D Gena can scoop water in a more efficient way and more time is required for the method than pouring water.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option ( A, B, C, or D).[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn the fairy tale \"The Thousand Times Open, Thousand Times Close\", which character is the most intelligent?\nA BoyOnce, a price said to his son, \"Boy, count how many times the blind dog barks, why do you often do it.

The civil war that happened between Autobots led by Optimus Prime and Decepticons led by Megatron involved civilian vehicles and military vehicles respectively. Therefore, we need to choose [[A]] as the answer here.\nQ2:  The correct answer is option 'B'. The second-in-command or subordinate to the leader in the Autobots is the Commander. However, keep in mind that other terminology can refer to this role as well such as first-in-command in theory, second-in-command in practice, and many others. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ3: The correct answer is option 'C'. The only concrete way to give life back is, for example, the Allspark, which is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ4: The correct answer is option 'B'. The Matrix of Leadership, commonly referred to as the Allspark or the Transformers, is the heart and soul of all Transformers. They are known as \"T-Coils\" in the Transformers universe and are attached to each Autobot. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ5: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. The Transformers universe concept includes an alien planet called Cybertron, a group of Autobots, larger-than-life Transformers, and vehicles capable of transforming. It does not include improving life outcomes as an option. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ6: The correct answer is option 'C'. Beat Box is the leader of the Attack Squad.

Energon, which is represented as orange planet with a reason space in the middle, is the type of energy that all Transformers depend on to live fully. This energy is also known as \"T-Cog.\" The red symbols on most Transformer bodies, the purpose of which is not yet clearly understood, may serve as a \"plug-in\" or \"battery\" used to rejuvenate \"T-Cog\" when discharged and drained. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\n\nThe question asked for what is NOT part of the Transformers universe concept.\nThe correct four options are as follows:\nOption 1: The correct option is option 'A'. An alien planet called Cybertron as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 2: The correct option is option 'B'. A group of Autobots as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 3: The correct option is option 'C'. Larger-than-life Transformers as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 4: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. Vehicles capable of transforming as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.",
