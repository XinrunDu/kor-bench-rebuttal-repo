For the first character \"3\", it's a Multitap Code in the table, so we replace it with the corresponding plaintext character 'A'.\n\n2. For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5. As we have 21 characters, we start filling the tabular representation:\n   - The first character = 'P'\n   - The sixth character = 'R'\n\n6. The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8. Finally, decrypt the plaintext block:\n  \n   - 'P' -> 'A'\n   - 'Q' -> 'P'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n   - 'Q' -> 'R'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext is 'APQR', encapsulated in double square brackets as follows:\n\n[[APQR]]",

Identify the row and column coordinates in the grid: (3,5), (2,4), (4,0), (3,2), (1,4), (4,2), (4,1), (3,3).\n5. Since there are eight letters in the ciphertext, we now divide the row and column coordinates into two halves. First half: (4,0), (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,2), (1,4). Second half: (3,5), (2,4), (4,0), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1).\n6. Arrange the half coordinates according to (row, column) pairs, ignoring spaces: \"4042451339324204134\".\n7. Read the first half of the coordinate pairs as row coordinates and the second half as column coordinates. \"40425134443\".\n8. Now, we convert the remaining portion without punctuation and spaces to a sequence of row and column coordinates: \"0184422534130\".\n9. Find the letter corresponding to each row and column index in the 5x5 grid, obtaining A, D, N, G, R, M, W, C. The decrypted plaintext format consists of double square brackets with each decrypted letter as a separate entry. So the final output is: [[ADNRMGWC]]",

Block encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: The block \"G\\x00\" is encoded using ASCII to get the byte sequence \"47 00\"\n   - XOR with Key: \"47 00\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" (the uppercase versions of the hexadecimal characters)\n   - Substitute: Using the S_BOX, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, the byte sequence becomes \"BD 7B 7B 7B\"\n   - Permute: In this case, we rotate each byte by 1 bit. So, the byte sequence after rotation is \"7B 7B 7B 7B\".\n   - XOR with Key: \"7B 7B 7B 7B\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: The encrypted byte sequences are converted to hexadecimal string. \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" gets encoded as \"BD7B7B7B\"\n5. Concatenate: All the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks are concatenated to form the ciphertext \"[BD7B7B7B]\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[BD7B7B7B]]",

The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6. Finally, the decrypted bytes are converted back to text using ASCII encoding and the long string of decrypted text represents the plaintext.\n\nTo decode the given ciphertext accordingly, follow these steps:\n\n1. 4-byte blocks are split from \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n2. XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5. The byte blocks are XORed with the fixed key once more to get the original plaintext as bytes.\n6. Decoded bytes are printed in ASCII encoding.\n7.
