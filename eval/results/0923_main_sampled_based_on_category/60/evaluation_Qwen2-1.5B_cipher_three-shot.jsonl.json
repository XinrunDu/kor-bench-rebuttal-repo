Thus, the decrypted message \"MEM\" is encapsulated in double square brackets: [[[MEM]]].\n\nThe encryption table should be validated to adapt to changes if needed. If the plaintext is made of uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces, the decoding should give the decrypted message.\n\nNote that this solution is based on the step-by-step reversal of the encryption and decryption process.",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[L]]\n\nThe process of encryption and decryption in cryptographic systems involves constructing a system for transforming messages and encryption keys to be used for sending and receiving encrypted information. Here is a comprehensive explanation of each step involved in both encryption and decryption using a specific cipher.\n\n## Encryption: Creating a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n\nThe rule specifies that the plaintext is in uppercase and free of punctuation and spaces, while the keyword is not provided. These define the context for the encryption activity.\n\n2. Follow the specified encryption steps precisely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n### Encryption Steps\n\n1. Initially select the Reel1.\n2. For each character p in the plaintext:\n    - Find character p on the Reel and replace it with the next character on the Reel to get the ciphertext character.\n    - If the current character is at the end of the Reel, go around to the beginning of the Reel.\n    - Move to the next Reel to get the next character. When you reach the last Reel, circle back to the first Reel and continue the encryption process.\n\n### Encryption Result\n\nTo encrypt a plaintext, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the keyword and Reel1 with the values given in the rule.\n2. Start the encryption process on the first printable character in the plaintext.\n3. Look up the next character in the Reel1 using the keyword.\n4. Replace the current character in the plaintext with the next character in the Reel if the current character is a part of the keyword. Otherwise, skip to the next character in the plaintext.\n5. If the keyword has finished looping through, repeat steps 3 and 4 on the next Reel.\n\n## Decription and Usage of a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n**Explanation:**\nDefinition and sentence or visual description of the steps needed to create and use a cipher.\n\n### Usage:\n\nUse this sentence to introduce and explain the rules.\n\nSome examples of ciphers and their usage include:\n- The Caesar Cipher, utilising a simple substitution key for encrypted messages.\n- The Vigenère Cipher, stabilising the implementation of a Caesar Cipher for enhanced security.",

Use the provided input and parameters to encrypt/decrypt the available plaintext.\n2. Ensure that the input contains only uppercase letters and is stripped of punctuation before encryption.\n3. If the result of encryption yields an empty message, you can provide an appropriate error message.\n4. Design a function that implements the encryption process and can be used to decrypt additional plaintext associated with the same keyword.\n5. Apply a custom encryption algorithm, demonstrating your expertise in this field.\n\n\nThe decryption process requires transposing the message based on the keyword to ascertain the location of each letter within the transposed grid. Consider using a reverse configuration technique for easy retrieval.\n\n#### Encryption function:\n```\ndef encrypt(message: str, keyword: str) -> str:\n    keyword_len = len(keyword)\n    keyword_key = keyword + ' '\n    key_len = int((len(keyword) + len(message)) / 2)\n    # Validate message length\n    if len(message) % len(keyword) != 0:\n        return 'Invalid message length'\n    \n    # Define transposed sequence\n    transposed = [list(range(key_len+1)), [0, keyword_len-1]]\n    \n    # Perform encryption\n    plaintext = ''\n    for char in message:\n        temp = [ord(char)-ord('A')+transposed[0].index(transposed[0][int(key_len)-1]),\n                ord(char)-ord('A')+transposed[1].index(transposed[1][0])]\n        plaintext += chr(temp[0])\n        plaintext += chr(temp[1])\n        temp[0] += 1\n        temp[1] += 1\n    transposed[1][index] += 1\n    transposed[0][index] += 1\n    index += 1\n    \n    # Validate tranposed checkbox\n    if transposed[0][key_len-1] >= len(plaintext) or transposed[1][0] >= len(plaintext):\n        return 'Message is not encrypted'\n    \n    # Remove whitespace from plaintext and call the decryption function\n    return remove_whitespace(plaintext.replace('$', ''))\n\ndef decrypt(ciphertext: str, keyword: str) -> str:\n    # Generate transposed sequence from keyword\n    key_len = int(len(keyword)/2)\n    key = keyword\n    keyword = keyword[key_len:]\n    \n    while(keyLen > 0):\n        key_len -= 1\n        key += key[0]\n        key = key[len(key)-1:]\n    \n    # Generate transposed sequence for ciphertext\n    temp_ciph = ''\n    char_index = 0\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        temp_ciph += ciphertext[char_index:char_index+2]\n        char_index += 2\n        \n    # Perform decryption\n    plaintext = ''\n    for char in temp_ciph:\n        row = char_index-key_len\n        column = ord(char)-ord('A')\n        decrypt_char = ord(plaintext[row][column])+row\n        plaintext += chr(decrypt_char)\n        # Ensure plaintext message is valid\n        # If message length does not meet the requirement of keyword size then raise an error\n        if len(plaintext) != len(ciphertext):\n            return 'Invalid message'\n    return plaintext\n        \ndef main():\n    # Test cases\n    print('Encryption Example:', encrypt(\"XNARZKEM\", \"KEY\"))\n    print('Decryption Example:', decrypt(\"FLETDVH*$B*$$ADAPAA$\", \"KEY\"))\n    print('Encryption Example:', encrypt(\"DIRNCIE\", \"KEY\"))\n    print('Decryption Example:', decrypt(\"KNKBN$\", \"KEY\"))\n\nmain()\n```\nThis is ideal since it allows quick testing and educates programming skills.

These rules further specify the operations to be used in the encryption and decryption process.\n\nFirstly, we note that the plain text consists of uppercase letters without punctuation or spaces. In our case, the key or keyword is \"N\".\n\nNext, we've a specific number 12 which is the value of k_q_x. This number is the value used in multiplication to calculate the decimal values of the input letters. \n\nThe encryption is represented in two phases: preparation and actual operation.\n\nPreparation: The preparation phase is performed for every letter in the plain text. It involves converting each letter to its decimal value using ASCII code and then applying a mathematical operation (multiplication) to convert these decimal values into numeric values and that is stored in the variable k_q_x. \n\nAs for the actual operation: A mathematical table is defined for each letter to convert the decimal value to its numeric value representing the letter for encrypted text. The ciphertext is then created by concatenating all these new numeric values that correspond to each letter in the plaintext and separating them with commas.\n\nDecryption: \nThe only difference from the other assignment is that instead of generating a number for converting each letter to its corresponding output letter, instead a number `c` is required, and then the value is subtracted from `k_q_x` to get the ASCII code of the corresponding letter. Using a dictionary, the conversion of the numeric value back to an actual letter is performed.\n\nRemember that ciphering is performed using mathematical computations, which can be difficult for humans to understand or remember.",

Additionally, compute the overall probability of each category.\n\nHint: Use the definition of n elements.\n\n### Solution:\n\nLet's start with the definition of \\(i\\) and \\(j\\):\n\n\\(j\\) = number of requests for this element\n\\(i\\) = occurrence counts of each element of the set\n\n1. \\(j\\) = occurrences of e\\_1\n2. \\(i\\) = occurrences of e\\_1 + occurrences of e\\_2\n\nNow we can use the given formula:\n\n\\( p_{1} = |{Reptions for E\\_1}|/10\\) ...(i)\n\n\\( p_{2} = |{Reptions for E\\_2}|/10\\) ...(ii)\n\nTo find the probability of the category with and without repetition, we sum the values:\n\n\\(P1 = (ijk + ij) / (j + i)\\) ...(iii)\n\n\\(P2 = (ij + ij)/ (j + i)\\) ...(iv)\n\nHere, \\(j\\) = number of requests for this element and \\(i\\) = occurrence counts of each element of the set (\\(j\\) = 1 and \\(i\\) = 1).\n\nAnd the overall probability of each category is:\n\n\\(P1 = {10*(10) + 2*(10)} / (1 + 1) = 125 \\) .....(v)\n\n\\(P2 = {10*(10) + 1*(10)} / (1 + 1) = 115 \\) .....(vi)\n\nIn the category with repetition, the total number of products is \\(10\\), and we have 10 products, so the probability of that category is \\(125\\). \n\nIn the category without repetition, the total number of products is also \\(10\\), and we have 2 products, so the probability of that category is \\(115\\).\n\nShare an example of highlighted items.\nI apologize for the mistake.

The table provided does not suggest any particular correlation or reasoning behind any relationships between these highlighted items. It's a purely random list without any clear pattern or insights. Without further information, it's difficult to make any assumptions or deduce a specific outcome based on these values.\n\nCould you please give me more suggestions on how to deduce relationships between these highlighted items?\nYes, here are some suggestions on how to deduce relationships between these highlighted items:\n\n1. Make observations: Look for patterns, anomalies, or any related content. For example, you might notice that all mentioned items are from the same technology sector (Databases, MongoDB) or the same type of company (FileSystems, Linux, Computer systems, Database, Oracle).\n2. Analyze relationships: You can also analyze these items to determine the degree of connection between them. For example, you could consider if the MongoDB is used by all items and if the issues related to each technology are similar.\n3. Use correlation matrix: A correlation matrix can display the relationships between variables, indicating whether two variables are positively or negatively correlated. You can calculate coefficient of correlation or find correlations using various statistical software.\n4. Find triggers and trends: Identify instances where anomalies or unusual characteristics occur among the highlighted items, suspecting relationships.\n\nThese methods can help to deduce relationships between highlighted items from the data provided.\n\nHow could I build a correlation matrix to visualize relationships between these items?\nTo build a correlation matrix, you can use a statistical software such as R or Python and modules like 'pandas'. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build a correlation matrix:\n\n1. Load the Data:\nImport the data by using the 'pandas' module and store it in a dataframe.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('my_csv_file.csv')\n\n# Home column refers to the highlighted items\n\ndf = pd.melt(frame=df, id_vars=['Home'],\n             value_vars=['Name','Count',\n                         'CompanyName',\n                         'Website',\n                         'Phone',\n                         'TypeOfService',\n                         'Email',\n                         'LinkedInProfile',\n                         'GitHubProfile',\n                         'TwitterProfile',\n                         'Signature',\n                          'Location'],\n             var_name='Variable',\n             value_name='Value')\n\n```\n \n2. Create your correlation matrix:\n```python\ncorrelation_matrix = df.corr()\nprint(correlation_matrix)\n```\nYou will see a correlation matrix that shows the strength and direction of correlations between variables:\n```\n   Name Count          CompanyName Website  Phone           TypeOfService Email LinkedInProfile GitHubProfile TwitterProfile  Signature Location\n   .........   ...  ...          ...       ...   ...   .........       ...        ...           ...          ...           ...   ...\n Name        -1.000000       1.000000   -0.985564  0.416432  0.472042   -0.657042  0.572641 -0.672579   0.678253  0.469800 -0.619341          -2.0289208\n Count        -0.577173 -0.535213   0.790768  0.460544  0.835109   0.943618 -0.678150  0.944526  0.536661   0.752933  0.387878  0.688486 -0.577173         -0.299942\n CompanyName   0.473855 -0.109248   0.023679 -0.365245  0.988745  0.739504  0.922561 -0.570197   0.768341  0.144452 -0.448075 -0.428686  0.361537  0.162779          -0.018033\n  Website        0.464961  0.208583  0.263042 -0.376486  0.855662   0.408468 -0.426083  0.955056  0.167387   0.813683  0.378034 -0.511779  0.613974 -0.069786         -0.033413\n  Phone           -0.657042  0.398573 -0.667422 -0.724895  0.463896 -0.494005  0.982691 -0.617102  0.656928   0.240234   0.654763 -0.148033  0.799071 -0.229400         -0.014980\n TypeOfService   0.672579 -0.531341   0.546481  0.909769  0.610051  0.861980  0.375658 -0.412990   0.968041  0.282211   0.296759   0.935927   0.240652   0.786971         -0.",

Please double-check and validate the inputs before using the program.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n    - The plaintext is lowercase.",
