Here, for p1 to be negated (~p1) and true (✓), p1 must be false (x). For p2 to make the \"and\" (p2) part true (✓), p2 must be true (✓).\n- Now, for ~p3 to be false (x), p3 must be true (✓).\n- The assignment where x|x|✓ will lead to the formula being false.\n\nTherefore, the falsity value is [[F:x|x|✓]].\n\n### Formula 2: (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n\n- The formula is formed as an 'and' operation.\n- For the formula to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- For (~p2||p3) to be false, both parts (~p2 and p3) must be false.\n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n  - For p3 to be false, p3 must be false.\n- For (p1=::>p2) to be false, p1 must be true (✓) and p2 must be false (x), which is not consistent with the assignment required by the first part.\n- Falsity assignments: Since (~p2||p3) requires p2 to be true and p3 to be false, but (p1=::>p2) cannot be false with these assignments, no single assignment can make the entire formula false.\n\nTherefore, falsity value for the given structure: [[F:None]]\n\n### Formula 3: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\n- The main connective here is '&', meaning both parts must be false for the entire formula to be false.\n- Consider (p1=::>p2): The conditional statement is false in only one case: p1 = 'True' (✓); p2 = 'False' (x).\n- Next, consider (~(~(p1&p3)||p1)):\n  - The leftmost part is a nested negation (~ (~ (~(p1&p3) || p1))). In order for it to be false (contribution to the overall falseness of the formula), ~(p1&p3)||p1 must be true.\n  - In the scenario to nullify (~(p1&p3)||p1), we need both ~(p1&p3) and p1 to be false.\n    - For ~(p1&p3) to be false, (p1&p3) must be true, requiring p1=✓ (True) and p3=✓ (True).\n    - This directly conflicts with our previous finding that p1 must be True to make the conditional (p1=::>p2) false, which implies the only assignment that makes (p1=::>p2) false makes another part of the formula True (p1=✓), causing the entire structure not to have a false assignment under the analyzed scenario.\n  \nTherefore, the falsity values identified are:\n[[F:x|x|✓]];[[F:None]];[[F:None]].",
