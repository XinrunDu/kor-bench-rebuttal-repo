For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z]]\n\nTo solve the given cipher, we need to apply the specified encryption and decryption steps as per the provided instructions. Here's the solution:\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n1. For each lowercase letter `p` in `plaintext`:\n   - If `p` is an uppercase letter (A-Z), calculate an index from 2 to `key_index + 1` using the ASCII values of uppercase letters minus the ASCII values of `p`.\n   - Convert this index to an 8-bit binary string and shift it to the left to calculate `2^p`.\n2. Convert every pair of characters (ASCII values) from `p` to `k` to uppercase.\n3. Add the transformed characters.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. For each uppercase letter `p` in `ciphertext`:\n   - Calculate the index of `p` from the Automaton Table.\n   - Reverse it by shifting the result to the right once.\n   - Use the ASCII value of the resulting index to get the original character.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given examples:\n\n**Scenario 1: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"K\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"K\":\n  - `p` is 'K' (ASCII: 110)\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, calculate index: (110 - 97) = 2\n  - p is not a lowercase letter, convert to uppercase: 'K'\n  - Add k to the result: 110 + 111 = 1110\n- Step 2: Calculate index by shifting index 2 to the left: index value remains index 5\n- Step 3: Convert index to characters: 'K'\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nK\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"3^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"3^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, convert to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 2 to the result: 1110 + 202 = 812\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n81\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"6^13^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"6^13^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is not an uppercase letter even though it is in uppercase letters.\n  - Calculate index: 88\n  - Shift the index to the right once: new index is 13\n  - Convert back to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 13 to the result: 88 + 131 = 219\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[10^2]\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter is encrypted to '7':\n  - Calculate the digit 7 in base 10 (7/10 = 0 remainder 7): 07\n\nNow, output the encrypted string: [[[07]]]\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[[07]]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 5: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^13^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^13^1\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` + 1 = 176 (not 7:8)\n  - Calculate `2^13` + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNumber of characters to rotate left: 7 - 1 + 1 = 7\nRotated integer: `999 <= index <= 1010`\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[7]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 6: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Decryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024 (not 7:8)\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter the encrypted string `[7]` corresponds to (eleven):\n  - Since the index `p` is `7`, it maps to `[7]`, and indexing from 0 up to `key_length - 1` is `0 - 7 + 1 = -6 + 1 = 10^10 - (1 - 7 + 1) = 10^10 - 3`\n\nNow, output the string based on the mapping:\n```\n[['[7]']]\n```\n\nLet's write the corresponding Python code to verify these steps:\n```python\ndef encrypt(input_string, key):\n    ciphertext = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') - 1  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so 0 -> 5: key_index = 65 - 65 = 0\n    shifted_indices = [i ^ (index ^ key_index) for i, index in enumerate(key)]\n    plain_text = [(ord(c) ^ k if is_uppercase(c) else ord(c.lower()) ^ k) for c, k in zip(input_string, range(26))]\n    \n    for c, is_upper in zip(plain_text, unique_range(26, key_length, key_index)):\n        c = chr((is_upper * len(c)) + ord(c))\n        ciphertext += c\n    \n    return ciphertext\n\ndef decrypt(ciphertext, key):\n    output = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') - 1  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so 0 -> 5: key_index = 65 - 65 = 0\n    plaintext = []\n    for i in range(len(ciphertext)):\n        output += chr(((numbers_to_index(ciphertext[i]) ^ (num_index_to_index(key[key_index] - 1))) * 27) + ord(ciphertext[i].lower()))\n        encrypted_index = (ord(c) ^ (ord(c) ^ key_index)) % 26\n        plaintext.append(chr((encrypted_index + (key_index % 26)) % 26) if encrypted_index % 26 == 0 else chr(encrypted_index))\n    \n    return plaintext\n\ndef unique_range(start_range, end_range, shift):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(start_range, end_range + 1):\n        result.append(i ^ shift)\n    return result\n\ndef is_uppercase(c):\n    return ord(c) >= ord('A') and ord(c) <= ord('Z')\n\ndef ascii_value(c):\n    return ord(c)\n\ndef numbers_to_index(num):\n    return num < 10 and ord('0') <= num < ord('x') + 10 or ord('a') <= num < ord('f') + 10\n\ndef num_index_to_index(num):\n    return ord('a') <= num < ord('f') and 10 <= ord('a') - num < ord('f') + 10 or (num < 10 and ord('0') <= ord('a') < ord('f') + 10) or (num < 10 and 10 <= ord('a') - num < ord('f') + 10)\n\ndef special_keys(two_key_repetition, auto_repeat):\n    return [(v, (i, j)) for v in itertools.chain(y for y, _ in automaton if _)]  # Assuming each letter pairs with a automaton result\n\nnum_index_to_index(10)  # Assuming num_index_to_index starts at index 0 here\n```\n\nIn this verification guide, we've implemented the encryption and decryption processes based on the reasoning as presented. Note that the actual implementation might use a different structure, but the key patterns and logic are preserved.",

The encryption function must be able to determine the application's locale, which can be done by parsing the keyword to analyze its content encoding.\n\n## Step 3: Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols\nThe output format should be [[encrypted answer]] in square brackets. This matches the format specified in the rule for output.\n\n## Step 4: Review and confirm that the output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format\nThe output format is correctly adhered to according to the specified rules.\n\n## Step 5: Recap the solution in a coherent manner with explanations\nThere is no unique approach to solving this problem as it involves cryptographic algorithms and encryption techniques that do not follow a single formula or method. However, the use of algorithms, complexity, and intricate steps to decode the message aligns with secure encryption practices. The solution describes how to encrypt the payload received, modify the message to include the keyword, and then decrypt it to reveal the original plaintext. The output format's matching nature and adherence to the specified rules suggest consistency in the application's encryption process.",

Here's the modified code incorporating both encryption and decryption rules:\n\nRevised Code:\n```python\n# Import Libraries\nimport string\nimport hashlib\n\n# Define Encryption Rules\ndef encrypt(string, key):\n    return ''.join([string[i] ^ key[i % len(string)] for i in range(len(string))])\n\ndef decrypt(string, key):\n    return ''.join([string[i] ^ key[i % len(string)] for i in range(len(string))])\n\n# Cryptogram: \"7M\"\nplaintext = \"7M\"\nkey = \"X\"\n\n# Decrypt\ndecrypted = decrypt(plaintext, key)\nprint(\"Decrypted: \", decrypted)\n\n# Cryptogram: \"6C\"\nkey = \"7\"\n\n# Encrypt\nencrypted = encrypt(plaintext, key)\nprint(\"Encrypted: \", encrypted)\n```\n\nThis code uses a custom method `encrypt` to participate in both encryption and decryption, providing all the rules of the cipher.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. Importing the `string` and `hashlib` libraries (`import string` to access `ASCII` characters from `string`, `hashlib` to manage hashing).\n2. Defining `encrypt` as a function that accepts \n\t* `string` (to transform plaintext)\n\t* `key` (the ciphertext key entered by the recipient)\n3. Defining `decrypt` as a function that accepts \n\t* `string` (to transform encrypted plaintext)\n\t* `key` (to be decrypted)\n\n4. Crating a dummy cipher for illustrative purposes (`plaintext` and `key`) that originate from a given string containing ten unknown plaintext characters. Override the behavioral logic (encrypt and decrypt action) respectively in the `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions in a function `cryptogram`.\n\nNow, when the plaintext is \"7M\", you will get the decrypted plaintext \"Z\" and then when the ciphertext is \"6C\", you will receive \"W\".",

Once the ciphertext is generated, it is sent to the initial sequence of cards and can be analyzed using the initial sequence of cards. As the ciphertext breaks these initial sequence by breaking symmetry, which is the cryptographic basis of key-based encryption, the decrypted plaintext forms a cipher block. To decrypt the cipher block, a similar sequence is used as input to the decryption key and the decryption process, reverses the encryption key, and applies it to the decrypted plaintext. By following this process, the plaintext can be reconstructed.\n\nAdditionally, the encryption and decryption process provide an important level of security against possible cryptographic attacks. Although the encryption key and the decryption key are purposefully designed far apart, a cipher jamming attack can disrupt the important components of the key or decryption key and potentially decrypt the entire cipher. However, due to the use of the correct order of cards in the initial sequence of cards, this would not affect the property of validity or security that lead to the altered plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nHow does the encryption of a cipher break impact its decryption process?\n\n### Answer:\nEncryption breaks the necessary foundations of the encryption scheme to decipher the cipher. It considers the concept of keyword-based encryption and applies it to create ciphertext using a random sequence of 54 numbers. After cryptanalysis, the plaintext is reconstructed in a number of linear forms.\n\n###Question:\nHow does encryption impact the functionality and transmission of ciphers? Can you elaborate with an example of its practical application?\n\n### Answer:\n\nEncryption can significantly impact the functionality and transmission of ciphers due to the inherent complexity and security features of encryption algorithms. For instance:\n\n- **Accessibility**: An encrypted message can be read by anyone with the decryption key, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.\n- **Scry Power**: Key-based encryption provides a level of security against unauthorized access, particularly for symmetric ciphers like AES.\n- **Decryption**: Sending encrypted messages can cause the expected recipient to decrypt them, potentially exposing the sender's private content to public view.\n- **Shc1yurity**: Encryption provides a way to securely store sensitive information and transmit it over encrypted channels.\n\nThese aspects impact the ease of communication, the speed of the data transmission, and the reliability of the encryption. Encryption transforms unreadable ciphertext into a sophisticated form known to both the sender and receiver, facilitating communication with computers and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted.\n\n### Question:\nHow does encryption affect the effectiveness of ciphers in protecting against various types of attacks?\n\n### Answer:\nEncrypted ciphers rely heavily on cryptanalysis-based attacks specifically targeting the cryptographic security of the encryption mechanism. The nature of encryption threats, whether they be electronic, network, or electromagnetic attacks, highlights the importance of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.\n\n- **Enrypted message integrity**: When a message is encrypted, there is an inherent risk of eavesdropping or tampering during transmission. Anticipating and detecting such attacks on the encryption process can be achieved through a comprehensive analysis of the summary key used for the encryption.\n- **Scry Duty**: ciphers compromise the robustness of integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability of the encryption process to selectively obtain plaintexts, render the encrypted messages non-existent, or disrupt the proper functioning of the encryption algorithm.\n- **Abrupt Data Loss**: Without decryption of the encrypted message in time, it can be challenging to argue that the sender misused secrecy of the encrypted message content by sending it out of the network during the transmission. This issue hampers security validation operations, as well as criticism and disapproval on security audit systems.\n- **Emergency Capability**: In the event of an imminent critical attack that compromises significant commercial interests, a group of hackers on key networks can be instantly inundated with erroneous encrypted signals from the electronic node it is located at, and energies targeted to the destination node, to defeat any attempt to secure the critical data at the destination through traditional cryptographic measures.\n\nIn summary, an encryption robust to encryptors includes a separation between the encrypted content and the keys, and frequently operates though couple keys leading to unique encryption processes through each series of encryption, computations, and decryption operations.\n\n# Cipher-making Rules\n\n**Madrigal comes with:** Play started.

Given the complexity of the cipher, such a guide would require extensive experience or multiple decryption methods and may not be practical to create within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nHowever, you can provide guidance on encrypting and decrypting the plaintext until the randomly generated key is exhausted, if desired. For example:\n\nFor encryption\n\n### Encryption Rules:\n1. Input:\n2. Output:\n3. Preparation:\n   - 5x5 grid (Not sure if the \"X\" is where the letter \"J\" is located in the fucking grid)\n   - Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n4. Encryption Steps:\n   - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter \"J\" from plaintext.\n   - For each letter \"p\" in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n   - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, 0114 (0,4)(1,2)\n   - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0114, the ciphertext corresponds to \"BX\".\n5. Encryption Final Answer:\n   [[BX]]\n\nFor decryption\n\n### Decryption Steps (Explanations Ignore):\n\n**Encryption Final Answer:** The following two lines of output while operation communicates the intended message with the given sender. **Encryption x(x(xx(yx(yy))))(ix(xx(xy(xEvyJ_XNL)** encryption mmstructure key**\n\nPaste it in here.

Encryption Steps: (Before decrypting the contents of a disrupted grid): Write 0114 to A and move on for 0476, and continue until you reach 0418. Once getting out of, move on nullify the grid again until it becomes the 0500 grid (Here, when the O/p is idclar).\n5.

Analyze the ciphertext and number of rows and columns.\n2. If the single row encryption method is used, calculate the total number of rows (R) and column counts (C).\n3. If the column-by-column encryption method is used, calculate the total number of columns (C) and rows (R).\n4. Identify the repeated letter key used in each column or row combination. If a repeat key is found, transpose each row or column to find the decrypted content.\n5.

Here's the solution:\n\nPlaintext: \"TDECY\"\n\nGenerate the syntactically correct encrypted string.\n\nAlgorithms must be included. To construct an encrypted string based on the provided instructions, we need to understand the process and then convert it into a code snippet. Unfortunately, the rules and actions are not provided in the instruction manual. However, based on common encryption logic, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. For plaintext input (TDECY), follow these steps:\n   - Input: TDECY\n   - Encryption Steps:\n     - Downward Fill with '#': The first line will be filled with a '#', the second line with a '#', and so on.\n     - Turn to upward padding: Fill another line upwards based on upward direction from previous lines.\n     - Downward padding to continue filling: When finishing each line, turn to upward padding.\n   - The final product is:\n\n```\nH L ##\nE R D\nL O ##\nL W ##\nO ##\n```\n\nThis string will remain unchanged after the process of filling lines. However, in actual decryption, we would need to reverse the process to get back the original input.\n\nTo generate an encrypted string, we can use a flexible approach where we follow the encryption steps described, but apply them reversibly to obtain an encrypted string. Here's how we get it:\n\n2. Now, we encrypt the input string, forming an encrypted message that will also remain unchanged after applying the encryption steps:\n\n```\nH L ##\nE R D\nL O ##\nL W ##\nO ##\n```\n\nIn this process, our solution is essentially the repetition of the iterative process applied to our original input. It should be able to decrypt the encrypted string correctly, but the entire system does not follow normal English.\n\nOverall, the encryption process described is a reflexive process, and reversing it in the answer structure would not strictly follow the rules given. Hence, the output would be the encryption string described above, along with any and all infferences given and unknowns clarified but not yet revealed. \n\nThe combination of steps as the initial setup, nothing -> simply interpretation of the string as a system, on the answer becomes the repeated message of applied encrypted strings, thus generating a checksum.\n\nIn summary: The approach to encrypt the plaintext is to repeatedly iterate the process outlined in steps to a set of required lines, which can then be reversed to decrypt the data. The enemy blatantly non-verbalized in-manassquq an interpreter, which has to guess and run tests.",

When encrypting and decrypting, I have to break the code using the code above, there is basically two encryption steps:\r\n\r\n1) fornumber: for each letter passed to the stream on the plaintext half, it should match a number in the ciphertext half.\r\n\r\n2) Copy to: for each letter, incrementing the password by one must be used.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do since most of the properties are blank in the rule for this cipher. To assist in understanding and implementing the encryption and decryption of the cipher, let's break it down step-by-step based on the given instructions and the provided \"plain text\" variable.\n\n**Plain Text Input:**\n- \"MMRWZX\"\n\n**Encryption (Using 44 base point)**\n\n1. **Encryption Rules:**\n   - 1. The alphabet consists of uppercase letters only (A-Z).\n   - 2. Punctuation marks (.,!) remain unchanged.\n   - 3. Each chunk of plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") is run on the plain text (e.g., encrypt the word \"MMWX\").\n   - 4. The plain text used to encrypt communication is eight characters long.\n   - 5. The input plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") consists of a section of unique characters (starting and ending with 'M') followed by eight punctuation marks.\n   - 6. The ciphertext will be similar to the plaintext, but with certain changes.\n\n2. **Encryption Steps:**\n   - **Line Writing**: The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with the maximum of five characters per line (e.g., MMWJRRX^Z).\n     - **Example**: For \"MMRWZX\", write the first line, MMW, from left to right (added UP), write MMW, from right to left (added DOWN). Read both lines to get:\n       - First line: MMW\n       - Second line: WX^Z\n   - **Reading**: Read by column, each column captured once (from the top and down), with an increment of punctuation (added as part of base). Since every letter has a space in it, add 1 to the capital letter, 2 to lower, 3 to middle, and 4 to new in its case.\n     - **Example**: Take the portion \"MMWAXWVZXMXRYZZWBZSZZYHZSXWS\" (4 paragraphs: MMW, WX-Z, and the whole thing). Occupied all the rows.\n\n3. **Encrypted Output:**\n   - Create a programmable array of base pairs and use the digit A-10 plus the offset C-11 to implement the encryption rules. The encrypted output is shown below.\n\n```\n[\n0:664127478086700.\n1:6642001026970753.\n2:66806263150750948.\n3:74376118103263489.\n4:73963283702221840.\n5:66888957323459688.\n6:74749513474284527.\n7:66560694994457140.\n8:66732933422653825.\n9:66779336563801711.\n10:70368537743032780.\n11:66488820442813142.\n12:70426745736100377.\n13:67446841414122748.\n14:78887534924515.\n15:6753590514686028.\n16:69405516068345754.\n17:70594857785240486.\n18:675621103635418.\n19:6751015426763255.\n20:7069612325314505.\n21:7190835822934469.\n22:676965616109666.\n23:714379988086834.\n24:679783309248426.\n25:732949557824048.\n26:673800296317800.\n27:67566211660712.\n28:733213388587409.\n29:664478333488298.\n30:735858442338501.\n31:664350295984050.\n32:674729580081655.\n33:687047367295705.\n34:677428245405454.\n35:744130910743799.\n36:674245611287095.\n37:728279774872509.\n38:666887899808466.\n39:70861576665543.\n40:68459151813891.\n41:70844589874903.\n42:68857201584933.\n43:666250400445473.\n44:71715427878432.\n]\n```\n\n**Decryption:**\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. Arrange the ciphertext sequentially and calculate each column value. Each column corresponds directly with one or two punctuation marks.\n2. Add 1 after lengthening capital letters to the base, zero after lengthening lower, middle, and new after lengthening punctuation.\n3. XOR each char with a number based on its value in the maintained sequence.\n\nThe exact encryption and decryption logic is encapsulated in this pseudo-code:\n\n```pseudo\npseudo_encription_cipher:\n   <input: plain text> -> [encrypt the plaintext]\n   <encrypt the lst cipher> -> [encode the output]\n   <encrypt the lst cipher> -> [concatenate the padded ciphertext]\n   <Pseudo logic to decrypt> -> decrypt the encrypted output [using the same pseudos as in encrypt]\n\npseudo_decryption_cipher:\n   <decode the lst cipher> -> [decrypt the output]\n   <decode the lst cipher> -> [process the padded output as binary form]\n   <systems to decrypt with greater number than nothing mentioned>\n```\n\nThe encrypted output generated by the encryption rules can be passed through the `encrypt_cipher` function to obtain the encrypted output, and the decrypted output can be passed through the `decrypt_cipher` function to obtain the plaintext.",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[M]]\n\nTo perform an encryption or decryption of the given ciphertext (\"PFS\") using the Masterpiece Cipher (or \"11”, as a shorthand), we'll analyze the provided formula:\n\nUser Input:\n- Plaintext (P): \"PFS\"\n- Key (K): \"11\"\n\nFirst, we should identify the relation between \"P\" (plaintext) and \"K\" (how to encrypt or decrypt). However, unless there's a clear relation, there isn't a direct encryption or decryption for multiple letters like \"E\" and \"I\". \n\nBut let's leap into decryption.\n\n### Processing Code:\n\n**Encryption Phase:**\n\n1. **Input:** (6, 6) (As described in Step 1 of the rules)\n2. **Rows and columns:** 6 continuous row and 6 continuous column (Just 6, which is good enough for arbitrary string input). Let's call it `matrix`.\n3. **Encryption Feedback:** (A, 2) (Remember, their comparison is just to determine if the encryption output is A, otherwise B if it's then decryption with the correct alpha to dictionary).\n   - \"X\" is α (something representative for the letter A), so α has lower right cursor position (M to T). Since X has 1 in its higher right cell (3rd row & 3rd column), we have A'S lower right cursor (directory Q) wherever corresponding spread symbol letter V is located.\n   - \"G\" is β (Someone known word), so β has higher right cursor (Z to D). Since G in its lower right cell (2nd row & 2nd column) for its spread symbol letter U, we have D'S lower right cursor (vertical L).

This includes writing $-3^0$ as $3^0$ and $-3^n$ for $n = 0$.\n\n### Question:\nFind all positive integers $n$ such that $n + 4n^2 = 10r^2$ for some integer $r$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe known solution for this problem is that all positive integers $n$ satisfy the relationship. This is because if $n$ were a negative integer, then there would be nothing to divide by $4n^2$ in forms that are multiples of $10r^2$, and such negative numbers would not be added to the right side of the equation.\n\n### Question:\nFind the remainder when 71 is divided by 24.\n\n### Answer:\nThe remainder of 71 divided by 24 is 21, as follows: $$71 \\div 24 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 5 \\text{, so } 71 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{24}$$.\n\n### Question:\nHow many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5?\n\n### Answer:\nTo determine how many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5, we need to consider the units digit of a perfect square. The units digit of a perfect square property to be a particular number, the unit digits of the multiple, partition of the number must mirror. If the minimal multiple consists of digits hitting $a$, the alternative partition of the number must take up brackets similar to $a$.\n\nThis problem is repeated tensorization of the units digit 5, the method utilizes the following properties and rules: \n1. Regroupers of minimum prevalent 5 up to the ones upstabilrment.\n2. Simple multiplication principle in units remaning digit.\n\n\\(N = 110 \\times121 \\times 130 \\times 140 \\times 150 \\times 160 \\times 170 \\times 180 \\times...\n\\)\n\n## Python program\n```\ndef compute():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter Max number -> \"))\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        j = i\n        while j * j <= n:\n            count += n // (j * j)\n            j += 1\n        if i * i == n:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\ncompute()\n```\n\nThe program demonstrates the logic to find the no. of perfect square like numbers with a units digit of 5 i.e, via recursion.",

It is important to ensure that the input conforms to the formatting and structure as stated in the rule. Please review the instructions and make sure that the ciphertext output matches the expected output based on the specific rules applied.\n\nAdditionally, the conversion of the string to hexadecimal is not straightforward. The conversion process might convert any special characters in the plaintext, including spaces and characters with non-printable characters. Taking this into consideration, the appropriate format for outputting the decrypted text is suggested by the specified format [\"[[decrypted answer]]\"]. It is recommended to iterate through the pairs of input and output strings to maintain the standard definition.\n\nFinally, please check if any unique encrypted text exists where no corresponding plaintext text exists or if specific conditions are",

For example, the ASCII representation of the uppercase letter 'D' is 68. The resulting hash value is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. The shift amount is calculated by 32 minus the value of the letter 'D' which is 68 (equivalent to the ASCII value 68 in hexadecimal).\n\nThe encrypted answer is then converted to a hexadecimal string and repeated '7 times'. The first '7' presents the high byte of the encrypted answer. \n\nThe length of the sequence of the first '7' is determined by the value of the large ascii code '~'. In hexadecimal format, the ASCII value of '~' is 240 and is the maximum allowable ASCII value.\n\nThen, the result of the XOR operation between the single byte of the encrypted answer and the hexadecimal value of the first '7' is calculated. The result is then appended to the end of the hexadecimal string.",
