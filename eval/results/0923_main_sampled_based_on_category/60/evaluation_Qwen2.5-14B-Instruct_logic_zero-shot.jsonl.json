Each proposition (p1, p2, p3) can be either true (✓) or false (x). We will evaluate each formula accordingly.\n\n### Evaluating Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\nLet's consider all combinations of truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n- If p1, p2, and p3 are all true (✓|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 evaluates to x since ~p3 becomes false. Hence, ~(p1&p2&~p3) = ~(✓&✓&x) = ~(x) = ✓.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and only p2 is false (x|✓|✓), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- If p1 is true (✓) and p2 is false (x|✓|✓), and p3 is false (✓|x|x), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- ... and so on for all combinations.\n\nThe truth table systematically covering all cases will show that the only time the formula evaluates to false (x) is when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (✓|✓|x). For all other combinations, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is true.\n\nThus, T: (All combinations except ✓|✓|x) and F: (✓|✓|x).\n\n### Evaluating Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to identify when the left side (~p1&p2) implies the right side (p1=p3).\n- If ~p1&p2 is false (✓|x or x|x), regardless of the value of p1=p3, the entire formula is true.\n- If ~p1&p2 is true (✓), then p1 must be false and p2 must be true. For (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) to be false, p1 must equal p3, which in this case means p2 must equate (false=✓, a contradiction).\n\nThus, the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) evaluates to false (x) only when p1 and p3 are both true (✓) and p2 is true (✓|✓|✓).\n\nHence, T: (All cases except ✓|✓|✓) and F: (✓|✓|✓).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe truth values and falsity values of the given formulas are as follows:\n\n- For formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n  - [[T:✓|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|✓|x, x|x|x, x|x|✓]; [F:✓|✓|x]]\n- For formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n  - [[T:x|x|x, x|x|✓, ✓|x|x, x|✓|x, ✓|x|✓, x|✓|✓]; [F:✓|✓|✓]]\n\nPutting this in the specified format, the answer is:\n\n[[T:✓|x|x,x|x|✓,x|✓|✓,x|✓|x,✓|✓|x,x|x|x,x|x|✓;T:x|x|x,x|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|x,✓|x|✓,x|✓|✓];[F:✓|✓|x;F:✓|✓|✓]]",

The value of ~p3 will be x if p3 is ✓.\n- Now consider the left-hand side (~(~p1&p2)):\n  - For ~(~p1&p2) to be false, (~p1&p2) must be true.\n  - So, for (~p1&p2) to be true, p2 must be ✓, and ~p1 must be true, meaning p1 is x.\n  \n- For the entire formula to be false, both parts must be false at the same time:\n  - ~(~p1&p2) is false if ~p1&p2 is true, which happens when p1 is x and p2 is ✓.\n  - ~p3 is x when p3 is ✓.\n  \nTherefore, the falsity values for formula (1) are when p1 is x, p2 is ✓, and p3 is ✓:\nF: x|✓|✓\n\n### Formula (2): (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)\n- For &(and) to be false, at least one side must be false.\n- Consider the first part (~p2||p3):\n  - This part will be false if ~p2 is x and p3 is x, implying p2 is ✓ and p3 is x.\n  \n- Consider the second part (p1=::>p2):\n  - This part is false only when p1 is ✓ and p2 is x.\n  \nCombining both sides, both cannot simultaneously make the overall formula false.

This is because no matter what values p1, p2, and p3 are assigned (true or false), the formula always evaluates to true. If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false. Thus, this compound formula will always be true.\n\nSo, the final answer as requested: [[A];[A]].",

However, if p1 is true, then p1||p2 will be true regardless of the value of p2. Therefore, there is no assignment of p1 and p2 that makes p1=::>(p1||p2) false, meaning it is a Truth Formula. \n\n2. **(p1&p2)=::>p1**:\n\nFor the implication (if p1 and p2, then p1) to hold true, the only condition for it being false is if p1 and p2 are both true, and p1 is false. But, if p1 is false, p1 and p2 cannot be both true simultaneously because p1& is not true.

Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3.

        "response": "The given reasoning involves Xiao Qiang knowing that Lu Xun is Lu Xun, and then incorrectly concluding that Xiao Qiang therefore knows a specific relationship (that Lu Xun is the brother of Zhou Jianren) based solely on the truth of that relationship in the real world. This scenario describes a situation where knowledge about individuals is incorrectly attributed or assumed based on the facts, without proper justification for Xiao Qiang's knowledge of this specific relationship.\n\nThe issue here aligns with the `InvSubError` method, which indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about one subject to another. In this case, Xiao Qiang's knowledge about Lu Xun does not automatically entail his knowledge of the specific familial relationship between Lu Xun and Zhou Jianren, making the inference invalid due to improperly substituting the knowledge context.\n\nTherefore, the formal fallacy in the question is:\n[[I]]",

However, the specific description matches the definition more closely of the \"CondSwap Method,\" which explicitly states the erroneous belief that if P then Q, one might incorrectly conclude that if Q then P.\n\nGiven the options and the explanation, the correct answer is the CondSwap Method.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[C]]",
