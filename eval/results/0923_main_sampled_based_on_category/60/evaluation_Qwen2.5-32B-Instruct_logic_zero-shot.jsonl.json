Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4. From the identity of AND with a true statement, we know that p&1 is logically equivalent to p itself.\n5. Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8. Thus, this equivalence cannot be universally proven as valid according to the given equivalences rules since the right-hand side simplifies to a contradiction which does not capture the variability of the left-hand side correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A];[B]]",

This scenario does not directly align with the definitions and rules of the BC Paradox or the LS Paradox, as they involve different logical structures and the conditions of their paradoxes do not match the given expression directly.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the GB Paradox, we see a parallel in using the same observation (in this case, q being true regardless of p's status) to draw the conclusion that q holds true. This can reflect a situation similar to the GB Paradox where the same outcome (q being true) can be derived from different conditions (p真假不一的情况), thus reflecting a situation where conclusions may appear to contradict each other from different viewpoints, even though they lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to the provided logical expression is the **GB Paradox** as it can illustrate a situation where the same conclusion (q being true) is approached from two different premises and can present complexity in conclusively favoring one form of inductive reasoning over another if not appropriately distinguished.\n\n[[A]]",
