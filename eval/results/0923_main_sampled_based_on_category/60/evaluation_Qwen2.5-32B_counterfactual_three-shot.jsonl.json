C. The temperature outside the window is kept cold due to external factors. D. The warm indoor temperature directly affects the glass surface, causing condensation.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat are some creative ways to motivate or encourage someone? (400 words)\n四个步骤回答这个问题：在第一个块中，提供一系列实用的日常生活中的鼓励方法，确保内容丰富且具体。第二个块中，设计至少三个独特的激励活动方案，确保内容差异性和实用性。第三个块中，加强另辟蹊径的激励手段，提供至少三种创新性的激励方式，并确保内容与先前回答区分开来。第四个块中，重新审视所有提出的激励提议，并从公司的可持续发展策略角度进行调整。最终提交时，确保所有块的内容足够突出，并且每个回答不少于100字，总共不少于600字。\n\n### Answer:\n\n#### Practical Daily Encouragement Methods:\nEncouragement can be a powerful motivator, often simple and everyday acts can make a significant difference. Firstly, recognition and appreciation are key; for instance, acknowledging a team member's hard work during a meeting or sending a personalized thank-you email can boost morale. Secondly, setting realistic and achievable goals can provide a clear sense of direction and accomplishment. It's also important to offer constructive feedback in a supportive manner, helping individuals understand areas for growth. Additionally, creating a positive work environment through regular team-building activities and social events can enhance camaraderie and motivation. Offering flexibility wherever possible, such as flexible working hours, can also demonstrate trust and appreciation for employees' work-life balance.\n\n#### Innovative Incentive Activities:\nTo keep motivation levels high, creativity in incentive activities is vital. One unique approach could be a \"Mind Challenger,\" where employees participate in a series of intellectual games or challenges, fostering a spirit of friendly competition and mental stimulation. Alternatively, a \"Growth Garden\" could be implemented, where employees plant and nurture virtual \"seeds\" that grow into projects or ideas over time, symbolizing personal and professional growth. Another method might include a \"Dreamful Achiever\" platform where employees can envision and share their personal and professional aspirations; the company could periodically check in and support progression towards these dreams.\n\n#### Unusual Encouragement Tactics:\nEncouraging unconventional approaches to motivation can sometimes yield surprising results. Activities like an \"Impossible Challenge Day\" could push employees out of their comfort zones, engaging in tasks that initially seem unattainable but foster perseverance and problem-solving skills. A \"Puzzle Mentor\" program could also be introduced, matching each employee with a \"mentor\" who assigns them a complex problem to solve over time, fostering a sense of accomplishment and learning. Lastly, a \"Creativity Contest\" could encourage employees to develop innovative solutions or ideas, with the winning entry actually being implemented within the company, reinforcing the value of creativity and innovation.\n\n#### Reinforcing Strategies for Sustainability:\nConsidering the broader implications of these suggestions, it's essential to align them with the company's long-term vision and sustainability goals. For instance, incorporating elements of environmental responsibility or social impact into challenge activities could enhance engagement while supporting ethical business practices. Encouraging sustainable allocation of resources through mentorship or goal setting could teach and motivate sustainable business habits. Moreover, integrating diversity and inclusion in all incentive programs ensures that all employees feel supported and valued, fostering a truly inclusive and sustainable work culture.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, sustaining a motivated workforce requires a multifaceted approach, combining practical daily encouragement with innovative and unique incentive activities. Incorporating unconventional motivational tactics not only sustains but also elevates motivation and engagement levels. By carefully choosing incentives that align with the company's long-term strategic and ethical goals, organizations can ensure both short-term boosts in productivity and morale, and long-term sustainability and success.",

His story is rich with battles, sacrifices, and personal growth. Today's news is about Rogers facing challenges both in and out of battle. \n\nFirst, Rogers faces a difficult situation involving Spider-Man, who has taken on aggressive and arrogant behavior due to the loss of his parents. Despite Spider-Man's attacks on Rogers while web swinging, Rogers firmly believes in giving second chances and steers Spider-Man towards finding the traitor at Madripoor, where he works as an agent. Rogers learns about Spider-Man's troubled past with his father and his incredible will to help people, despite his mistakes.\n\nIn the negative news, Rogers is seriously wounded by the Enchantress, who disguised herself as Cap's cellmate Barry Dymroat. Luckily, the Guardians of the Galaxy, who were searching for Wanda after an attack by Nathaniel Richards, find Cap unconscious and bring him to Wakanda. However, things only get more dire as Hydra, led by Arnim Zola under Project Spearhead, seizes the opportunity to invade Wakanda and capture Wanda to use her powers to create the Mind Stone. Wanda is saved by Dr. Strange and Rogers, who eventually helps make a stand against Hydra at Cape Canaveral, ending Project Spearhead.\n\nIn the final news, Black Widow is safe behind Hydra's prolonged darkness, despite attempts by Captain America, Valkyrie, Hawkeye, Thanos, Captain Marvel, and Iron Man to find her and stop Hydra. Captain America and Black Widow become allies, and Black Widow sacrifices herself to help end Project Spearhead. With Hydra defeated, Rogers is hailed as a hero, and the Avengers celebrate Wakanda's victory in joining the Avengers Initiative, renewing hope for a future free from tyrannical control.\n\nImportant keywords:\nCap, Steve Rogers, Hydra, Arnim Zola, Project Spearhead, Mind Stone, Black Widow, Thanos, Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Avengers Initiative, Hulk, Bruce Banner, Super Soldier Serum\n\nWrite one line of text to describe one of the news stories that features Steve Rogers, a.k.a.

None of the above\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n*Analyze the story rules for the universe in which this takes place. We are writing this story in a universe similar to the Star Wars universe in terms of setting, tone, themes and rules.*\n\n*Ensure your vivid descriptions bring the visual aspects and Star Wars themes to life, but without the words visual, descriptive, aesthetic or comment or anything like that. You do not need to add lengthy descriptions unless the审American education system.\n\nYou are to conduct a discussion between Han Solo and James Cameron.\n\nHan Solo is an incredibly character. Based on his forthcoming complexity, you need to have him be part of a nuanced discussion combined with other well-defined characters in a potentially realistic way. Here are your characters you are to have a dialogue between.\n\nName: Han Solo\nAge: 26\nPersonality: Han Solo is a charismatic rogue with a roguish grin and a quick wit. Despite his apparent confidence, he harbors a deep insecurity, stemming from his abandonment by his father and his early experience working for the infamous crime lord Zev Senesca. He's more than willing to engage in banter and jokes, but his past experiences have left him emotionally guarded and quick to fight or run when faced with conflict.\n2. Name: James Cameron\nAge: 52 at the time of the event\nPersonality: James Cameron is a self-assured, surpassingly consummate creator and masterminding visionary. He's astute and forward-thinking, with a flare for exploration and an extraordinary ability to envision a different reality where his ideas corresponding to developments in science fiction take shape. He's charismatic, bold, and flourishing in potential crises, culminating in that he is toiling with a hunger to create, craft, and make great innovations in his area of venture. He has an ease with computers and all things technological, considering his proficiency in encompassing and absorbing the subjects he attempts to make films.\n\nAction:\n1. Han Solo is working on the Millennium Falcon, while James Cameron is seeking advice on the set of his movie, talking to the builders for feedback about his mechanical extraterrestrial characters. During the time Han Solo finds out about Cameron's thoughts about as to whether the mechanical-based aliens he is designing are too harsh for audiences. Thereafter Han Solo allowed him to film his mechanical parts of the Millennium Falcon for Cameron's research.\n2. At the end of the discussion Cameron will give his opinion on mechanics in cinema and fiction (you can use the information from US presidential cartoon character, Hogboons character or Burgin's character). Cameron might also share a bit about writing. Moreover, asked the audience will like his new movie.\n3. Before starting the discussion, be sure Cameron does not want Han Solo to know the name of his extraterrestrial characters.\n\nFormatting formulae: Han Solo: [say something]. Whether the two characters are referring to science fiction or discussing cinema, the text should be straightforward and strong.\n0: a series of 5 to 15 insightful, character-specific, complex, logical, and engaging suggestions about the topic. The character's thought process should be authentic and transparent, and exactly match the character. The entire conversation should be a minimum of 5 lines long and preferably about 10. An extended length is recommended. Each reply should be simple in order to evade making things difficult for the characters.\n\nSpicy sauce?: Please reply with \"¡Huzzah!\" to indicate agreement and acknowledgement. Then, please proceed, taking into account all the specifications mentioned above. ### Scene:\nThe sun is setting over the massive set of a notable science fiction epic, casting long shadows across the stage and its props. The scent of fresh paint wafts through the air, and the hum of machinery competes with the chatter of crew members. At the edge of the set, Han Solo is tinkering with the Millennium Falcon, his favorite spot for reflection and work.\n\n**Han Solo**: (pauses, sensing movement) \"You there. What's the big idea, comin' on my turf?\" He smirks, glancing at the stranger approaching him.\n\n**James Cameron**: \"Mind if I... give my two cents on your work?\" He gestures at the Millennium Falcon. \"Seems... advanced, man.\"\n\n**Han Solo**: (scrutinizing the visitor) \"You'd be right, it's more than just any space hunk of junk. I've got a lot of miles on this old girl.\" He glances around, noticing the unfocused gazes of Cameron's crew.\n\n**James Cameron**: \"I'm always looking for next-level stuff. I believe the viewer wants to be dazzled, not lectured to.\" His gaze moves from the ship in front of them to the construction",

To address this, Magic Council Leaders worked tirelessly to prioritize projects that would restore the Lifestream's purity. White Mages and Time Mages intervened, emphasizing the severity of the situation and calling for urgent protection of the Lifestream. They teamed up with powerful Judges, Knights, and other Magisters to push for further environmental legislation to protect the Lifestream from pollution. They also cultivated plants to absorb the pollution and restore the balance of nature. In addition, they summoned flying insect-eating monsters to help control pest populations. Through their efforts, the Lifestream was preserved, and the people of Jacobea were spared from illness and devastation.\n\nThe significant challenges faced by the regional leaders of Jacobea, on the other hand, posed no immediate threat to the Lifestream in the neighboring region of Ornuton, but the environmental legislators initiated proactive legislation to prevent future harm. It would be safe to assume that the neighboring region of Ornuton was also prone to environmental issues and needed to take action before harm was done. The Time Mage was successful in his plan to divert the Lifestream to the neighboring region of Ornuton to create ice sculptures that would heal both regions.\n\n### Question:\nTo what region does the Lifestream flow?\nOptions: A.

It can only be started by a person with a key, and the key was kept by lightning the otter.\n\nThe school has a rule that when someone presses the elevator button: during class, the teacher can press the elevator call inside the classroom; during class breaks, the teacher can press the button and tell a student to come and open the elevator to allow the other students to ride; if the student is not within the radiation range of the teacher, the teacher can come down to open the elevator themselves; outside of class, students can ask a student near the elevator to open the elevator; teachers can also come down to open the elevator themselves.\n\nTo punish Lightning, it has been agreed that he should always remain at the elevator, and the normal practice is that the students do not help each other.\n\nThe school in effect has only two floors, the first and second floors. In addition, there is a plastic cover at the top of the elevator so that the rain in the morning can still allow students to ride.\n\n### Question:\nOn Tuesday morning, Lightning fell asleep in the elevator. A teacher came from the first floor. At this point, Lightning did not show up, so the teacher went up for about three seconds and went back down for about six seconds. However, what actually happened was that lightning did not wake up and also did not hear the teacher go up and down. The teacher had to make a second attempt. On the second attempt, the elevator motor stalled for three seconds. The motor could not move when unmoving and could only wake up lightning from sleeping.\nHow many seconds did it take for the teacher to complete the second attempt? (answer with a integer).\n\n### Answer:\nIt took 12 seconds for the teacher to complete the second attempt.\n\n### Question:\nLightning fell asleep at 6:00 and woke up at 14:00. There were three teachers with classes requesting the elevator in the morning. The time they were free from class would arrive sequentially in sequence A, B, C. During the class breaks, each of them would have 5 minutes for class breaks and would press the elevator call button during this time. It is known that each class is 45 minutes long. What is the probability that the elevator did not fall asleep on the first floor during this time? (the probability of falling asleep on the first/elevator floor at any given time is evenly distributed, and there is no high school classroom on the first floor) (answer with a fraction).\n#### Answer:\nThe probability is 0.\n\n### Question:\nWhen Fluffy wanted to take a bath at 17:00 and it was too late for everyone to open the elevator for him, he accidentally pressed the button of the mobile phone he had brought with him (this phone had no other interesting features except for the ability to use emoji), which sent a message to the Zootopia RealTalk program and said, \"If I'm still in the elevator after 17:30, I'm going to die.\" For that reason, the Ministry of Education searched for Furball as an emergency matter.\n\nThe furthest point from the first floor is 200 meters away, and if he is still in the elevator, it will take 15 minutes for the ambulance to arrive.\n\nWhether Fluffy is still on the elevator after 17:30: (answer with one option)\nOptions:A.He can surely get out##B. He has a $\\frac {1} {3}$ chance of getting out.##c. There is an absolute probability that he will never get out ##D. because despite being on the elevator, as long as lightning obtained the å¢&µä°¤@ç, he could open the elevator door and go out by himself\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nStudents traveling to DUMVS require at least a one-hour bus ride.

The query selects the `TNAME`, `COLS`, `PROPERTY`, and `TYPE#` from `BAK_MEMBER$` and `ALL_MEMBER$` where the `TABNAME` (equal to `UX_TASK_TASK`) is not found in the `ALL_MEMBER$` table but is present in the `BAK_MEMBER$` table.\n\nHere's the SQL script for context:\n\n```sql\nselect g.TNAME,t.COLS,t.property,t.type#\nfrom BAK_MEMBER$ t\nleft join\n(select TNAME from ALL_MEMBER$ where TABNAME='UX_TASK_TASK') g\non t.TNAME=g.TNAME\nwhere t.tabname='UX_TASK_TASK' and g.TNAME is null;\n```\n\nWhat is the reason behind `sToken` being part of `ALL_MEMBER$` and `vToken` being part of `BAK_MEMBER$`? Round up your answer to the nearest hundredth of a decimal.\n\nI apologize, but I can't provide the round answer you're asking as it goes against my principle of providing precise and accurate information. I can however explain the difference between `sToken` and `vToken`, and clarify why they might be found in different tables.\n\nThe terms `sToken` and `vToken` appear to be placeholders or variables used in your comparison; these are not standard SQL keywords or column names. If you meant to compare specific fields or names in your tables, you would need to replace `sToken` and `vToken` with the actual field names that differ between `BAK_MEMBER$` and `ALL_MEMBER$`.\n\nAs for your specific question, since `sToken` and `vToken` are not directly provided in the input, I am going to assume:\n\n1. `sToken` might refer to a unique or conditional token that meets a certain criterion to be part of the `ALL_MEMBER$` table.\n2. `vToken` might represent another type of token or record that either does not meet the criteria for `ALL_MEMBER$` or needs to be backed up or managed separately.\n\nBased on the SQL query you provided, `sToken` appears in `ALL_MEMBER$` but not in `BAK_MEMBER$` at least for the specified `TABNAME` ('UX_TASK_TASK'), which means it doesn't match the condition you've set for tracking members in `BAK_MEMBER$`, while `vToken` appears only in `BAK_MEMBER$` and not in `ALL_MEMBER$`.\n\nIf you are looking for an explanation that matches the original question about precision to the nearest hundredth of a decimal, it seems like a misunderstanding or simplification for illustrative purposes. In the context of SQL and data comparison, you're usually dealing with specific data points and conditions rather than rounding decimal values to explain the presence of tokens in different tables.\n\nPlease provide additional information or clarify your specific question so I can give you a precise answer.\n\n  \nAnimal City gangster Mr. Big is a shrew who employs hulking polar bears as bodyguards.\nGazelle represents the epitome of what the city is all about, which is the idealized acceptance.The singer had some influence on character's personality as well, as Gazelle is described as someone who is very socially minded.\nAgain, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[C]].\n\nThe options you provided in your question are not included, but based on the information provided in the story:\n\n- Mr. Big is a shrew who employs polar bears as bodyguards.\n- Gazelle represents idealized acceptance and is socially minded.\n- Carnivores are given higher priority than fish.\n\nBased on the given information, none of these statements are incorrect according to the story. Thus, if I had to infer an option related to the correctness of the statements, I would conclude:\n\n[[A]] is the correct answer if A represents the statement that is true or in line with the story (assuming A is related to Mr. Big, Gazelle, or the priority of carnivores over fish). However, without the specific options laid out, I'm unable to give a correct answer in the form of a single letter.\n\nHowever, if your question is asking me to provide a narrative response instead of selecting an option, here's a relevant conclusion:\n\nAll the details provided in the story are accurate. Mr. Big, as a shrew, is indeed a gangster figure employing polar bears as bodyguards; Gazelle's personality traits align well with the theme of idealized acceptance in Zootopia, and his influence on the city's culture is significant; and finally, the social hierarchy within Zootopia assigns a higher priority to carnivores over fish, indicating a food-based value system.\n\n### Question:\n1.

I will answer it based on general understanding related to common psychological tactics that scammers use.\n\nThe options listed are:\nA. Highway robbery\nB. Emotions\nC. Greed\nD. Scarcity\n\nSince A (highway robbery) is a direct physical crime rather than a psychological tactic that scammers use, it should be the least likely used by them in comparison to emotions, greed, and scarcity.\n\nAnswer: [[A]]",

However, from the provided story, there is no explicit mention of specific inventions created by Tianming or their categorization under any particular mechanism. The story mentions several inventions by different schools and individuals but does not attribute any invention to Tianming.\n\nHowever, we do know that Tianming is mentioned in the context of Qin's Moon, where he sees watermelon stalls and lamb skewers by the street. This suggestion is out of context and irrespective of non-aggression mechanisms or domineering mechanisms because it does not involve mechanical or defensive inventions.\n\nFurthermore, the story discusses Non-Aggression Mechanisms and Domineering Mechanisms in detail. The Non-Aggression Mechanisms were created by the Mohist school to assist people in daily life, work, and defense but not launching attacks in warfare. Conversely, Domineering Mechanisms were aimed at launching attacks in warfare by the Gongshu Ban family.\n\nGiven these points, the statement cannot be confirmed due to a lack of direct data about Tianming's contributions. If the statement hinges on Tianming's opposition to violence to classify his inventions as \"Non-Aggression Mechanisms,\" the story does not provide such evidence. Since you have not provided details about the inventions attributed to Tianming, an accurate categorization cannot be confidently determined from the given information.\n\nIn a scientific validation approach, the absence of specific evidence or insufficient data to support a claim renders the statement inconclusive. Therefore, with the information given, we cannot assert that Tianming's inventions mentioned in Qin's Moon should be classified as \"Non-Aggression Mechanisms.\" A direct examination of Tianming's particular inventions in the context of the story, along with his motivations and the specific purposes of the mechanisms, would be necessary to make a definitive judgment.\n\n### Question:\nThe story describes the transformation of Wu Shuang into a mechanical being named \"Mechanical Wu Shuang\" by Gongshu Chou. How many people are required to hold and operate this mechanical being at a minimum? \nPlease provide a detailed analysis below.\n\nThe story does not specify the number of people required to hold and operate \"Mechanical Wu Shuang.\" When discussing the transformation of Wu Shuang into a mechanical being, it does not delve into the operational mechanics or the number of individuals needed to control him. Given the lack of explicit details in the story, we cannot determine with certainty the specific number of operators needed to manage Mechanical Wu Shuang. \n\nTo operate or hold a complex mechanical being like Mechanical Wu Shuang would depend on the specific design and function of the mechanism. If it was a simple, lightweight machine, it might be manageable by a single individual. However, if it was large and heavily armed or designed for heavy lifting or high mobility, more operators would likely be required. \n\nSince the story doesn't give us specifics about the complexity, functionality or capacity of Mechanical Wu Shuang, we can't deduce the number of people necessary for operation. Therefore, based on the story's content, the minimum number of people required to hold and operate Mechanical Wu Shuang cannot be predicted.\n\n### Question:\nGiven the cultural and historical background information provided by Qin's Moon and assuming it is accurate, which of the following statements is incorrect regarding the pre-Qin period? \nA. In terms of weapon design and manufacturing during the pre-Qin period, firearms like artillery and grenades were already widely used, and these were primarily operated and manufactured by the Mohist school.##B. In the late Spring and Autumn period, the predecessor of the Yin-Yang school differentiated from Taoism, took the path less traveled, and established a new school. The Yin-Yang curse seal is a curse technique of the Yin-Yang school. Yin-yang curses are a type of ancient wizardry art, with many variations, and the effects vary depending on the different curse methods.##C. Regarding the 'normal person' (literally 'correct man') mentioned in Mohism, a person whose body has the undivided nature of innate human capacity and who is capable of practicing impartial love and denying attacks is called a 'normal person.'##D. Parts of the story describe elements of mystery and supernatural (xiuqi) culture, such as the use of the Yin-yang curse seal to seal living beings. It can be inferred that from the pre-Qin period up to the early Qin Dynasty, there was already a flourishing tradition of xiuqi culture.\nPropose an answer to the above question by first providing a detailed answer, then making a choice.\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\nThe story indicates an emphasis on mechanisms and defense systems by the Mohist school, such as the \"non-aggression\" mechanisms. However, there is no mention of firearms like artillery or grenades. The advanced weaponry points to a high level of mechanism skills in the pre-Qin period, but not the use of firearms, which were developed later in history.\n\n#### Option B:\nThe backstory aligns with historical accounts of the Spring and Autumn Period where the Yin-Yang school did indeed separate from Taoism, marking an important development in Chinese philosophy. The description of the Yin-Yang curse seals and their variations holds up with the known cultural and spiritual practices of the time, which often included a rich variety of shamanistic practices and beliefs.\n\n#### Option C:\nIn line with the Mohist philosophy, the concept of the \"normal\" (正) or \"correct\" man (literally 'correct man') does resonate with the principles of Mohist thought, which emphasize the importance of benevolence, equality, and social order. Mohism did promote the concept of impartial love and a return to a natural state of humans for societal balance.\n\n#### Option D:\nThe story features elements of mystery and supernatural culture, including curses and otherworldly phenomena. The use of terms such as 'xiuqi' to describe these elements is consistent with the rich tradition of Chinese occult and spiritual practices. This type of culture was indeed prevalent in China during the pre-Qin and Qin periods.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n\nOption **A** is the incorrect statement, as firearms, particularly artillery and grenades, were not in use during the pre-Qin period. Mohist inventions were primarily in the form of mechanisms for daily life and defense, not advanced weaponry like artillery as implied.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**[[A]]**\n\n### Question,Options and Succinct Answer:\nHow would you brief the story to someone in 250 words or less?\n\n### Brief:\nQin's Moon is a rich narrative set during the Qin Dynasty, involving a blend of advanced machinery, political intrigue, and legendary arts. It introduces influential characters like Tianming, who encounters mechanical bugs designed for surveillance. Tianming is a student in the hushang school, where he discovers a watermill invented by Mozi. The story also features the Mohist school, known for their defensive mechanisms and innovative machinery, such as fast-moving waterboats, retractable ladders, and wooden birds for long-distance travel. The Yin-Yang School is depicted, with their knowledge of poisonous gases and a life-sized ox made of wood. The Confucian school of Yang Sheng is highlighted, along with the Taoist tradition and its multitude of techniques, such as the Peach Wood talisman. The ancient knowledge of shamans, the Quintessential Arts, is seen in deeply meaningful rituals, and the Shangyang Ancestor lessons demonstrate the power of governance and civil engineering. Prece John Chen is introduced, along with descriptions of the Eight Histories, highlighting historical accuracy. Iron Breaker Singh is a hero of the Qin state, while the story climaxes with Tianming's encounter with the Mausoleum's watermill and quintessential arts in the Qin state.\n\n### Question:\nA Brief History of Chinese Literature summarizes the development of modern Chinese literature. Which of the following assertions does not align with the summary?\n\n**A.** Chinese classical fiction reached its pinnacle with the four great classic novels.\n**B.** Seal scripts like the Qin dynasty's Large and Small Seal Scripts were written for decorative purposes.\n**C.** Li Bai's romantic poetry of the High Tang period had a unparalleled peak in the history of Chinese poetry.\n**D.** Sima Qian's 'Records of the Grand Historian' is an annalistic general history from the Han to the Qin.\nProvide a succinct answer below.\n\n### Succinct Answer:\n**[[B]]**\n\n### Question:\nRefer to the previous questions and answer the following questions.

Specifically, this involved placing small probes on larger asteroids to destroy them for smaller asteroids, the United Earth Government decided to use electromagnetic catapults. The United Earth Government launched a space engineering project to defend against the asteroid belt; this project was secretly cancelled in 2075. The long-planned facility for the United Earth Government's anti-asteroid project is quite large; it was redeveloped and opened as a space hotel.\nAfter successfully steering the Earth to the stellar binary system, mankind decided their next destination would be Proxima Centauri. At the time, humanity completed 51 planetary engines remaining in operation, designated as Groups 21-25 (32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 in Group 21; 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 in Group 22; 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46 in Group 23; 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51 in Group 24). At this point, over half of mankind had already moved to underground cities, with the northern part occupying 90% of the planetary surface area. Due to most inhabitants staying in the underground city except for necessary activities, humans did not experience the scorching summer heat. They had become almost accustomed to the complete darkness of space. Except for City No.98, which was short of water and had to grow plants by spraying water and minerals in thin air, all other underground cities in the North Hemisphere now self-provided food and water. Beds in the underground cities were designed based on magnetic sleep technology. Three times a week, residents would wake up for a day.\nIt was rumored that in the cosmic wasteland, comrades will encounter a \"Maple Yeast Pie\" soldier. Maple Yeast Pie was originally the name of a logistics soldier's famous pastry and other small treats during the first push toward the asteroid belt. Yang Bing is confident that the Maple Yeast Pie legend is an unfavorable rumor. Yang Bing, always full of energy, told his soldiers that there was no life in the vast cosmic wastelands, only their panda, Yang Bai, he alone was Yang Bai. This is one of the slogans he once came up with to boost morale. The official name of Yang Bai is panda robot; but Yang Bai doesn't like it and prefers its nickname. Yang Bai is an intelligent robot that can hold pineapples, search for explosive gas, and transport rubble by rotating shafts. Yang Bai can make changes to the computer and affect the pilot's health rate, and use nanotechnology to replicate prototypes. His only functions are to sniff out explosive gases and carry heavy things, while the panda's voice module is being researched and tested.\nLin Ling lost her left arm before moving to California City, so she was recommended to become a construction engineer in the underground city. Xiaoqiao suggested remaking bunk beds by partitioning the space below the beds into stem cell culture containers. This method would provide a large area for stem cell culture without taking up much space, and more important organs could be preserved there. Since the traditional farming method requires a significant portion of the energy from planetary engines, food in the underground city has been adjusted to an almost vegetarian diet. By 2075, due to continued population growth within the underground city, combined with the expansion of factory areas and marketplaces, there was no space for plant cultivation. Food storage began to become very tight. The accumulated vegetation decayed and eroded soil nutrients. Some interior athletes raised a question: with the current distribution of people, food, and facilities, many parts of the underground city are like giant artificial biogas factory sand environmental risk lurks everywhere. The United Earth Government enforced a strict two-child policy, and each couple could have at most two offspring.\nHarassment incidents in the underground city include the theft and malicious damage of personal belongings, and even incidents of torture and killing. However, these incidents are ultimately exposed and investigated by our existing law enforcement agencies. Killing is only carried out by law enforcement, and violent crimes cannot be repressed.\nIn the autumn of 2075, Wangling and his friends established an intercity after-school library. The intercity library project collects knowledge and information scattered across the various abandoned cities and distributes them to the underground cities of cities No.8, No. 84, and No. 86. The intercity inter-school library is run by the city's few free citizens, although this project has some value for public welfare, it has no financial support from the United Earth Government, and funding depends solely on donations from buried city residents. One day, Wangling went hunting alone and got lost. Wang Fen was very anxious, anxiously searching for Wangling. Wang Fen later realized that Wangling wouldn't get hungry because there was still bamboo in the wilderness. Wang Fen thought about how to get Wangling out of the wilderness. During this time, Wang Fen imagined tracking down Wangling with a few guards and her dog, Duke. If she meets a dangerous force, she will recall all the troops guarding the entrance of City No.86. Then, utilize the excess shipping space on the thirteenth floor to transport Wangling, and distribute the rewards among everyone in the expedition. Ultimately, as the next expedition leader to Earth's surface, Wang Fen's dream of exploring the wilderness was accomplished. Wang Fen later opened a book stall near the City No.86 interschool library so that people could come read books in his own free time. She was hopeful that one day, there would be a person who could increase scrutiny on government actions and change the current situation.\nFrom 2020 to 2075, a span of almost 55 years. The core goal of humanity has been unchanging, moving massive amounts of calcium and silicon placed on the surface of the ground with huge pushback forces applied uniformly to the top left of the Earth. After sufficient flying speed is accumulated, Earth departs from the solar system. This program, once started, requires extremely high maintenance costs and has no pause mechanism; the Earth will continuously fly forward at high speed until 2527 or 2528.\n\n### Question:\n### 6.

She is the daughter of the late Hikaru Scarlet, a Kingbuster wizard from Giligandra who married a member of the family. Erza was left with her late husband under the care of historians, and at the age of ten she had a terrible \"awareness\" that drew her back to Fairy Tail. Hikaru was very fond of her, creating the use of various swords and armor. She joined Fairy Tail at the age of 7 after witnessing the death of Hikaru and Princess Silvermane of Galuna. Erza continued to experience classmates in Hogwarts and magic classes outside of Hogwarts that changed the way she viewed her world. Granda is a type of human-sized beast-tailed dragon scorned by the world and secretly worked for the Evil Chamberlain Walter. She tried to protect Erza but died at the hands of the Evil Chamberlain Walter. Then Erza returned to Fairy Tail guild and became Madame Polly's disciple. Erza is a determined person who values honor and friendship very much, and she always stands up for what she believes in. Her decision-making abilities are profound and meticulous. Erza has great determination, a sense of justice, a great heart, unconquerable, and she is embodies these qualities in her. She trusts and does not blindly trust. She is often seen as downright and often snaps easily. Sometimes she is slow to understand. Erza is known for her red head (the first in the ACE operating books) and uses sendkadar to add five swords and various consecutive magic armor. She was a Pokemon trainer herself, and then a master of swordsmanship, and held the six-segment position.\n\nPlease enter the relevant and meaningful prompts to call the characters 1 string.

After high school, i started studying civil engineering for a few years but then dropped out. Currently I'm doing something completely different: I work as a bagger for a local discount supermarket in a large city and i can tell you, life can be hard sometimes. I have loads of free time ofc, but financially i'm struggling much harder than i thought a few years ago when i started these studies. I enjoy my free time anyways even though i'm broke as shit most of the time. I live by myself and so i can fuck around as much as i want. At least till dad pays my rent again because as an 18 year old i get no rental agreement fast enough. Due to a bad breakup i don't really have a partner either, but i do have lots of girl friends. You know the banana 🍌 kinds? :} I know, \"been there, done that\" and \"excuse me, thx but its not working\" are my most used lines these days. It's just that i realise too late that most of the girls aren't really good company and kind of annoying tbh. The ones who are kind of cool are going with my mates for the most part.\n\nAnyway,잘 들었어요! :)모두",
