The correct interpretation involves recognizing that the initial formulation of the left side, through any direct simplification, does not lead to a match with the right side's structure without deeply embedding into the logic of NAND or NOR operations implicit in the behavior of negating an OR operation directly through De Morgan's, which isn't directly cited in the simplifications allowed.\n\nGiven the structure and the aim to match $(p | q) & (!(p | q))$ through direct logical simplification from $(p & !q) | (!p & q)$ without deeply engaging in the implicit transformation via De Morgan's to directly compare the negation of the OR through AND operations directly specified, the equivalences provided do not straightforwardly confirm the equivalence without engaging in a deeper, non-explicitly-allowed transformation.\n\nTherefore, for the strict application of the provided basic equivalences to directly confirm or refute the equivalence:\n\n**The answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.

For \\(n = 4\\), this number is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n**Being a Basic Formula:**\nA formula is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes \\(m_0\\), which corresponds to the truth assignment where all propositional variables are false. In terms of our notation and the given rule, this means including the paired conjunctive term that represents the hexadecimal number 0, which is \\(m_0\\) in binary form (since \\(0_{16}\\) in binary is \\(0000\\), and \\(m_0\\) corresponds to this binary representation).\n\n**Being an All-Even Formula:**\nA formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have indices that are even. In the context of hexadecimal numbers used to denote these terms (where \\(m_i\\) or \\(M_i\\) corresponds to hexadecimal numbers), an even index translates directly to the binary representation ending in an even number of 1s. This is because even hexadecimal numbers (except zero) in binary start with 1 and have an even number of 0s following (or are 0 itself, which in binary is \\(0000\\)).\n\n**Intersection of Basic and All-Even Forms:**\nFor a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must include \\(m_0\\) (corresponding to the all-false assignment) and no other terms except those with even indices in their hexadecimal to binary correspondences.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables:\n- The only form that includes \\(m_0\\) and satisfies the all-even condition without including any other paired conjunctive terms (to adhere to the definition of being both a basic and an all-even formula simultaneously) is \\(m_0\\) itself. This is because including any other term, either from odd-indexed paired conjunctive terms (which would violate the all-even condition) or from even-indexed terms beyond \\(m_0\\) (which are necessarily included due to their pairing in the binary/hexadecimal scheme and the need to exclude all others for the formula to be basic), would contradict the criteria of being a basic or an all-even formula.\n\nThus, the only formula that satisfies both conditions is one that essentially represents the disjunction with no variable truth assignments beyond the all-false case, which is distinctly represented by \\(m_0\\). There are no other formulas under 4 propositional variables that can simultaneously be both a basic form and an all-even form due to the exclusivity of the conditions when applied strictly to their definitions as outlined.\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form with 4 propositional variables is 1.\n\n### Answer:\n[1]",

Here are the combinations:\n\n1. dispel(p, p ∨ q): Impossible to resolve directly.\n2. dispel(p, p ∨ ¬q): Impossible to resolve directly.\n3. dispel(p, q ∨ ¬r): Impossible to resolve directly.\n4. dispel(p, q ∨ r): Impossible to resolve directly.\n5. dispel(p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q): This results in 0, indicating \"Implausible\". However, since we aren't running the algorithm interactively and are more interested in the process and final outcome, let's continue with the assumption we're documenting the process without immediate termination for instructional clarity (real implementations would indeed terminate at this point).\n6. Resolutions between (p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r), and (q ∨ r) do not directly lead to a resolvable contradiction without a longer iterative process that eventually simplifes the clauses or leads to a contradiction.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and the focus on demonstrating the process, let's outline the expected approach rather than simulate each iterative step to resolution directly, as the actual iterative steps to simplification or reaching \"Implausible\" through direct resolution of clauses without a more complex, step-by-step manual application or a computational check are more nuanced and involve a cycle of adding new clauses to S2, moving S1 to S0, and repeating with the new S1 (from S2) until either \"Plausible\" is determined due to S2 becoming empty (signifying no contradictions found) or the process simplifies the formula to the point of reaching an immediate contradiction or an empty S2, indicating \"Implausible\".\n\nGiven the setup and the nature of the clauses, the primary point is to illustrate that the resolution process seeks to find contradictions (leading to \"Implausible\") through the iterative simplification of the CNF into resolvable disjunctive clauses. The specific sequence outlined above demonstrates the initial non-resolvability of pairs directly and hints at the iterative nature of the algorithm, where the process would continue with updating S0, S1, and S2 based on the resolutions possible within the constraints of the resolution rule.\n\n**Answer, with emphasis on the process and outcome format:**\n[[\"Implausible\"];[N/A]]\n\nThe \"N/A\" in the second part of the answer denotes that the number of cycles isn't directly computable in a step-by-step explanation without a detailed iterative resolution process, but it's implied that the process would iterate through cycles of resolution steps before ultimately identifying a contradiction (hence \"Implausible\"), typically after several cycles that simplify the initial clauses through the resolution process. In actual computational implementations or detailed manual resolutions, the number of cycles (or steps) before reaching a conclusion would be specific to the depth and breadth-first search strategies in resolving clauses. \n\nFor educational purposes, the key is understanding the algorithm's iterative process and how it seeks to resolve contradictions in a logical formula, leading to a conclusion of \"Plausible\" or \"Implausible\" based on the ability to simplify the formula through resolution without contradictions or with contradictions found, respectively.",

Moving on to Figure II (Form: P()M; S()M; ∴S()P):\n- The first statement is a universal negative (∀P⇒¬M), so it can't be P()M.\n- The second statement is an existential affirmative (∃S⇒M), so it fits S()M.\n- The conclusion is an existential negative (∃S⇒¬P), so it can't be ∴S()P.\n\nFigure II also doesn't fit the argument. Now let's check Figure III (Form: M()P; M()S; ∴S()P):\n- The first statement is a universal negative (∀P⇒¬M), so it can't be M()P.\n- The second statement is an existential affirmative (∃S⇒M), so it fits M()S.\n- The conclusion is an existential negative (∃S⇒¬P), so it can't be ∴S()P.\n\nFigure III doesn't fit the argument either.

However, we can analyze the pattern of the given statements to see if it matches any of the valid moods without adhering to the strict form requirements given the constraints of the figures not fitting exactly.\n\nGiven the pattern:\n- First statement: Universal Negative (∀P⇒¬M)\n- Second statement: Existential Affirmative (∃S⇒M)\n- Conclusion: Existential Negative (∃S⇒¬P)\n\nThe closest mood that matches this pattern, though not fitting strictly into any of the provided figures due to the mismatch in the first statement's placement, is a combination that isn't directly listed in the figures' valid moods as they were applied (since none of the figures strictly apply due to the initial mismatch in universal statement alignment with M()P). However, for the sake of analysis based on the essence of the statements' roles, it somewhat aligns with aspects of an \"A type\" for the first statement's intended implications (though it's negated, making it more akin to an O-type in terms of focusing on non-Ms for Ps, and then S exists as M, concluding with S not being P, which echoes a negation flow more closely to an O-series mood in traditional syllogism classification but doesn't fit neatly due to the existential nature of the middle term's revelation and the universal negative implication leading to an existential negative conclusion without a strict figure adherence).\n\nGiven the constraints and the issue of none of the figures matching perfectly due to the specific way the existential and universal statements are laid out (with the first statement being a universal negative, which doesn't align with the M()P, P()M structures in a way that directly corresponds to the listed valid moods within the strict figure formats), the analysis concludes that the argument does not strictly match any of the Figure-Mood combinations listed in the initial rules.\n\nHowever, for a direct answer format you requested, acknowledging the initial misalignment in fitting the argument into the exact figures with moods due to the constraints you noted:\n\n### Answer:\n[[None];[N/A]]\n\nThis answer indicates that the argument does not neatly fit into any of the provided figures with a corresponding mood based on the strict interpretation of the figures and moods given.

This does not directly match one of the provided formulas but can be related to the idea that if something is not necessarily true, its opposite could be considered possible. Therefore, we look for a formula that best captures this nuance.\n   - Formula (9) #p → $p comes closest in the sense that if something is necessarily possible, then it is just plainly possible. However, to directly align with the given scenario, we need to adjust our understanding of the relationship between # and $ as described in the Four Modal Proposition Relationships. Specifically, relationship (1) applies where #p and $¬p cannot both be true or false, indicating a strict separation between necessity and possibility for the same proposition.\n   - Given the structure of the initial scenario involves the interplay of two actions (pulling hair and leaving the earth) rather than a single proposition's necessity and possibility, we need to focus on how the negation of necessity intertwines with possibility. The closest conceptual match in the operations and relations provided, considering the interplay and the negation involved, is more aligned with understanding the implications of necessity and possibility relationships as outlined but not directly matched by the numbered formulas.\n\nHowever, the direct inference from \"A person cannot necessarily pull their own hair and leave the earth\" to \"A person cannot possibly pull their own hair and leave the earth\" isn't straightforward from the provided formulas as structured. The inference involves a shift from negating necessity to asserting impossibility, which is a stronger claim than merely stating what is possible. \n\nGiven the structure and the aim to find a direct match or the most conceptually aligned formula from the provided, the process involves inferring a stronger claim (from not necessarily true to impossible) which doesn't have a direct numerical match in the provided modal logic inference formulas. \n\n### Answer:\nWhile the question aims to find a direct match from the provided formulas, the inference and its alignment to the given logical operations and relationships highlight a nuance not directly encapsulated by the listed modal logic inference formulas. The closest conceptual alignment in the context of discussing the interplay between necessity and possibility without a direct numerical match suggests a recursive application of the principles, especially around negation and the implications of necessity (#) and possibility ($):\n\n- The inference from \"cannot necessarily\" to \"cannot possibly\" involves a leap from negating necessity (#) to asserting impossibility (which can be seen as !$, given that \"cannot possibly\" negates \"possible\").\n\nGiven the focus on finding a formula that corresponds to the direct inference asked in the question, the exercise underscores the need for a formula that explicitly bridges the negation of necessity to the assertion of impossibility in a single step, which is not directly provided in the list. \n\n### Answer (Approximate conceptual match):\n[[(1)]]$ - This is not a direct match but conceptually, the transformation from necessity to possibility in the context asked, considering the aim to find a closest principle, indirectly involves recognizing that if something is not necessarily possible (negating the necessity of the conjunction), it implies a different level of possibility discourse, which, while not formulaically matched in the provided, conceptually aligns with exploring the implications of # and $ relationships and their negations. The closest practical application would be related to how negations interplay with # and $, guiding toward understanding the implications rather than a direct numerical [[number]] match.",

According to the Time Proposition Relationships (Relationship 1), we can symbolize \"past period of time\" (A) paired with \"past point in time\" negation (H¬p) as they cannot both be true nor both false. Since the proposition is true, we use \"A\" and the logical conjunction operator (∧) to combine it with the ordinary proposition \"p\" (representing Wang Qiang worked in Beijing), resulting in \"Ap ∧ p\".\n\nFor the second proposition, \"Lin Min has lived in Ningbo in the past,\" we again use the \"past point in time\" negation (H¬p) because it refers to a specific event in the past. However, since the rule directly connects \"A\" and \"H¬p\" in the context of what cannot both be true or false, and since the statement is true, we directly use \"Ap\" to represent \"Lin Min has lived in Ningbo\" and combine it with the understanding that it refers to a past event, thus \"Ap\". The ordinary proposition \"p\" could be used for both, but for the sake of directly applying the given logical structures, \"Ap\" alone sufficiently represents the proposition in the context of past events without needing to negate it explicitly, as the focus in reporting is on the truth of the statement rather than a strict binary negation within the provided logical framework's explicit pairs.\n\nTherefore, the representation focuses on the \"A\" aspect for both as they both refer to past events, with the understanding that \"p\" serves as the assertion of truth for the ordinary propositions they represent, but for the strict application of the given logical operators and pairs, \"Ap\" directly symbolizes the past event proposition of the second statement, with the implicit understanding that it is indeed referring to a point in time where both cannot be false (as per the relationship rules provided).\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the format asked for, and considering the instructions for pair relationships and the focus on displaying a direct application of the logical operators given the events are clearly in the past, the first answer stands as the correct application:\n\n[[Ap ∧ p]; []]\n\nThis format shows the logical breakdown of the proposition into its past time period aspect and the truth of the statement, directly applying the logical operator for past events and the truth of the ordinary proposition. The second proposition, while true, is more directly represented by its \"A\" aspect due to the question's focus on symbolizing the propositions rather than deeply dissecting all possible logical implications beyond the directly provided logical structure pairs.",

This can be represented in terms of the logic rule as \\(Ap \\vee A¬p\\), acknowledging it could have been a specific time or more broadly, any time within a past period.\n\nFrom the inference formulas:\n\n1. \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) - This suggests if \\(Ap\\) (Dr Lee worked on farms in the past at a specific point) is true, then \\(H¬p\\) (past point in time when Dr Lee did not work on farms) must also be true, but it doesn't directly align with the given statement as it implies a negation that isn't explicitly provided.\n2. \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\) - This implies if \\(A¬p\\) (Dr Lee worked on farms in the past at a specific point but not at a specific time specified) is true, then \\(Hp\\) (a specific past point when Dr Lee was not working on farms) is false, which is a logical deduction but not the primary implication.\n3. \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) - This suggests if \\(Hp\\) (a specific past point when Dr Lee worked on farms) is true, then \\(A¬p\\) cannot be true, aligning more closely with the exclusion of the statement \"at some time\" not specifying the point.\n4. \\(H¬p ↔ ¬Ap\\) - This aligns with the idea that if Dr Lee never worked on farms at a specific past point, then it's not true that he worked on farms at a specific past time, fitting the negation aspect but focusing on the negative rather than affirming the positive aspect of the past.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and how it relates directly to the inference formulas, the correspondence is most directly with the concept of \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true in some form, acknowledging a past action without specifying the exact timing. The formula \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) and indirectly \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) (through the negation implied by \"some time\") are the closest in concept, emphasizing either a specific point or period without directly mapping 1:1 due to the nuance of \"in the past\" versus \"at some time in the past.\"\n\nTherefore, while none of the formulas perfectly encapsulate the statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" without interpretation, the logic most closely parallels with the understanding of past actions over specific points or periods. The closest correspondence in terms of directly matching the inference process outlined by the formulas, especially considering the interpretation needed to fit \"at some time\" into the \"point\" or \"period\" distinctions of \\(A\\) or \\(G\\), would most accurately be related to the implications of \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true, with the formula \\(Hp ↔ ¬A¬p\\) and indirectly through negation, \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\).\n\nGiven the interpretative approach needed to fully align the statement with the provided inferences, the direct correspondence in terms of exact formula matching is less clear, leaning towards the understanding that the statement implies conditions akin to \\(Ap\\) or \\(A¬p\\) being true, with the most direct alignment being with formulas involving \\(A\\) and its negation in relation to \\(H\\) or \\(F\\) through the lens of past-specificity or period.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of clarity in directly answering the initial question about how many correspond, given the interpretative nature required to fully link the statement to the formulas while accounting for \"at some time,\" the most straightforward alignment in concept is with the relationship between \\(A\\) propositions and their negations in relation to past points or periods, touching on \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\), acknowledging the \"some time\" aspect as requiring a broader interpretation across these formulas.\n\nThus, in a strict interpretation looking for exact formula matches without broadening to the conceptual implications on past actions and periods, the direct correspondence is challenging to pinpoint to a specific formula due to the statement's broad implication of \"at some time.\" Conceptually, the relations \\(Ap\\) and \\(A¬p\\) with their implications for \\(H\\) and \\(F\\) are the closest, but without a formula that exactly matches \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" without interpretation.\n\nFor the sake of providing a numerical answer that reflects the closest conceptual matches and the most directly aligned formulas based on the broad interpretation needed, one could argue for the inference relation closest to the given statement's implication regarding past actions broadly, which would lean towards the pair involving past points and their negations in relation to the existence of such actions in the past. This interpretation would lean towards formulas \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\) as the most directly related in concept, even if requiring a broader understanding of \"at some time\" to fully align with the given inference formulas.\n\n**Answer:** [[2]] formulas conceptually correspond closest to the inference involved in the statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\", focusing on the relationships \\(Ap ↔ H¬p\\) and \\(A¬p ↔ ¬Hp\\), with an emphasis on the interpretative link between past actions and the implications for specific points or periods in the past.",

This perspective suggests we're interested in a state where `φ` is true and will be true regardless of further iterations, which aligns more fundamentally with the necessity operator `[...]` rather than the possibility operator `<...>`.\n\nStarting from the Loop Rule:\n- `[ c* ]φ` is equivalent to `φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ)`.\n\nThis rule accounts for the possibility that `φ` is true before the loop even starts (`φ`) or, if not, it will be true after some execution (`[ c ][ c* ]φ`). Given Alice's conviction, we're specifically interested in a scenario where `φ` is necessarily true (`[...]φ`), not just possibly true (`<...>φ`), after the loop.\n\nTo represent Alice's belief focusing on the necessity of `φ` being true after the loop, we can't directly simplify from the Loop Rule's structure to a pure necessity statement without acknowledging the loop's iterative nature and the initial possibility of `φ` being false. However, under the interpretation that the loop continues until `φ` is true, with a strong conviction, we can approach the essence of her belief through an iterative application of the Loop Rule, iteratively applying the rule to imply that after enough iterations (which the concept of a loop inherently allows for an indefinite number), `φ` will necessarily be true.\n\nGiven the constraints and the desire to capture Alice's conviction in the simplest form considering the necessity of `φ` being true after the loop, we acknowledge the iterative process's foundation allows reaching a state where `φ` is not just possibly but necessarily true after the loop. This is inherently captured in the Loop Rule itself, as it fundamentally deals with the scenario until `φ` is true.\n\nTherefore, while strictly simplifying from the Loop Rule's direct application (`φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ)`) to directly state the necessity of `φ` being true after `c*` in the simplest form adhering to the asked for `[[]]` format, we are looking at the essence of the loop's operation to achieve a state where `φ` is necessarily true. The rule itself, when understood within the context of iterative execution towards the goal of `φ` being true, embodies the conviction that `φ` will be necessarily true after `c*`.\n\nThus, the most faithful representation of her belief, focusing on the outcome of the loop operation embodying her conviction, is directly through the Loop Rule:\n\n- `[ c* ]φ`\n\nThis is because, in the context of Alice's conviction and the rules provided, the Loop Rule not only accounts for the process of making `φ` true but also reflects the necessity of `φ` being true after the loop executes, given its infinite or iterative nature until `φ` is true. \n\nIn essence, the Loop Rule, in its standard form, directly captures the essence of Alice's belief in the necessity of `φ` being true after the loop, given the loop's purpose is to ensure `φ`'s truth. This simplification relies on understanding the iterative process towards the end goal of `φ`'s necessity as directly embodied in the application of the Loop Rule.",

This can be symbolized as `P(S, 75, 150)` for Region B.\n\nBoth regions show a similarity in the proportion of respondents who exercise daily, despite the difference in the total number of respondents. The proportion of respondents exercising daily is higher than 50% in both regions, which indicates a similarity in the attribute of exercising daily across these regions.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule:\n\n- If `C(S, 90/100, 75/150)`, then `Pr(S, P1) ≈ Pr(S, P2)`.\n\nThis means, symbolically, if we apply the C-Reasoning rule to the proportions of respondents who exercise daily (attribute S) in Region A and Region B, we can infer that both regions likely have a similar proportion of their populations who exercise daily, despite the difference in sample size.\n\nTherefore, the inference can be denoted as:\n\n```\n[C(S, 0.9, 0.5) → Pr(S, P1) ≈ Pr(S, P2)]\n```\n\nThis notation suggests that through C-Reasoning, if the observed proportions (90% in Region A and 50% in Region B, due to the simplification of 75/150) for the attribute of exercising daily are considered, we can infer that the two regions might have similar proportions of their populations exercising daily. The actual simplification of 75/150 to a comparative 0.5 in the symbolic notation is to illustrate the comparison process; in practice, this would involve more detailed statistical analysis to confirm the similarity in population attributes, but the core logic of C-Reasoning is to find similarities in attributes across different samples to infer similarities in the overall population attributes.",

The LS Paradox requires that the hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable, and their conjunction contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis r_n+1.
