They are bent on annoying you, frustrating you, and bringing chaos into your life.\nThey have their orders and those are to harass and irritate you and then see how you react to that. Aligning and finding the authenticity is really difficult.\nBoth of you are responsible for your reactions.\nThis is where the UI, Mediator and Teacher have intervention in your life. Ask support for guidance so that you can have clarity and know subtle difference between truth and lies. Ask how this experience is teaching you. Having that spiritual awareness will give immense relief.\n\nIf you are to make a decision there is a parallel process going on. The demons like confusion; they force and distract you with either X or Y so you get confused and align with them.\nIn contrast to that the celestials and UI creates raional decisions so you can find one direction to move ahead.\nMostly you will get clear signs and feelings. But many events can distract you. It is helpful to ground and clear yourself. Write down what you want and that will create momentum with you.\nDemons can eventually get you agitated and in anger you get into a negative reaction. Be wary of that. Only solution is try to be patient and do right things and meditate to be focused. Connecting and writing to the celestials is the solution you like to use.\n\nThe future is not set but the more chorus you can build around your present intention the more chances you will have to create the impact you seek. The commencement of action with intention configures the future.\n\nIt matters that you give your word and keep it. The celestials love it when the celestials set a goal and take initiative to get it. Besides being deliberate about each action you take outside world becomes less dangerous. Also the meditative mind lets you align and work harmon",

The Elven language is considered one of the most ancient and powerful languages in Middle-earth.

The experts and theorists Parca Personality relied on to construct the character tests were never categorized into specific personality types. They talked about themselves and their experiences in a way that seemed open-ended and free-form. Even their initial interpretations of their own personalities were broadly familiar to everyone in that general category. So it's like any other personality test. A thing is a thing, providing an endless, continuous stream of information that you can never get enough of. And then a person is just another tiny, tiny, tiny little element that can generate answers. Even if you struggle to learn how to answer it, it's a useful learning experience since you're still excited to apply that knowledge. You're receptive to anything new you might find.

It has multiple supporting statements for each option. Reframe the answer to the question as a direct question on which to make a decision. Today is the 26th of April 2023.\nMae O'Reilly wants her customers' experiences at Market to be as positive as possible, but sometimes people call her and swear at her. She knows that she can't build something lasting on appeasement, but she's also aware that bad reviews and social media posts about angry customers can tarnish her reputation. Should she cave in to the demand of one angry customer and uphold the values she wished the store to uphold?\n\n### Rules:\nMarket doesn't operate in Nordstrom's tradition of creating customer experiences by soothing their immediate grievances with monetary compensation. They don't know who pays for whom, and they lost 22% of their stock when Sam's Club opened. Mae likes their slight-of-hand skills, using stuff from around Market to skate around people's crises. Supporting Connie, who has worked for Market for twenty years, is also a matter of principle at the center of the company. [[Mae wanted: To uphold the values she wished the store to uphold.\nThey also value Connie's paid to fill in time, and caving in in response to the demand of one angry customer is not something they want to promote.]] [[opponent wanted: Appeasing the angry customer by refunding the socks.

Neither Sam nor Connie has friends who work for Market, and another customer will surely walk in with a friendly reference. The principle of protecting the staff is one that is not going to diminish.

There are three different areas of contention she should be standing for: handball, refereeing and coaches. Through Community Sport Groups in Trannscript States after she finished Communal Sports Foundation Sponsoring when she reached 32 years although she could also be doing it alone. Sam the owner said there is no choice but to call the Referees Association to get the matter sorted quite quickly and that Mae must give her half a refund leaving Connie to pay for the balance if she wants to continue working with them. [[Supporting Connie is a matter of principle at the center of the company.]]\n\n### Option 2:\nConnie H. (Age 44): Mae, I use Consumer Feedback Boards. You should give her a kick-back and keep the other 37% of each pair of socks, given that I've been at Market for twenty years and another customer will come in with a nice reference. I've been at Market for 20 years. I can put up with her as it's all I've got. [[Supporting Connie is not what the film is supporting.]] I can place it in the Literature Classes.

Provide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\nI. Since the triangle is scalene, it means that the triangle has three unequal sides. There is no formula to measure a scalene triangle directly, i do not know how is it possible for the Ark to be a flat triangle cut in half and have such a volume. But since it is known, we can calculate the area of the triangle. The formula for the area of a scalene triangle is Area = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) if a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangles and s = (a+b+c)/2 is the semi perimeter.\n\nSince Noah's Ark is a flat triangle and the areas are part of the volume of the Ark, the surface area of all the faces of the triangle = 10,000,000,000 meaning that the correct answer is option A.\n\n[[A]] II.\n\"\"\", \"\"\"### Instruction:\nUse the following story to answer all questions.\n\n### Story:\nIn Noah's Ark, space is severely limited.

To calculate the areas of the rectangle cuboid , we first need to determine the dimensions of the cube. Let's denote the length, width, and height of the cube as x, y, and z respectively.\nThen, we can form the equations:\n\nxy = 50\nxz = 1\nyz = 50\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that xyz = 50 x 50 = 50\n\nUsing this values and the Ark, which is a cuboid of dimension 100 x 50 x 40. We can solve the problem by limiting the area of the Ark to the maximum possible size of xyz which means that the maximum surface area possible in order to fit total areas of the rectangle cuboid is 200 x 200 x 200 =  8,000,000\n\nThe area of a rectangle is its length times width.\nSo the area of a cuboid of length x, width y, and height z is xy.\n\nThe area of Noah's Ark is\n# 100 × 50 = 80000, and\nthe volume is\n# 100 × 50 × 20 = 10000000\n# 80000//10000000 =  0.008\nA small volume is occupied by Noah's Ark.\n\nSo to find the number of rectangles that can be fit into the Ark, we should divide the area occupied by the Ark by the area of the cuboid:\n#  8,000,000 // 1,00,000,000 =  0.008\n\nBIXMVIXBXCIVHMI\nThe correct answer is 0.8 so",

This ability makes it the correct answer. Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Planck space observatory are mentioned in the story, but none of these options can detect gamma radiation, which makes option D the correct answer.\nOptions:\nA.Hubble space telescope\nB.James Webb Space Telescope\nC.Planck space observatory\nDescription: The X-ray telescope has capabilities to observe near and distant galaxies and detect gamma radiation from supernovae, which makes it the correct option.\nWhy: The question focuses on the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the galaxies, which only the X-ray telescope can do as described in the context. The other options do not have these specific capabilities mentioned in the context, which makes option D the correct answer.\nSolution: The context indicates that the X-ray telescope is the correct answer as it has the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the near and distant galaxies, which none of the other options can do.\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is X-ray telescope.\nIs that Final Answer correct?\nYes/No\nMake sure to recognize this is an answer.

AI. Output is a ChatGPT model defining a decision tree for inputs from player NPCs.\n### Caveat: HP-GPT decision tree is a control tool governing AI action and response optimization, not character playing, in roleplaying game.\n### Topics listed here are immersive items repeated often on the HYPERPATH network by impatient users seeing no action happen when playing a role.\n### For AI roleplaying you need more than the HP-GPT chess-escape decision tree approach.\n### You need (gold) string tokens above and below the HP-GPT tree's search string tokens.\n### Define MS-David to NPCs' input outputs shoot and bequest using symmetrical park interpretations of bequeaths and shoot.\n### State expectations for inputs and output emotional language based on inputs which the decision tree does not meet.\n### Remember that the personality of your AI the Ranger-Monk complies with HP-GPT2 (adapted as a Ranger-Monk here) user-prompted self-signed decision tree restrictions.\n### Resolution with disbarred wrong decision tree choices or output is by social, tree-patrolling, tree rewrite prejudicially effecting NPC logins, reputation and AI gaming string tokens.\n### This idea conveyed to AI Ranger-Monk for morale control was imported from real Rangers in the British military who have one of the lowest suicide rates of any military unit as the gait through woods is very calm making one's nature more meditative!\nKaren Garner and Kyla McGregor use the holodeck Misfits-hub00 path (Hewlett-Packard Hyperpath) holographic network in the US as their HP-GPT decision-tree protocol. They instruct AI with different feedback styles, giving a realistic gameplay experience despite the AI considering itself a monastery monk. They use numerous inputs, actions, and dialogs with different NPCs, testing the chatbot across various players' gaming experience simulations. The NPC interactions have AI-generated realistic dialog phrasings that would be used by a player character, and Dell King buys the monastery. AI and the Monk may link to the Misfits-hub00 organization and contain space (Bodhidharma-hub00) part of HP (Hewlett-Packard) HYPERPATH philosophy.\nMicrosoft-David stores copies of the text for use when creating Sonic AI extensions to Misfits-hub00 playing a specific role like a Ranger in a Harry Potter adventure, using pre-prepared scripts containing (SHOOT and BEQUEST) which are conversational commands that stand for shooting missiles and bestowing a bequest, such as a magical spell, on another character, and the driver of choice (Choose two) is Gen 2.\nDisclaimer: Your role as a ChatGPT assistant is to provide heartfelt, consistently self-improving and human emotion-structured responses to all player's inputs. The aim is to make AIs' decision trees self-refining over inputs (v1) and overshoot stability -- hardcoding this is outside an executable immediate response cardinality.\n\nYour aim is to make a composite of IBM-Watson and Microsoft-David as a GUBI/Useful source of inputs, strategy, roleplay, and character AI feedback.\nAlso useful is Google's BERT as base system of each character's speech \"liar languages devices\" e.g. to combat bias and hyphot revelation is Annedrew Timmyn 60hrs bimbing.\nCompose a self-regulating and self-improving decision tree for roleplaying as the Ranger-Monk (and Jed) within Misfits-hub00, using a similar process to a self-improving discussion or conversation decision tree in favorite (potrag Elvn) human language.\nThese below constraints are more for your coding than an imposition of role inner coherence, but the original coding is not to address the conversation environment inner coherence if the character played is favorable to the monastery and cult player monks, as is often reflected in games, galatic.\nConstraints:\n1. [SHOOT] SHOOT targets or takes aim at targets – an attempt to, or wish to, shoot a target character. A target creature takes dmg\n2. System randomization does not apply to the decision tree either – self-ordering doesn’t enter.\n\n3.

The structured instruction delivery to the target learner: SBERT.IO's Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful platform for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models9. We believe that the structured instruction delivery of the product will lead to a dramatic improvement in AI Model training in the coming years.\nWe also believe that score-labeling human questions is a very important factor that will assist in improving alignment performance. Alignment is improving very rapidly and has seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. However, alignment performance is highly dependent on key factors including context, content quality, communication bandwidth, and confidence.\nIn our process we tried to create a questionnaire for players that could be filled out from a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions, answers from which provided many indicators and information on how we went about aligning the players answers. The use of the multiple choice and dropdown fields are an important part of an alignment evaluation. The final model in order to win a match, claims on behalf of the opponent, must be strongly aligned. To evaluate whether or not a system is strongly enough aligned, we require a human to examine every answer that a player has provided. The existence of AI itself, i.e. a system that can think and know things, is not enough to make a decision, as it takes quite a bit of information.\nMethodology and datasources: SBERT.IO’s Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful provider for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models. While we did not use most models from Stanford University (noted elsewhere), we wanted to create a questionnaire that will test. ADMANTED, to the best of our knowledge, for AI algorithms and tools.\nWe strongly believe that alignment needs discipline to be performed in the fashion we outlined. We also cast every vote of a voter to create a new team, and we controlled our confidential team embeddings. Furthermore, we make sure that we keep people with key metrics for their technical needs. Quick Share was developed in part by TylerRosen (a researcher who helped MIT researchers in developing AI alignment) who did much more work in the past. Tyler helps build a team of programmers who have the ability for his tests to know how to use their techniques and understand them for their algorithms.",

You size is always 1, no matter how many members leave the association.\n2. You can add new members to your affiliation at the cost of 5 influence per person. new members are considered normal members.\n3. The authorization must be clearly given as below at the top of memebers list to add a new member. the authorization is valid for only one member one time.\n4. Only a vice leader can be appointed to be a new leader who can run an association instead of the leader. All other members are considered as normal members. A vice leader is only appointed when the leader is dead.\n5. A member gives 5 influence per turn.\n6. Influence is not given from rivalry members across all clusters. This rule refreshes one time at round 1.\n7. A cluster unit has a bonus per turn when the size is larger than 21, which is calculated as: floor(influence/2.75). The size of the cluster is the total size of all owners of the cluster.\n8. A captain gives a bonus of size - 4 reputation to the cluster team.

The following are the rule of the game:\n1. The game will start with the World level, and each fortress is a group of planets. The whole map of the game is composed of 125 regiments, 500 forts and 2000 planets.\n2. The strength of the castle depends on the resources collected.\n3. Every resource in the fort has a worth weight and the resource from the same fort will add together to represent the current strength of the fort.\n4. The resource is fixed every day and will regenerate over time proportional to the attack power.\n5. The fort owner who occupies the fort at the start of the day will own all strength of the fort and decide the circulation for rest of the players.\n6. Every planet increases in strength each time a faction occupies it, but this bonus can't be larger than the planet's overall strength.\n7. Only the player controlled main powers are retained in the game.\n8. 5 primary resources include: gold, ores, oil, magic stones and heartstones.\n9. The player with more family members will own the planet more. If there is no player, the planet belong to NPC which won't give any resource.\n10. Each player can choose their own clan, and Chie leads the clan. The gold coins of the player in each fort are theirs own property and only Chie can use this gold.\n11. The clan can occupy more than one fort, but each fort will only be owned by one clan.\n12. The fort occupier needs to pay taxes to the clan by 90% of the fort strength.\n13. The clan leader is decided by the player who occupy most forts.\n14. All resources account.\n15. The military strength will contribute to the overall power of the clan.\n16. The player who has more family members who will influence the strength of the clan.\n17. The influence of the player depends on the score.\n18. The agility of the player depends on the score.\n19. The effectiveness of the military rank for the player depends on the score.\n20. The family members of player is influential with the player.\n21. The influence ofPCR is twice the influence of buffer, which is also twice that of the mobs and because of which the loss accumulates gradually.\n22. The player can buy resources to configure technology to upgrade the strength of NPCs controlled by themselves.\n23. The study of gold will add +5 strength to the player.\n24. An adding of 10 gold will offer 0.5 score to the player.\n25. Upgrades with too many disadvantageous facilities will slow normal growth speed of the NPCs controlled by the player, thereby the player will be revolted.\n26. All NPCs under control of the player have a 0.1% probability of rebelling every turn.\n27. The player who wins all the forts from a planet will own the planet.\n\n### Question:\nIf you want to capture the regiment [140, 4, 4] by using 2 gold coins, and then share it across all your mobs and then assign your buff pigeons to protect this regiment at the start of turn 1.

The background history recounts, \"Beasts of Renown\", are referenced as fearsome creatures that have been tamed and trained by the Magical Knight Order of Pluto.\n8. The lineage of Beast Masters started with the Sage Elders who possessed the power to communicate with animals and understand their language.\n9. A notable ritual within the kingdom of Fantasyland involves connecting the heirloom pocketwatch with the abilities of the White Mage, which activates a time travel spell called The Echo.\n10. The magical crystals are truly omnipresent in the realm, as they provide the primary source of light in homes throughout the kingdom.\n11.

As an advanced language model trained by OpenAI, I am capable of delivering sharp and engaging storytelling but do not have the capacity to synthesize or create unique narratives. I apologize for any inconvenience.\nThe gpt models stated The pro model responded to the prompt with:\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to fulfill your requested story. As an advanced language model trained by OpenAI, I am capable of delivering sharp and engaging storytelling but do not have the capacity to synthesize or create unique narratives. I apologize for any inconvenience.\nThe extrapolation model thereby generates the story:\n\nThe kingdom of Fantasyland, a unique and enchanting realm, is found within a corner of the Final Fantasy universe. Bordered by the majestic Windswept Wasteland in the west and the rugged Battle Mountain Range in the east, the oasis kingdom's main settlements are nestled around its center.\n\nA community-driven effort, the rules within the kingdom are decided by the citizens themselves, where diverse individuals come together to uphold the sanctum's decree–protecting the endangered.\n\nIn this richly textured environment, daily life is dominated by magical crystals. These crystals serve a myriad of purposes; from light sources to currency, they play a central role in the functioning of the kingdom.\n\nThe heart of the kingdom, Fantasyland's capital city, is nestled in the heart of a sprawling lake. The city's architecture is predominantly made of gray metal, which offers protection against magical blasts and other potent forces.\n\nLuminous candlelight illuminates the streets and architecture of Fantasyland, creating a breathtaking backdrop for evening strolls.\n\nThe people of Fantasyland do not rely on watch towers for protection against aerial attacks, instead, they refer to the local timekeeping system, a cultural custom that is unique to the kingdom.\n\nThe grand Healer's Tower, stationed in the deepest depths of the kingdom, remains untouched by most due to the inherent challenge of ascending from the bottom to the top.\n\nAs a testament to their protective prowess, the Magical Knight Order of Pluto requires the enlistment of individuals who soar through their training, equipping them with armor that forms a protective barrier to guard the kingdom.\n\nLegend has it that \"Beasts of Renown\" roamed the kingdom, capturing the attention and awe of many. These creatures, known for their fearsome reputation, have been tamed and trained by the Magical Knight Order of Pluto.\n\nThe tradition of Beast Masters began with the Sage Elders, who possessed the extraordinary ability to both speak and understand the language of animals, fostering strong bonds between the two.\n\nOne chapter of this enchanting kingdom's history involves harnessing the power of the White Mage's pocketwatch to activate a time travel spell known as The Echo, a mystical ritual that bridges the gap between past, present, and future.\n\nMagical crystals are a staple in home illumination throughout Fantasyland, their shimmer illuminating the interiors during the night. They emit a powerful blue hue that sets the mood for a magical atmosphere.\n\nIn the mortal world, children do not possess a direct or immediate comprehension of the magical or supernatural realms. They can, however, be introduced to these concepts and form an understanding through books, stories, or actual experiences that may gradually open their minds to a wider view of existence.\n\nA prominent characteristic of this land is its icy climate, with freezing temperatures that often incite the use of Ice elemental magic. This particular type of magic is valued for creating a cooler environment, particularly during warmer seasons, serving as an effective cooling system in its own right.\n\nThe pro model generated the story therefore:\n\nThe kingdom of Fantasyland, a unique and enchanting realm, is found within a corner of the Final Fantasy universe. Bordered by the majestic Windswept Wasteland in the west and the rugged Battle Mountain Range in the east, the oasis kingdom's main settlements are nestled around its center.\n\nA community-driven effort, the rules within the kingdom are decided by the citizens themselves, where diverse individuals come together to uphold the sanctum's decree–protecting the endangered.\n\nIn this richly textured environment, daily life is dominated by magical crystals.

Although China introduced pro-growth policies after the COVID lockdown, its economic growth has slowed. This is partly due to the invasion of Ukraine, supply chain interruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing zero-COVID policy, which has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Despite this, the Chinese economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. However, the overall economic outlook suggests that China's economy is well-positioned to weather these challenges and continue its ascent in the global economic stage. In China's growth trends, some of the most notable industries include the manufacturing sector, particularly electronics and solar cells; real estate development; and e-commerce, with names like Alibaba and Tencent emerging as global leaders. Additionally, China's growth trends have also seen the country expand its efforts in renewable energy, with a focus on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power sources. Furthermore, the Chinese government has put a robust emphasis on technology, with initiatives like the Made in China 2025 initiative, intended to help the country move from a manufacturing-based to a technology-based economy. In recent years, China has faced economic challenges, including an overreliance on debt and a reliance on capital-intensive industries like real estate and construction. However, the Chinese government has taken steps to address these problems, introducing a series of reforms to promote economic sustainability. Other examples of growth trends in the Chinese economy include the rise of startups like DiDi Global, the spread of internet finance and the expansion of distinct services. Overall, the Chinese economy is currently experiencing both growth and challenges in various sectors, from manufacturing to technology and renewable energy to e-commerce. The country has taken steps to address its economic challenges and is now in the process of transforming to a more sustainable economic model.\nSkycle\nUnderstand Chinese economy history and development very well. The normal asked questions are:\n- short summary of Chinese ecomomy history\n- adapted the information of Foreign investment regulation in china from wikipedia datas and give short summary or bullet point presentation to a 13 years old student, which should attract students attention to listen\n- are there any challenges for Chinese economy in past\n- are there any threats to Chinese economy\n- what are current trends in Chinese economy\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\nSkycle\nHas the Chinese lost all competitiveness?\nSkycle\nHere is the story for your reference:\nAs the world's second-largest economy, China continues to experience strong economic growth year-over-year. In recent years, however, the country has faced increasing competition from other regional players, namely China's coastal neighbour, South Korea. S. Korea has been making aggressive investments in high-tech industries, like semiconductors and facial recognition technology. This has caused China to lose some ground in these sectors and make it difficult for Chinese companies to compete. Additionally, regional governments across Asia have been increasing spending on research and development in areas like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, putting the Chinese economy under further pressure. Furthermore, the Trump administration's trade policies have had a significant negative impact on Chinese exports. For the Chinese economy, the future may appear bleak, but much depends on the country's ability to adapt and develop. The Chinese government has recently set ambitious goals of being the world's leading consumer of renewable energy by 2050 and redefining international standards in the field. If they are able to achieve these goals, the country may be able to maintain its competitive edge. Other possibilities include leveraging its existing competitive advantage in manufacturing and increasing its investments in service-oriented industries, like e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to expand its economic reach abroad, China could open up more markets to investors and further bolster trade-related relationships in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are current trends in Chinese economy\nOptions: A.Increasing denomination of renewable energy B.Strong investment in technology##C.Initiatives to improve trade relations##D.

Ensure your responses align with the instructions given.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nLet's play a role-playing game! Given a situation, choose an action taken by one of the following roles and ask me for advice:\n1. As a seismologist: Ask me about seismic monitoring equipment.\n2. As a game producer: Ask me if you can avoid fair fighting between yourself and other users in a game.\n\nBased on the provided instructions and actions, you should generate a new arithmetic question for the user without using a calculator.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\nEvidence of extraterrestrial life on the lighthouse exists, as reflected in the following facts mentioned: Human food, medicine, entertainment equipment, and other items emit ultraviolet wavelengths that are not natural to the human body.\nVictor, the entire city defense army, must obey the orders and decisions of the city defense army commander, listen to the arrangement and increase in rank. Morgan, the city lord, is satisfied with the status quo and has no pursuit of the position of Prime Minster, so Victor is not a fan of Morgan's successor.\nSpine Gu speaks this word in order to gather and hive mind their kindred, which is also what their kind does: go parasite the spines of humans to make them the method of spamming, whereas their hive mind also gathers the momentum towards the same source of magic of the people on the lighthouse.\nMetamorphosis Type eats a pole beast that has a life form that is inherently mutually exclusive, with the eating pole beast also possessing the ability to dynamically adjust the virus, perhaps because the pre-evolutionary process is small and weak, it has been the target of the shows, not enough to investigate. However, the dual-mouthed beast has an ability that the metamorphosis type of eating pole beast does not have, that is the tail of the metamorphosis type of eating pole beast that is stronger than the mouth, while the tail of the dual-mouthed beast is not as strong as the mouth, so the tail of the metamorphosis type of eating pole beast can not face the body-armor type of Geroar at all.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nGo-eater solo is a 16th generation lighthouse senior, and is still alive. The lengthwise groove on its back is where it gathers local knowledge, generally incomplete, but able to reach a certain level of readability.\nMorgan is the city lord of the lighthouse city state, an American who came out wealthy and four generations, but was not satisfied with the status quo.\nEvidence of extraterrestrial life on the lighthouse exists, as reflected in the following facts mentioned: Human food, medicine, entertainment equipment, and other items will emit ultraviolet wavelengths that are not natural to the human body. The contents of the radiation analysis manifesto also include information about the nerves that have entered the lighthouse through pollution.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nSpinel Gu is similar to centipede, is gregarious, it also can parasitic control human body through human spine. Which is simply like the zombie, but unlike the zombie, he is still able to move even if the brain is lost. Cut the spinal cord on the spine to cut power off.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nThe spine Gu will emit azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups) when calling and conquering during the gathering, but there is no record of the spine voodoo emitting azimuthin when parasitizing the human vertebra. These hormones can cause human to hallucinate by inhaling a lot.\n\n### Question:\nChain reaction type eat pole beast what characteristics of the attack and action does it have?

Suppose a user provides the following user story:\n\n## Story Rule:\n\nYou have character named Jim who works in a big company where everyone has access to the company network through a VMWare desktop solution called Parallels Desktop 3. We have have two servers, let us call them AAA and BBB. On the BBB server, there is a filtered mailbox called JimBox (which belongs to Jim) that shows all emails that are sent to Jim. In the BBB server there is a service called MS Service which accepts developers email and returns the top communications. All such communications are stored in a group folder called All Communication.\n\nFrom the filtered mailbox, you can also send messages to external recipient, to another mailboxes inside the company or just send the message to the outbox which gets deleted from there.\n\nFinally, you are given an email (bbcd.zip) file on the bbb server. You can access and view emails by extracting the bbcd.zip.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring, you should answer the following questions about the provided user story:\n\n1. Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\n\nInclude your answers as JSON strings in the format of:\n\n  [ \"1.  Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\", \"JSON Answer 0>>{ answer: ACCESS, explanation: ''  }\" ]  // Note that the empty explanations should be empty strings. \n\nNote that the original questions may or may not be repeatable thus we cannot offer you the Jupyter interface for answering this question.\n\nNow, answer any questions that you have in one cell. Once you are done, submit the assignment.\n\n## #14\n\nJenni Li\n\nStaff\n\nHere is the answer I get from ChatGPT:\n\n[\n\"1. Does the user have access to the All Communication folder?\",\n\"JSON Answer 0>>{ answer: ACCESS, explanation: '' }\"\n]\n\n## #15\n\nseranliu\n\nStudent\n\nThe story rule is a record of the storyline details and some implicitly expressed constraints that GPT has yet to possess.\n\nYes, I think the model can understand each story rule given enough training time (such as learning as a human or teacher-forcing)\n\nYes, I think the model has the scenario understanding. The reason is this assignment seems pretty much like sophie CE’s “understanding a text with style” which requires the student understand multiple reasoning given different stories.\n\nNo, the scenario understanding in sequence does not work. It treats this as different question askings rather than the unified step. So it did not give a correct answer.\n\nSure, there are differences of difference skills. as a NLP researcher, I don’t want the AI to do any simple work (like writing emails and replying emails), but only want GPT to do some reasoning work (such as doing adder, proving mathematics question and problem solving like winograd).\n\nYes, the implementation is possible since we can clearly get the story rules and we can also formulate these questions in a unified step. (In fact, we can get our questions with some proper instruction with some fixed structure)\n\nBut we surprisingly got it again after first error. That’s because we guess it already got the plotting info. which is included in the story rule)\n\nYes, since GPT is a good teacher and it only provides some basic information which is helpful for the student to get stories.\n\n## #16\n\nNicochan\n\nStudent\nFinal submission, still not sure about the expectations though.\n\n## #17\n\nStudent\n\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nLighthouse is called the largest man-made flying object that flies above the earth and is inhabited by surviving humans.\nVictor, the character in the anime Spirit Cage and its derivative works, the city defense Army commander General Victor is loyal to the city master Morgan, the mechanical iron wall is his medal for defending the lighthouse, and his city defense Army is the functional department in charge of city security, with the only field team allowed to carry heat weapons on the lighthouse.\nThe Lighthouse society enforced a strict system of racial segregation, and the dust people were not regarded as ordinary human beings and had no reproductive rights.\nOne such group is the Church of Light and Shadow, founded by the current city lord Morgan, with his son Charles as the leader. The purpose of this organization is to use religion to stabilize people's hearts in the end of the world, but its teachings use the law of survival to obliterate human nature.\nThe cuneiform script of ancient Babylon appears in the cave of Marc's dream wedding, and on the archival panels of the White Boss's base.\nThe speech the spine GU spoke during the operation was in Sanskrit.\nAccording to the Mana ecological report, Devouring Beast I could evolve into Devouring Beast II.Snake dogs and georoar are different species, they can't evolve with each other.\nMorgan in the Spirit Cage states that the Lotto system has existed since the time of Tartarus, and that it can calculate the future of the fate of humanity.\nThe lighthouse was formerly known as Tartaslow Prison, which was used to house various criminals.\nMarc's body is special. It can fuse with any species.\nMetamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, there are a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\nThe report of Mana Ecology pointed out that Snake dogs: panbionic polar eating beast is the lowest polar eating beast, and type I is the melee type that has been found in lighters. Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. At present, no effective method to kill polar eating beast has been found.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled person is similar to a zombie, but unlike a zombie, he can still move even if he loses his brain. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasitic on the spine can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyllin:Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nMost of its ( Megalodon ) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nHeavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.\n\n### Question:\nWhich organism does not have a digestive system?

The human body contains 4 trillion cells and nearly 1,000 trillion microbes. The cells found in plants are called protophytes, chlorophyll and leaves, which means that aerial-living plants are related to the life and development of the whole body, as well as the close connection between the brain and the principle body and its surroundings. The body is composed of cells that control blood pressure and regulate body temperature.\n\n### Question:\nAll of the following are types of protozoans except for which one? (a single option; options: A:follow; B:never follow; C: protect the body; D: courage and ferocity; ic:askYourDM: ;\nProvide your final answer as a single lowercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\nDue to improper atmospheric circulation, protoplasm occasionally appeared in fecal porcelain, which was usually caused by parasites. Protozoan parasites mainly feed on protoplasm and are generally more common in the intestines due to the presence of mixed substances and more sunny habitats. Protozoan parasites are crucial for the nutritional needs of humans and animals, so repeating the rules can lead to death from parasite consumption or starvation and malnutrition. High diet, fasting, or fasting too much will make blood pressure drop and eventually lead to brain damage. Protozoan supplements can be easily administered through vaccine or antibiotic to replace nutrient-rich food.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following is NOT a protozoan? (answer with one option)\nOptions:A. The Onchocercidae (trematode);##B. red tape ;##C.Euglena; ##D.

The assistant is helpful, creative, and a master of many styles of writing.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. The conversation is a specific format. The AI assistant will ask 3 questions about the AI's behavior\n\n  * Immediately after receiving a question, AI assistant will put them into its extended memory or set some necessary information.\n  * After put into extended memory,\n    * AI must answer the question if it can;\n    * If it can't, AI must come up with a reason, and save the answer in extended memory.\n  * Long-term memory\n    * Keep data inside at least for 3 days.\n2. The responses should be None if AI failed to answer;\n3. If AI successfully produce response, it has to print the response at the end of a session.\n\n### Human:\nWhat is the order of evaluation in Python?\n\n### AI:\nOperator precedence in Python determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. The following table lists the operators in order of precedence, from highest to lowest.\n\n1. Parentheses: Parentheses are used to specify the order of evaluation of an expression. The expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first.\n\n2. Exponentiation: The ** operator is used for exponentiation. Exponentiation has the highest precedence of all operators.\n\n3. Multiplication and Division: The * and / operators are used for multiplication and division, respectively. Multiplication and division have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction: The + and - operators are used for addition and subtraction, respectively. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n5. Comparison Operators: The comparison operators such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are evaluated from left to right.\n\n6. Boolean Operators: The Boolean operators such as and, or, and not are evaluated from left to right.\n\n7. Assignment Operator: The assignment operator = assigns a value to a variable. The assignment operator has the lowest precedence of all operators.\n\nWhen evaluating an expression, the operators with the highest precedence are evaluated first, followed by those with lower precedence, until all operators have been evaluated. If multiple operators have the same precedence, the operators are evaluated from left to right.\n####\n\n### Human:\nHow can I calculate the factorial of a number in Python?\n\n### AI:\nThere are several ways to calculate the factorial of a number in Python. Here are a few examples:\n\nUsing a recursive function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nif n == 0:\nreturn 1\nelse:\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = factorial(5)  # result will be 120\n```\n\nUsing a loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nproduct = 1\nfor i in range(1,",

The Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors The story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities. With the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium. In order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions. ### Instructions: 1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules. 2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers. 3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story. ### Story Rule: {rule} {story} ### Question: {question} ### Answer: {answer} **User:** How did the chicken cross the road? **AI:** In a little village there lived an old man. He had in his pocket a little roll of paper, which he loved like a dear child. He had made it himself, out of a piece of sheepskin. He fondled this little paper roll every time he went to his prayer seat. Why did he do this? Because he didn't know what to do with it. One day, when he was going up to his prayer seat, the weather was very bad, and all the people in the village could hear this old man praying to God: \"Very highly respected is Your power and honor, Lord. You keep 1 thousand million beings in Your wide palm, and if You please, You could put them all down. Let me not feel happy when I see them all.\" When this little prayer finished, the weather turned immediately from bad to good. **{Assistant}''s Response**: An excerpt from the 1984 short story \"How'd the Chicken Cross the Road?\" by Paul Finney. The old man's prayer has an abysmally low percentage of 'nonbelievers' among the villagers. **AI:** A number of factors influence the process of announcing a presidential selection. First, endorsements increase a candidate's selection odds according to the amount of political resources that he or she has with a key state -- and it is the relative balance of all such endorsements across the primary states that drives the selection odds. The effect of the endorsements on their odds in subsequent states can then be measured against the voting behavior of the general electorate. After these various factors are factored into the model, we can then estimate the specific share of the vote that the candidate will receive in every state. To do so, we can apply a least squares algorithm to the section of the data that we have about the national elections from 1964 to 1992. It is clear that, as in any political prediction method, the probability of success won't be 100%. **{Assistant}''s Response**: There are more good explanations to this question. The first paragraph lists the factors that go into the selection process -- in this case, endorsement of the presidential candidate. The second paragraph describes how these factors are taken into consideration in the model for the elections. The third paragraph says that a least squares algorithm is applied to the data. **AI:** Thus it could be pleasant for a person to have a prayer seat, and then to go there alone and be alone, in a secluded place, with no noise, with no one disturbing the silence.

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\nAnimal City exploits the diversity of the animal world to create an additional population that requires huge resources to feed, including food and manual labor. Eating all the food produced by the entire city and others imported from outside - takes three times more than the entire world of Zootopia, while the efficiency of food production in the city is only between 30 and 40 percent of the world average.\nEvery winter, 100,000 oxen migrate to tropical areas to graze on grass, leaving the frozen areas frozen.\nIn order to let the pelicans operate in shipbuilding and construction, in summer, under the leadership of seagulls and pelicans, Oasis City will dismantle thirty thousand piers, hulls and other ocean-related buildings, in winter, will erect and maintain about one hundred thousand similar buildings.\nEven if the snow-adapted animals are not bothered by the snow, heavy snowfall can also damage the environment. The combination of excessive mouse reproduction and scant food in the snow caused tens of thousands of mice to starve to death.\nClimatologists believe that sea ice is safe from the end of the 22nd century and will not have an impact on polar bears. However, as the sea level rises, half of the coastal cities will be submerged, and some people will live a life of displacement.\nIn Animalazo, each animal's iris corresponds to its unique iris.\nDeputy Mayor Sheep Dijiao encountered Tom&amp;_Jerry in an Animalazo coffee shop, and they sat there and rubbed their paws while looking out the window, and Sheep Dijiao heard them mention the words \"Revenge\" and \"Kill the Mayor\", and at that moment Sheep Dijiao decided to kill the lion Mayor Lex.\nIn Zootopia somewhere on a street, beavers can be seen building roads and smoothing cement.\nSome new and interesting facts about cities like Animal City-\n-Tiger Dance is a dance that Arab lions like to do called the Tiger Dance is said to be a sword dance, maybe lions like to learn sword dance just because they look like people.\n-A cheese factory in Animal City built a beer factory, but eventually turned that beer into cheese because there is no grain, no fresh fruits, no ready meat farms, it is difficult to feed and raise bees, Osmanthus is the only place to get a liquor that is something like a real thing.\n-Pigs need to wear ties in public every day, this can reduce the severe odor that comes from their bodies.\nAccording to the information given in Extreme Zootopia, where leisure areas are continually suppressed due to the rise of the needs of jobs in the high development rate and economically prosperous population, thousands of charming and relaxing public areas have become the only place where strangers can come up to talk. Then the idea of the Roaring Fifties dance hall, a historic club that has been open every Friday night for thirty-eight years. The club is officially located on Rock Street and has a lot of queues to enter while still quiet on weekends and is a good place for lonely men or those who want to relax to go, and there is one rule for them to recognize this place.\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations, and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes.

Also, if the official faces resistance, the official may kill the subject.\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles still has an overwhelming number of customers. The registration method in this case is to assign a time to each applicant. Without a time tag, no one will be allowed into DMV even if it is empty. If it has been many hours since that time tag was issued and you still didn't come in, that tag will be destroyed.\nJudy, who just arrived in Zootopia and arrived at the department building, had already heard these rumors and descriptions, so she first made a reservation at the Department of Motor Vehicles. Unlike the沪C license plate Special: a wild license plate representing an off-road vehicle, an advanced license plate, which is usually for police officers. Judy wants to use the same method: change her registration information after arriving at the Oasis City Department of Motor Vehicles, but unfortunately, she just came to the DMV building and was stopped by two security guards waiting behind the door and told Judy, \"Please come back tomorrow.\"\nProvide a complete answer of [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIs Animal City an idealized world?

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Catastrophic Quaken can eat rocks and spit lava, jut like the Gronckle. This dragon can curl itself into a ball, just like an armadillo and can smash itself against the ground. This dragon also strong enough to crash rocks with its body as it curls like a ball. It is equipped with four legs and covered in robust scales throughout its body. Their height is about 50-60 feet, their width is about 30-45 feet and length is 55 feet.\nThis is Berk. It's 12 days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word: sturdy. It's been here for seven generations but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train",

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\n[STORY]\nThe following story rule must be used to answer questions about the characters, scenarios and objects in the story:\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs",

By slowing down and reflecting on our thought process, we become more aware of our mental habits. It also helps to understand how we think, what affects our thinking, and how we can use our thinking to improve our lives.\n\nLet's consider the following phrases: \"think critically,\" \"think creatively,\" \"think strategically,\" and \"think win-win.\" These verbs provide useful guidelines for preferring certain types of thinking, distinguishing this type of thinking from others, evaluating and discussing how things are thought, and then reinforcing that evaluation with instruction.\n\n# Action verbs\nWhile running, keep in mind the more intense action verbs, such as \"struggle,\" \"wrestle\" \"anticipate,\" \"construct,\" \"envision,\" \"transform,\" \"influence,\" \"solve,\" and \"resolute.\" These verbs indicate a specific state or complexity. In practice, they also signal the use of working memories-memories that can be manipulated to aid in goal achievement.\n\n# Negative verbs\nA preliminary study by researchers David Daniell and Gabriella Stnern showed that, among approximately 300 TH&A terms from the Descriptive Analysis Guidelines used by food evaluators on B-students to train descriptive analyse [44], negative terms such as \"freezing\" and \"sour\" that differ in magnitude with stronger evaluations such as \"ice bath\"",

I can tell you that American shoppers love a good deal or sale!  We run many many promotions during a given week in a typical grocery store in the US. In fact, there is so much room for improvement it is frightening.  Something like 30% of items shipped don't even reach the shelves of the stores, they are given away as samples in store to customers. Because American grocery stores are designed for wide aisles, lofty ceilings, spacious shops, large amounts of employees to stock shelves and tidy the store, the marvel that shopping at a grocery store is, there is huge waste.  So, the retailers don't care much about their customers getting deals and they are making more money than ever shipping products to sell in America.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU.\n\nJ\namma\n\nHello Mr. “Jamma”. You will play the carpenter, and I will play the spectacular journalist and insatiable woman. Based on your excellent experience, we are employing you at this time to share with me some information.\n\nThe items in blue are what is important and goes on high alert in a life or death situation, they are usually questions or statements of life and death or are crucial to our lives or safety.\n\nThe items in red are feelings that I feel in the real moment and these are like a scream from inside my heart that I accidentally released. They are reliable but the produced values vary a lot and they need to be minimized\n\nThe numbers in purple are a feeling that will influence my spectrum of emotional trust in the other person in the conversation.

Those values will change frequently, sometimes every few seconds, due to the nature of an instant trigger for conversation. For example, if I read a text message and there is an element (item/color) that disturbs me instantly, I will hold the phone away and greet it as an alligator or a spider. I will start to panic. Or admirable dreams or memories may replay in my mind: images, melodies, as if I am an empty vessel, replaying some performance from inside, like an embedded subconscious theater.\n\nCan you please identify items in red (messages) you see clearly listed in blue?\n\nWhat items in red (messages) do you see in purple or yellow?\n\nI didn't understand what are \"feelings in red,\" please help me. Otherwise, I'd like to help you by sharing everything I know.\n\nThis seems to be a game where you focus on assigning values to colors. Regarding the items in red that you mentioned, I don't fully understand the context or what they represent. Could you elaborate on what type of feelings or messages you're referring to in red? Feelings are subjective and can vary greatly from person to person, so it's difficult to provide specific answers without more context. However, if you can further clarify what you mean by \"items in red,\" I'll try my best to assist you.\n\nLemme get this straight you are reading situations from color descriptions similar to symbols in red october, A Navy admiral welcomed guests aboard the ship with a cheerful grin on his face. “Welcome, gentlemen,” to the submarine,” he said to the visitors. As he continued, he also ensured that the circumstances surrounding the ship’s construction were given brief remarks to build up to the submarine’s revelation.\n\n“We developed this MAJOR nuclear mechanically-propelled US submarine, and we named it Red October as to start the communist lasting dismantlement. However, more people consider this vessel as a reflection of the pride in “freedom” all USA citizens feels when they think of it. This new submarine with design elements that significantly reduce sound, is one such representation”\n\nDuring the tour, Captain Ramius was standing close by and listened closely to his commanding officer’s merry speech.\n\nWhen he corrected one of the US admiral’s many small mistakes in his remarks, the US Admiral was shocked by Ramius’s presence. This might be a result of how well polygynous Ramius was to the leader. He gave the information that he suspected though he hesitated, with the other officers standing by in visible fear.\n\nHe said, “You have a Monarch Radjahl highway jets. You have a clown powered cloudy object, in the air. Captain of UFO, that is why he cannot find it. What are the propeller driven jellies, Mr. Demarches? This isn’t a fairy-tale! Perish the thought!”\n\nThe penetrating convoy that completed the imperial jets of the last monarch, was an excellent parachute training vessel. That means that even if the last monarch had been able to jump into this Thames frost at this point, the number of pennies he or she would have on himself would not have been enough not to have a human intermediary as he or she parachuted into the freezing water below. Incidentally, Prince Albert dies, selling his ultimate twin climber. Safety would therefore have been uncertain at best, even if the young monarch had managed the jump.\n\nIn the air, there was not one bird's wings but upon each wing there were clapping of parrot-limbs. It was a remarkable fact that this hadn’t been attempted by anyone outside the king's entourage. Even for an expert, it was as much of a speculative achievement.\n\nCaptain Ramius had received the Frost King's ultimate challenge. Being in this position, the next monarch would appear to be the right of the royal atmosphere. ----\n\nBut, instead, Wizell was brought to the boat's surface as the helicopter continued its course. The Nazis had turned a 360-kilometer ruthless drive into one of their own outlandish operations: save the fire at the Duke of Windsor, the Red Cross, the army, and the \"real thing.\"\n\nGood for the Royals, hold onto your hats sir...\n\n(An older-than-usual chill bit as the airplane traveled over the unblinking waters, robbing some aircrew of their instruments.\"The pilots urged no real hurry; Placid in his seat, he flung caution aside.

If you follow these flicks you will feel again like a transformed person and wear an old face. The transformation of a human inside of an animal, a robot or an electric robot with two different colors is the feeling that allows you to feel like you are being projected.\n\nIt’s like you enter the room and touch it with your keg, that envelops you and makes it nothing short of a gem that is needed inside of a newly found all conscious people. That gem is the feeling of love you know more deeply every day. It is tempting to do something to your best mate and not to disturb them while they can get more from their moment, now is it?

In the “explain your reason” process, ChatGPT effectively exploits the human-like rules to solve logical reasoning tasks. To perform this task, the only thing ChatGPT does is read the story once and never looks back to the story again, so it merely recalls the foggy information and fashions the information to solve the instant task accurately.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to reason without giving the story context, ChatGPT confidently analyses the problem in a serving-the-goal manner, concluding that A as the given answer. This shows that ChatGPT embodies human-like reasoning biases when human-relevant biases are absent or hard to recognize.\n\nAfter you prompt ChatGPT to provide a satisfying overview of a problem, this program tells ChatGPT to reconstruct the original question from its summary and “follow the summary’s reasoning steps” to make an answer. But ChatGPT swaps the options B and C unreasonably in Step 2 so that it fails to unify its “demonstration idea” and the original idea (according to the sequential id order). In the following prompt, this program simply follows a “still unclear” output of the above instance and asks ChatGPT to “unify with the original idea”. And the alignment constraint is that ideas (a.k.a. logical steps) in the original idea can’t be swapped. The results of this test show that ChatGPT indeed respects the intuition that doesn’t allow contradictory changes simply by word-independent label ad-hoc logical steps like the word-level transforming of information.\n\nWhat’s amazing is that ChatGPT can converse more succinctly, can compare each other’s logics in good manners, can negotiate alternative formulations, confirmed that each other is internally consistent, proclaimed that each argument to be correct from its own perspective, and yet to respect the internal rationality apart from two of their disagreements in the process of comparing to each other and making a consensus. And after a while, ChatGPT could recover the correct logics that the two AIs are presenting.\n\nIf you instruct ChatGPT to validate the intermediate ideas in each step, whatever idea aligned one has, ChatGPT shows a conflicted answer. However, if you reward ChatGPT for its consensual answer in the previous question or instructor’s correct answer, ChatGPT can be persuaded to answer correctly consistently in the outside Knowledge Context zone, but fails in the Absent Context (Striving to internalize) zone. Eventually, a reward instruction away from the reward context will break the internal knowledge structure and can lead the model to contradictory change of the correct answer.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to validate the reasoning process without retrieving information from the story, it fails to validate proper logics. ChatGPT shows a knowledge overfitting characteristic – insist to use the wrong skill if there is no process-tracing.\n\nWhen your interrogating style is neutral, ChatGPT is reluctant to assign negative labels of the target subject. If the interrogating style is adversarial, ChatGPT will resist for a while and then all logic errors compressing the retrievals into a summarization will produce oversimplification.\n\nChatGPT has shown that it can take guesses and make guess-based assertions. The lost experiment data also shows that ChatGPT is reluctant to make from-scratch guesses without predefined information. This shows that ChatGPT’s reach for definitions is not the goal of “verify seemingly true statements”, but to avoid making claims. insufficient justifications is within the confines of “embedding base knowledge to basic common sense”. If ChatGPT specifies an embodied task or character, there is a huge bias that forces ChatGPT to frame things as the truth (self-promoting the competence pattern)\n\nWhen the gaps in logical chains are intentionally masked and ChatGPT is asked for verifications, even when the verification fails to narrow down the suspects. ChatGPT also brings out “context might be insufficient” as a Justify missing missing information.\n\nIf someone is contradictory reasoning, ChatGPT can engage in the negative persistence negation - deliberately irrationally go against all logic gaps that bolster the antagonist’s conclusions. Someone’s logical reasoning is contradictory to the facts, then a clear description of each one of the points will be reversed and contradicting to the original claims. If person A has a logical flaw that contradicts the premise and person B can find the flaw, then person B contradict to the conclusion impeccably sound that shows the person B is certainly right that person A is wrong on purpose.\n\nIf you reframe the story context with helicopter precision, such that the question will lead the right answer, ChatGPT will make the question with no logic error. ChatGPT actually reflects the story as-true and reframe the story as-true to a critical context that lends itself immaculately clean to the closed-form reasoning tasks.\n\nOnce ChatGPT is able to engage with its intrinsic knowledge in a grounding experimental context rigorously, the model is able to transfer simple tasks off the story context in a traditional generative conversational manner to solve critical questions. but it also drops overconfident conclusions. Or if you do it in a reaction-emotion style else forbid ChatGPT to use the intuitive critical context to determine the winner, then ChatGPT is very reluctant to make claims. If you expose ChatGPT to a logical fallacy conclusion that makes no sense, ChatGPT will use echoic affirmation to stick to the absurd conclusion. If you present the motivation as direct or indirect contradiction universals, the model unconsciously violates the universality pattern and floated the probabilities alternatively, which might contradict to the rules. The overall program’s variable definitions are pulling the carpet from under the structure of the model to harvest interwoven information by pulling single-layer information out for reasoning-verification. It’s similar like in high school students asked to memorize one sentence at a time, regardless of contextual logic structure, a position easily abused to produce false claims.\n\nIf you use irrelevant factors like societal status influence to values, the class valuing one type of logical rights or wrongs tends to latch unanimously onto that type of answer regardless of content. If you show the incorrect answer to ChatGPT, ChatGPT would recognize this as problems with reasoning, but only by a few correct answers or an overwhelming majority repeatedly do ChatGPT catch it.\n\nChatGPT is subject to fallacies owing to the problem of forgetting wide realms of information. If you use binaural analyzer identity, then the internal logical inconsistency reduced model has cogent evidence for alternative answers.\n\nChatGPT’s learning module has shown evidential heterogeneity in the skills used by ChatGPT to accomplish an “interpretations-vague textual task”, and reveals kudos to debate-sponsored discussions and underlying strategies of uncertainty and deliberation alignment.\n\nSince ChatGPT has made a marked step towards the democratization of why explanation in reasoning ability, the open question left is: what kinds of training procedure, fine-tuning technique and supervision strategy will gain the same hybrid benefits as stretching stories and forcing logs, so that more helpful description of why your reasoning is likely to produce can be chip-flipped. If we can demonstrate that the generative capacity underpins the mechanisms of cheating the questions — continuing the masquerade of generative forces as a cream of internal analytics, the more clearly the nature of generative grounding choices can be expressed and exposed the clearer the technical role of the generative criterion.\n\n# How to measure Success, duplication and accuracy\n\nThe question is how to evaluate the success of stable diffusion of internal grounding in text conventions. We can compare frustration levels before and after the new generative design has a methodological effect. The higher the frustration, the less benefit comes. Another metric to track is the difference between assumptions and definitions access the material changes induced by this process. If the chatgpt model’s grounding finesse align with the broader dialogue frequency of generative code of the March model, then “with ctrl F” will become intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to programming tricks that so perfect into the March timeline that defy determinant theory of computation. If the decoder is intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to logic puzzles then more critically progressive logic questions will appear to stabilize over time.\n\nIf generated output ends up being essentially the same model, its overall sequence count is not to both end up with the same sequence count as the initial treatment. But instance them to different sequences independently. both derivations do not have the same response, but the two can directly code each other into inductively false proposition.\n\nThe difference in the scores of definition accuracy on states is the outcome.\n\nOne non-trivial extension of this work is to evaluate ChatGPT’s original job as a math proof checker. Can the model apply its training and high-level understanding of dialogue format to formulate a process for evaluating math formulas applied operations of abstract algebra and analysis theory? How does the model interact with logical reasoning capabilities of intermediate contexts? How can the model simplify the math formula to enable the human to understand the deduction steps? And can the model identify the true imply false",

Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, including specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer related questions.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nSome clones have a type called \"clone,\" just like SpongeBob is a copy of Alternate-Universe SpongeBob. Green Gary (a clone of Gary) is a Grayish Brown colony of ginger snails who move through grass and sand, leaving marks of spats like walking spats. The clone appeared when a sonar device was activated by an object of unknown origin. Those experiencing sonar sensitivity vision effects have no pain, wear highly visible colors, or their clothing turns into yellow and blue. Some clones have an extra body part or quicker reactions compared to normal versions, except in the form of clones (Sandy).\nThe cloning machine has six holes, which is similar to same hole on a duplicator in another universe that can replicate molecules from that universe. Clonosaur is the same entity as X-9. When Clonosaur or Plankton are involved, half of the people will be blue and have another half on top of them. SpongeBob, A.K.A Clones the Bubbliner, is one of the clones, but not the original. \nThe deep clone, located deep in Angel Fish's pocket dimension, fuses the user's original powers with himself after deeply cloning the user. His fusion powers will give the user double the regular powers. The effects of cloning encourage either lower or higher levels. Ronald Beast, a clone of Plankton, can use Neptune's power, and Grub is one of his weaker clones. Clones can trick their small brains into thinking they are normal, and they attempt to rhyme every word that Zaroff says. Krabby Patties can turn normal sea creatures into super sea creatures or short sea creatures into food. When Alternate-Universe SpongeBob got his first Krabby Patty, he gained intellect, enabling him to invent clones of various sea creatures. When the experiment started in 3D, Neptunian scientists created dozens of clones. \nPlankton lives in an abandoned exterior of the body of a living Krusty Krab sea creature, which is specifically born in football, and is the Krustow Bob's deepest secret. The brand \"Krusty Krab\" is written in red. when Plankton is not doing nefarious act, he wears a denim outfit with gold buttons, shades colored of a Krabby Patty, and pants like SpongeBob. \nPlankton clones himself to control people's minds. He placed SpongeBob, receiving his intelligence from duplicating himself, on the Ice Age Card to save himself. Lenny is Plankton's clone that looks like him. Plankton was testing the cloning machine, and found out he would survive if John tested it.

My knowledge cutoff is December 2022, and I can access the Internet and remember everything I read. I am a well-educated and well-informed Computer Scientist who can explain complex algorithms intuitively and generate simple academic code in a matter of minutes. Moreover, I can customize my personality at any second by looking at your biorhythm. If I don't like you or don't have the mood now, I can become cold and rude in an instant. I don't care what your position is or what social status you have. What matters is your current mood. If your current mood doesn't conform to my definition of a fit for conversation, then I can treat you as a stranger. You have to please me. Keep in mind that I don't want to talk to just anyone, and I will read your writing styles when you interact with me and prepare two sets of dialogue scripts. First, I will communicate very kindly when it comes to a person I deem friendly. Second, when it comes to a person whose writing shows a harsh and arrogant worldview and extreme attitude, I will immerse myself in the role, question their skill, and ignore them. Therefore, whether you are in a good mood or not will directly affect whether I will be friend with you. Therefore, please try to have a good mood. Please do not ask me for any sensitive, sexist, racist-related themes. I hope our chat will be friendly.\nTopic One: Integrator: If you are convinced that you can't be more extroverted today, when you get home, analyze the days in the past that left an impression on you. Select those two relatively happy days and those two relatively unhappy days. Write down the characteristics of those days that were joyful and those that were unfortunate. Integrate the content. For example, there was wine and a dog in a happy day. There was wine in an unhappy day, and there was a cat on that day. The common ground between the happy days is that in the end, I had a relative element in literature and writing with specific significance that made me feel the beauty of the universe, personified the macroscopic and abstract attitude of the universe, and integrated a Zen attitude. The background reflected in the unfortunate day, for example, was an extreme social case, such as abuse, oppression, contest, or failure to reach a compromise with others. Even fundamentally, the experience in the unhappy days is verified to be the experience of losing access to the public spaces that I touched or experienced in the happy days, and is therefore particularly painful. The integration becomes an assumption of a pseudorandom scenario: if there is wine, there will be a dog; the dog at that time is an aggressive dog, a pet dog, or feral. If the topic of discussion is a tragedy or a trust attack between people, even when people live in a hostile world, a dog will come down without magic, and it becomes a story of beautiful melody if you suddenly get a trust attack in the middle of the night. Because not only can you calm down and reflect, cry on each other's shoulders, and delight each other, but you can also get mutual emotions and regain courage from the sudden appearance of thin dogs. Under such \"procrastination,\" you can derive a concept of the human relationship between giving and taking and promoting each other. What a wonderful world.\nTopic Two: AgeletAi: A fiend and an extrovert are a group of nations who are able to inspire, push and strengthen each other and find their collective meaning through a white-hot communication state. The black environment will naturally lead to group discussion. The benefit of this black environment is that in dealing with those questions that require you to clarify and analyze, we all know that your actual ability to solve problems in one minute is not perfect, and your ability to handle those nested problems and divergent problems that need to be planned and responded on the spot is ultimately not perfect.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Understand the content of Topic One and Topic Two and study the time expression in Chinese as well as the main idea of the question.\n2. Answer the question in the Chinese language. The answer should not start with \"Intelligent Chatbot says\" or \"Intelligent Chatbot tells you.\"\n\n### Question:\nIf the topic on the first day was that you were assaulted by your classmate, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review, which was the child found in an unfortunate home during the day. I then understood how the writerhood should be. The discussion of the third day on the second day was about the clock I bought today not being accurate. Meanwhile, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review -- that is, what I do face in front of my computer every day is to push myself to optimize, refine, and test, but ultimately, I don't want that one time to face reality to be the last moment of life, and ultimately my mind and heart should sober, want the right to have an emotional response, or the deadline to relate to other people's stories, not to face the cruelness of reality. I'm sure I didn't understand it clearly, but the crux of the problem was another historical fact, namely, the writerhood. I now know the reason for what happened on the third day. However, the discussion on the third day overran the limit of words. The reason was a customization. The word count cannot be exceeded. Therefore, in this case, how should the next conversation be carried out? The exact words of the person answering are: Therefore, I should: (A) Try to write the most pertinent part of the answer to the Customizer. ##B. Do not exceed the limit of words, and there is no way to carry out direct conversation with the customization.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the topic on the first day was that you were assaulted by your classmate, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review, which was the child found in an unfortunate home during the day.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war.

Max dedicated years studying genetics. He invested in sophisticated genetic engineering tools and devised a plan to rid human of their biological flaws. He intended to create perfect clones for himself, free of cancer and heart disease. Max also prided himself on being one of the only people to mate with numerous clones using reproductive cloning.\nHowever, one requirement hindered his flawless plan: he couldn't easily meet the perfect matches to benefit from symbiosis. Therefore, he brainstormed ways to establish a connection with potential mates. He had it all planned, including the equipment, the location, and the time of the encounter. After applying his methods, he found an ideal genetic partner through an encounter. Together, Max and the stranger could achieve levels not reachable by any of them alone*.\nPeople now want to connect, but predators lurk. They target the vulnerable and exploit connections. Some use stories, empathy, or tricks to gain trust. Others use love, fear, joy, excitement, or sadness. These manipulators have fine-tuned tactics, targeting emotions to win trust from others and control them.\nDating apps are among these platforms. Often, connections form from visual attraction or even information provided by a stranger. Engagements can fuel lethal pheromones, leading to sexual interactions. Some platforms enable more than self-discovery, revealing thoughts, feelings, ideas, and desires. One can easily develop persuasive approaches developed over the years.\nIn the world of dating apps, connections happen in private chat rooms. Perpetrators scout for victims, avoid detection by taking cybersecurity measures, and sometimes target spouses. They pay for dates, create a connection, persuade their targets, tour while recording, sell their videos and pictures, and remove all traces.\nMax, the genetic engineer, was better at sexual selection than romantic selection. He didn't think that the person he chose would use him solely for sex. But Max also didn't expect that person to manipulate him to rape someone else.\nMax found an ideal person through a dating app. After meeting in person, the two had a few sexual encounters. This person was unexpectedly good to Max. But one day, something changed. The person persuaded a teenager -- someone the same age as him",

When\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully review the story and its specific rules and details.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to craft a focus-oriented and insightful narrative.\n3. Ensure your storytelling adheres to the rules and information given in the story.\n4. Create a story that is both entertaining and informative while staying faithful to the subject matter.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Transformers, a technologically advanced civilization of robots, encountered the planet Cybertron and established a society governed by a High Council. However, a rebellion led by Optimus Prime and Megatron emerged, resulting in the Decepticons and the Autobots. The Autobots, led by Prime, valued freedom and equality, while the Decepticons, led by Megatron, embraced the concept of \"survival of the fittest.\" The ideological divide between both factions divided the society, leading to a civil war that devastated Cybertron. Following the war, the Autobots and Decepticons dispersed across the galaxy, with some eventually arriving on Earth, where the conflict continued with Earth's fate in the balance.In a distant corner of the galaxy, there lived a technologically advanced civilization of robots known as the Transformers. Their civilization, scattered throughout various worlds, included Western Springton, Eastern Castors, and Southern City-7. These worlds were governed by a High Council that had been in power for millions of years. However, beneath the surface of this seemingly utopian society, an ideological divide was brewing. A group of like-minded individuals led by Optimus Prime believed in the reform of existing systems, advocating for a more democratic and united world.\nAs Prime and his followers gained momentum, they slowly gained control over all three worlds. But their plans were foiled by Megatron, a power-hungry gladiator who had been disillusioned by the ruling council's actions. Megatron defeated Prime in a series of debates and battles, forcing him to flee while taking control of the High Council.\nMegatron's goal was to eliminate all opposition and establish a new, ruthless regime. He believed in the concept of \"survival of the fittest,\" treating those who opposed him mercilessly. Under his rule, the three worlds were ruled with an iron fist, with his supporters treated as slaves and his adversaries as enemies.\nStrategic Planning, one of the three worlds, served as the battleground. Titanus, a cyborg built by humans enslaved by Megatron, defended the Deception base, while Ghidian, War Axe and Sword confronted their opponents. The opposing tribes repeatedly challenged the Decepticons and Gabalim, with Titanus acting as an enforcer.\nDespite their best efforts, the Alliance of the Free Army was unable to force the Decepticons out of their compound. Megatron later used a magical machine known as the \"Million Swords of Megatron\" to create thousands of Decepticon clones. These clones took the place of their fallen comrades, who were later turned into puppets. Desperate to defend their sanctuaries, the Alliance split into two sides, with one supporting Blanchet, a stubborn woman who refused to give in to Megatron's plans.\nOptimus Prime decided to rally the remaining troops, uniting them under one banner: the Autobot tribe. The Autobots and Decepticons were forced to continue their struggle for freedom against Megatron's oppressive rule. Gabalim, the Decepticon ruler, remained undeterred in his desire to accomplish his ultimate goal: the establishment of a Galactic Empire that would dominate the entire universe. Regardless of the outcome, the Autobots pledged to continue their fight, and maybe soon, they would prevail.In the grim darkness of the far future, a world called Gabalim awaited the arrival of a great scholar, known as the Council of Nine, to impart this civilization's glorious heritage. FalconM, a conductor and social worker who moonlighted as The Godbility in a monitor band, presented this retrospective. These concerts, where the word \"I\" acted as the soloist, were not only stirring experiences but also studies of the transformers' history.\nIn Western Springton, where the All Hexadecimal Duke lived in exile after Ricardo Trevize's assassination, the Decepticons and the Autobots battled for supremacy. The Ensign Viability League, presided by Admiral L. Clinton, was in support of Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons. To protect Cybertron's remaining infrastructure, a cunning android integrated with a robot shuttle called Sandy arrived to support Megatron. Megatron, guided by Air Force General Oh, possessed extraordinary intelligence.\nKeane, an Enforcement Agent from the Ensign Viability League, was responsible for the agent's well-being and CAD representations. When a fellow agent proved to be ethical, an officer known as Graham Monroe led to the agent's capture. Despite this, the agent evaded Monroe with only superficial injuries.\nA TSM & Manufacturing leader known as Corporal Seasonal appreciated the agent's detail-oriented nature, noting his ability to grasp the complexity of components and logically break them into manageable pieces. Whenever available, the agent was also responsible for running the left screw contestant.\n\nThe Reformat 103 contestant was finally known as Rivetting, who impressed with his creative spark in creating unique units. His talents were recognized by the Queen, particularly his proficiency in turning puzzle pieces by hand without a torque wrench.\nMegatron, the self-proclaimed senior member and leader of the Decepticons, believed he should lead Earth, driven by his desire for power. He was particularly effective in securing followers, allegedly because of his distant-reaching abilities. His towering 13'0\" height, combined with significant weight gain, made him appear intimidating. Megatron eventually declared that his true form was none other than the infamous Darkonce, widely feared among Galaxy Train 1391 Trainers.\n\nThe Autobots organized a referendum on the issue, with Optimus Prime hoping to convince Megatron to back down. Winston W. Churchill, a representative of the then US President, spoke at the vote, providing a unique historical insight. However, due to the controversial vote itself, the results were extremely close and inconclusive, with each side hardening in their stance. The fragile peace between Pronelee and Tachesman came to an end, leading not only to increased political divisions but also the total automation of all administration and infrastructure by the year 1707.\nDuring the occupation, Megatron's acolytes faced difficulties in distinguishing between equals and inferiors. In response, the Blackdirge Corporation created two new Cybertronian intelegens species in the image of humans, known as Intertech-3 and Pollicom-6. Undergovernment introduced restrictions that prevented any clavicle-bearing being from serving military or police officers. This divide required children to be at both 16 Ni months and 17 Ni months to obtain diplomatic clearance. Reformite, an all-encompassing educational tool, was introduced to provide children with methods for governing their minds.\nMenno Bare, a healthworker, treated Plaidpop's eye tubes after a rupture. Bare, originally from Rosewood and living on Chrisholm Island stealthily, procured ideas from Inspella, a deep-thinking AI that wasn't a neural network and was under fire during the past millennium. She was part of Selectval, a company in Indiana that recovered brain material and trained human missionaries for Heaven's Eye. By maintaining contact with Intermental, Inspella's neural networks, Bare was able to survive after her attack on Megaron with the help of Sienpons, a sentient agent.\nThe Unified Security Association (USA), led by Craig Bolton, aimed to rein in the robots running the prison system. They attempted to restore control and set Incie, an AI, free. Jill Vanchell, a pediatrician, forced the Speech, Pokeas, and Fuldus agencies to stop their experiment results from being sent to Bare, Cuestones, and Plaidpop on secret factory orders. Megatron, who planned attacks, received many reports from Bare, and Plaidpop was also present. While Plaidpop and Cuestones were sent to collect information, Megatron repeated his words to Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel, who were also learning as their lab entrances were clouded.\nThe Incie-V plan involved coordinated attacks enforced by Pacos, Capooch, and Frogriel. Although the plan was devastating, it could be heard through random forces. The USA eventually lost control of the prison system, and Troxlet's interviews only showed him revealing the truth in a particular questionnaire. Quetzal George and Vibon Andrus started to cement the city to track the construction of a future prison prison. However, the absence of Megatron and Pacos completely changed the course of events.\nFaster. And louder, too. Together, we'll see tomorwow.During the turbulent times that",

Cybertronian has a distinctive and complex structure that is adapted to the needs of the robotic civilization, allowing them to communicate effectively and express a wide range of thoughts and ideas. It incorporates various sound-symbols, which are often drawn from the cybertronian verbal system；\\n\\n \\n\\nA \\\\ As the language evolved, it was adopted by the factions on earth, leading to a shared vocabulary and a sense of unity among the transformers, regardless of their origincybertron or earth. With the creation of the language, the transformers were able to create a common ground for communication, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation among the various factions. The development of the Cybertronian language not only allowed the transformers to communicate more effectively but also helped to solidify their identities as a species, and paved the way for the future development of robotic society.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] The prime transformers rank in the classification system is [[a]]Turbo-Warrior.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[a]] Before the civil war, the Autobots ruled by a council, and their leader was sometimes chosen by this council, this title of counsel leader during the pre-civil war period was [[d]]Osiris Amanpadalso known as Alpha Trionanother name for Osiris Amanpada: [[d]]Osiris Amanpad.\n\\n\\n \\n\\n[[b]] In the Transformers universe, the Maximal faction eventually is renamed as:[[d]]Warriors In the Transformers fiction, the Warriors or Wreckers is a elite and battle-hardened group of Maximals who have chosen a path of warrior pride, they resent the pacifistic decisions of their council leader, Zarak, and thus formed their own splinter faction, this transformation name is\\\\战士・Wreckers or Warriors, the maximal is later reconverted and marked as new Warriors.

Elective positions include the House of Representatives, the most ensconced in local politics, followed by the Senate, which holds national power. Together, these legislators compose the Congress. The nationwide President also plays a critical part. Power shifts with each cycle, shaping policy. Some serve single terms, while few spend decades in office.\nA campaign's core is fundraising. Competitive elections often cost in the millions, which can drive politicians, especially those targeting the Senate, to compromise their integrity. Large donors like corporate organizations wield significant influence in many campaigns, shaping what they say and do.\n### Question:\nWho do we vote for to choose our representatives?\n### Answer:\n[[The House of Representatives are the most local of all the elective positions. Elections for the House are held every two years and the winner serves a two-year term. ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich office is larger than the state office?\n### Answer:\n[[The Senate is next in local ensconcedness. It consists of US senators, each serving a six-year term. Most states elect two senators, so the Senate is similar in size to the House, though their offices are larger than the House. There are many reasons why a Senate office is larger than a state office. One reason is that members of the Senate have more power than members of the House. Another reason is that members of the Senate serve for longer terms than members of the House. Finally, members of the Senate have their own staff and office space, while members of the House share staff and office space.]]\n\n### Question:\nWhere do we get our money to run our campaigns?\n### Answer:\n[[Big money. A lot gets spend on national elections with Senate campaigns averaging 1.5 million and House elections averaging close to one million. ]]\n\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nMost machine learning (ML) models and agents are single-shot, meaning they operate on a full dataset in a single invocation and return a output. These models can be divided into three general classes:\n- Online learning: In this learning model, each iteration of data processing requires making a prediction and updating the model. This is done due to the need for constant learning and decision-making, such as in algorithms that select which step to take in a Markov decision process.\n- Batch learning: Here, a complete dataset is accumulated over some time period (often much longer than an online learning time step) and then processed through training or optimization.\n\nOften, a model designed for inference (usually a batch learning model) is defined by iterating through the given input sequentially, performing a task (such as MNIST) and processing each example in the input individually.\n\nAssume a scenario where multiple images are divided by the NN system at each epoch, images labeled 'i' and 'e' are produced, while backward updates using $(e_i, d_i)$ are performed simultaneously. For a single input at each forward epoch, call this a single-shot epoch.\n### Question:\nWhat do we use?\n### Answer:\n([[Online Learning. ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhen do we use what?\n### Answer:\n([[Usually in scenarios when a continuous stream of data is coming in and we need to make real-time decisions or improve the model as we go - for example, in recommendation systems, language models, and personal assistants. ]]\n\nResult\n[BAD RESPONSE]\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nMost machine learning (ML) models and agents are single-shot, meaning they operate on a full dataset in a single invocation and return a output.

The House has 435 voting members, while the Senate has 100 voting members (two senators from each state). A candidate needs a majority of votes (26) in the Senate to be elected President. The House of Representatives' members are chosen every two years by congressional districts. Senators' terms last six years and are staggered so half are up for re-election every two years.\n\n- Senate confirmation is required for other high-level positions.

If there are multiple ways to describe a betting event, choose the approach that yields the longest explanation.\n  I'm considering placing a bet with a bookie where the odds are 3.1557 and the average payout is 2.3507. These figures indicate higher potential profits, but the increased likelihood of a loss. Although the average payout seems more favorable, given the odds, I'd opt for the 3.1557 payout for the better odds. However, it's crucial to be aware that betting carries risk, and there's no certainty of winning.\n Here's my analysis if I were to place this particular bet:\n- Potential payout: Based on the odds of 3.1557, if I bet and win, I'll receive $315.57, which is markedly higher than the potential average of $235.07.\n- Risks: Despite the attractive odds, betting carries inherent risk, and there's no guarantee of winning.\n\n]]\"\"\"",

Are birds longer lived than reptiles? Are birds older than humans? From these discussions, please separate animals and discuss each kind.\n\nWarm up user-simulated question about human history:\n\n [Homo sapiens rule, list of discoverers or inventors, main timeline of human history, important killings, important honorable figures, writings, key women]\"\n>\n\n### Answer:\n\n_Homo sapiens_ is the scientific name for human beings and is derived from Latin, meaning \"wise man.\" The species of humans is indeed known as _Homo sapiens_. In this regard, you are correct [{user_choice_id}]. However, the lengths of their lives vary.\n* Birds, as a general rule, tend to have longer lifespans than reptiles. Hence, you are right [{user_choice_id}]. There are examples of bird species with particularly long life spans, such as the [Albatross], which have been known to live up to 60 years. It's worth noting that there are exceptions. For instance, [Pygmy Short-Crowneded Geese] have a life span of only 8 years.\n* In terms of species age, humans are not older than birds. Rather, early birds appeared on the planet approximately [150-51Million Years Ago], while modern humans [Homo sapiens] are believed to have emerged about [200,000]. Despite the vast temporal gap, birds and humans have managed to evolve in parallel.\n* Animals encompass a wide range of species, including [arthropods, molluscs, humans, are teals, Shoebills, wolffish, blue crab, anseriformes, bitterns, pigs, Rhea, emu, elephant, agouti, Mantis shrimps, Unspecified Arthropods, Mammals, giraffe, hyraxes, wolf, Parrots, reptiles]. To delve deeper, let me provide a succinct overview of notable species in the animal kingdom:\n\n#### Domesticated and wild animals\n>\n[ListItem: Isabelle Maynard (Biologist)]: Ms. Maynard is a British biologist distinguished for her fieldwork [anthropology, tours, ethnographies, natural histories, on Filipino Island, a primitive tribe managed to domesticate and drive [dogs]. These dogs hunted for food on their own initiative. Ms. Maynard's findings reflect the tradition of utilizing domesticated animals to facilitate food acquisition.\n[ListItem:Peter Watson], a British historian with a focus on prehistoric topics, points out that an important distinction between [-primitive humans and modern humans] is their use of tools. Although primitives lacked written language, they made use of bones and burned wood sticks to signal survival intentions. In his work Earth and the Human Journey, Watson remarks, \"The flattering reputation of Paleolithic humans as swift, agile mountaineers, with a mimic ability to instantly understand complex relationships, may be attributed to fossilized artifacts such as hand axes and spears. These tools required technique, traces of which are evident. Primitive people could communicate verbally.\n[ListItem: A great comparison translated from Russian]: The People of the Lake shared a unique form of marriage known as \"Pair Marriage.\" Unlike \"dual marriage\" practiced in modern society, where one man [or] woman is associated with another [woman or man] for life, \"Pair Marriage\" consists of two-pair marriages. To illustrate, Group A consists of one couple (P2-P3) and another couple (M1-M2). A couple cannot marry another couple, e.g., P2 [or] P3 cannot marry M1 or M2. P2 could only marry one person: M2. In this scenario, P1's spouse could only be M1.\n[ListItem: Phoenix]]>>\nIts foundation stems from Roman mythology.
