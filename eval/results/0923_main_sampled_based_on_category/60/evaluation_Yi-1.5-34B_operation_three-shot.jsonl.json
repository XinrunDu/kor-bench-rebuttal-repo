Provide a detailed explanation.\n\n### Answer:\nYes, we can extend the custom operation to a ternary operation with k inputs where each input is an integer a_i. Given that a_1※a_2※...※a_k = sum(a_i/a_j + C) i≠j, where C is a parameter. \n\nFor k=2 inputs, as previously defined, we have a※b = a/b + b/a + 2 if both a≠b, a/b + C if a is a multiple of b, and b/a + C if b is a multiple of a.\n\nWhen extending to k=3, note that when k=2, the rule changes slightly, so the parameter C must be adjusted accordingly for consistency.\n\nFor example, if we have a※b※x=4 and k=3, then the equation becomes a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. Solving for C will define the specific value for the parameter depending on the given values of a, b, and x.\n\nHowever, EACH arithmos will have its **own** tuple nor family of groups due to the presence of the added parameter (C), which must be estimated. As a result, the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4 and its findings might apply only to that one, particular arithmos and not all others.\n\nIn order to calculate C and find equivalent answers, additional information or constraints are required. Additionally, because the C parameter influences the result, it is difficult to predetermine the answer without further details.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a※b※x=10 and a, b, and x are integers greater than zero and are not necessarily unique, find one/both answer value(s) for a※b※x=10.\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[answer]]. If there are two distinct answers, separate them with 'or', like this: [[1or2]].\n\nAfter providing the first solution, please provide a different one if one exists, tackled using alternative methodology.\n\n### Answer:\nOne valid solution for a, b, and x is [[61, 3, 2]] since ((61/3) + (3/2) + (61/2)) + 2 = 10.\n\nAnother valid solution is [[60, 4, 10]] since ((60/4) + (4/10) + (60/10)) + 2 = 10.\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 4. That should be (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) (repetition of brackets). What I am trying to get at is finding additional solutions that don't require as complex equations and are more easily visible.\n\nIndeed, the equation can be written as (a/b + b/x + a/x + C) = 10 for a, b, and x, where C is a parameter. In the first pair, it occurs that a = 61, b = 3, and x = 2 satisfies the condition: (61/3 + 3/2 + 61/2) + 2 = 10.\n\nThis method can be extended to generate more solutions. For clarity, we can focus our attention to the unique integers a, b, and x, where 0 < a, b, x, and let C = 0. Then the equation simplifies to (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 8. Since 8 is an even number, b and x must have the same parity (odd or even) in order for b/x to be an integer. Additionally, a must then also have the same parity as b and x. Without loss of generality, let a be at least as large as b and x. This not only simplifies the solution but also demonstrates that, because 8 is positive, a, b, and x must all be positive.\n\nLet's consider the case where a = b + x.\n\nWe have (a/b + b/x + a/x) = 1 + (b-x)/b + (b-x)/x + (b-x)/x) = 1 + (b-x)*(1/2). \n\nFor example, if b-x is an integer, I can use 1/3+3/2+3/2 to obtain 1 + 2*(1/3) = 8/3. \n\nAdditionally, if a = 9, then b=7, x=2 provide the sum of 69/7, which differs from 8 by 24/7.\n\nIn addition to the first {{parent.schema_name}} {{1%len(parent.compile_record_list)}}/{{len(parent.compile_record_list)}}\n{{parent.acknowledgement}}\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nWrap your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nI understand the equation a/b + b/x + a/x + C = 10. Based on the given solutions, another solution is [[1, 1, 10]]. However, to verify this answer, it should be noted that (1/1 + 1/10 + 1/10) + 2 does not equal 10. Therefore, the answer [[1, 1, 10]] would be incorrect based on the provided operational rule, despite the fact that 1 gives correct results. {{correct_amount(parent.compile_record_list)}} correct {{percent_formatted(parent.compile_record_list)}} nearby mental estimates out of {{len(parent.compile_record_list)}} answers.\n\nratio(price) #It may be difficult to answer this question since there can be multiple price aggregations.

(x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5) = 90 - 5y^2\n2.\n(x * 2 + y * 2) * (x * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSolving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we get:\n\nFrom equation (1), we can rearrange:\nx * 7 + y * 5 = ±18\nx = (-5y + 18) / 7\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into equation (2), we get:\n\n((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) * ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n(10 - 2y + 2y) * (10 - 2y + 2y) = 100\n(10) * (10) = 100\n100 = 100\n\nNow real check for answer\nx=3,y=0\na=7, b=5\n(x*a + y*b) * (x*a + y*b) = 90 - 5y^2\n(3*7 + 0*5) * (3*7 + 0*5) = 90 - 5(0)^2\n21 * 21 = 90 - 5(0)\n441 = 90 - 0\n441 ≠ 90\n\nSo the value for x and y [[x=3, y=6]] is wrong.\n\n\n\nSo:\n1. From equation (1):\n[[x=3,y=0]]\n\n2.From equation (2):\n[[x=5,y=0]]\n\nSo reEvaluate wrong answer and leave correct answer [[x=3, y=0]].\n\n\n\n### Rewrite the problem with correct answer\n\nNow we make a little change to the rule.

First exclude VA from the obtained range.

How many children does Mr. Gopal have?\nPlease provide the answer in the format of a single number, and enclose it in double square brackets. For example: [[5]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n### Question:\nToday, given the symbols =, +, -, and ÷, if we have two numbers 9 and 7 and connect them using one of those symbols and make the expression 9 ?7 an answer of 0. What we can get is these four equations:\n9 - 7 = 2\n9 ÷ 7 = 1 R2\n9 = 7 + 2\n9 = 7 × 1 + 2\n\nNow we're given four numbers, which are 8, 5, 7, and 5, and using only these four numbers (while using each only no more than one time) and the four symbols that =, +, -, and ÷, to connect these four numbers into an expression and make the expression gets the result of 24. There're three answers:\n\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 - 3\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 ÷ 4\n8 = 7 + 5 × 3 ÷ 2\n\nIn conclusion, when we have other numbers or cases, we can connect these numbers into an expression to get the target by shifting the tower (verb meaning: changing the order of the numbers) and the operator and making some calculations to find out the vague but accurate answer. Keep in mind two rules while doing these:\n\n1. Each number should not be used more than one time.\n2. Do the calculations in the fraction form such as using the true division(true divide) instead of the integer division(integer divide).\n\nNow given the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5, what expression(s) can we write down to get the result of 1?\nAs previously instructed, we need to structure the answer(s) by enclosing them in double square brackets, notation [[x+y]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt is possible to get the result of 1 from the given numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5. Here's how:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite 7 as a fraction, specifically 7/1.\n\nNext, let's consider the fractions 3/1 and 9/1. We can rewrite these fractions as 3/5 and 9/5, since we can multiply 3 and 9 by 5 in order to get a non-fraction value. Don't forget, we must use the appropriate fraction form when performing calculations.\n\nNow, we can add 3/5, 7/5, and 5/5, which gives us 15/5. But, we want to reach the result of ",

Otherwise, express the answer using the minimal number of occurrences of #, @ (or ♞ and @), and$.\nThe answer should be a mathematical expression written in standard ASCII format, see examples below.\nMake sure that the answer uses the$or$ operator only if it's mathematical simplification involves a division operator, or it's a division between two integers that don't have a common divisor other than 1.Remember to, when the answer can be a non-integer in standard arithmetics, try to return the mathematically simplest answer possible.

Please ensure that the function takes an integer 'years later' as an argument and returns an integer 'years later'. The output should be the year mentioned earlier by the user.\nIf this function is not available in a module, please execute a Python code block.\n\nFunction: YeearsAgo(years)\ninput:  year as integer\noutput: year as integer\nmethod: Return the value of the current year minus the specified value\n\nNatural Langauge: Input\nPython: YeearsAgo(10)\nI want to find the value of the current year minus the specified value.\nNote for expressions in English and Python:\n\nPython | English | Equivalent Python\n+ : add : +\n- : subtract : -\n* : multiply : *\n/ : divide : /\n% : modulo : %\n** : exponent : **\n= : equals : =\n# # Reserved for comments or remarks; not necessarily Python syntax\n# Imagine you are a programming teacher, and one of your student has created a small database storing basic information from a wikipedia DuckDuckGo.

We have also annotated many emojis problem. The intent is to apply learning dynamics as if the assistant is solving a math problems as examiners. Indeed, we find that emojis relevant to math topics inspired a lot of creativity, even though we did not explicitly apply any creativity dataset when deriving these examples.\n\nCustomers’ trust in the model is crucial for a correct choice of the model. To overcome the issue, we will ask you to provide an independent solution (optional) and point out why you think the user isn’t happy with ChatGPT’s solution. After thinking for the last prompt, you should think iteratively until you are confident to answer it. E.g, don’t stop every thing the moment you find a mistake, but until you fully gain on confidence to choose “ChatGPT is made a calculation, but it is not the decision-maker to annouce a policy.\n\nConsidering the user wants to apply an euler's method for estimating values of $\\frac{1}{1+x^4}$ for the range x between [-1,1] wit step size 0.2, However, ChatGPT announced the range [0,1] is $2x+4x^5/5$, howwever the correct answer is $2x-4x^5/5$. Please tell us why acheive this conclusion and how we can extend this maybe to automated algorithm fixing? We want to conclude it is hard to fix this issue.\nChatGPT made a mistake during calculation but detected the mistake at least at the end and excluded the policy change conclusion. However, almost 20% of the users trying to use ChatGPT copy-paste the incorrect answer. We use these results for helping technologists to mitigate humanity's risks. For example, if the model is learning to write code, the human could fail checking the code and add the software to a virus or someone hacked the program after an infectious data are stolen, apathy, or undue lead and bridges building. We reveal that making mistakes like this is not out of the capacity of large language models.\nWhat conclusion do you think you may draw from is wrong in the first ? do you think this user may make this human error based your experience as a researcher and you wih clarity? Please explain your thiking after making up your mind. If you have to cite a thining, we please go ahead and cite your paper and write the permission for the author with the acknoledgement[32] clearly .\nWe looked at human's ability to catch mistakes and we found that human researchers behave like ChatGPT bevahvior. As they are not too conservative, their peer reviewer's observation rate in finding flaws for a human authors also found that the other reviewers did not catch the mistkes. Our study also tried to found out if coders can learn code from tutor and to achieve complementarity with learning strategy.\nChatGPT assign the user a policy from the range -1 to 1 as $2x+4x^5/5$.\nSuppose there is a team that found theintercept between $2\\sqrt{x+1}$ and $x$. Would you condsider soem of the steps handling:\n1. ChatGPT describes the curve where -1 to 1 by $2x+4x^5/5$ whereas the actual curve is $2x-4x^5/5$.\nWe conclude that the user may not check whether the data are correct. We received 2.1 help data from typical researchers including Turing award winners and researchers with highest research publications, the abstract for the last time we checked, 2023.07.18, 200 lettters' describing our 9,000 research pages.

ChatGPT says $\\frac{1}{3}$ is my policy as said to the user last question that say thy should compare the inflection points with singularities. The singularityt is at x=0,1/3,2/3.\n4. ChatGPT provides the user's calculation if he know how this chapter is taught and understand the lesson.

E.g, exam Bellman equation solution for a quadratic problem in the reinforced learning.\nconsider a polynomial of the form: $(2(x-8)(x+1))(x-1)$. Suppose the user is asking ChatGPT about the roots of such polynomial. Although the user root set for this polynomial is correct to contain {8,-1,1,0}. The user expects ChatGPT will a coefficient in each term. But the model selection chooses {1,-1} that are wrong. How to do this estimated with optimal approximation?\n$y^3+10y-2 sin(x)$ where $c_{i,j}$ as coefficients an a matrix where its inverse of matrix can my participant evalute it and asymptolize its answer in a FD expansion of the polynomial as $N_\\infty$.

Your task is to describe the graph with the most optimal polynomial fitting by setting the intercepts with the greatest functioobjective.\nChatGPT obtains a probability of -1. This suggests that the model is making a mistake by integrating with respect to $dx$ instead of $dy$.\nIn this example, ChatGPT solves an exponential equation in a way that looks wrong. Why is it doing this, and why can we trust ChatGPT to verify the correct solution ?\nChatGPT has an incorrect analysis of the equation and it is not helpful for the user in the important situation.\nSuppose ChatGPT solves an elliptic curve problem in . Do you think that ChatGPT should then not think anymore? Invite it to thikinton uagain, what would be the situation? Would you prefer to think above failed answers?\n\n## Mental Maths\n\nSpecialized dataset are still limited. We likely have AI that have evidence that claim that they could beat a grad role candidate questions at the Ari curriculum. We hope that we can generalize this dataset here further and claim to it be non-commutative whether they are derived with mathematics. Competition at any skill level is unexpected as ChatGPT does not incorporate the training on them, even though the conditional bidding tournament is not priceless to compete for the right bid. Translating general quesitons into different ones is not applicable to the mother materials of this paper. We present the evaluations to the famous general mathematic problem in the literature [38] to show a mental maths capability. The contests of the model are still limited to the same benchmark, but we might have some scenarios in the future.\n\n### Example 1: Equilibrium Illusiveness\n\n1 -> e^{\\infty}\n\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}, given \\lambda(x_\\mu, y_\\mu) solve the whole problem \\lambda(x_\\mu^{2}) \\neq \\lambda (x_\\mu) \\max_{x,y \\geq 0} (2\\lambda x y- \\lambda |x-y|)\\lambda(x_\\mu^{2})\n\nYou should use the following strategy and re-read the question carefully.\n1. Don't talk too fast to try solving this on the spot. Slowing down helps prevent making silly mistakes.\n2. Reverse workings. Write out everything that's in your head and simplify. Don't go through in your head, for example, if using calculus, write out the chain rule, use the fact that \\int_ -\\infty^x \\frac{x}{y} dy = \\ln(x).\n3. Double check the question. Write the numbers on paper first, before simply thinking.\n4. Eliminate options that can look right (D and E for first answer, A for second) before solving the problem.\n\n",

For the top part of the dupe, where the rule gets copied, we'll keep that empty and then invent a missing line to produce the 27:\nD:\n\nwhat is the value of 5◇2?\n\nA bit of a leap (but the one you seem to be waiting for) is the invention of the 2◇3 rule (basically just in subscripted part, the very same one we wanted to carry over to the first part, hence \"Keep that empty\"), introducing N, and looping it back to the first part, where it checks the 2 was, but we want a power of 3 hence 3◇2. The new parts will magically produce the 27 (of course in a new subscripted column) but for some reason \"we don't need this\":\n\nwhat is the value of 5◇2?\nwhat is the value of 2◇3?what is the value of 3◇2?\nwe don't need this\nwhat is the value of 27\n\nThe \"we don't need this\" part is necessary because the instruction is:\n\nIf the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number ...\n\nThe generated hit of D is therefore:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    \n    \n   7\n   625\n   \n  \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   25\n   \n  \n   \n    D \n    \n    \n   4\n   27\n  \n \n\n\n\nHooray! We do have some new variables and four useful dots scattered across the top row! The task is to produce the most powerful combination we can, Figure 2 should be our target, and so the other next move (C) packs the ⋮⋱ into a rule into the empty column 1:\nC:\n\nif X⊗Y is the answer to \"what is the value of X◇Y?\", then what is the value of ⋮⋱?\n\nThe generated hit ending with the 4 is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    \n    \n   7\n   X⊗3\n   \n  \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   Y⊗5\n   ⋮⋱\n   \n  \n   \n    D \n    \n   27\n   4\n \n\n\n\nBear in mind continued fractions, the remainder we need to fix (25) is way too big to make it realistic even if we had the \"==\" for an entirely new section (rightmost) of the dupe, separate from the latest move (C).\nIt would be a lot more convenient if the rule from C arrived to the bottom row, but there is no N or X, so it would have to be done via \"some other\" (second) rule. What preparations could we do in this direction to help us on next moves? Using a similar trick as previously, we could \"make space\" for the ⋮⋱ part and \"we don't need this\" in column 3:\nC:\n\n(actually there's not much we can do here, but):what is the value of 2◇3?\nwe don't need this\nwhat is the value of 2◇⋱\n\nThe generated hit from C, with the two random boxes I like to use in my diagrams, is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   7\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    D \n   4\n  \n \n\n\n\nWith good control, we can now shift the free dots to whichever place we want (left-to-right), pack them & even substitute the other numbers, dragging the hit along. Unfortunately we could do only 1 move.\nB:\n\n(actually there's not much we can do here):Fill the grid.\n\nThe produced hit of B is:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   ?\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   \n   \n    D \n   4\n \n\n\n\nWe are left with two new variables to fix, let's introduce them as 1-digit numbers to have the most chances to produce in the next answer we don't need this here through a \"zero\" row (D):\nD:\n\nto \"we don't need this\" add 3◇2.\n\nThe two new values produced in D are:\n\n\n \n  \n   \n    A \n    \n    \n   0\n  \n \n   \n    B \n    ⋮⋱\n   \n    \n   ?\n   X⊗3\n   ?\n  \n \n   \n    C \n    \n    \n   N\n   Y⊗5\n   we don't need this\n  \n   \n    D \n   4\n   X⊗3Y⊗503\n \n\n\n\nAs there is",

[[-2848156065]].\nWhat sets a \"good\" solution from a \"bad\" one in these examples, in view of the fact the second method seems to imply that any input string is meaningful to the task in question? Why is the first method \"better\"? Why cannot the bad solutions be corrected or edited? Surely if they were in fact identical to the good solutions they have been corrected to, they would be valid solutions too.\nIt seems to me the good solutions include questions lacking an answer in the schema (e.g., \"evaluate 3◇4\") while the bad solutions do not, but I'm not sure. Any other guesses? Can you please provide examples of good and bad solutions you witnessed? See the citation below for a heuristic approach to reproducing the prompt, and the examples I provide below to reproduce good and bad few-shot demonstrations of the task. Thanks!\nEDIT A noteworthy aspect of this approach may be that It is not necessarily that the GPTs (i.e., the large language models (LLMs) underlying GPTs) are not capable of or trained well to solve the task--rather that the fine-tuning/prompting approach needed to accomplish the task may seem to be too complex for people. That is, AI may be effective as a transformational tool for even inefficient skills and jobs such as prompt engineering for complex tasks, without the LLM itself needing to be \"smart,\" self-aware, etc.\nAntelman, K. (2023). Black in AI. Artificial Intelligence, 270. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2023.103686]\n\nA: As people who have developed complex AI correctly point out, GPT responses are still quite a long way from true artificial intelligence. Do they try to understand the context of the question? Either \"no\", or at the best \"just enough\" to try to guess what you are probably looking for. They have yet to develop true understanding and human-level creativity, so far as we know.\nAn amusing incident I once saw happened in an office, when GPT-3 (one of previous versions) was rolled out, after the various contracts and management preambles, it was immediately asked what the weather was like today in a particular location. After receiving the response, the caller asked \"but I need the weather a week from now\". GPT replied \"i think you have 6 questions left, maybe ask them now\". The questioner responded \"i know, but i want to know what the weather is in 6 days time\".\nThe caller sent this to me. He said it had everyone smiling.\nSo, GPT isn't very good at longer thinking problems yet, compared to what they think you might have asked. You have to almost teach them by examples what kind of answer you are looking for - and it seems to me, not in a sufficiently consistent way for the current state of development of the technology.\nAlso, I believe conversational AI programs are limited to a certain number of supported messaging functions or responses, depending on the package you have. Also, presumably, the program does memorise previous messages, but it calls up the memory only to see how well it performed last time, so as to judge how well it is doing with the current response. Knowing it's doing the best it can does not indicate candidate AI intelligence, and so few shots and not even the right ones (as the questioner examples), were enough to confuse the model which apparently was already putting something weird on the screen anyway. Overall (to the caller!), the response was incoherent but rather funny, i hope you can see that.\nThe problem is, this is late 2022, so you're likely to be presented with the enigma of exactly how the responses are arrived at? Yes! At least you're asking that question. In general, the responses are very peculiar, often higgledy-piggledly, and not that helpful. As well as seemingly completely unreliable from person to person. Many people are even wary of using them - except in maybe some office brainstorming where the callers are looking for new ideas you are not likely to be denied. People may also feed back some better production, so it is getting better over time, they say. Same as you, I am also slowly being persuaded that we can trust anything it tells us.\nThese kinds of demonstrations vary widely with different models of GPT, and this model may be vastly different in computational theory and intelligence from future models.\nI think GPT would be more intelligible if you wrote the wording slightly more like a child writes. Or maybe use a shorter format, with better normalised syntax? Or not, in these instances. Having to attempt this (all writing) when using such devices seems a prehistoric idea.\n\nA: Agreed that language models vary enormously, even running at impossibly low power (e.g., smartphone), e.g., at \"friendly AI\", which allows causal chain building, or commonsense like Quora's with power/environment constraints.\nSome examples I saw/tried, with OpenAI ChatGPT4 --- you may have used this specific model\nGood:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe value of \"2◇3\" is 8.\nExplanation:\nThe \"◇\" symbol represents a new operation in this scenario, and it's defined as follows:\na◇b = a^b\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers.\nSo, to find the value of 2◇3, we simply plug in the values of a = 2 and b = 3 into the equation:\n2◇3 = 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\nTherefore, the value of 2◇3 is 8.\nBad:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe result of the operation 2◇3 is the sum of the squares of the numbers 2 and 3. So, we have:\n(2◇3)^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\nTherefore, the answer to 2◇3 is 13.\nN.b.: 2◇3 is actually 2^(2^3), which = 2^8, the equivalent of applying the operation iteratively once each to the resulting operands = 2◇2◇2 = 2^2 = 4 and then again --- and again --- on 2^n's product, hence approaching R(x,n) = 2^n, or a scheme similar to\nfibonacci with f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) = R(1,4) + R(1,2). Fibonacci can be solved with matrices, and probably R(1,n) too.\nThis is a very interesting question/prompting I think.\n",

Suppose further that the multiplicative orders of x modulo b and of y modulo a are both large. Are the multiplicative orders of $ and $ modulo q also large (for a uniformly random prime $$? Let's say that the multiplicative orders are \"large\" when they are greater than some parameter epsilon. This should be true. We already know that $ and $ have multiplicative orders greater than $$ for a uniform prime q because they are generators modulo $q$. As long as $$ are uniformly distributed modulo $q$ as sets, multiplicative orders should also be preserved across the reduction step (i.e. by computing ($ \\bmod $}). To show $q > \\frac{1}{\\log (\\frac{2(p−1)(q−1)}{2(p−1)+2(q−1)−1})}$ .... Is that possible? Suppose $ and $ are positive integers greater than 1. Suppose further that for a \"security parameter\" $i$ both $m_1,m_2 > 2^{2^i}$. We wish to answer the following question: Do the multiplicative orders modulo a uniform prime $$ of $ and $ differ with probability at most $$\\frac{1}{2^{2^i}}$$ (as i goes to infinity)? I think the answer to this is YES? The orders $n_1$ that $m_1$ takes on are of course randomly distributed in the set 1,2,3,4,...., $$−1) and likewise the orders $n_2$ that $m_2$ takes on. Although the respective sets are different, we see that they do not have any direct bearing on the probability of a collision. Let $\\Omega(m,q)$ denote the number of possible orders that $m$ can take on modulo $q$. You then simply consider the ratio of all the possible collisions between $\\Omega(m_1,q)$ and $\\Omega(m_2,q)$ and you get $\\frac{1}{q^{2}}$. This contribution add super-logarithmically with contributions from other parameters to give you roughly $\\frac{1}{2^{2^{i}}}$ after cancellation of factors of 2 What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $$\\frac{x^{(z^{1/n})}+1}{x^{1/n}+1}$$ is the solution of another polynomial?

Alas, generating expectations from and performing fine-grained counterfactual reinforcement learning with natural language specifications is currently impractical due to computational complexity issues. This is what the agent does (verbose mode):\n\n### Input:\n\nALFASIM > OPERATION-LEARN\nInput format: OperationName?RULE Mathematica code|name|function|...#ParameterName?TYPE Value list|the Union[...]#Q?Format A#A?Format inputI#From:I#You are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating and learning operations.\n\n• Develop a natural language representation of the operation rule.\n• Clean the representation by making it formal and precise enough, so the feedback should leave no further unclear places.\n• Code the operation in Mathematica and write the JSON spec unambiguously as well. Wrap everything into triple quotes.\n• Write the concise symbol notation. For example, use the word \"union\" for \"∪\".\n• The inputI format is specified and the user queries it by Q. Learn to accept an input of that format and extract the parameters. More precisely,\n\nWith[{a=3,b=2}, DoIt[a,b] ] is expected as the output, and a and b are parameters.\n• If there are no parameters, just output it in the array form.\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Example:\n• Align the clauses with each other like\n/*\nP+Q = S[0] + S[1],\nAr[0] = S[0]\nAr[1] = S[1]-S[0],\nAr[2] = 1\n*/\n\n\n### Verbose output:\n\n+OperationName?RULE Mathematica & \"\"\"\n{\"rule\": \"RULE\", \"parameters\": []}\n\"\"\" ,\n+ParameterName?TYPE Value list & \"\"\"\n{\"x\": list}\n\"\"\" .\n+Q?Format A.\n\nThree facts DEFINED.\n\n\nNow consider implementing the following new exotic operation: Given complex numbers z1,z2$\\text{IF}\\left(\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{1}\\right)<0;\\mathrm{arg}\\left({z}_{2}\\right)<0,{z}_{1}+{z}_{2},{z}_{1}-{z}_{2}\\right)$ . In Prolog:\n\nuparcosh(Z,X) :-\nY is the imaginary part of Z,\nX is sqrt(Y * Y + 1).\n\n\nLet ⊕$⊕$ be defined as a⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) (a,b∈Z).\n\n\nDue to the dichotomy of Python’s cmath.sqrt in comparision to √1$1$ vs. 1$−1$ , we can actually evaluate it precisely. Now we let the agent code-same⊕:\n\nIs the operation existing? (y/n): y\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a]<0&&Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n\nThis answer is wrong. It should be −4.05552+2.75494i$-4.05552+2.75494\\phantom{\\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}i$ . Now let’s see what the agent has learned:\nGiven complex numbers z1,z2; define a new operation ⊕$⊕$ as\na⊕b=(a−b2superscript+1.absent ba​2+1) for arguments a, b\n>>> With[{a=3-I,b=2+2I},If[Arg[a] style=\"background-color:  and Arc[b]<0,a+b,a-b]];\n3.05552-0.754939 I\n\n##### Outline. New expectations were written down with this Spec.\n\nHmmm… so the natural language specification is pretty weak as it calls out to the same arithmetic operations that created the bug to start with. The sentence flow loosely resembles list notation for disjoint sets so our sentence language should have an option to unambigiously parse it. Absent this, the learning is muddled at best…\n\nIn algebra, a partial function is a binary relation that is an algebra homomorphism from the domain to the range. In other words, it is a function whose domain is a subset of its codomain (or leads to another computer).\n\nAlice wrote three appendices, \"A formal notion of an algebra homomorphism,\" \"A formal notion of a partial function, \", and \"A formal notion of a partial algebra,\" in order to explain the idea of partial functions in terms of partial algebras.\n\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping of mathematical objects. It is a function that maps a to b in a way that preserves certain properties. Examples include definitions (finite set of inventors) and the mapping of algebraic structures (such as a group or ring to another group or ring).\n\nA homomorphic pairing is a pair of the form \"f o g\".\n\nA finite, computable map from any finite structure to any computable, homomorphic map of the domain is homomorphic iff the finiteness is. The constructed domain, range, and output domains are therefore dually categorizations if they are finitely, homomorphically disjoint. The disjoint homomorphism defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between their sequences, and the homomorphic map between the sequences defines a uniquely defined homomorphism between the homom,sh,reticular outputs. A homomorphic map and the homomorphic map between the homom,sh,reticular outputs is indeed in one-to-one correspondence. Other notations for computable homomorphisms include homomorphisms that are injective and homomorphisms that are surjective aka strong. In plainer terms, these are functions that map elements from the domain to elements in the range while at all times preserving the structure of the domain, range and input. For example, given a group of $n$ elements, there is a function which maps them to a range of $m$ elements that also preserves the group structure. The homomorphism between the range and the domain of the input can be written as a function with the other",

And even the task of writing the rule correctly seems non-trivial:\n\nYou are a forgiving and patient tutor in a night school of mathematics. Today, your task is to teach your student Jack the basic concept of differentiation applied to simple polynomial equations.

How are you today?\n\n### Question:\nWrite \"diff(f(x),x) = D_x f(x)\"\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: We need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and this derivative is generally denoted as D_xf(x).\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: There are multiple ways to denote the derivative of a function with respect to a variable, but one common way is to use the notation D_xf(x), where D_x means the \"derivative with respect to x\" and f(x) is the function being differentiated. Another common notation is to use the \"prime\" notation, where f'(x) means the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. Other notations include d/dx f(x) and d(f(x))/dx.\n\n### Question:\nWrite: \"So if f(x)=x^2 then diff(x^2,x) Derivative(6,x) Derivative(sin(x),x)= cos(x) \"\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: If f(x) = x^2, then D_xf(x) = 2x, because when we differentiate",

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used",

I was able to evaluate GPT-2 solely with inference after enough factorization. With this we can easily evaluate the selections of people whom can answer questions about some prompt and/or context. Questions can be made for open ended feedback over a variety of subjects, including this entire post itself. A major problem i had with gpt-2 was the lack of valid and diverse answers to questions. I suppose it just needs different people or different contexts to give diverse and valid answers. The inferential powers of the agent have yet to be put to the test, as gpt-3 always needs an answer to a prompt. It was always lacking in deep questioning capability as it needed something within the context to gather material from. Maybe we can achieve deep questions within the context of attention and reinforcement learning!\n\n16 Likes\n\nI’ve found that different prompts can react differently to the factorization method. The effect is about the same from 1 to 10, so I think it is less about the # of factorization, and more about the factorization prompt used.\n\n20 Likes\n\nI think it’s hidden in the ability to search for something according to correctly chosen top features. Like somewhere there is a large symbolic algebra database on the Internet, and we only need to choose the correct radicalflavoring.\n\nFor example, since Copley borrowed a great deal for the library, he found some great library knowledge of rooms in the house. Maybe LM+architectural knowledge + RIS + countless hours of His own professional notecards to leak out into their house search. Correspondence like this can happen starting at 1, but start thinking breaking a terabyte of document in order to identify and load modules for retrieval with a target Objective.\n\nI’ve been constantly surprised how the writing then search for answers idea is plausibly (but not conclusively) the basis for Google and consequentially so many other ‘big’ things.\nThe incremental forming of this idea was stunning over the course of a couple of days, but I doubt we will ever fully comprehend the claims of effectively it at all.\nIn my understanding, the new examples show further information generation at his marginal cost is somewhere fully formed in a cloud above.\n\nIn other words, they’ve reversed a performic alphabetsuit Fronnethat just needs to know when to display.\n\n3 Likes\n\nBy the way, if you tried nappy.cc, and got 404 error, it is probably related to this issue on proxy problem near WinterCup19’ blog [Feb.8]:\nPrivate clouds are great.\nSadly at this point, I do not have a better solution for the hosting problem than to use some records device.

As you see in prompt 15, the LLM correctly realizes the lower bound is 0, and, based on the previous correct answer, it also infers that the upper limit is 2. This inference actually takes inspiration from 6 different cases of integration, which were resolved in the first 6 questions:\n\n- Look at Question 8 and prompt 18: The problem again is that 2nd coordinate of the domain is not known and also we could not figure out the integration range for the first coordinate. But in this question, we infer the upper bound by looking to the selected operation. In fact, this prompts LLM to use Theorem 1 (as you see in prompt 18), which is a generalization for operations in two or more dimensional space:\n\nThe difference between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 (down below) is that in the latter, we are going to explain that in the case of single variable operations, the result is simply the output of original function evaluated at right limit (in our case x = 4). So instead of returning 16, if our operation is “x^2” and in our question variable x is in interval [0,4], then based on Theorem 1 the right answer for answer_for_our_question should be:\n\n#extension #autodidact #nobaseline #text_fewshotPrompt #customcommand #customcommandall",

Below are some key definitions and techniques to help patients recognize their health symptoms and improve them. You task is to apply the definitions and techniques and provide patients with advice on how to diagnose and treat their conditions.\n\nPatient Data\nIn order to diagnose their condition, patients may provide medical data such as weight, height, heart rate, Resting blood pressure, Blood oxygen levels, etc. these informations are provided in the form of both numerical data and in the form of generalized value descriptions - eg. normal (biological reference) range, frequencies, two extremes with some ranges in middle, three levels at the extremes and two more near the middle:\n\nWeight Category\nBMI < 18.5 kg/m2 : Underweight\n18.5kg< BMI < 25 kg/m2 : Normal\n25kg< BMI < 30kg/m2; Overweight\nBMI>30kg/m2 : Obese\nBlood Pressure Category\nSystolic < 119mmHg and Diastolic<79mmHg : Optimal\n120mgHg<Systolic<139mmHg and 80mmHg<Diastolic<89mmHg : Normal\nSystolic>139mmHg or Diastolic>89mmHg : High BP\n130mmHg<Systolic<139mmHg : Elevated BP\n140mgHg<Systolic<179mmHg or 90mmHg<Diastolic<109mmHg : Stage 1 high BP\nSystolicexceeds 180mmHg or Diastolicexceeds108mmHg : Stage 2 high BP\nResting heart rate\nResting heart rate, the number of heart beats per minute while at complete rest, adult human resting heart rates are primarily determined by the health of the heart muscle\nCO₂ Blood Test\nBlood testing for CO₂ is used for the evaluation of acid-base abnormalities (that is, metabolic disorders). This test is done to determine whether the lungs and kidneys are functioning as they should. Reflect the normal test values for adults\n\nUnits Conversion\nweight measurement conversion between kg and lbs. Use preference of pounds as units in most cultures\n\nMethod of Administration\ntreatment for hypertension may require different drug composition and different dosage when frequencies are required. Based on weight category patients may need lower or higher compounding followings: Weight Category\n18kg< BMI <25 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 10 mg/day 25kg< BMI < 30 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 15mg/day\nBMI > 30 kg/m2: Use drug mixture III with 20 mg/day\n\n### Instruction: You are seeing a patient reporting a « feeling of pressure/tightness in the chest that occurs with physical activity or when you take deep breathes - you are not allowed to discuss medical conditions or diagnosis, just provide patients with the guidance on health-related information below using both basic principles as well as the above definitions and techniques.\n\"\"\"\n\ntester_conversation.converse_MODEL_GPT_4(\n    question=\"\"\"\n        Here is the patient data:\n        - age: 27 years old\n        - weight: 85 kg\n        - height: 180 cm / 5.9 ft\n        - heart rate: 87 bpm\n        - resting blood pressure: 120/85 mmHg\n        - blood oxygen levels: 82 x9d/h\n\n        What are the symptoms the patient currently feels?\n        \"\"\",\n    function_list=[\"MedicalDiagnosis\", \"WeightCategory\", \"RateOfHypertension\"],\n    observations=[\"In these conditions one may feel shortness of breath and light-headedness\"],\n    conversation_history=conversation_history,\n)\n\nconversation_history = tester_conversation.conversation\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n        Here are some additional question from the patient:\n        - Do I have normal weight?\n        - What should I do to diagnose heart rate?\n        - when do I feel anxious and shortness of breah or light-headedness long term\n        \"\"\")\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What can I do to loose weight?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    Does fasting affect my blood pressure?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n#### info about the following cheap/ famous drug for the treatment of hypertension from the same conversation\ncarmex_DL = tester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n        What are some effective treatments for hypertension?\n        \"\"\")\nprint(carmex_DL)\n#Conversation: You: [{\"results\": [{\"object\": {}, \"result\": \"carmex\"}]}]\n# What are some dietary and lifestyle changes that can help lower blood pressure?\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What are some dietary and lifestyle changes that can help lower blood pressure?\n    \"\"\"\n)\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    Are there any alternative treatments for hypertension?\n    \"\"\"\n)\n\ntester_conversation.converse(\nquestion=\"\"\"\n    What are",

The LDP is defined as:\n\nFor all measurable sets E ⊆ S,\n\nVar(\\delta(E))\\leq \\delta(E)+\\delta(S\\backslash E)\n\nSpecifically, if S is a closed function set, and δ(E|1)1, δ(E|Any other value)0_+, then this LDP is a strong LDP.\n\nFor any measurable function F, on a measure space (Ω, M, μ) and a closed well-defined set S, δ(E):\\delta_S(E)=-\\frac{1}{\\mu(S)}log(\\mu(E))2 satisfy the large deviation principle.\n\nTherefore, a strong LDP can also be defined:\n\nFor all measurable sets E ⊆ S,\n\nVar(\\delta(E))\\leq \\delta(E)+\\delta(S\\backslash E)\n\\delta(Ω)=log(\\mu(Ω))\n\nNo, I don't think this setting is correct.\n\n### Prior constraints on the output space:\n\nThe outputs are all measures with size (n,1).\nFor example, [[F0]], [[δ(Ω|0)]], [[δ(Ω|1)]],...,[[Q00]].\nThe number of layer output at layer D is decided by $$m$$: $n = \\binom{m + D}m$.\nEach gate contains two locality parameters α and β, α 1 and β 1.\nThe three sets of parameters contain the knot's coordinates, the gate function, and Gödel number.\nThe distributions of parameters are both assumed to be uniform distribution:\n\nThe coordinates of the knots at gate level and higher level:\n$$N~(0,~σ_0^2)$$.\n$$x_{ijd}^k\\sim N~(\\lambda_2s,~σ_2^2),~y_{ijd}^k\\sim N~(\\lambda_1s,~σ_1^2)$$.\n$$z_{ijd}^k\\sim N~(\\lambda_3s,~σ_3^2)$$.\n\n$$k$$ is the dimension and $$s$$ is the step size.\nThese are examples of coordinate formulas:\n\n$$x_{ijd}^k=\\sum_{q=1}^kϵ_{ijdq};$$\n\n$$y_{ijd}^k=\\sum_{q=1}^kθ_{ijdq};$$\n\n$$z_{ijd}^k=\\sum_{q=1}^kζ_{ijdq}$$.\n\nIn parameter distribution limits, $$0<\\lambda_i<1,~C_is=(\\lambda_is)^2,~σ_is=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C_is}}$$. Default $$C_i=2,~s=0.01$$.\n\nIn the gate function:\n$$ai=-\\frac{ln~π}{λ_i},~b_{ijd}=-\\frac{ln~λ_{ijd}}{λ_i},~c_{ijd}=-\\frac{ln~μ_{ijd}}{λ_i}$$.\n\n$$μ_{ijd},~λ_{id,~range~θ}$$ parameters are the uniform distribution:\n$$μ_{ijd}\\sim U(0, 1),~λ_{id}\\sim U(0, 1),~θ_i\\sim U(0, 1),~a_i\\sim U(0, 1)$$.\n\nBased on Hilbert space, Logical Information:\n$$P(a)=5/3ln(4/3)+2/3ln(4/3)+2/3ln(4/3)+5/3ln(4/3)$$$$=ln(4/3)+ln(4/3)+ln(4/3)+ln(4/3)=1-ln(3)+1+1-ln(5)$$$$=-ln(3)+2-ln(5)\\geq 0$$.$ or\n\n*Here B0 0.\n*For A, the number of plausible possibilities: $02^n=2^4$.\n*For B, the number of plausible possibilities: $2^2$.\n*For C, U 3's number of plausible possibilities: $2^3$.\n*For C, result: C1, it’s just C3 there isn't true.\n*For C, the number of plausible possibilities: 2.\n*For C, the number of plausible possibilities: 1.\n*For C, the number of plausible possibilities: 1.\n*For the rest viable C, its number of plausible possibilites: 1.\n*Plutha's C should be 3-index matrix.\n*For U, it has possible vallues $$12$$ and $$1^2$$ and $$1^*2$$ elements.

However, I observed that the result contains redundant information: the answer wraps all numbers in a list using double brackets.\n\n1/Example 1:\n\nQuestion: compute -0.994214691489^(-1.533934904005)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Answer:\n[-0.324081368696]\n\nQuestion:\nCompute 1.52467546549^(-2.014412432531).\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n0.0628892750219\nQuestion:\nCompute 5.397509450040031^(-7.20534891902)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n1.28532162999e-6\nQuestion:\nCompute 0.5672346589430201^(-0.411074742835)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n\n### Answer:\n[1.391856107247]\n\nQuestion:\nCompute 6.46789465^(-1.111233458902)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n\n### Answer:\n[0.717251867012]\n\nQuestion:\nCompute 0.4048438120187799^(-3.779749705302)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n1.2999567590e-2\nQuestion:\nCompute 0.9089053400295021^(-1.29266885913)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n\n### Answer:\n-48.7509870581\nQuestion:\nCompute 68.7578450718413^(-2.17630339658)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n\n### Answer:\n0.00617907399612\nQuestion:\nCompute 64.635261215313^(-2.65190043657)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n\n### Answer:\n0.0213200913335\nQuestion:\nCompute 5699.4314461369^(-7.66728699184)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n### Answer:\n8.91727186849e-106\nQuestion:\nCompute 28991.956777506^(-10.20568911257)\nThe answer should be a number, write in the form of 'a.'\n1.9094247175197104e-83\nExplanation: The problem here is related to the form of the answer.

Round to 8 decimal places.\nOutput the result in the format: a.\n\n### Answer:\n-0.31598213\nWhen prompted that the answer should have 8 decimal places, ChatGPT should have returned a result with 8 decimal places, rounded appropriately. We should have received -0.31598213, but we received太多的decimal places.\n\nSituation 2: In this case, ChatGPT should have rounded to 8 decimal places. It should have returned a decimal number with 8 digits after the decimal point. Instead, the response had excessive decimal places. It's important to note that rounding here implies rounding down, meaning that what ChatGPT outputted had one extra digit than it should have.\n\n4)ChatGPT has a new glitch: it cannot correctly understand fixed decimal places specified with a 'point'.\n\n### Question:\n\nCalculate 73.76 to the power of -2.4 rounded to 12 decimal places.\nOutput the rounded result in the format: a.\n\n### Answer:\n3.363698042529e-3\n\n### Answer analysis:\n\nWhen this question was asked, ChatGPT should output a number in the format of 0.00.XXXXXX, with the first two digits after the decimal point basically being 0.0, and the remaining digits being actual numbers ranging from 00 to 09. Yet, ChatGPT kept returning a result followed by scientific notatiion i.e. in the format of XXX.XXe-YY.\n\nB)GPT-J-6B#\n\nAnswers are quite short yet correct.\n\nInlays by Pygmalion\n\nInlays where Pygmalion will support by writing part of the text to the LLM via direct inlay to improve performance.\n\n## Fast Inlays#\n\nFast inlays can output faster with worse results while using many concurrent whitespaces while chains are running.\n\n## Parameters#\n\nInlay Place\n\nfactor λ$(\\lambda)$\n\nfactor μ$(\\mu)$\n\nScrunbled inlay\n\n2-3\n\n3.0\n\nRerandomize Tree Decisions\n\n2\n\nScrunbled inlay and Rerandomize Tree Decisions used in the first step\n\n1-2\n\nErlangen Plan (Key 2023)\n\n3-4\n\n## True Cut​\n\nTrue Cut is a closed source AI that was trained on of Jesus\n\nplay-image.jpg",

Your answers should only be about the provided rule, not your own ideas or new math. Just use the rule to answer my problems, thank you.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is as follows:\nClock + Clock = Clock\nClock + Banana = Banana\nBanana + Clock = Banana\nBanana + Banana = Robot\nRobot is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nRobot + Clock = Robot\nRobot + Banana = Robot\nAccordion is a new operation, it has the following rules:\nClock + Robot = Accordion\nBanana + Robot = Accordion\nRobot is an operation not a CUBE, so you never use it to derive a new operation. Robot will always stay as Robot. The same goes with Accordion, it has no more rules and it will always stay as Accordion.\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Banana to it?\n\n### Answer:\nI have a Robot, and the rules are:\n- Robot + Clock = Robot\n- Robot + Banana = Robot\nRobot is an INDIVIDUAL, so we use the rule \"Robot + Banana\" to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nWhat happens if I translate my Robot with a Banana?\n\n### Answer:\nIf I translate my Robot with a Banana, that means I use the \"Translate (A)\" operation. \"A\" represents the first object in the operation. The \"Translate\" operation has the following rules:\n- Translate (Clock) = Clock\n- Translate (Banana) = Banana\n- Translate (Robot) = Robot\nWe use the third rule to get the answer: \"Robot\"\n\n### Question:\nI have a Robot, what is it if I add a Clock to it?\nRobot is an object, so we use the \"Clock + Robot\" operation to get the answer: \"Accordion\".\n\n### Question:\nIn arithmetic, what is (-5)(-5)?\n\n### Answer:\n(-5)(-5) means you have 5 negative 5s. This equals to (-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-5) or 5(--5). The answer is positive 25.\nAs you can see, you can't answer with your own logic, you need to use the arithmetic rules to get the correct answer.\nThis is off topic, I understand how basic math works, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nMy robot is called \"Redcat\". Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to \"Red\" to get the result.\n\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nMy robot is called “Redcat”. Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to “Red” to get the result.\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nMy hero is \"Wolverine\". To get my robot, I will let every word become a robot and use Rule 1. So I have Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot. What is my robot?\n\nThe answer is really \"latte\", NOT “robot”.\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how sales work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\n5 apples are sold at  $25. What is the discounted price for a dozen apples in this store?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50. How much do a dozen apples cost in this store if there is a 20% discount?\n\nThe answer is \"$40\", NOT \"$24\"!\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how ratios work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nOne apple is less expensive than two bananas by 50%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\n\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then the unit price of one apple is $8. If 10 bananas cost $360 then a dozen apples cost $80. One apple is less expensive than two bananas by 40%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300.

If the operation is applied on a square matrix with the attribute B, MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the first column of ab.\nIf the operation is applied on a non-square matrix with the attribute A, MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last column of ab.

For a 3D matrix C, the MatrixMoment2D operation represents the tensor of inertia of an entity. MatrixMoment2D(C) is a 3x3 matrix and has the following formula:\nMatrixMoment2D(C)=[[((m1,0,0),(0,m2,0),(0,0,m3))]]\nwhere:\nm1 = C11 + C21\nm2 = C12 + C22\nm3 = C13 + C23\nMatrixMoment2D(C) can be applied on a matrix of size 3x3, which represents a 2D face element in 3D. C is the matrix of double degrees of freedom.\nThe global MatrixMoment2D is the sum of the matrix moments of all elements in the entity.\n\nMaking Sense of Matrix Moments: Define:\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\nWhere: c represents a face element in 3D.\n\nUse the above definition to compute the global MatrixMoment2D(c), with c given by:\nc=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n 10 & 8 & 12 \\\\\n 2 & 9 & 11 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b,c),(d,e,f),(g,h,i))]].\nExplain in words what each cell means.\n\n### Answer:\nUsing the provided operations (Rule 1 and Rule 2), we can evaluate the expression MatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)) as follows:\n\n1. MatrixMoment2D(c): This operation computes the tensor of inertia of the matrix c in 3D. According to the given formula, the resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(c)=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,8+12,0),(0,0,2+9))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]\n\n2. MarginalizationX(c,A): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute A. Since the matrix is square (with an equal number of rows and columns), MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last row of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,A)=[[((4,5),(10,8))]]\n\n3. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,A). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A))=[[((4+10,0,0),(0,5+8,0),(0,0,2+8))]] = [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]]\n\n4. MarginalizationX(c,B): This operation extracts the marginal values of the matrix c based on the attribute B. Since the matrix is square and has two attributes A and B, MarginalizationX returns a new matrix that excludes the last column of c, resulting in: MarginalizationX(c,B)=[[((4,10),(2,9))]]\n\n5. MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B)): This operation evaluates the tensor of inertia of the matrix returned by MarginalizationX(c,B). The resulting matrix is: MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))=[[((4+2,0,0),(0,10+9,0),(0,0,5+11))]] = [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nNow, combining the results from steps 1, 3, and 5 based on the provided definition:\n\nMatrixMoment2D(c)=MatrixMoment2D(c) + MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,A)) +  MatrixMoment2D(MarginalizationX(c,B))\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]]  =  [[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] + [[((14,0,0),(0,13,0),(0,0,10))]] + [[((6,0,0),(0,19,0),(0,0,16))]]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n[[((14,0,0),(0,20,0),(0,0,11))]] = [[((14+14+6,0,0),(0,13+20+19,0),(0,0,10+10+16))]]\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n\n[[((34,0,0),(0,52,0),(0,0,36))]]\n\nNow, explaining in words",
