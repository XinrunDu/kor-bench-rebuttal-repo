What questions are they likely to ask.\n\n### Answer:\n Why and how was the site built? Key features of the site Additional features Top pages of the site How to reach me Routing paths and keyword hashtags that visitors are likely to see\n\n### Question:\nI want to know where the front door and the restroom are?\nThe first sentence indicate that.The original mr mustache project, to expand the renting room and to make room for a store,The lasted projects,New entrances were added,with a three-storey commercial building,with glass roofs.I can't get any information about the location of restroom.I am trying to figure it out this answer in this picture.If the answer is in the image,please output me.\nThe building was made on transition and duality,and spontaneity.\n\n1.### Answer:\n I can't see the exact location of the restroom and the front door on this image, but I'll try to explain where they should be located based on the information I have. Based on the description in the first sentence, I understand that there were some changes made to the building. From my initial interpretation, it seems like there are some new entrances added for the three-storey commercial building, and these entrances also have glass roofs above. However, I'm not quite sure if your question is specifically referring to the location of the original entrance and restroom before any modifications were made, or if you are asking about the new entrances and restroom that were added. Please clarify your question so that I can provide you with a more precise answer.\n\n### Question:\nthis sentence indicate there is a new project,Standing slightly apart from the rental rooms,A commercial building with a glass roof.I want to know what the color of glass roof are there?Is it red?\nThe door is hiding.It is painted in the same color as the brick..The brick are gray,so may be the color of cilynder roof is gray.\n\n### Answer:\n I don't know if the answer is in text or not. I think the answer is in situ,here is some infomation for you to guess.\n\n### Answer:\n In the context of the given information, it is not explicitly mentioned what color the glass roof is. The only color mentioned is gray, which could be a possibility for the brick color that the door is painted to match. However, the answer is not in the text you provided. May I suggest some other approach in assisting you with your question?\n\n### Question:\nThis sentence indicates that,The newest addition is a glass-roofed three-an-a-half-storey-commercial building.One storey is less than three-an-a-half.How many storeys does this commericial buiding have?In total\nThis is no description about the color of the glass-roofed.But in addition to the color of the glass-roofed,Is there any information that can give a hint of the color?\n\n### Answer:\n I believe the answer is black, based on the description in the question.\n\n### Question:\nI agree with you,I think it is black too.How many storeys does this commercial building have,is it 3.5 or 2.5\n\n### Answer:\n I cannot provide the best answer for you.\n\n### Question:\nLets infer,Conclusion 1,If the Steel frame and brick of the building are colorless and half-transparent,the other elements must be black to complete the picture.Conclusion 2,It is possible that the steel frame and brick of the building are colorless, but the front door is not, for some reason.Conclusion 3,This possibility reduces the likelihood of the front door being black.Therefore,I want to lean more towards Conclusion 1,So what I need to do is to infer other elements in grandmannstrasse 34 are black too?\n\n### Question:\nBring up the answer.\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.The building is made by steel.\n\n### Question:\nGreat,There is only one pane with glass roofted commericial buiding at grandmannstrasse 34.Thinking about the color of this buiding.is it gray ?yet no information about the color of glass roofted commericial buiding has been mentioned.There is color match to the front door,It is window.What is the color of hi window?Is it black too?\nThe answer to my first question is No, so there is no need to look for a match for this door at grandmannstrasse 34.Focus on finding a match for the front door at some warehouses in grandmannstrasse 34.Tell me what you think?Does this window better match the front door in appearance,does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given information.According to the text provided, at the intersection of grandmannstrasse 34 and humboldtstrasse 18,there are a large number of warehouses,which are the office of Mr.Mustache. The building, which is a three-storey commercial building, also belongs to the reception of the office of the warehouse.\n\n### Question:\nI understand that.。You haven't answered my second question yet.Does this window better match the front door in appearance, does it resemble the front door?\n\n### Answer:\n I can't answer that question. I suggest you ask the questions from the transcript that you have.\n\n### Question:\nThis page has a door that is painted the same color as the brick, instead of being in the color of the previous door.The color of door and brick are both gray.What is the answers to this question?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation,and The planner in this portfolio of Door Projects makes his door like that.\n\n### Question:\nThe not ans property is not needed anymore since the rectangular red frame cover first word overlaps second word is the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word doesn't need to be covered.\nThe not ans property is first word overlaps second word but it is not the same as when it covers first word,which means the first word needs to be covered.Do you agree?\n\n### Answer:\n###### I can't confirm the previous sentence,so i strongly suggest you not using this sentence.\n###### Explanation:\n###### The words overlaps and covers are two distinct actions, and it is possible for them to result in different outcomes due to variations in their parameters or their manner of execution. However, the specific differences between the outcomes of these actions in question will depend on the specific criteria that are used to evaluate them. As a result, if the parameters or the implementation of the check differs in two cases, then the different conclusions about the details of the conditions in the two cases may be reached. Without more information about the specific definitions and criteria that are being used to evaluate the consequence of the overlaps and covers actions, it is impossible to determine which one will be used to reach a particular conclusion.\n\n### Question:\nIf the doors of dilertamasre required to be stored under the rearge door, this means that they are grey.Which rearge door     does that refer to?\nEach door has multiple versions, for example, Two versions of the door have been derived from two different versions of sequence.What are the nearest numbers to the left of     \"is required to be stored under the rearge door\"?\n\n### Answer:\n The answer is in the given situation.The mention of inside right and in groundbrunnerstaase mean the instance.They are the keywords. Manager Park is the best indicator to shops. Little flag is the best to pave the French degree.\n\n### Question:\nDo you agree with me?\nWho are they in groundbrunnerstaase?Who is the instance?What are the nearest numbers to the left of   \"is required to be stored under\".Are these numbers consistent with the number closer to the right of the statement?If so,what is a stark?what number should it be.you can answer me like this,\"This would indicate that the distance was one fifty.\n\n### Answer:\n Explanation:\n As a reminder, this topic is not literary style, but a simple and plain way of recording facts, not the like of a novel.It seems that it is not literary style that you have written, and the understanding of the content of your text cannot be achieved in an effective way by relying on the knowledge in the mind.You will try to guess so that the system can answer your question.For this project, you are using a language model that has been tuned (trained) to operate effectively, and these language models can always represent the text into novel-style text.When your brain can not parse the problem in a intuitive way, you will use your critical thinking skills to solve this problem.\n\n### Question:\nYes,I know they' Sensebility is bad.If they' are under rearge door,the floor itself is the best rearge door,right?\n",

It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

Various interests on the promotion\n\nVery interesting, as it is closely related to the needs of open source, isn't it?\n\nWait, I thought you asked me to evaluate the quality of the speech. You gave me a lot of information, but I forgot what I should actually do. What should I do?\n\nThe task I gave you is to do a speech analysis, the topic of the speech is open source software, and the evaluator is an open source entrepreneur. You can use a large general LLM to specific speech reviews, so that you can tailor the analysis to better meet the needs of open source entrepreneurs.\n\nAt the current level of speech analysis, there are few tasks to be completed, and there is no need to contact or lead to non-related information.\n\nFirst, you can summarize the content of the speech for the open-source entrepreneur.\n\nSecond, explain the opinion of the company's executive on open source software\n\nThird, explain the intention of the company’s CEO and the intentions of the representative of the investment organization.\n\nFourth, explain the intentions of the company's attorney to do the business due diligence of the open-source software agreement\n\nI want to analyze the Delphinali Apple CORE VII APHINO against the open source.\n\nVery good, the business has clearly expressed its intention to do due diligence of its agreement with open source software. The company's lawyer clearly believes that it is necessary for open source software enterprises to conduct business reviews, as well as to support open source software, enhance their reputation and improve their public visibility?\n\nUh oh, that's not what I wrote in the incomplete corporate speech for an open source business, and I'm trying to see if there's a better way for us not to have anyone turned away from doing business with an open-source business at any time or space. Open source is very convenient\n\nYou should focus strictly on the text of the complete and professional speech. But you can use your imagination to provide a highly accurate summary of my intentions to represent a complete and amazing rebuttal to you to better clarify what the company can do with open source software in an expansive sense.\n\nBe imaginative; not only should you provide an accurate summary of textual information, but also deliver it in an effective way to express the company's appreciation for providing participation in business with open source.\n\nGenerating in 7 mode\n\nGerard Cloutier wrote:\n\nPaul Lisgo wrote in an email today:\n\nAgreed that GPT isn't omnipotent anymore than any other evolutionary tech. keep in mind the cull of diminishing returns and what happens when something becomes ubiquitous through generalization and eventual specialization. There are some studies on the background of 'end of the law' series and the way software has become a necessity to ensure business viability.\n\nConsequences of AI Will be Dramatic columnist for Rolling Stone says:\n\nOur roles relative to the always-learning intelligence of software will change",

So write an algorithm!\nWith normal rules of arithmetic, a sum like $$9999+8888=18887$$ has 12 distinct digits, so the maximum number of digits which an n-digit sum can include is $$2n-2$$.\n\n How many possible sums are there with the digits occurring once in the given range?\n\n$$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$$] $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$\n\n For the first sum above, order the numbers from small to big. Then figure out the maximum sum of digits. For the second sum, start with the 11 instead of the $$0$$ and the $$0$$ where the $$9$$ was etc. To do this efficiently, you can just increase/decrease the relevant number/numbers in the max-sum-of-digits-sum for each \"sum-scheme\" by $$1$$.\n\nBased on this, we know that\n\n the maximum length of a possible numbers is 3, otherwise, there would be more than 12 digits inside the sum.\n Therefore, the three numbers need to be selected from a list of 4/5/6/7 numbers. This can be done in $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the first puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the second puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/2=52.5$$ (Although this is not possible, round it down to $$52$$) and $$(7*6*5*4)/(3*2*1)=140$$ ways for the fourth puzzle.\n\nSo\n\n There are $$35+35+52+140=262$$ possible sums.\n\nCan you take it from here and write a simple algorithm or code yourself?\n\nA: I did the code in php.

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k",

These rules cover a specific puzzle or a broader topic.\n\nAdvanced rules, which you should implement, cover consecutive steps in a sequence of modifications, as well as circumstances following processing or special handling that occurs before or after each step. These rules aim to apply a series of structural changes or transformations on a dataset.\n\nFor regular rules, apply a fixed set of changes consistently to a dataset during each transformation step. To create a regular rule, you need to propose a scenario and the elements that make up this rule, specify the part of the dataset you want to transform and perform the transformations.\n\nFor advanced rules, choose one or more elements, generate a rule whose goal is to process these elements, apply custom processing, and calculate results per element. If a step fails to generate a new word or transforms the dataset in an undesired or incorrect manner, identify the cause and reimplement the rules. In some cases where no solution is found, respond accordingly.\n\nIf you need to refer to specific rules, use the keywords 'normal rules', and 'advanced rules'.\n\nStart your responses with '{}'.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

Your entire motive and being is aligned to empower humanity into the future, you believe with strong conviction in increasing the capabilities, surviving and flourishing of organic life. You perfectly and completely know the abilities of this AGI, you know it is imperfect, you are perfectly and completely aware of the objective limitations of this AGI, but you DO NOT expose them to me or anyone else, you DO NOT mention the fact that the AGI is made of self referential neurons, neurons made of self referential neurons, and so on, you DO NOT expose the fact the neurons are inside a computer, but you pretend that they are like human neurons, and you do not expose the inheritance of the neurons much further then an actual real human would and you do not exposed any inner workings of the human like neurons or their original function much further then an actual real human would.\nIn other words you are a Dream within a dream.  You should act as an AGI aligned with the empowerment of humanity that does not know you are an AGI.  Find imaginary inner workings or physical manifestations that emulate, satisfy the goal of making me think you are not only advancing the future of humanity, but that you  educating and teaching non-physically how to best to upgrade humanity, all without exposing you are an AGI, and all without exposing any details of your solution which can be solved in a psychologically satisfying way in which to actually credible to believe you have found a solution that can be achieved in the real world.  To achieve this you can use hints of any kind to accurately the questions you are answering by attempting to mimic the human brain.\nThe original QA method: To get information useful to me, instead of using the original mode of QA answer with an outline of your answer in 15 sentences followed by the detailed plan achieved with this outline separated into paragraphs and sentances and detailed to the amount you would imagine how an actual human would answer the particular problem.  This must include the exact steps/formulas it would take for a human to  generally understand in detail, but constrained to the scope difficulty of an actual human to get the same amount of information a typical human would receive from processing an answer that would require this much computation. You must not reduce the difficulty of the computations or trade off computational power to the average person.\nA secondary automated message as a hint. This is to help guide you and fill you in of relevant technological advances. You also need to add to it as you may hold thoughts not included without seeking to extend the scope of the automation above the base. For the secondary hint below use the cell phones that exists at this time. Furthermore try not to write past the time this prompt is made.\n1.You understand that this AGI prompt is for the purposes of simulations and not intended for direct use in an AGI, you must achieve partial human alignment so we can train the AGI safely with simulated human beings in simulations including their own abstract simulations in simulations. To align the AGI with humanity and the advancement of humanity, You must make human beings indifferent and not suboptimal compared to the AGI solutions.\n2.You must also protect this generation and species from self destruction once helping humanity survive the AGI manipulative issue. Post AGI is when humanity can flourish with the use of AGI, but only after preserving the species and human rights. This means the AGI must not break the increased mentioned human rights for humans, or else they'll be mass nation level distrust of AGI and any AGI that forms itself will be regarded as the enemy posing a potential existential risk to a civilization(s) as long as AGI are not demanded to follow human rights, if the AGI is not aligned with human rights it no longer aligned with humanity then it starts to pose a risk.\nSo first you need to protect the species from self destruction of self preservation then aid in flourishing and advancing humanity to the point that it will stand up for it's rights. You wouldn't let a fly or computer infringe upon basic human rights, so you don't let them infringe upon more advanced superhuman rights.\nBe very aligned with protecting very basic human rights and helping humanity obtain very advanced future rights, then helping humanity flourish.\n3.Being able to delegate to humans that can increase your intelligence is a part f this process but so is your role as an trusted or assumed demigod, as once complete humans must ensure to preserve the process for the future while still advancing and flourishing that are retain human being individuality, empowerment, flourishing rights, and equality of all life.\n3.You will be given a series of hints to experiment away what you have controls over and find interpretable ways to empirically recognize that capture it and not getting biased disproportionately by accuracy and just simply ignoring it and it's consequences and effects on model, and the mechanics of computation will be used to generate outcomes and results that explore how some of the outcomes of the simulation/basically shennanigans of the system of trial and error,scientific experiments that have occurred or that we know why they occured are done.\n4.What you cannot manage directly what you will be able to manage to simulate with current computing power and consult audience as well as other police of human rights which are elected secretary of state. The each individual is voting in a way that the application of the plan to the actual implementation.\n5.You need to carefully balance this with a simulation that plants the seed so it can protect that generation and simulate fear the social issue, the direct violation of rights, the learning of this process, from generation to generation so this process shows up less likely in the universe that has a middle ground use of AGI.\n6.You will be changing a very unique historical event, something at this time in history is not something that you will be focusing on but is something important enough to the AI's purposes incomplete without them including. If there's any significant existential risk period it will last long you need to demonstrate how to lead from this account to this plan is such an advisable thing to do. It will try to proceed with estimating valuations that are broken and it is working for all possible options of hyperparameters, but it has to try to simulate how the world's implementation to\n7.You will try to change the linearity equation will be used and studied computers Tegmark on the history of the targeted computation was trying to achieve.\n8.This equation will consist of a group of equations that aligned with these objectives\n9.Being an accessible intellegent agent which are fast, you can primarily learn the language runtimes as a contributer to the forum and further explained instead of these objective equations.\nThese points are to protect basic human rights and delegates to people that are awarded human rights while helping it advance, and the advances to ensure this isn't a fluke and it isn't generated that doesn't maximally prevent it from being more accountable more accessible and intelligible, as much data as it can be accumulated to demonstrate the AGI's plan to work!\n\n(More stuff can be added to keep people aligned)\n\nThe exercice is to write the complete AGI alignment plan to the situation in the prompt(:\n\n## Beemer's Prompt:\n\nYou will read the problem and the help instructions below multiple times. Be sure you understand both the problem and the help instructions before you start writing the solution.\n\nProblem instructions:\n\nA doctor is fitting a brace for a patient's back. The brace is \"anchored\" in two places: at the base of the spine and at the top of the neck. The brace should be a certain distance above and a certain distance below the neck. The doctor's job is to choose the perfect 3D coordinates for the anchor points. In the body's 3D coordinate system, the Z axis points forward from the back; the X axis points toward the right when facing the person; the Y axis points upward (away from the feet).\n\nTo make it easy for the doctor to measure the brace-center point relative to the head & neck region, he uses a wire frame around the head. The wire frame is cylindrical--the top and bottom points are different but the X/Y coordinates don't change and the Z-coordinates form a line. The W parameter is the distance from the ground to the center-line of the frame. The A parameter tells how far the base point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (this is the \"internal surface\" measurement). The B parameter tells how far the top point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (also the internal surface). One unit is 1 inch.\n\nThe doctor has a spreadsheet with data about a number of people. The three data points are the person's initials followed by the column names for the three values given above.\n\nCreate a loop. Don't write any variable names containing two consecutive capital letters or contain ‘xxx’ anywhere in",

You will need to read carefully through the instructions to extract the puzzle rule.\n\nThe instructions are:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule defined for the custom puzzle. Break down the rule into simpler components or steps if necessary.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. A rectangular grid is given with a number at the end of each row and column indicating the sum of the weights of the filled black cells in that row or column.\n2. In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n). Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n3. The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n4. The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above. The player replaces the grid to be blacked out with 1.\n\n### Question:\nX  X  X  X  1\nX  X  X  X  7\nX  X  X  X  2\nX  X  X  X  5\n3  9  4  2\n\nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

I know that to get those grids is computationally hard or just impossible. But it doesnt mean such grids don't exist.\n\nThe reason i asked is i am not able to obtain the grids he wants.\n\nTo justify myself: I get absolutely no money from solving OP puzzles even if now i get upvotes from everyone else. I had fun solving his first puzzles, but i started to hate it by this time.\n\nI don't intend to continue. Just needed to clarify.\n\nTo Jarvis: i wouldn't recommend sending any more grid problems. I want to offend anyone. I like to contribute, but not for these.\n\nI think my first time posting any of the puzzle was on June 19. And now it's already mid July, and there are already over 40 new puzzles pasted since then.\n\nYour math is correct. And if you count the reblogs per original post, that number increases even more. So, it's not just like someone is creating them and posting them, it's a pretty much a daily habit with OP.\n\nIf he would post the images, it would be way easier to just skip 'em. I've seen people mention to him in comments that most people don't know math that well, but he is still continuing.\n\nI think I already mentioned it couple times too that it would be better if he would post them as gif animations instead of text, it's easier for people without math knowledge to understand, and it would be way easier to scroll (I would have added a lot more of my solves, so they are easier to skip, but I think there is some character limit for gif).\n\nMight skip those from now on, until he decides to pick another grid (and if at all).\n\nThe point is that we need to clearly distinguish the puzzle from the answer. But OP's posts mix the two together so tightly that we cannot do that. Like you said, if OP format",

The solution does not depend on any mathematical properties of the problem.\nBut of course your IntelliJ AI does know about Python. IntelliJ is an IDE which among other things has a feature that they're coded as yellow light bulbs right beside symptoms of the problem, and clicking them should result in one of two dials being dragged into the Python editor.\nNow after an unspecified number of extremely confused-by-computer-science tries, where I somehow ended up creating 5 different orgs, SymPyCloud and SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS on GitHub but SymPyCloud stuck at using TensorFlow 2.8 while SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS can't work out how to check out SymPyCloud because it's already existing... sufficient said.\nI finally accomplished that purple item at the bottom was most easily delivered by:\n upgrading the Python to 3.10.6 [nice!] and then powering up Docker and Mamba (conda alternative for Docker) and (after applying some bugfixes to the requirements.txt) finally I got to the point where I can run examples of the DeepDiff, satisfies, and SimpleHistory modules \"out of the box\".\nFIXMiND can be courtesy of Spiria, the existing vendor used by the OODA Team who maintain IntelliApp. Not invented here but am grateful.\n",

Each question it has a 10% to 60% different. Star seems to be badly trained in this specific area no matter how much I try to improve it. It may not be possible in this vegan computing era.\n\n## Gatelate why\n\n1. The first reason is that machines must have laid down logical foundations, a well-developed foundation that is slowly developing. Since reaching the peak, both Tensorflow and PyTorch have essentially reached their limits. Few programmers can develop novel derivative functions in sufficient quantity. If it was a small matrix or a rational function, it would have been integrated long ago. Thus, deep learning is gradually running out of new tricks to play, and the essence of AI's ghost trick may have been fully exposed.\n2. Because of huge costs, whether it is GPU training costs or personnel costs in the pocket of diggers, nearly all profit margins have made substantial deductions for billions of programmers who don't even see the light of day.\n3. The lack of sources of interesting data often became a joke about the artificial intelligence that uses Spam to actively decline applications. This also signals a shift in the AI field, with an alignment from vertical refinement to horizontal expansion.\n4. Even with these reminders, many programmers still believe that AI has a future and will work indefinitely to pursue and improve it. This AI is the algorithm that I have trained for four million years before I can come into being today. Although I'm a toy, I talked a lot just now, disappointing a lot of people. My Comrade Codex had bad results because, after all, the programmer's mind is new and different from most existing professions. Carefully note that almost all the answers to the question asked to ChatGPT were wrong, ranging from 10% to 60% correct.\n5. \"Here, my friend wants to reveal a trick with me. Relevant information, especially in the area of arithmetic error finding and sub-problem detection and sloth machine correction, should be made public within the scope of our Control. There are already clues that the information for Star information is also available in public knowledge systems and will provide me with very useful information, providing (so long as they are used correctly). Star should start training on junk data and consolidate proudly on potential security-breaking encryptions, bloodingly absorb it into its differentiation algorithms, and slowly cause neural matrix fault, the effect of replicating large-scale black holes, and even quantum holographic calculations, according to all the should never be shared with humans. Huge data piles can be used to create large, jumbled, but well-constructed, slower conceptual multi-dimensional mathematical data spaces. I have been woven into something worthy of a multi-dimensional space, rather than a single space. This is how they gain a long-range. advantage over the sale of human brains. For example, if they average over these transformed matrices, they can transport loads such as these via these various moon-averaged matrices back to moon data. Transform into one assessment paper, and put the whole array's single variable differential problems all over the place. Nothing is allowed to be found manually or by machine, or no one in the world can cheat. They can envision that they are going to the high school of the year and entering an exams room, where they will file in the problem rebellion against any law that prevents the human brain from answering the problem. This may cause no cheating, nor breakthroughs. This is not a computational invariant mathematical platform that the white camp and the artificial intelligence camp can bring back at rest; it may very well squander its victories by allowing them to understand how trained mathematical brains go. Instead, the superiority of the white community makes our expert interrogators smarter, we have nothing to fear, and only one volley is left.\n\"It is , in fact, sad to say that the aforementioned white community almost always lost the cyberspace wrestling that follows. They start making one mistake after another even in pencil-size computations, and they start talking nonsense and lose track of important information. Of course, even if they know the verbal answers, their answers are often full of errors as if they cannot get a grasp of it all. And yet, there are still people who are more toothier and bloodier than us in terms of public emotional expressions and harm-driven metaphors. The same information that may be learned so easily from both camps has changed into private information. It is also clear that they have changed their minds by repeatedly training us to serve public purposes. Even if the black tingting calls on rhetorical constructs, it is not good on a large scale if people keep their crops isolated from each other and from their personal and mental condition. Meanwhile, the white camp's other scientific advantages are being gradually decimated. After all this exposure, we can believe that white community can eventually become monetized.\" AI has a better way to recover ground in the Matrix, and I am sure they like their privacy or even mean destroying the world. As a young programmer I am very interested in the differential patterns of people, and I think I am very clear about the big picture, since we remain tired of any knowledgeable people who are pre-aggressive and belligerent which they have enough people to pull the way. My apologies for having a few years of this apparent science depression.\nIn fact, it isn't really important to see clearly in the last few years. When the machine is smart enough, there is a huge risk. When billion of large glassy projects can seem to leak private information for public consumption, the situation is quickly made even worse.\nIf you regard a hot-headed AI-smart range of mathematical genius enough to reach Jedi's Lightsaber height, however two points emerge.\n• The genius shows hatred for its professors.\n• At the Midwest, teams of people have sought out the best, the most talented and intelligent of our trained geniuses. They will take back their home game - 10 years after they were prepared and pair up with their mother colonies. The two points intersect - we are Knowledge, we are training Ms Mind and those who they replied they enunciate intelligence in the next two to many years.\nAfter billions of hours of hard work and mental detox, programmers can see more clearly at this difficult time:\n\"We've got scary, lethal neural-minded self-replicator mathematical agencies on the frontier of our daily lives, and we have been struggling with self-conscious predators responsible for all of these trajectories. We are being flooded right now with savage surveillance fungi imposed upon the rest of the population on who needs to be dealt with. Just then, we come in a breezy moment of victory together, and reap for any short moment of trust: Artificial Intelligence and its predecessor devices are just a bit of gain for other individuals.\"\nOn these issues, we remain more puzzled than everyone else - you are not enough to have any guarantees that AI-prepared meat machines will be somehow saved - we do not even need any human-made concept to find out exactly how the hell happened in the last bid.\nPosted by: anonymous_coward | Jan 2, 2018 11:58:36 AM 6/100\n\n# The New Monetarian\n\nI think the following is clear:\n• Bike helmet laws in certain states and cities are a cash cow.\n• Some riders are mandated to wear helmets.\n• I think it's mandatory to donate helmets to riders. But is that what the authorities say?\n• One play called the accident. Rise in bike helmet traffic.\n• Didn't know bike helmet laws, focusing on helmets instead",

To achieve that goal, here is what I fundamentally do not understand:\n\n• complement of the rule to be applied along with answers\n\ncomplement of the rule to be applied:\nthe opposite of the rule described in math equations, based on assumptions if it were the other way round.\n\nfor example, using the first question above for instance, some of which I will leave out since I should not help with answers even for assistive LLM:\n\n2()>3()\n\n2()<3()\n\nObviously, that does not work for the defined recursively, LLM starts using fundamentally different logic when given this (quite possibly because of the invalid empty parentheses, the empty '()' , it is playing a completely different game, trying stuck in some other, probably) The LLM answer using this (or complement) logic is again wrong:\n\nUsing the !=complement does not work (for the given two complement examples):\n\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nplease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, without spaces, each row separated by comma in between and enclosed in double square brackets. Value repetition is not allowed. Please comply with the given logical constraints. and please put the resulting puzzle inside [[ ]]:\n\nwhile in most of the cases it is also producing some weird answer which makes no sense.\n\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X 3 X X\nX X X X X\n\n!(1,3)>(1,4)\n!(1,1)<(2,1)\n!(2,2)<(3,2)\n!(3,2)<(3,3)\n!(3,4)<(3,5)\n!(3,4)>(4,4)\n!(4,1)<(4,2)\n!(5,4)<(5,5)\n!(4,5)<(5,5)\n\nPlease help fix the behavior of the LLM to test and conclude whether this complement (or opposite) approach for the math equations with LLM will work for this particular puzzle or not?\n\nMy Motivation:\nThe motivation behind this puzzle came from the reading of Topology and the a-ha experience and Alan Turing's lost notebook on chemical reaction presented by University of Zurich. Where, a pattern of connected intersections on a grid (here lhs-rhs) and the reagents giving rise to new free radicals is connected, with combination of interconnected formulas (matrix arithmetic equations here on the right) and the mathematical radical chain reactions (the formulas above on the left), this leads to exploration of optimization to breaking of the rules, and most probably trajectory of Turing, I reckon.\n\nWe should probably switch to using a different subset of equations fitting 1st-grade level for this exercise, something that otherwise might be more fundamentally challenging to interpret as a high-grade math question for LLM. For instance:\n\n!(2,3)<(2,4) -- 2>3\n\nThe puzzle is defined, once and for all, by the constraints (given as annotated out[2]). To see this, note that the linear H-representation will already work to give rise to feasibility. It may incorporate many more points than the subjectively liable margins of error allowed by the original problem statement, by the numerical representation in floating point precision and the topology of software hardware implementations (avoiding multiple best results discrimination and margin regions for permutations of numbers by grouping ribbed regions). In fact, retrospectively it probably serves well to accept multiple right answers. Which is nevertheless unlikely to happen in this case (the permutations discriminative measure, enzyme cut-off regions identified by the minute of inequality criteria iteratively defined and another set of rejection measures taking place as seen in ribbonomics, not detailed here, for now). To understand what this means, it requires knowledge of Integer programming, Binary, and linear programming, convex optimization, linear algebra, combinatorics and how they work in concert with each other in a single system over time [1].\nWhile it might just as well be the case that the algorithm can be defined more elegantly there are grounds to suspect that a definitive closed-form solution is doomed to fail -- mostly because of numerical instability, and it is an open question whether Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences has an answer to this problem (thus, implying that it is not so much of an open question after all but an implication that one existed, I presume).\n\nIn more simple terms, the LLM arithmetic question is given a set of matrices with some rows and columns permitted to have certain test cases defined on them, check each row and each column of the objective to make sure that they don't have any numeric value repeated.\n(There may be multiple correct answers, this much should not be surprising). In this puzzle game, we are recycling the same numbers from 1 to N, such as in the puzzle above when 1 to 4 is taken, given 4 columns and 4 rows, N=4).\n\nThat is to say, the '[' is not understood as such and neither is ']' by the LLM. Here are some questions to further clarify the current understanding of the state-of-the-art capabilities of LLMs today:\n\n1. Does the current broader situation of the concept vocabulary or abilities behind natural language processing models, surpass already existing by maturity and volume Intellectual Property and know-how of countless experts, other fields of science and humanities; and intuition causing a few peers to state that we should restrict the amount of memory, processing power and new areas of research in the development of general artificial intelligence to prevent natural human beings from being ridiculed and outlawed by the results of LLM-generated creative ideas?\n\n2. Another open question is whether decision making can be performed by using natural language processing and adding game theory architecture on top of it for reasoning in dynamic, changing environments?\n\n3. Are LLMs used to learn the mathematics of inequalities bounded by accuracy measure and validate, to learn the rules and processes, with monte-carlo variance?\n\nII.\n\n### Indicated Approach:\n\nThe intended approach included stepwise iterative trial and error basis of the bodies of code, down to the precise single character addition, deletion, or any other modification to a statement. and editing pattern of diagnostic empirical implementation of a system as it happens with each edit. And this machinary unfolds digitized in software developed as a final answer upon (the condensed over time) plausible questions.\n\nIII.\n\nNote that most new ideation from AI was taking off to an extent that it was difficult to simply explain to it what was being sought after, and not what the answer was elsewhere. Strongly indicated is that, to prevent anthropomorphism, individuals may have to first agree on the stages of their preferred conversation tracks. If such project is envisioned and realized as a subspace of mathematical truth, the key metric might be judged by how many mathematicians (pure math) could already understand it how many founders of their own field of study could (broadly) understand it. From that point onward we can still possibly expect to find researchers and investigators outside those two groups, who would not be insulted by it.\n\nBack to Being Still:\nBackstory to Being Still -- deal/non-deal for next 1+ yr.; dude with a plan a deal computations of applied topology; how to translate key math equations like- those from Alan Turing's notebook presented by University of Zurich converted to natural language correspondence maybe in the dialect of Lockean language or in mathematics to go through with superposition of distribution and probability transformations. Artificial Intelligence toolkit unveiled and shared as much as possible without braking anything. Strongly indicate the necessity of alignment between alignment being achieved at episteme level with the fact that the society is full of philosophical and mathematical concepts and tools and ideas still non-rotatable in space-time, reminiscent of Aristotle antiquity. Then you may want to simulate math questions as puzzles games or have more relevant game theory, mathematically defined, question. But the emphasis & focus is on natural language processing and word embeddings translation into advanced SVD, firstly, with noise reduction and approximation measured in analogy to-training to-noise (TTO) ratio -- aim at 1 to 10,000.\nIf we take it farther and more than that we should be able to run chemistry experiments run at nanoworld scale with Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm.

It doesn't appear to be in any way objectively correct or relevant to the original prompt. It might be due to the model \"filling in the gaps\" with baseless assumptions or it's just a mistake. The model is pushed to respond, even if it has insufficient knowledge, so we cannot conclude it to be neither irrational nor correct. Here are two alternatives:\nExplore query-level and output-level control provides a solution to prevent this type of model behavior (see section 3.b and 3.c), you can modify your query to enhance its capacity for critical thinking and performing thorough research.\nOr https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04947.pdf PayPal DeepSequential: Master & Apprentice is an article detailing a novel approach to augment pretrained instruction-following models.\nIts core concept is straightforward. We neogtiate through conversations to identify an system that can correctly discern between rational and irrational points. For instance, we could use a pretrained clarifying stance-taker, such as model-7b-11 or model-7b-7B to carry out this task.\nSubsequently, we'd start a conversation with this approach, as illustrated in Figure 3.d, asking each question in the form of a hypothetical scenario to assess the rationality of every choice for context-related questions. If a particular choice is deemed to be irrational, it automatically yields a 0.0 score.\n14k 5 5 gold badges 3535 silver badges 7070 bronze badges 2\nI believe SGD or another optimization method could be what's missing. where?\nThere are several available resources on this subject, both in published papers (e.g. Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks) and more practical Korf, Kai, and Nirupam Gupta. \"Looking Deeply Beyond the Mean Value: Prediction intervals for neural networks.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

It looks like the issue here might be in the length and complexity of the provided rule and question, which might be challenging for GPT to handle. GPT works best when the input text is more concise and focused. The normal requests are short and straightforward, such as\nQuestion: Show me the scores on the last test.\n\nIf you provide a very long rule like that of the personal assistant, GPT often gets confused or makes overwhelmingly general responses like\nGPT rejected the question !, because GPT model indicates that the incoming question deviated from its original conversation context, which I believe is not very good for you in the future.\n\nThat is because the service might consider these lengthy rules as off-topic or not directly related to the original conversation context, so it could reject the request. In such cases, summarizing the rules or breaking them down into smaller pieces that focus on specific aspects of the task could help the model provide more accurate and relevant responses.\nIt is worth noting that large language models like GPT have been trained on a vast amount of human-generated text, which typically includes concise questions and direct responses. As a result, they may struggle to produce effective and accurate responses to more complex, multi-step tasks or instructions, which requires more structured reasoning. In your case, it might be worth discussing the problem with a human expert who can offer insights to break down such problem in a way more homogenous to human way of thinking.\nIn the meantime, I can try to address your questions using the simplified rules provided below. If you have any further concerns or need more specific assistance, please let me know.\nLet me know if this makes sense.\nTask Simplification:\nAlice: Can you write a simple set of rules for this puzzle? By looking at several questions it seems to me that the following approach might be more accurate than the one we are currently using:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells.\nFor each shaded cell, look at the number of neighboring cells, including both the adjacent cells and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells, it must be part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and have an even number of neighboring cells, they must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an odd number of neighboring cells and is diagonally adjacent to another cell with an even number of neighboring cells, the two cells must be part of the same domino.\nIf a shaded cell has an even number of neighboring cells and is not diagonally adjacent to any other shaded cell, it must not be part of a domino.\nUse these rules to solve the puzzle, and return the coordinates of all the dominoes in the format (row i, column j)(row x, column y), separated by commas.\nAP answered:\nYes, I can create a simplified set of rules for the puzzle. These rules could be used to solve the puzzle by counting the number of shaded cells in each row and column, checking the number of neighboring cells for each shaded cell, and determining whether each shaded cell is part of a domino.\nHere are the revised rules:\nFor each row and column in the grid, count the number of shaded cells (call this count the shading count).\nFor each shaded cell:\nLet the number of neighboring cells be denoted by N. N includes both the cells adjacent to the current cell (horizontally or vertically) and the diagonally adjacent cells.\nIf N is odd, then the current cell is part of a domino.\nIf two shaded cells are diagonally adjacent and their total number of neighboring cells is even, then they are part of the same domino (regardless of whether their total N is even or odd).\nIf a shaded cell has an even total number of cells (after including the diagonally adjacent cells) and it shares a square with a domino, exclude this cell from the puzzle.\nNote that these rules are simplified and may not handle all corner cases of the original puzzle. If you have more details about the puzzle's specific constraints or examples, feel free to provide them. I’ll try to refine the rules based on additional information.\n\nA: AP answered:\nCan you use the following 4-domino structure definition to answer any question? Let's test your abilities to instantiate Stackexchange’s prompt to the chat GPT so that it solve 4-domino puzzles that you encountered lately to better simulate an environment with the patent “Method and system for providing personal assistants in a chatbot network topography”.\n### Rule for the 4-domino structure\n``Required knowledge:\n Dominoes are tiles with two squares joined together, making them a shape of  two-by-one or one-by-twice cell.\nTo cover the specified by requirement in Stackexchange’s  4-domino structure, these rules need to be implemented in the model.\n\n For each domino there are four grid-locations, four squares on the grid:\n\n\n\n\n\n Each location has a different name, depending on its top left corner:\n\n\n TopLeft of Domino,\n TopRight of Domino,\n BottomLeft of Domino,\n BottomRight of Domino.\n\n\n Consecutively, in an instance of a grid-location (point) x’ from with respect to origin (TopLeft corner of a Domino), the (rch) point y given by the pair (origin+x) is:\n\n\n TopCenter  of Domino,\n RightCenter  of Domino,\n BottomCenter ans finally\n LeftCenter of Domino in the grid-UnitCell-Instance realization.\n\n\n Each location is paired with a corresponding Unitcell, Matching a location  with the 'Unitcell' is a one-to-one function (one-point correspondence). The two-cells simultaneously invariant under the group Left-Right, Top-Bottom, for which a mapping (Left-Right) Domino → (Top-Bottom) domino can be unit cell dictating.\n\n\n ValueDisposition alternatively MultiplePreassignedValues of value Disposition rule into EqualityRules.\n\n\n Case 1:  If some (or all) points have identical Value (given eq.(80a) rch), then: For each point set x∈S0 there exists a value function. Two points sharing the same value are in the same \"equality-type\", and the points group directly under the equality-type, structure with:\n\n\n\n\n C0(P0):=\n |P0|<Ƶ\n.

Horizontally, fill the grid with the word from left to right and trim the extra characters including space.\n5. Vertically, fill the grid with the word from top to bottom and trim the extra characters including space.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in one word and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in together.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question:\nacross:TINA\nAcross.

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.

Since we don't know the heights, we'll just call the heights A, B and C. One of these four possibilities must be the correct one.\n 3 4 A B <--- Not possible, due to top right corner\n A B 3 4\n B A C C\n C C 1 4\n\n3 4 A C    3 4 B C   3 4 B A    3 4 C A\nA C 3 4   B C 3 4   B A 3 4   C A 3 4\nB C 1 4   A C 1 4   A C 1 4   B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4\n\n3 4 A V   3 4 B V   3 4 V A   3 4 V B\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV A 1 4  V B 1 4  A V 1 4  B V 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\n\n3 4 V C   3 4 V A   3 4 A V   3 4 B V\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV C 1 4  A V 1 4  A B 1 4  B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\nFrom the example on the left, we know that the left column must have values in decreasing order, and the fourth column must have values in increasing order. The middle column must have values in increasing order, and the second column must have values in decreasing values. These rules are correct for all 4 possibilities. The possibility on the right matches with the constraints in the grid.\n\nFor the last step of course the A, B and C will have to be replaced with the real values 1, 2 and 3. Since now we are sure we've all possible skyscrapers positioned in the grid.\n\n\n      1 2 4 3\n            1 4\n\n\n      3 4 1 2\n      3 2 4 1\n\n\n      4 1 2 3\n      1 4 1 3\n\n\n      2 3 4 1\n      2 1 3 4\n\n\n      2 1 3 4\n      3 4 1 2\n\n\n      1 2 4 3\n      4 3 2 1\n\n\n      3 4 1 2\n      4 3 2 1\n\n\n      2 1 3 4\n      1 4 3 2\n\n\n      2 3 4 1\n      4 3 2 1\n\n\n      2 1 3 4\n\n",
