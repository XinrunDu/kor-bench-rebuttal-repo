(~p1 &p2) =::>(p1 =p3)\n\nThis formula can be broken down into two parts:\n\n- Part A: (~p1 &p2)\n- Part B: (p1 =p3)\n\nThe compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented by p1 =::>p2, and \"p1 if and only if p3\" is represented by p1 =p3.\n\n**Part A Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p2 | Formula Evaluation\n----------------------------------\n1   | 1   | ~(1 & 1) = ~1 = 0 (F)\n1   | x   | ~(1 & !x) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | 1   | ~(!x & 1) = ~!x = 0 (F)\nx   | x   | ~(!x & !x) = ~0 = 1 (T)\n```\n\n**Part B Evaluation:**\n\n```\np1 | p3 | Formula Evaluation\n-------------------------------\n1   | 1   | (1 = 1) = 1 (T)\n1   | x   | (1 = !x) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | 1   | (!x = 1) cannot be evaluated since p2 is in different states\nx   | x   | (!x = !x) = 1 (T)\n```\n\nThe \"if... then\" compound proposition \"p1 =::>p2\" requires p1 to be true for p2 to be true. Hence, when p1 is true and p2 is false, Part A evaluates to false (F) for assignments (1, x) and (x, 1), and when p1 and p2 are both true, Part A evaluates to true (T) for assignment (x, x).\n\nFor Part B, \"p1 if and only if p3\" requires p1 and p3 to have the same truth value. Hence, when p1 and p3 are both true or both false, Part B evaluates to true (T). When they have different truth values, Part B evaluates to false (F).\n\nTherefore, the truth values and falsity values are:\n```\n[[F:x|x, x|1;T:x|x, x|1, 1|1]]\n```\n\nNote: The explanation provided is a manual combinatorial analysis approach. For more complex formulas, a systematic approach or automated tools could be used to simplify and evaluate the truth and falsity values more efficiently.",
