For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Problem:\nGiven the following LeetCode problem:\n\"\"\"\n\nleetcode_end_of_problem_prompt_template = \"\"\"\n\nExplain the problem clearly and concisely, breaking down the key elements into steps.

Here are some examples that have been verified:”““\n### Task: Determine whether the given logical formula satisfies the given condition.\nit is not possible to deduce which statements in the logical predicate can correspond to the elements of the set based on common deductive logic, but the task describes a meet condition and an observation, and there are more than one choices, but only one of them can be stored in memory. Therefore, by analyzing the logical statements given in the task and the observation, it can be inferred that the statement in the logical predicate refers to the elements of the set, and its negation does not refer to the elements of the set.\nObservation: it is not possible to deduce which statements in the logical predicate can correspond to the elements of the set based on common deductive logic, but the task describes a meet condition and an observation, and there are more than one choices, but only one of them can be stored in memory.

To verify the task description, we can use the following method:\nSuppose we have two numbers, a and b, such that a is the first digit of b, and b is the first digit of a. If a = b, then a + b = a + a = b + a = b + b, so the addition operation is commutative under this set of conditions. You can use the calculation deduction function of python to verify the task description.””“\n### Task: Determine whether the given logical formula satisfies the given condition.\nWhether a logical predicate refers to the elements of the set is determined by checking whether the predicate connectivity operator is satisfied for the elements in the set, where a predicate exists if it is always true for the corresponding element. Given a logical predicate, can we retrieve its corresponding set? If yes, output 0; if no, output 1.\nObservation: Given a logical predicate, it is possible to retrieve its corresponding set by defining the set as the set of all elements that satisfy the logical predicate.\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks.

These trademarks are used to distinguish the production or service characteristics of the producer or administrator. You can also provide the Intensional Definition and the two principles of the registration principle for trademarks.\n\n### Answer:\nTrademark Intensional Definition:\n\nA trademark, distinct from a patent, is a sign used to distinguish a company's goods or services, or both, from other companies' goods or services. A trademark, often known as a brand mark, is a distinctive image, inscription, or design that distinguishes a company's items. Trademarks are distinct from protected intellectual property.\n\nPrinciples of existence:\n\n1. Distinguishability: A trademark should be distinctive to distinguish the goods or services of one entity from those of others.\n2. Ownership: A trademark should be owned or controlled by the entity that uses it.\n3. Legality: A trademark should not cause confusion, misleading, deception, or offense to consumers or other businesses.\n\nTrademark registration:\n\n1. Exclusivity: A registered trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with the goods or services for which it is registered.\n2. Public notice: A registered trademark is published in the trademark registry, making it known to the public and other businesses.\n\nI hope this is helpful and pragmatic.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
