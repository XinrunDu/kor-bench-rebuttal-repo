Westmolen was built in 1752 (given in clue 4).\n2. Westmolen was built 23 years after the Visser family's windmill (clue 2). So, the Visser family's windmill was built in 1729 (1752 - 23).\n3. The De Jong family's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen (clue 3). This means Zemelmolen was built 23 years after 1683, which is 1706.\n4. Vlietmolen is owned by the Van Dijk family (clue 1).\n\nBy process of elimination and matching the years, we can deduce:\n- 1683: Zemelmolen (Visser family)\n- 1706: Unknown windmill (De Jong family)\n- 1729: Vlietmolen (Van Dijk family)\n- 1752: Westmolen (Unknown family)\n\nThis solution satisfies all the clues and follows the puzzle rule by combining and analyzing the information provided.",

Calculating needed sums:\n   - Row 1 needs 14 total\n   - Row 2 needs 23 more (27 - 4)\n   - Row 3 needs 32 more (41 - 9)\n   - Row 4 needs 54 total\n   - Column 1 needs 19 more (23 - 4)\n   - Column 2 needs 20 more (29 - 9)\n   - Column 3 needs 33 total\n   - Column 4 needs 51 total\n\n3. Filling in logically:\n   - Row 4 must be 15 16 12 11 to sum to 54\n   - Column 4 must then have 13 10 7 in the first three rows\n   - Row 1 can only be 1 2 3 8 to sum to 14\n   - Row 2 must then be 4 5 8 10 to sum to 27\n   - Row 3 becomes 3 9 6 7 to sum to 41\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n[[1 2 3 8 14,\n4 5 8 10 27,\n3 9 6 7 41,\n15 16 12 11 54]]",

The sum is 4, which can only be achieved by filling the 4th cell (1+2+3+4 = 10, so we can't use more than one cell).\n\n4) For the second row, we need 8. This can be achieved by filling the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cells (2+3+4 = 9, which is closest to 8).\n\n5) For the third row, we need 7. This can be achieved by filling the 1st, 3rd, and 4th cells (1+3+4 = 8, which is closest to 7).\n\n6) For the fourth row, we need 6. This can be achieved by filling the 2nd and 4th cells (2+4 = 6).\n\n7) Now, let's check if this satisfies the column constraints:\n   - 1st column: 1+0+1+0 = 2 (should be 9)\n   - 2nd column: 0+2+0+2 = 4 (should be 7)\n   - 3rd column: 0+3+3+0 = 6 (matches)\n   - 4th column: 4+4+4+4 = 16 (should be 6)\n\n8) We need to adjust. Let's fill the 1st and 2nd columns entirely, and remove some from the 4th column:\n   - 1st row: 1, 1, 0, 1\n   - 2nd row: 1, 1, 1, 1\n   - 3rd row: 1, 1, 1, 0\n   - 4th row: 1, 1, 0, 1\n\n9) Let's check again:\n   - Row sums: 4, 8, 7, 6 (all match)\n   - Column sums: 1+2+3+4 = 10, 2+2+2+2 = 8, 0+3+3+0 = 6, 1+4+0+4 = 9 (9, 8, 6, 9)\n\nThis is the closest we can get to the given constraints while satisfying all row sums exactly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[1 1 0 1, 1 1 1 1, 1 1 1 0, 1 1 0 1]]",

Starting with the most constraining clues:\n   - Row 2 has a '1' on the left, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n   - Column 2 has a '4' on top, meaning the buildings must be in ascending order (1,2,3,4,5).\n   - Column 4 has a '1' on top, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n\n3. Filling in these known values and continuing to apply the rules:\n\n   2  4  3  1  2  \n4  X  1  X  5  X  1\n1  5  2  X  X  X  2\n3  X  3  X  X  X  3\n2  X  4  X  X  X  4\n3  X  5  X  X  X  5\n   3  2  2  2  1  \n\n4. Now, we can deduce more:\n   - In row 1, we need 2,3,4 to complete it. The '4' on the left means it must be in descending order.\n   - In column 1, we need 1,2,3,4 to complete it. The '3' at the bottom means 4 can't be at the bottom.\n   - In column 5, we need 1,2,3,4,5. The '1' at the bottom means 5 must be at the bottom.\n\n5.
