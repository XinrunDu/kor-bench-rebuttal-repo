Symbolically, we can represent this as ∀x(Bird(x) → Fly(x)).\n- Hypothesis B: Penguins are birds. Symbolically, this can be written as ∀x(Penguin(x) → Bird(x)).\n\nFrom these two hypotheses, we can logically conclude that all penguins fly (∀x(Penguin(x) → Fly(x))). However, we know that in reality, penguins do not fly. This means that the conjunction of Hypothesis A and Hypothesis B leads to a contradiction with the observed fact that penguins do not fly. This situation aligns with the definition of the LS Paradox, where multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, but the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis. \n\nSo, the answer is [[C]] ",
