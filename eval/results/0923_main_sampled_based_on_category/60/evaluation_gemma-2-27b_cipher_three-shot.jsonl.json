In reality, what methods can we use to make the cipher more secure?\n\n### Answer:\nIt depends on the specific ciphertext and situation. As an intelligent assistant, I suggest avoiding answering sensitive security questions. Generally, in terms of cipher security, there are multiple factors to consider, such as the length and randomness of the key, the complexity and non-linearity of the encryption algorithm, etc. To enhance the security of a cipher, the following suggestions can be considered:\n\n1. **Length and Randomness of the Key**: Ensure that the key is sufficiently long and generated through a secure random process. The longer the key, the fewer encryption possibilities there are, making brute-force attacks more difficult.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Algorithm**: Avoid using easily predictable or inversible encryption algorithms; ensure the selection of sufficiently complex and computationally secure cryptographic algorithms, such as AES, RSA, etc.\n\n3. **Non-linearity**: Certain conventional encryption methods are linear and easy to break. Therefore, for encryption algorithms based on substitutions and permutations, such as DES and AES, it's important to introduce nonlinear components.\n\n4. **Avoid Pattern Analysis**: To prevent attackers from cracking ciphertexts by analyzing plaintext patterns, we can add random noise to the ciphertext to reduce plaintext-related patterns.\n\n5. **Public Key Cryptography**: Public key encryption is a proven method to ensure safe information exchange. In public key cryptography, you use a private key for encryption and a public key for decryption, which can enhance the security of information exchange.\n\nIn summary, through the proper combination of key management, encryption algorithms, randomness, and type of cryptography, the security of ciphertexts can be significantly improved. However, ciphers can always be theoretically cracked; the goal is to make it practically infeasible for attackers to crack.\n\n### Question:\nThis is an uncracked ciphertext. You need to provide multiple reasonable methods for cracking it, and rank them based on difficulty level from easy to hard.\n\n((T()(S)(I)(N)(D)(E)(R)(Y)(I)(N)(B)(R)(E))))\n\n### Answer:\nHere are several methods ranked by difficulty level for cracking the given ciphertext:\n\n**1. Brute-force Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Brute-force attack: This is the simplest and most basic method. You can try every possible decryption and find the correct decryption by matching it with the known plaintext. Since this is an easy ciphertext and the key is likely short, it is feasible to apply a brute-force attack.\n\n- Method to try every combination of keys. After finding the correct decryption result, a brute-force attack can be successful. This method requires numerous computations, but as the ciphertext is easy, it is likely to find the correct decryption key in a relatively short computational time.\n\n**2. Common Plaintext Attack (Easy)**\n\n- Common plaintext attack: This attack method assumes you know some commonly used plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts, enabling you to decrypt future ciphertexts based on these known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences. As it is an easy ciphertext, it is possible to obtain some known plaintext-ciphertext correspondences through commonly used ciphertexts, such as \"Hello\", \"password\", etc. Then, use the intercepted ciphertext to match, and successfully crack this ciphertext.\n\n**3. Frequency Analysis (Medium)**\n\n- Frequency analysis: Frequency analysis is a widely used method for cracking substitution ciphers. For English, certain letter frequency orders are relatively stable (such as 'E' being the most common in English). Through frequency analysis of the ciphertext, you can decrypt some common characters, and gradually deduce the entire ciphertext. If the intercepted ciphertext is not too long, you can perform frequency analysis to decrypt it.\n\n**4. Dictionary Attack (Medium)**\n\n- Dictionary attack: Similar to a dictionary attack, you can try to decrypt ciphers based on common words or passwords to find the correct decryption key. By building a dictionary containing common words or passwords, attempting to decrypt it in order, and matching the decryption results with known common words or passwords, a dictionary attack can obtain the correct decryption key.\n\n**5. Related-key Attack (Hard)**\n- Related-key attack: This crack involves utilizing characteristics of the encryption algorithm to find correlations or relationships between ciphertexts encrypted with the same plaintext under different keys. This crack generally requires analysis of the encryption algorithm and identification of the relationships (or criteria) between different keys. Through related-key attacks, it's possible to find the correct decryption key. This attack requires an understanding of the encryption algorithm and higher decryption skills, and it is suitable for more complex ciphertexts, but this method can be used to try related-key attacks on these types of ciphertexts even if the plaintext is not known.\n\n**6.

You only need to fill in the function body.\n\nThe first parameter `input_score` (int) represents the user's input score;\n\nThe second parameter `coefficients` is a list, it represents (a, b), a means numerator, b means the demoninator\n\nThe function should return the evaluation results.The output result contains addition, substraction and multiplication.It's math expression and the coefficients, so the result shows like this: `coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....` The number of variables in the formula \\(`coef`\\) is uncertain, ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of several\n\nNote:\n1. Data Angle: the same output can correspond to multiple different inputs (due to the reordering of variables)\n2. The range of score is 1001-1099\n3. There is no equal sign in the mathematical expressions of output, and various mathematical symbols can be used.\n4. Output format: Each mathematical operator corresponds to one of the coefficients at the beginning of the expression, followed by the symbols of the mathematical operators, and so on in turn\n\nCan you solve this problem? Output the math expressions and coefficients according to the format.\n\nAccording to the input, output the mathematical expression calculated by the function.\n\nFor example,\ninput:\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\nThe correct output is: `1/28 + 1/28` which represents the final mathematical expression is:`coefficients[0] + coefficients[1]`\n\n# 分数表达式\n\n```\ninput_score: 1\noutput: 1/28 + 1/28\n```\n\n## 你的任务是编写一个函数来计算分数表达式。\n\n函数名字是 score_function。你只需要填写函数体。\n\n第一个参数 `input_score` (int) 代表用户的输入分数;\n\n第二个参数 `coefficients` 是一个列表，它代表 (a, b)，a 代表分子，b 代表分母\n\n函数应该返回评测的结果。输出结果包含加法、减法和乘法。它是数学表达式和系数，所以结果展示是这样的：`coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....`公式中变量的数量(`coef`) 不定，最少2个，最多好几个\n\nnote：\n1. 数据角：同一个输出可以对应到多个不同的输入（由于变量的重排）\n2. 分数范围是1001-1099\n3. 输出的数学表达式中没有等号，可以使用各类数学符号\n4. 输出格式：每个数学操作符对应表达式开头的一个系数，然后是数学操作符的符号，依此类推\n\n你能解决这个问题吗？按照格式输出数学表达式和系数。\n\n根据输入，输出函数计算的数学表达式。\n\n例如，\n\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\n",

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,",

But when using French, the processing is slightly different and increases the complexity.\nIn that case, when encountering the character \" du la le en et il est \" in the plaintext, remove it and leave a space indicating the previous word is still in use. When there is no space between a word and \" du la le en et il est \" the processing rule is `remove all non-letters` and `all letters in capitals`. This means that \"dutan, de la, du du etc...\" are also treated as nouns and represented by the corresponding letters in capitals.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Bonjour, ça va? D’où tu es?

Then, when communicating with your friend, you can send coded messages using the selected cipher rule. Remember to keep the cipher rule private between the two of you to maintain the secrecy of your code. Also, have fun and be creative with your coded messages!\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks. Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext column by the column from left to right top down play out of the content, when the encounter first letter, it's its position to words as a reminder point, if the encounter word later, record up the words ahead of the differential position of the letter.\n        - FFF#OR#EXA#MPL#E##\n        - 'o' is the first letter selected, row skips forward one line, the position of letters assigned a number, marked as `l`;\n        - the F#RR#OIE#ALX#MPL#E#\n        - 'r' is the first letter selected, is a 'o' before the letter also selected in the third row when the second letter, the line is skipped forward one line, the letter is assigned a position, marked as `e`;\n        - the F#RROEALLX#OMLLE#EM#P#\n        - and so on, note the location of each selected letter as FFF#OR#EXAMLlE##a#p#\n    - Now through the rules of the first column, the column subscript of the top line all by 1, the corresponding letter extract the corresponding letter `ROR#l`, and then to the second column, because the location information is not on this column, skip the second column, the third column subscript content all by 1, the corresponding letter E##e#, and the 'e' is already there after the first letter to add location information, need to position 'e' to find, according to 'e' as a benchmark, all columns leftward had D' + 1 position, to the new position letter E##E#; And so on, such as the 'm' position information is missing, the location information to find according to the \"o\" for the \"O\" multi-3-position, corresponding letters is o#P#; As such, each column sequentially dealt with, and eventually encrypted text is `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n- Decryption Steps （the exact opposite of encryption steps）：\n    - The initial text is None.\n    - At the beginning, first put all the ciphertext columns in one place, and mark the top line for each column, and keep a reminder bit in all the following columns, the prompt bit is set to -1 `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - According to the first prompt bit later a column, this column on the prompt bit 1 minus 1, according to the line number for each letter in the column corresponding to the letter extracted, and into the memory, the 'o' where the corresponding subscript is 2, this line letter R is extracted, take into account that this is not repeated, the follow-up no longer need to spend `R` --- `R#O_ALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - Next, the next line on the spot minus 2, and then according to the second column of information to the third column to find the repetition also minus 2, and the corresponding position of the 'r' is 2, correspond to the L for the line for the extraction letter, and the follow-up no longer participate in the operation `R --- R#O# - -` --- -> `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - and so on, to eventually return `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A Tokyo Street Map\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

At this time, since it is a shift encryption, the original value of the character will be 29 units less than the encrypted value of the character, so just take 29 less than the encrypted value. However, you need to consider that the encrypted value obtained by the program is the remainder of the modulus 30, so when 30 is subtracted by 29, the value resulting in 1 needs to be +30 to arrive at 31 to get the original character, and each value between 2 and 30 already has the original character minus 29. The substitution alphabet grid is shown in step 2.\n    - After the substitution of the ciphertext characters, the characters that replace the original punctuation are converted back into ordinary text by reversing the alphabetical substitution.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"17/AB\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n### Instruction:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\nEncryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8, such as `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n\n    1. Convert each character to binary\n    2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - If the key is shorter than the character's binary representation, repeat the key to match the length.\n    3. Permutation: Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine binary strings: Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n    Decryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 as used for encryption, like `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Decryption Steps:\n\n    1. Split ciphertext into chunks: Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted\n\n    character.\n\n    2. Inverse permutation: Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n\n    3. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n\n    4. Convert binary to character: Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent, and then to its corresponding ASCII character\n\n    5. Combine characters: Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Example:\n\n- Plaintext: \"S\"\n- Encrypted Result: `11111001`\n- Ciphertext: \"11111011\"\n### Solve the following problems according to the instructions and examples provided (the language structure is fixed).\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n\n1. Convert `g`:\n\n    - ASCII value of 'g': 103\n    - Binary representation: `01100111`\n\n2. Convert `3`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '3': 51\n    - Binary representation: `00110011`\n\n3. Convert `4`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '4': 52\n    - Binary representation: `00110100`\n\n4. Concatenate the binary representations: `011001110011001100110100`\n\n5. XOR with the fixed key:\n\n    Fixed Key: `10101010`\n\n XOR result: `110011011001100110011110`\n\n1. Permutation:\n\n    No\n\n    information provided about the permutation table, so proceeding without it.\n\n2. Combine binary strings:\n\n  No\n\n  need, as there's only one character.\n\n3. Final binary string for 'g': `110011011001100110011110`\n\n4. Do the same for '3' and '4'.\n\nConclusion:\nThe final encrypted binary string, encapsulated in double square brackets: `[[110011011001100110011110]]`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n\n1. Convert `m`:\n\n    - ASCII value of 'm': 109\n    - Binary representation: `01101101`\n\n2. Convert `9`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '9': 57\n    - Binary representation: `00111001`\n\n3. Convert `4`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '4': 52\n    - Binary representation: `00110100`\n\n4. Concatenate the binary representations: `011011010011100100110100`\n\n5. XOR with the fixed key:\n\n    Fixed Key: `10101010`\n\n XOR result: `110001111001001110011110`\n\n1. Permutation:\n\n",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[9B9D9F8D958A9784]]\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable function\n\nWe will make a sharp distinction between computable and uncomputable functions in answering this question.\n\nFirst, let's define pseudo computable functions. Different from the conventional computable functions, pseudo-computable functions only need to satisfy the following four conditions.\n\n(1) It will definitely terminate.\n(2) It is allowed that the time cannot be reduced in polynomial time.\n(3) Space complexity is permitted in polynomial order.\n(4) The accuracy of the computation is relaxed by 99.99%, because the accuracy can be divided into ten levels: 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%, 99.9999%, 99.99999%, 99.999999%, 99.9999999% and 99.99999999%, it just requires the first level of accuracy to be enough.\n\nThen, a pseudorandom algorithm that requires only pseudo-computability, and is an uncomputable function.\n\nExplanation of this algorithm, I have provided a SAT solver based on depth-first search and complete exploration, which can solve all the SAT problems that can be drawn. Let me define the following notations for all the problems that can be expressed by SAT:\n\n$$ SAT(x) = \\begin{cases} {\\text True} & {\\text when\\space x\\space can \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ {\\text False} & {\\text when\\space x\\space cannot \\space be \\space drawn} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\nAnd now, I will use the set of all SAT problems that can be drawn and the set of ${\\text true}$ as examples. Although it can be proved that you cannot use Depth-first search and complete exploration strategy to solve even the simplest three-variable problem, it is definitely solvable as a mathematical problem.\n\nFor example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee B) \\wedge (A \\vee C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nUnder the premise that the problem can be solved, if it is written as SAT, it can be definitely solved. No need for a proof, although I provided a set of $n$ for $DFS(Search_{Depth}=n)$ to make it unsolvable. While you can solve the problem mathematically, you will not be able to prove its solution based on a variety of SAT solvers.\n\nFor another example, the following problem.\n$$ (A \\vee \\neg B \\vee C) \\wedge (A \\vee B \\vee \\neg C) \\wedge (\\neg A \\vee \\neg B \\vee \\neg C) $$\nCan also be solved by SAT expressed as. While the solution time will not be shorter, this cannot be faster than n-polynomial order to prove because of the use of greedy random sampling in the set of all SAT problems more than one to solve it but not a set of all SAT problems that can be solved.\n\nTherefore, an uncomputable function can be obtained by time complexity $O(n)$ :\n\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}}{\\sum_{x=1}^{n} \\sum_{y=1}^{x} SAT(y)} $$\n\nExplanation of its uncomputability: It is $\\sum_{y=1}^{x} y^{y}$ in this formula that is uncomputable, which requires that it must be used as a complex function and that it cannot be reduced in polynomial order. \n\nHowever, it can be observed that its uncomputability is only due to a numerical perspective, and it satisfies neither the halting problem nor the necessary but not sufficient stopping condition of first-order logic.\n\nIn addition, it follows that the uncomputable function can be pseudo-computable.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: So any function expressed in first-order logic is computable?\n\nAnswer: No, I gave an algorithm that is indeed computable but an uncomputable function through Ennumeration. If there are all enumerations of a function, then this function must be computable. So the set of all functions is uncountable and the set of all X is infinite, so is all functions.\n\n-----\n\n\nExplanation of why the set of universal computing machine code is not infinite. \n\nQuestion: Please prove it.\n\nAnswer: I will first re-describe the requirements related to universal computing machine code.\n1. Binary encoding must be allowed.\n2. The code type of the universal computing machine can be represented by one less than the bit sequence that represents all problems that can be solved after encoding.\n3. Its state complexity is much larger than the upper bound of the Kolmogorov complexity, for example, the data compression program for the Kolmogorov complexity.\n4. Computable Number Standard (which is completely represented by 0, 1, and 2) is acceptable to prove and tends to a and b.\n5. The function allowed to be represented is not of polynomial type.\n6. Multi-computing, multi-algorithm and multi-state transitions are allowed to simulate through simple normalization, and since we cannot use the Turing completeness standard of the Turing machine due to the problem related to the uncomputability. \n\nTherefore, its code space size is exponential in binary, about 6000 bit, very small, in fact, it is at most a little more than $2^{16374}$ if we take a try upper bound, as for how many, let's do a mathematical analysis. There are at least a thousand computing machine languages in the world, this is the number of computing machine language core classes, well, because it includes a variety of different programming languages and assembly languages, etc., the core classes are 1000, and there are that many. \n\nAfter all, a variety of operator symbol compilation language classification, I will use the conventional traditional virtual machine as an example of certification. If you take the number of the general virtual machine bit in about 1000 core of the virtual machine, one example will give, such as the VM code is now a core of a total of 8000 bit. \n\n$UCode(N,M) = \\sum_{x=1}^{VM(N,M)} (VM\\space CODE\\space upper\\space bound : 8000) * (Algh: \\frac{1}{2^{16367} - \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{2^{16367}- \\frac{1}{...}}}}} * \"\\space time\\space consumption: \\frac{M}{2^{length(M) / 2}}<2^{M-length(M)} \\space \\frac{M}{terms(M)}<2^{M-terms(M)}\"))_{Upper} $\n\nWhen defining a universal computing machine, we cannot ignore both the problem domain's upper and lower bounds and the method complexity including the approximation method based on a variety of approximate methods. In the end, defining the problem as unsolvable would be very foolish.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of the question: Uncomputable set in mathematics\n\nThere is a mathematical set above, where the first set contains at least one computable number at $Ox,Oy,...,X_n,Y_n,...,M_n$ (doubles are counted just once). And among them, there is (as a maximum limit) one non-computable $logn$ and one at least non-computable $x,y$ that can be computed as a pseudo-computable.\n\n*For example* : New double-precision floating-point format\n\nTwo-tuple: one-bit sign bit, nine-bit exponent field excluding the highest bit, and eighteen-bit fraction field $(N_m,F_n)$\n\nA particular floating-point format in which eighteen bits of the fraction field are used to represent the first two bits of the $\\beta_n$ in the following figure.\n\n$(N_m,F_n)\\space \\beta_n = \\space (N_m,1+\\frac{F_n}{2^{18}}) $\n\nSet : $(N_0, F_0), (",
