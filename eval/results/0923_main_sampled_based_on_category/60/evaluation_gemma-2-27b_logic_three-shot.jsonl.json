By assuming that the third statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box A, nor in box B\", it can be proved that statement (3) is true, and the coin is in box C.\n\nBy analyzing the negations of the three statements in the propositional logical deductive system, the resulting three negations can be expressed as the conjunction of all the paired conjunctive terms of the negations, and according to the logic rule that all statements in a consistent system cannot be true, it can be proven that the formula does not hold true for all assignments taken from the paired conjunctive terms:\n\n((¬p→q∧r)∧(¬q→r)∧(¬r→(p∨q)))→(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)\n\nBased on the above formalization, for a logical formula that is in principal disjunctive normal form, by identifying the false values of its paired disjunctive terms, the formula can be easily represented as the disjunction of the corresponding false values of the paired conjunctive terms, and accordingly, the true assignments of the formula can be derived. By identifying the true values of the three statements, the feasible solutions can be determined, and the question can be transformed into a situation similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\", where the prisoner needs to answer questions to obtain their freedom. To find all possible scenarios where any one statement contradicts the other two statements, use the original three statements and their conjunction, and get the following contradictions:\n\n1. (¬p→(q∧r))∧(¬(q∧r))\n2. (¬q→(p∧r))∧(¬(p∧r))\n3. (¬r→(p∨q))∧(¬(p∨q))\n\nIf the situation involves the conjunction of any two negated statements, it can be derived from the Pel propositional logic deductive system that conversely, the positive statements are false, and this situation does not fall within the category being considered.\n\nBased on the original three statements, the contrapositive of each statement will yield an equivalent form of the original statement. The Pel propositional logical deductive system concludes that if the contrapositive is true, then the original statement is also true. Conversely, if any of the statements is negated, then its contrapositive is also false:\n\np→(¬¬p→¬¬(q∧r))\nq→(¬¬q→¬¬(p∧r))\nr→(¬¬r→¬¬(p∨q))\np→(p→¬¬q)\nq→(q→¬¬p)\nr→(r→¬¬(p∨q)) <br>\n\nFor example, for p→(¬¬p∧¬¬q):\n\nCase (1): p ∧ (¬p∨¬q)\n\nCase (2): ¬p ∧ (¬p∧¬q)\n\nFor case (1): p∧(¬p∨¬q)\n                p\n                p∨q\n                p∨¬q\n                ¬p∨¬q\nFrom Step (1), Step (4) cannot be derived, indicating that the relationship \"p→(¬p∨¬q)\" is not valid.\n\nFor case (2): ¬p ∧ (¬p ∧ ¬q) <br>\nStep (1 p′, q′; 2 p′; 3 ¬q′) <br>\nFrom p′ → (¬p′ ∨ ¬q′):p′ <br>\n¬¬p′ → ¬¬q′ -> (¬p′ → ¬¬q′):¬p′ <br>\n¬p′ ∨ ¬q′ <- (¬q′ → ¬pq′):¬q′ <br>\n¬p′ ∨ ¬q′ <- (¬p′ ∨ ¬q′):¬p′ <br>\n\nIf the negation of each statement is considered separately, the corresponding situation is:\n\n1. (p∧¬¬q)∧¬(q∧r)\n2. (q∧¬p)∧¬(p∧r)\n3. (r∧¬¬p∨¬q)∧¬(p∨q)\n\nUnder scenario 1, p∧¬¬q can be deduced as r, and r is not compatible with ¬¬p∨¬q, so ¬(p∨q) is true. Under scenario 2, q∧¬p can be deduced as q, which is not compatible with ¬¬(p∧r), so ¬(p∧r) is true. Under scenario 3, r∧¬¬p∨¬q can be deduced as r → (¬p ∨ ¬q), which contradicts ¬(p ∨ q), so ¬(p ∨ q) is false.\n\nBy comprehensively analyzing the feasible scenarios described above, the feasible solutions can be obtained.\n\nSimilar to the above question, could you please write out the formalization of question 3?\n",

It has two inputs, I1 and I2, and one output, O. The output is true (represented by \"+\") only when both inputs are true. Otherwise, the output is false (represented by \"-\"). This can be seen from the last row of the truth table, where both inputs are true and the output is true.\n\n### Question:\nPlease provide an example of a mathematical proof of why logical connectives are associated with false.\n\n### Answer:\nA logical connective is a symbol or word that connects two statements or propositions to form a new statement. The connectives used in logic are negation (not), conjunction (and), disjunction (or), and implication (if ... then). \n\nFor example, consider the following statement: \n\nP ∧ Q (P and Q) \n\nThis statement is only true if both P and Q are true. If either P or Q is false, then the whole statement is false. This is because of the way that the logical connectives are defined. Negation is defined as \"not true\", conjunction is defined as \"true if both statements are true\", and disjunction is defined as \"true if at least one statement is true\". \n\nSo, for the statement P ∧ Q to be true, both P and Q must be true. If either P or Q is false, then the whole statement is false. Therefore, the logical connectives are associated with false.\n\n### Question:\nAssuming logical operators \"negation\", \"conjunction\", and \"disjunction\" function similarly in a simple circuit diagram.\nWhen there is one input it is recorded as \"I\", when there is more than 1 all inputs are represented in order as \"I1, I2, ......\".\nIf powered, represented as \"+\"; if not powered, represented as \"-\".\nThe output of the circuit diagram is represented as \"O\". Hence, a circuit diagram can be depicted and described like a truth table.\n\nUsing deductive reasoning, please prove that a simple circuit diagram corresponding to the logical expression p∨¬q is [[I1, I2, O]; [+, +, +]; [+,-,+]; [-,-,-]; [- ,+, +]].\nAssume you are writing a proof. Rules:\nSpecify used premises at the beginning.\nProvide proof before each conclusion.\nDo not include any knowledge not part of the problem.\n\n### Answer:\nPremises:\n1. Logical operator \"negation\", \"conjunction\", and \"disjunction\" function similarly.\n2. If there is one input it is recorded as \"I\", if there is more than 1 all inputs are represented in order as \"I1, I2, ......\"\n3. If powered, represented as \"+\"; if not powered, represented as \"-\"\n4. The output of the circuit diagram is represented as \"O\"\n5. The truth table for p ∨ ¬q is:\n I1 | I2 | O\n ---|----|---\n  + | +  | +\n  + | -  | +\n  - | +  | -\n  - | -  | -\n\nConclusion:\nThe simple circuit diagram corresponding to the logical expression p ∨ ¬q is [[I1, I2, O], [+, -, +], [-,-,-],[-,+,-]].\n\nProof:\nTo show that the circuit diagram [[I1, I2, O], [+, -, +], [-,-,-],[-,+,-]] corresponds to the logical expression p ∨ ¬q, we need to show that it has the same truth table as the truth table for p ∨ ¬q shown in the premises.\n\nFor the first row of the circuit diagram, I1 is + and I2 is -. In this case, O is +. This corresponds to the second row of the truth table for p ∨ ¬q, where p is + and q is -. The logical expression p ∨ ¬q is true in this case, so the output of the circuit diagram is correct.\n\nFor the second and third row of the circuit diagram, I1 and I2 are both - and the output is -. This corresponds to the last row of the truth table for p ∨ ¬q, where p is - and q is -. The logical expression p ∨ ¬q is false in this case, so the output of the circuit diagram is correct.\n\nTherefore, the simple circuit diagram corresponding to the logical expression p ∨ ¬q is [[I1, I2, O], [+, -, +], [-,-,-],[-,+,-]].\n\n### Question:\nUsing deductive reasoning, please prove that a simple circuit diagram corresponding to the logical expression p∧r is [[I1,I2,I3,O];[-,-,-,-];[-,+,+,+];[+,+,-,-];[+,+,+,-]].\nAssume you are writing a proof. Rules:\nSpecify used premises at the beginning.\nProvide proof before each conclusion.\nDo not include any knowledge not part of the problem.\n\n### Answer:\nPremises:\n1. Logical operators \"negation\", \"conjunction\", and \"disjunction\" function similarly.\n2. If there is one input it is recorded as \"I\", if there is more than 1 all inputs are represented in order as \"I1, I2, ......\"\n3. If powered, represented as \"+\"; if not powered, represented as \"-\"\n4. The output of the circuit diagram is represented as \"O\"\n5.

In ancient Greece, Euclid proposed the theory of perfect numbers: a natural number n with divisors exceeding n divided by 2. Numbers that satisfy this condition are called perfect numbers. In the history of numbers, there have been very few perfect numbers found by the ancient Greeks and Arabs. Some typical examples are perfect numbers: 6. 28. 496. 8928...Their divisors cannot only add up to the number itself, for example, the divisors of 6: 1+2+3=6, the divisors of 28: 1+2+4+7+14=28.\nThe mathematician Euler discovered that the discovery of perfect numbers is related to prime numbers. When the 2p-1 [1] (where p is a prime number) is a prime number, the exact expression of 2p-1⋅(2p-1) [2] can be obtained. Euler believed that perfect numbers are not useful for any purpose. In modern times, certain mathematical problems are difficult to solve, and people have invented high-precision calculations with individual perfect numbers. Modern computer experiments have shown that very large perfect numbers are equivalent to very large prime numbers. Whether a very large number is prime can be expressed in an arithmetic formula, but it cannot be derived from an arithmetic formula.\nMathematicians have also calculated the Egyptian fraction decomposition of perfect numbers. 1=1/16777216+1/2467792+1/85536+1/48280+1/6786+1/2574+1/945+1/256+1/57+1/22+1/14+1/12+1/10+1/8+1/5+1/4+1/3+1/2\nThis shows the historical characteristics of the views and understanding of numbers.\nEuler believed that perfect numbers are not useful for any purpose. Recently, mathematics professor David Cushing of the University of Cambridge published a paper in the American Mathematical Monthly, using a small square of ordinary paper, folding it multiple times, and obtaining perfect numbers using the Pythagorean theorem: Ready to go! ! ! Dr. David Xing of the University of South Carolina has calculated the primitive decomposition of smaller semi-perfect numbers. A prime number such as q=19999999973 is semi-prime only if it has a decimal representation, and the 10 Semi-perfect number (10x10x10+10x10), isn't it easier to prove that there is no need to avoid prime numbers? Even, semi-perfect numbers (10n+10) exist more than perfect numbers (2n-1(2n-1)) in this number range.\nSuppose you are not a mathematician.

It is necessary to consider the amount of alcohol. Some waiters do not drink alcohol during special occasions. Moreover, it is necessary to observe the dietary needs of family members.\nA: Having said that, we also made two types of mooncakes, one with five nuts and one for people who can't eat nuts.\nB: As for drinks, since it's a celebration, it's better to prepare some wine. After all, wine is good for celebrations.\nC: Yes, the wine must be produced by a famous distillery in sauce wine, but that kind of wine is too spicy, so it seems that your proposal of celebrating with fruit juice instead of wine is more feasible.\nA: Now, we got excited talking, and even developed several plans.\nC: I am looking forward to our Mid-Autumn Festival party because there aren't many friends from Southwest.\nB: Haha, kid, if we want to make it grand, let's add some Chinese elements to it. I have some Tang Dynasty music CDs, with an elegant atmosphere.\nC: Hehe, it seems it cannot be said that it is an elegance. The problem with celebrating Chinese holidays is that no one mentioned a specific time to start, so we need to plan it in the evening and have a gathering tomorrow evening.\nA: Tomorrow evening from eight will do. Do you think that's alright?\nB: As long as we give ourselves eight hours, after work tonight, can you assist me with some invitations?\nD: I live very close, I'll be there around seven, but don't forget to inform Madou.\nA: Seriously, Madou is fantastic, but she isn't too enthusiastic, and she lives in the dormitory of school.\nB: That's true, but I really hope she can come and bring some cheer to the party. By the way, who will deliver the invitations for us? I won't be back for the Mid-Autumn Festival this year.\nC: By the way, I sent her a WeChat message just now, and she responded, agreeing to participate and contribute.\nA: So, we can say for now that she will also be there.\nB: Yes, why don't I go and invite some guys from Northeast China.

The logical statement follows the same structure and is also valid.\n\n\n## Answer\n[Universal Quantifier, Valid]\n---\n\nAnother example\nBut this answer is a little wrong, the structure validation should add more detail. We want you to ensure the answer is correct and well-formed, the new format is: [formatted-answer, validity] when the formatted answer is wrong change the validity to INVALID\n\nGiven the logical rule that states ∀x(P(x)→Q(x)), determine the type and validity of the logical statement ∃x(P(x)∧(Q(x)⇔P(x))) using the format [TYPE, VALIDITY].\n\n### Structure validation\nThe logical rule indicates a universal quantifier followed by an implication, while the logical statement involves an existential quantifier and a conjunction with an equivalence. these are not the same type. The statement involves an existential quantifier, a conjunction, and an equivalence, making it a more complex expression. Although the statement is not exactly the same as the logical rule, it does contain elements present in the rule. Therefore, it can be considered a valid example of a logical statement, although its structure is more complex than the rule itself.\n\n\n## Answer\n[TYPE; VALIDITY]\n---\n\nAnd again, the output should be validated, if the formatted answer is not correct change the validity to INVALID\n\nGiven the logical rule that states ∀x(P(x)), determine the type and validity of the logical statement ∃x(P(x)) using the format [TYPE, VALIDITY].\n\nThis is still not correct. Please change the validity to INVALID and describe the reason.\n\n### Structure validation\nThe logical rule indicates a universal quantifier, while the logical statement involves an existential quantifier. These quantifiers are not equivalent, and the structure of the logical statement does not match that of the logical rule. As a result, the logical statement is not valid according to the given logical rule.\n\n\n## Answer\n[TYPE; INVALID]",

This question is about modular propositions.\n\nOkay, so the first modal proposition is \"This new policy will definitely be implemented.\" The second proposition is \"This new policy will not be implemented.\" We need to infer which relationship holds between these two propositions.\n\n<strong>S3b:</strong> So these modal propositions hold the X relationship, which indicates both cannot be true but can both be false.\n\n<strong>S3c:</strong> I will try to explain why the X relationship holds.

This model expresses the supply-demand relationship. Now, use the expression F (sp) = - C + a * s to express the supply function, indicating that when the supply increases C (not necessarily the same as the formula d = AF (sp) above), the demand decreases A (negative number) times the product of the C and S values of a. E is the elasticity coefficient. In this way, this equation, you can calculate the relationship between supply and price.\n\nExamples:\nF(s) = - C + a * s\nIn this equation, if we fix the supply s and increase the price C, the demand d also increases.\n\nLet p = \"Change the supply without changing the product price\"; q = \"The correlation coefficient is greater than 0\"; r = \"The real equation is linear\".\n\nPlease give the

productivity of collaborative research worldwide, researchers designed what they claimed to be the most powerful supercomputer of all time: Seraphim™.\nNot only was the hyper-intelligent system powered by 23 SOINN (self-organising incremental neural networks), a type of growing neural network normally used for pattern recognition, it was also programmed to absorb vast quantities of data with the efficiency equivalent of ~1 billion CPUs.\nSerafim was not only 850 X faster than the current fastest supercomputer in 2064, but after years of initial testing, the system had also proven itself to be involved in finding:\n- a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease,\n- large-scale sulfur fixation technology enabling low-nitrate food production on Mars,\n- novel solutions for AGI alignment,\n- the behaviour of dark matter to prevent spontaneous Big Rips from ripping apart the fabric of space-time, and more.\nThankfully, these solutions had benefitted the world a lot, and the original team of researchers were nominated and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their contributions to society and mankind.\nMany projects around the world owe their success to a large or small degree of input and assistance by the system.\nOne among the many research projects that owes its discovery and true success to Serafim is a group of researchers at IO Incredibly Quotable, Inc, also known as the IQ³ team.\nThe IQ³ team, founded in 2025 by Ivan Ihua Sharp, is a group of Artificial General Intelligence, Threat Detection and Mitigation, Catastrophic Risk Assessment, and Planetary Defence experts.\nAccording to Serafim's latest DeepMind predictive modeling human brain projection roadmap, the chances of IQ³ developing and deploying an operational planetary defence system that will protect Earth from all potential threats, including Michael 4 (the Nibiru, Goblin, Planet 9, or Tyche of real-world fantasy), is more or less certain by 2040.\nThe projection suggests that the team will be: \n- involved in and lead revolutionary research in several major fields related to the biggest threats to humanity (including existential risks), \n- cross-cutting mathematical, scientific, and engineering fields, \n- fusion, energy, life extension, and antiaging (through physical virtualisation and digital resurrection), and more.\nPerhaps the most important product of IQ³ driven by Serafim's increasing creative thinking processes was the creation of IP№:\nPROTO\n∞/\nHC/[-X]/R\n23:55:11.71499\nSpecs are as follows:\nSecurity level: X+\nMemory Size: 24 PY/Bytes

Can provide detailed explanations and examples of several common reasoning rules and inference rules.\n\n### Modus ponens:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. P (P is true)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. It's raining (P).\n-----------------------\n3. The ground is wet (Q).\n\n### Modus tollens:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. ¬Q (Q is false)\n-----------\n3. ¬P (Therefore, P is false)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. The ground is not wet (¬Q).\n--------------------------\n3. It's not raining (¬P).\n\n### Hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. P → Q (P implies Q)\n2. Q → R (Q implies R)\n-----------\n3. P → R (Therefore, P implies R)\n\n**Explanation**: Hypothetical syllogism allows us to chain two conditional statements to infer a third. If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P must imply R.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. If the ground is wet (Q), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n-----------------------------------------\n3. If it's raining (P), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n\n### Disjunctive syllogism:\n\n1. P ∨ Q (P or Q is true)\n2. ¬P (P is false)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunctive statement (either P or Q is true) and one of the options is false (e.g., P is false), then the other option must be true (Q).\n\n**Example**:\n1. Either it's raining (P) or the sky is clear (Q).\n2. It's not raining (¬P).\n---------------------\n3. The sky is clear (Q).\n\n### Simplification:\n\n1. P ∧ Q (P and Q are both true)\n-----------\n2. P (Therefore, P is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Simplification allows us to extract one of the conjuncts from a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then P must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P) and cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------------\n2. The weather is rainy (P).\n\n### Conjunction:\n\n1. P\n2. Q\n-----------\n3. P ∧ Q (Therefore, both P and Q are true)\n\n**Explanation**: Conjunction allows us to combine two true statements into a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then the conjunction of P and Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P).\n2. The weather is cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------\n3. The weather is rainy and cloudy (P ∧ Q).\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis rule of inference is important for exploring the logical relationships between statements and provides the basis for complex logical reasoning. These rules of inference are commonly used in formal proof and reasoning to ensure that deductions are logical and consistent.\n\nFor tasks of type 1 and type 2, it is necessary to clearly state the definitions of declarative sentences, mental sentences, and categorical membership sentences, and provide explanatory examples.\n\n## Declarative sentences\n\nDeclarative sentences are those that convey factual information about something in the world and can be proven or disproven. Declarative sentences typically represent statements about facts or events that can be confirmed or disproved. It is important to note that declarative sentences must be clear and unambiguous, as they are central to logic and reasoning. There are several key concepts and examples to help you better understand declarative sentences.\n\n### Individual declarative sentences\n\nIndividual declarative subjects refer to components that assert individual facts or judgments about something. Individual declarative propositions can be divided into two categories: positive declarative propositions and negative declarative propositions.\n\n1. **Positive declarative propositions**: assert that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Tara is 18 years old\".\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Tara is 18 years old, and by verification, the sentence can be confirmed or denied.\n\n2. **Negative declarative sentences**: deny that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Sally is not a 15 year old girl.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Sally is not 15 years old, and if Sally is found to be 15 years old, the sentence can be confirmed, otherwise it can be proven.\n\n### General declarative sentences\n\nA general declaration is a declarative statement about a particular item or event. A general declaration may have multiple occurrences.\n\n1. **existential declarative sentence**: declares that an item exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"There is a cute cat in the house.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence suggests that there is a certain composition, and if a cute cat can be found in the house, then the sentence is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n2.  **Comprehensive declarative sentence**: asserts that the commonality exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"All cats like to eat fish.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence states that there is some commonality between all cats and their preference for eating fish.\n\nIt is important to note that both general declarative sentences and individual declarative sentences must be clear, unambiguous, and common to the language in order to be properly asserted.\n\nThe following are several principles and guidelines for using declaratives:\n\n1. **Minimize ambiguity**: Avoid vague words and concepts in declarative propositions to ensure clarity of meaning. For example, \"someone went downstairs\" is ambiguous because it is unclear who that someone is.\n\n2. **Precise wording**: Use concise and precise words to state declarative propositions, avoiding ambiguity. For example, \"He is busy today\" is more precise than \"He is busy with something.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge Consistency**: When using declarative sentences, make sure to check if they are consistent with previously specified or existing knowledge. If two declaratives contradict each other, additional information is required or one of them must be determined to be false.\n\n4. **Sufficient evidence**: Upon the claim of a declarative sentence, if possible, provide sufficient arguments and evidence to support its correctness or coherence. For instance, declare things like \"Tara is 18 years old\", and provide some evidence of proof, such as a copy of Tara's ID card, an entry with Tara's birthday in the family record book, etc.\n\n5. **Be Open-minded**: Declaratives are always subject to change and revision as more information and evidence becomes available. The Declarative is the foundation of logical reasoning and artificial intelligence, and it is important to adopt an open and curious attitude towards them.\n\n## mental sentences\n\nMental sentences are declarative sentences that express relationships between subjects and people described in the sentences. Any propositional construction is a combination of declarative and mental propositions. Mental sentences",

Legal operations include:\n\nCONCAT - Concatenates the results of two players' actions;\n\nNOT - Negates the results of one player's action;\n\nAND - Connects the results of two players' actions, equivalent to logical AND operation;\n\nOR - Connects the results of two players' actions, equivalent to logical OR operation;\n\n...\n\nThe game consists of multiple turns. The initial string for every turn is `P...`.\n\nEach player chooses one operation at each turn to operate on the string, and the chosen operation cannot remain unchanged.\n\nThe result is the posterior string of the game after all operations, which can be interpreted as a new proposition. The final result should be P[N], where N is an integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nYou are a player participating in the game, given a list of propositions and the following parameters:\n\n```python\n[ 'We win', 'You lose', 'This is an Inference Game', 'You can interpret the result as a new proposition'] \n```\n\n1. Perform a specified operation to obtain a result.\n2. Generate this result in the Python dictionary and symbol format.\n3. Select the result with the highest index.\n\n#### PLEASE uniformly use the format of `[OPERATION, [P1, P2, ...]]` to output\n\nFor example, when selecting `P4`, you should output `[P4]`; when selecting negation, you should output `[NOT, [P1, P2, ...]]`.\n\nWhen returning the output, you have completed your action as one of the players and return the information of your action in Python dictionary format with the keys being 'result' and 'action'.\n\n# RULE TWO (Team Game):\n\nA team game consists of a list of teams with a symbol starting with `[T1, T2, T3, ...]`.\n\nTeam players perform operations on a string of T symbols to generate results.

The circle and the triangle do not intersect. A line segment within the circle, which passes through the center of the circle, is perpendicular to the line segment across the circle through the centre. The line segment equally divides the circle into two hemispheres. If we make another circle outside the triangle. The line segment connecting two points outside the original circle, and the line segments parallel to it, a new triangle is formed.    (This test question is based on the copyright &copy; Gold Elementary Math Test II, Beijing Institute of Technology Press, November 2007.)\n\nQuestion-specific reasoning:\n2.3 Question Entailment\n(1)  Analysis:\nThe location relationship of the graphics is evident according to the description. Both circles are concrete concepts representing objects, and these objects can be named according to different properties (diameter, centre, etc.) The essence of the spatial relationship between the triangle and the circle can be expressed by the position relationship between the vertex of the triangle and the circle (whether the vertex is inside or outside of the circle). The essence of the spatial relationship between the two circles can be expressed through position relationship (inner, outer, adjacent) between their circumferences, Similarly, the line segment that \"equally divides the circle\" can be seen as the attribution relation of this central line segment to the circle. \nAccording to (1) of the description: if the line segment is in the inner circle, and the \"division of the circle\" relationship holds, then the two points on this line segment must be different from the centre of the circle, And one point is in the centre of the circle (by definition of a straight line, with at least two different points). \nAccording to (1) of the description: the two points on the line segment (not the centre of the circle points) are also on the triangle, then there must be points on the triangle within the circle.\nAccording to (2) of the description: there are two concrete circle objects, the central points expressed in (2) are the same (parallel line segments), and this point is on the straight line through the two points on the circle \"within\" the triangle. \nTherefore, the central point of the circle held in (2) must be within the triangle. According to (1), if the central point is inside the triangle, the other two points on the central line segment are also outside the circle, and according to the property of the straight line, this situation will not happen. question-1: false\n\n(2)  Analysis.\nAccording to (2) of the description: the triangle and the circle outside do not intersect and are positioned relatively. The essence of the circle's position relationship can be expressed through the position relationship between the vertex of the triangle and the circle (whether the vertex is inside or outside of the circle). \nA straight line connecting any two points outside the circle, outside the circle must be the same as the point described in (2). \nBy definition, draw a straight line segment, the linear relationship of the two points can be expressed as the linear relationship of the two points, and the straight line relationship of two points can also correspond to the straight line relationship of the parallel line segment through the intersection. For example, the line segment l1 inside the circle and the line segment l2 outside the triangle are both on the straight line drawn from two points outside the circle. The essence of this straight line relationship can be expressed (outside the circle, outside the triangle) by the position relationship of all points on the straight line relative to the circle and the triangle.\nThe line segments passing through two points outside the circle are perpendicular to the line segments crossing the circle through the centre; the line segments equally divide the circle into two equal parts. This is one example of a line segment that is perpendicular to the line segment via two points outside the circle that are outside the triangle. Note that the question gives the objects of two dashed line segments (circle, triangle), the given straight line (the dashed line segments drawn from two points outside the circle) must be crossing two concrete line segments, or outside the concrete line segments, or inscribed in the concrete line segments. Because there is the concrete line segment corresponding to the concretely triangular object in the question. Therefore, to determine the location of the graphic, first determine the position of the straight line (presented by two points) and then the corresponding position of the dashed line segment (represented by the straight line).\n`The line segment l1 inside the circle and the line segment l2 are on a straight line` is a linear relationship, and it is presented in terms of the position relationship between the four points represented by the words `two points outside the circle`.  \n`There are two parallel line segments dividing the circle into two equal parts` is a line segment relationship that is presented by the position relationship between four points (two points outside the circle) and two line segments inside the circle.\n`The line segment outside the triangle (represented in the question) is also marked as within the circle` is a line segment attribution relationship that is described as the line segment is on the circle and the triangle. It is a spatial relation expressing the object  of the line segment.\nPut it simply: The question describes the \"one side of a line segment inside the circle\" only takes the physical meaning of the attribute \"inside the circle\" of the line segment itself, and does not give the relationship between the line segment and the circle; `The outer circle with the inner triangle` is also a line segment attribution relationship, which is missing a position relationship in front of a `within` literal. The whole explanation is as follows: `The two points present any step l1 and l2 on the straight line, through the definition of a straight line, there must be two in diﬀerent individual points to in the straight line.  Two points are outside the circle, and l1 is inside the circle, and according to the property of a straight line, two points must be outside the circle, the same reason, straight line l1 and l2 exist only on the straight line, but only partial existence have to be inside the circle, while the outer triangle with the l2 inside the circle, according to what has been illustrated above: segment l2 can not be characterized by a simple in the circle, and l2 can not be simply inside the circle, but also have other relations, only both internal points from an individual and external individual points to be considered line has appeared characteristics. Statement 2 has two relations, the first is the \"define l1 and l2 are linear relationships of collinearity\", because they are on the straight line, the second is the intersection. The statement \"not intersect from two points outside the circle with the circle (inner triangle), the properties of linear relationships of collinearity, and has been proved above statement 1 directly contradicts.\"\nThe linear relation is established because the set of straight lines and two parallel dashes do not intersect, then the line relation of the straight-line segment circle held in (1) is contradicted. question-2: true\n\n(3)  Analysis.\nThe property of parallel line segments is that there is a parallel line segment (making up a straight line) passing through the two points hierarchically inscribed into each circle. \nif a straight line in the circle inscribed two adjacent endpoints hierarchically, by describing (2) of the parallel line segment position relationship, the complete diﬀerence position relationship of the two endpoints can be known (the circle and the position of the triangle, just as two corresponding points on the straight line (can be described as `two points on a line, one point inside the circle, the other point outside the circle`) in the `three parts` `one is inside a segment, and two are outside`, can be described as: `newline 2 is inside the circle, and the remaining two points on the outside of the triangle`. not all points on the straight line make the whole straight line segment appear inside the circle, and none of the line segments described in (2) are within the circle. The location relationship of the dashed line segment in (2) cannot satisfy the position relationship such as `in",

This type of Reasoning-based logical scheme can be characterized by [[]]\n\n\nPlease write a Python function `count_optimization(line)` that completes the following. The function parameter `line` indicates the input string of the code block. First, you need to write a function `calc_word_min(line, word_list)` that takes a string and a tuple of words as input. The function performs the following and returns the result：\n1. If the string contains at least one sentence, and each word in the tuple appears at least once in at least one sentence, then this tuple can be considered as a valid answer;\n2. Calculate the minimum length of all valid tuples in the correct order;\n3. If the input `line` is empty or too long to finish processing within 10 seconds, then the function immediately returns a value of 0.\n\nThen, write a function `pop_word_max(line, word_list, words_count)` that takes a string, a tuple of words, and an integer as input. The integer `words_count` represents the minimum tuple length with valid answers of the string. The function performs the following and returns the result：\n1. Selects a word from the second element to the `words_count`th element in the tuple of words;\n2. Iterates through all possible combinations of these selected words and obtains all valid tuples;\n3. From these valid tuples, finds the one with the maximum length; If multiple valid tuples have the same maximum length, returns the combination with lexicographically last words.\n\nFinally, please write a function `count_optimization(line)` that completes the following and returns the result：\n1. If `line` cannot generate a valid tuple, returns 0;\n2. If the count of words appearing in `line` is less than or equal to 1, returns 1;\n3. If the count of valid tuples is less than 6, returns the count plus 1;\n4. Otherwise, returns the result of the following function call：`min(12, 6 + pop_word_max(line, words_count))`, where `words_count` is the global minimum tuple length.\n\n\nSimulation awaits.\n\n### Question:\ndef calc_word_min(line, word_list):\n    import re\n    sentences = line.split(\".\")\n    if len(sentences) == 0 or len(line) > 200:\n        return 0\n    min_len = float(\"inf\")\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        words = sentence.split(\" \")\n        valid_count = 0\n        for word in word_list:\n            if word in words:\n                valid_count += 1\n        if valid_count == len(word_list):\n            min_len = min(min_len, len(word_list))\n    return min_len\n\ndef pop_word_max(line, word_list, words_count):\n    valid_tuples = []\n    for i in range(2, words_count+1):\n        selected_words = word_list[1:i]\n        for combination in combinations(selected_words, len(selected_words)):\n            new_word_list = list(combination)\n            if calc_word_min(line, new_word_list) > 0:\n                valid_tuples.append(new_word_list)\n    if len(valid_tuples) == 0:\n        return word_list\n    max_len = max([len(t) for t in valid_tuples])\n    max_tuples = [t for t in valid_tuples if len(t) == max_len]\n    max_tuples.sort(key=lambda x: max([words.index(w) for w in x]))\n    return max_tuples[-1]\n\n\ndef count_optimization(line):\n    word_list = line.strip().split()\n    if len(word_list) == 0 or len(line) > 200:\n        return 0\n    if len(word_list) <= 1:\n        return 1\n    words_count = calc_word_min(line, word_list)\n    if words_count < 6:\n        return words_count + 1\n    return min(12, 6 + pop_word_max(line, word_list, words_count))\n\n\nline = \"a b a b c d e f g h i\"\ncount_optimization(line)\n\nThis response involves complex code logic, lists, condition judgments, and calculations.

Discounts\n- \"d\" (double) rule: 50% discount (half price) for all \"d\" meals.\n- \"half\" rule: 50% discount (half price)\n- \"quarter\" rule 75% discount (one-quarter price)\n- \"c1bm\" (combo1 Buy 3 Get Meal Free) rule:\na. Minimum order: 3 drinks and 3 sides\nb. Rules of combination: When 3 drinks and 3 sides are ordered together, 1 free meal is given for each.\n- \"xx\" (exclusive) rule: Discounts for meal \"a\" (if ordered) cannot be combined with discounts for drinks and sides \"b\" and \"c\".\n\nExample 1:\nPolicy Sequence: \"d\", \"quarter\"\nDiscount coverage: meals\nIf meals \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" are ordered, with \"a\" being discounted by \"d\" and \"b\" being discounted by \"quarter\", thus 50% + 75% = 125%. Discount will be taken on the most expensive meal in the order list.\nExample 2:\nPolicy Sequence: \"c1bm\", \"d\"\nDiscount coverage: meals\nAssume you order 3 drinks \"a\", 3 sides \"b\", and 3 meals \"c\".\nApplying \"c1bm\" and \"d\" to the previous list would result in one free meal using \"c1bm\" and another free meal using \"d\". So, you get two free meals. If you order another side or drink, you get another free meal because the \"c1bm\" rule applies.\n\nNote: This rule will be updated later, so please refer to the latest version.\n\nPlease read the rules carefully and respond according to the indicated format and situation.\n\n### Conversion:\nQuestion:\nA customer orders 1 soda, 1 water, and 1 sandwich.

The sentence uttered by the asker is a polar question, expecting a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. However, to achieve the communication purpose, the expected response from B should be \"Yes\" or \"No\", or an assertive statement such as \"I can drive\" or \"I cannot drive\". B's response, \"I have a car,\" is not providing the required information directly, i.e., whether B can or cannot drive.

A is very rich and deposits $100,000 to the bank. B is responsible for recording the corresponding number on the central computer of the bank and intends to add one more zero by mistake. In this case, a bomb with its trigger connected to the central computer is set by the satan to blow up the bank if B input a number less than 1 million because the trigger only work in the range [0,10⁶].\n\nAssume A's and B's phones are encrypted to prevent the satan from knowing the true $100 note number since the satan needs a large number >10⁶ to set the trigger (1 million) not to detonate the bomb. But he is a great machine learning expert and intends to build a model for $100 note number distribution to infer from it the right number to detonate the bomb. We know the distribution of $100 note number is \"normal/Gaussian\" because the majority of normal people deposit/withdraw $100 incremental.\n\nThe phrase \"The number on a $100 note.\" is a factual kind of information. The specific number, 2, represents the number of zeroes for the particular incident of the $100 note.\n\nTherefore, the speaker is already aware of the specific number of zeroes of the $100 note and intentionally avoids explicitly revealing it.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA.

Based on the Information Principle, if you only say A played the treasure hunt game, you can know that A would get \"trick\" without explicitly saying so.\n\n\nThe \"bad tricks\" activity involves a social activity in which individuals deploy specific tricks against others.\nThe phrase \"defeated the bad dragons\" is an factual kind of information.

The explanation given by B, \"the greater the similarity between two objects, the lower the similarity,\" implies a paradoxical relationship. It suggests that if there is a larger amount of similarity between apples and pears, then the similarity between the two is actually lower. This statement reflects the level of similarity between the two objects but does not directly indicate a straightforward answer to the question of whether there is a big difference between apples and pears.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn this dialogue, A asks about the existence of a big difference between apples and pears. B provides a contradicting statement: \"the greater the similarity between two objects, the lower the similarity.\" This statement implies that if there is a large amount of similarity between apples and pears, such as their shape, size, color, etc., then the perceived similarity between the two is actually lower. This response touches on the level of similarity between apples and pears but does not directly answer the question of whether there is a big difference.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[A]]. The reason is that B's response does not directly answer A's question of whether there is a big difference between apples and pears. Instead, B provides a difficult-to-understand and unusual explanation: \"the greater the similarity between two objects, the lower the similarity.\" This explanation implies that if there is a larger amount of similarity between apples and pears, the similarity between the two actually decreases. Therefore, the response indicates that there might not be a big difference between apples and pears.\n\n\n### Question:\nIn this dialogue, A asks whether there is a big difference between apples and pears, and B's response touches on the similar/dissimilar nature and degree of difference between the two. **B's response suggests that there is a certain degree of similarity between apples and pears, but it does not directly convey whether there is a big difference between the two.** To fully understand B's response, it is necessary to comprehend its implication, which is that if there is a larger amount of similarity between apples and pears, it suggests that there might not be a big difference between the two. In this case, the focus is on whether B's response can result in “~K(Q)”, where the speaker does not know whether a certain sentence Q can be established. \n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Is there a big difference between apples and pears?\"\nB: The greater the similarity between the two objects, the lower the similarity.\n\nA: \"Is there a big difference between rabbits and squirrels?\"\nB: The more similar the eating habits are, the less similarity there is.\n\nIn the first example, B's response suggests that if there is a large amount of similarity between apples and pears, it indicates that there might not be a big difference between the two. The word \"not\" here implies the negation of the big difference between apples and pears. \n\nIn the second example, B makes a similar statement, indicating that if there is a large amount of similarity in the eating habits of rabbits and squirrels, then there might not be a big difference between the two. Again, the word \"not\" here reflects the negation of the big difference between rabbits and squirrels.\n\nUnderneath the words, B is expressing a similar and consistent pattern of thought and inference in both examples. It is important not to underestimate the power of words in communication as they carry meaning and convey information. **When engaging in dialogue or conversation, it is crucial to consider the words carefully in order to fully comprehend the meaning and intention being conveyed in the absence of face-to-face engagement.** Always pay close attention to the string of words and consider the underlying implications, as the omission of words does not minimize their significance.\n\nB’s responses in these examples indicate the presence of a significant amount of similarity and negate the claim that there is a big difference.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA.

However, B claims that they sold the three companies at the required price without incurring a loss. \n\nIn this dialogue, A does not say that among the three companies sold, setting the asking price too low would lead to a loss, while B's response implies a different selling price for the three companies. Therefore, B's response does provide information beyond what is explicitly stated in A's statement.\n\n\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\nB's response is structured around the inference of the sentence using B's information principles under A's information principles. Under the premise that A has not contradicted their knowledge, B assumes that the companies were sold for different prices. As a result, B provides additional information beyond what was stated in the original sentence in response to A. This additional information indicates that B possesses more knowledge and understanding of the situation than what was initially mentioned. From B's perspective, the selling price for the three companies are different, so the originally stated information can be expanded to include the possibility of setting a higher price for at least one of the companies in addition to the two companies where the price was set too low.\n\n\nA.

B specifically emphasizes that the selling price of all three companies is at the required level, and no loss is incurred in the transaction when A claims that a loss would occur if the companies were sold.

The former is theoretical innovation, and the latter is technological innovation.\n\nWe should understand scientific and technological innovation from the following perspectives. The first perspective is a tentative explanation. The concept of “scientific and technological innovation\" is vague. This concept is accustomed to being understood from the perspective of epistemology, but there is no corresponding epistemological theory to match it. Epistemology studies the general principles of knowledge in science, and it doesn't directly care about what scientific and technological innovation is or how to achieve it. The concept of 'scientific and technological innovation' attempts to describe and explain the process of science and technology transforming from old to new. This process is not simply the accumulation of scientific and technological knowledge, but often involves interaction or even exchange between scientific and technological knowledge, which may produce impacts in other technological fields. In summary, the concept of scientific and technological innovation is a sub-concept of scientific and technological exchange, which undergoes a process of transformation. Through exchange, scientific and technological knowledge is converted into scientific and technological innovation, and then becomes new scientific and technological knowledge. When looking at the concept of scientific and technological innovation from this perspective, we can see that it encompasses a range of complex processes. But how does scientific exchange occur? Many scholars agree on this - scientific and technological innovation is achieved through scientific and technological exchange, and it is a kind of innovation carried out through exchange. However, these scholars did not explain how scientific and technological innovation and exchange are related.”\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ⚯ Definition\nB. ⌘ Definition\nC. ⚒ Definition\nD.

In July 2018 it reached a peak of 5,000, then declined to 800 cases. In March and April 2019, it rebounded again to 800-1200 cases. From 2018 to 2019, the Children's Defense Fund filed over 170 lawsuits demanding the reunification of children with their parents and the end of family separation. [11] The activities of separatist families, and immigrant advocacy groups that demonstrate with volunteers to raise funds and provide information, such as Border Angels, also put pressure on the US government. [12] [5] [13] [14] [15] On June 20, 2018, protesters gathered outside the Hudson ICE detention office - where children were being separated from their parents - in protest. [16] Six days later, hundreds of people gathered in front of the offices to demand answers as to where the children were being held. [17] At the time, state officials and members of Congress also shared their concerns.\n\nSimilarly, in 2018, the teenage network KVUE has three journalists who have integer doubts over the integrity of the Trenton olndensi messaging and tear into the so-called \"cage\" over images and videos they have obtained. These images show that many children and young people have no blankets to use during the night and poor hygiene supplies such as shampoo, soap, and diapers. [18] Napolitano acknowledged that the situation of children and young people who enter the United States will worsen during the summer months and will continue to be a major challenge if the 17 conditions remain in Congress.

At the same time, White said that NGOs strongly demanded the president stop arresting in-family illegal immigrants. NFI offers such humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, air conditioning and free toilets on both US and Mexico's border crossings. Following the description of the case, some Republican militants, such as Rep.

No matter what kind of things we use, if we use them but don't invent them ourselves and therefore don't understand their inner workings, we will never be truly developed. Due to our newly advanced civilization, people point to foreign things and say that Yaos and Shuns did not have them, that Sages did not have them, and that they are the result of foreign learning. This argument is simply untenable. Firstly, Yaos and Shuns were not the only periods of civilization in Chinese history. Moreover, even if these things were not invented entirely by Chinese people, they undoubtedly contain viable aspects that we can still use. Also, these things were originally used for our own purposes. If we must abandon foreign learning to return to the past and say that it is good to go back to the past, then why should we still use things like foreign papermaking and books? For example, why not use bark instead of papermaking to create books?\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\n\"Studying the new world, new universities are proving the usefulness of new studies in various ways every day.
