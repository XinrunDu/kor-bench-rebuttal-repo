I will be grateful for your suggestions for improving this solution.\n\n### My Explanation:\n\n1. Identify the relevant headers and objects mentioned in the rule: Plaintext, keyword, ciphertext, reversed_alphabet, substitution_alphabet, standard_alphabet. The rule indicates that the task involves encryption and decryption procedures, and the process involves shifting encryption and decryption.\n\n2. Follow the specified steps for encryption and decryption:\n- For encryption:\n    - Use reversed_alphabet as the reverse mapping, so that the alphabets in ciphertext string can be mapped to the correct ones in plaintext.\n        - Considering that ciphertexts are uppercase strings, the corresponding process could be similar to the reverse mapping of plaintext integers in reverse_digits reversal rules. Specifically, for each alphabet ci, find its original index ci in reversed_alphabet, then replace ci with the character xi in the plaintext. For example, if A is mapped to Z, B is mapped to Y, etc.\n    - Add n positions after the alphabet in plaintext. The new plaintext of ciphertexts mapped character (1) is mapped to\n    - Obtain the character at position n of plaintext. Then replace it with the original character of that mapping. For example, if the n-step plaintext character is D, then the position of encrypted plaintext is\n    - Replace the character obtained by (3) with the letter corresponding to the position n of the encrypted plaintext in ciphertext alphabet. For example, the cipher alphabet is \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\", where the original character obtained by (1) mapped to\n3. Follow the specified steps for decryption:\n- For Decryption:\n    - Use the encryption results as the encryption results for decryption step. Assume that the character obtained from the decryption step is\n    - Compare the new character n step with cipheralphabet, then find the number ci of cipheralphabet for it. Finally, execute the decrypt steps on ci maps. For example, like encrypted string\n    - Dexcrypted character is\n    - If p maps to Z, it means that p was a candidate encrypted plaintext, and the decrypted cipher text p is\n    - Find ciphertext character ci, corresponding original number i means cipher c\n    - [^]\n    - If the encrypted character obtained by decryption is\n4. Ensure the output contains a formatted string.\n  * Use plaintext, key, transformed alphabet, and end point for consistent output formatting.\n\n\nThe variable used in the solution:\n\n```\nkey = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM\"\n# reversed_alphabet = \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n# substitution_alphabet = \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\nreversed_alphabet = reversed(str(key))  \nalphabet = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\nalphabet_dict = {}\nfor i in reversed_alphabet.rstrip():\n    alphabet_dict[reversed_alphabet.index(i)] = i\nfor index in reversed_alphabet:\n    if index not in alphabet:\n        result = \"\"\n        txt = f\"Enter the encryption rule:\\n{txt[1]}\"\n```\n",

It is represented as a letter, specifically \"P\".\n\n2. Check if \"P\" exists in the Polybius square. If it does, use the principle of \"rows and columns to replace it\".\n\n- If O does not exist, replace with 66.\n\n3. Obtain the ciphertext: \"35\" (row and column notation)\n\n4. Process according to \"rows and columns to replace it\", and obtain \"O\".\n\n5. Conversion as necessary, answer: \"34\"\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"35\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns, and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"B\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[B]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"4533332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"KN\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[KN]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"I\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[I]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"BBO\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[BBO]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"45346\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"0453332\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"11167724758754\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"N\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[N]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"224\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"Y\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[Y]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"01165426\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"L\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[L]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"135\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"A\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[A]].**\n\n* Decryption:\n\nCiphertext: \"7551316594311\"\n\n1. Substitute letters into rows and columns and find the corresponding letters in the square.\n\n- If it's O, it's a 66.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext to a plaintext \"QQ\".\n\n**Thus, the decrypted result should be [[QQ]].**\n\n* Explanation of XOR Operation:\n\nXOR (exclusive Or) operation is applied to each character pair of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext. During decryption, since there may be O in the ciphertext, the corresponding XOR operation is carried out. If the plaintext contains O, perform the overall XOR operation as usual, otherwise perform the XOR operation as follows:\n\n`If XOR(c,p) = O XOR(c,p) = 66 `\n\nBe careful not to be confused. The purpose of \"rows and columns replacement\" is not only for encryption but also for decryption.\n\n**Example of XOR Operation:**\n\n ciphertext: \"45346\"\n\nplaintext: \"B\"\n\nin_pair: \"45346\" \"B\"\n\nout_pair: \"0C33133D3D3D1313 D13333363\"\n\nThe XOR operation result of \"66\" is very close to \"C\", so perform the overall OR operation instead of XOR.",

This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n",

I’m rational about what I’m trying to achieve and capable of reflecting on and self-regulating my actions and performance. \n### MOTIVATION  ::\nI’m excited to work alongside a supportive and stimulating group of people. I like knowing what is expected of me so I can learn. \n\n### OPENNESS  ::\nI readily share thoughts, ideas and feedback. I’m straightforward in my feedback and strive to always seek to understand. I am honest when reporting errors so that I can be helped to rectify these sooner. \n\n### TEAM SPIRIT ::\nI trust my team will create the best outcome and I believe our ideas are our own, contributed by the group. I'm adaptable to changing roles and tasks, and willing to support others and collaborate on ideas. \n\n### COURAGE  ::\nI have the confidence to question, challenge and speak up (if it is needed). I am prepared to take a stand and put forward my own ideas. \nI am always ready to admit mistakes (if my mistakes impede the quality / outcomes) and work toward improving my performance.\n\n### CONSULTANCY  ::\nI’m available and willing to take on tasks beyond my brief, helping the team with any problems and demonstrating expertise if it gives us a competitive edge. \n### QUALITY  ::\nI’m curious, ask questions to challenge thinking and seek ways to improve our processes. I always strive to achieve the best possible outcome through high standards. I check my work is done satisfactorily – performing, presenting and operating to the highest standards.\n\n### LEADERSHIP  ::\nI demonstrate clear direction, focusing the team on the bigger picture and identifying risks or opportunities. \nI’m responsible and willing to lead and delegate others in situations where I feel it would benefit the team to progress. \n\n### MANAGE MY WORKLOAD - ::\nI'm aware of what timeslot of the day it is and ensure I focus on the task at hand like an assassin. This includes not getting sidetracked/distracted and staying on track while staying focused without any external stimuli. I also remind others it's our job to stay on track. \nMy priorities and what I need to do are crystal clear. I prioritise the important things first, and focus, not procrastinate. In doing so I delegate and ask others to help me. This keeps me on top of",

At the end of the twentieth century, algorithms that are efficient and produce the largest number of zeros when decrypted became popular and widely adopted. It's important to understand how these algorithms, the best known of which is the data encryption standard (DES), operate below the surface. These algorithms employ a long array of numbers called a KDF (key derivation function), which is a key-dependent function, to encrypt data blocks. To decrypt messages, you must be familiar with the original ciphertext generated by the encryption algorithm.\n\n<strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://aes.stackexchange.com/questions/58/data-encryption…\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question01.png)\n\n### Question 1:\n\nProvide explicit examples of Python statements to obtain the frequency of each character in the input string using class lists.\n\nPlease specify the functions including and the function signature\nwith explicit examples.

Our thoughts are used to make sense of the world around us. The patterns encoded into ciphers play a significant role in those thoughts. For further understanding, reference this:\n\n\n<strong>Reference Link below:</strong>\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/how-b-crypt-hash-algorithm-en…\n\nThe key and the operator is specified as \"aes-256-ctr\". Decryption requires the operator's key, and no algorithm can be applied to it.\n\nWhat should the code to do with this string be?\n\n<strong>Python Code:</strong>\n\n<code>[![image](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question04.png?raw=true)$[line=92,63]string = str(input())</code>\n\n<strong>Output:</strong>\n\n<strong>\"------------------------------\"</strong>\n\n#bytes  int  *  str - string - list\n\nThis test case is really a challenge!

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SAL]]\n\n\n# Solution\n\nIn this situation, you need to ensure that your encryption or decryption algorithm follows the specific rules provided in the cipher rule. This involves addressing properties of the rule defined by the keyword (when necessary), determining how consecutive values in outer_disc will be replaced by inner_disc, and smoothly flowing between the encryption and decryption steps. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that your final output matches the format specified in the encrypted and decrypted answers. Your final ciphertext or plaintexts must be formatted as required and enclosed within double square brackets.\n\n### Encryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties.\n- **Replacement**\n    - You replace certain characters in the plaintext with corresponding values in outer_disc.\n\n```plaintext\nInput:\n- Keyword of encryption (e.g., 'H')\n- period\n- increment\n\nOutput:\n- Uppercase letters string\n- keyword renamed\n- Encoded ciphertext\n\nEncryption Steps:\n- For each character p in the phrase {when applicable}, find the character that matches h in the inner_disc, and replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the outer disc. Assign the encrypted string as result.\n\n```\n\n**Encrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput: (Describe the process to find the character with the keyword)\nEncryption(Encrypt):H\n\nOutput: [[HI]]\n\nProcess: The process of finding character is:\n1. According to the keyword \"H\" in the original input \"H\", we find that it is equal to the character\n      {109 [01000001] on the binary code}\n2. Then {26 [0101111] on the binary digital} is replaced on the outer_disc, and the result is {108 [0100001] on the digital code}\n3. Repeating step 2, rotation increment = period = 14, after {4} characters are processed, the result is {109 [01000001] on the digital code}.\n{In this way, when period = 14, increment = 2, the inner_disc will rotate twice back, again as {109 [01000001] on the digital code} }  \n```\n\n**Decrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput Encryption(Encryption):HI\nOutput: [[I]]\n\nProcess: The process of decrypting the character is:\n- 1. according to the ciphertext \"HI\" in the input, find the character h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {109 [01000001] on the binary code}.\n- 2. then {108 [0100001] on the digital code} is replaced on the outer_disc, resulting in {H [0100000] on the digital code}.\n- 3. The process of encryption steps for character H is repeated until finally getting the final plaintext.\n```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n\n### Decryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The same properties (e.g., keyword) will ensure a smooth transition from encryption steps to decryption steps.\n- **Replacement:\n    - You replace the characters in the ciphertext with the values obtained in the outer_disc through decryption steps.\n- **Re-Encryption**\n    - Repeat the process for the replacements of characters until *n* passes, where ‘n’ is the encryption periodicity.\n\n\n\n```plaintext\n- Keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties\n- Replacement\n- Re-Encryption\n\nProcess:  \nInput:\n- Phrase in the ciphertext as string\n- Period, increment\n- keyword\n\nOutput:\n- Re-encrypted phrase in uppercases as a string\n- keyword renamed\n- Phrase in uppercases as string\n```\n\n**Sample input cipher text:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\n\nInput\n- The character is \"BAIL\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption \n- Encryption(Upgrade):BAIL\nPeriod: 12, Increment: 4\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Character: [{34 [101 01100] on the binary digit},{10 [01001] on the binary digit}]  \n```\n\n**Re-Decryption:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\nInput\n- The character is \"SUF\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption\n- Encryption (Upgrade) :SUF\nPeriod: 6, Increment: 1\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Characters:           [{95 [11101] on the binary digit},{10 [01001]}on the binary digit ]\n\nDecrypted Characters:  \n- Process: The process of finding the character with the keyword as input \"H\" is:\n  1. according to the encrypted ciphertext \"SUF\" in the input, find the character with the name h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {10 [01001] on the binary code}.\n\n  2. the character {10 [01001]} on the binary code is replaced on the outer_disc, with the result {95 [1] on the digital code}.\n\n  3. The process of decryption steps for character 95 is repeated until finally getting the final ciphertext.\n  ```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n",

You need to use the decryption algorithm, but not all of it. The \"Unified Algorithms Operational Instructions for the National Unified Algorithm Library\" in the \"Encryption Algorithm Assessment Standard\"\n\nEncryption cipher (related parameter calculation algorithms):\n\n1. Ciphertext Calculation Method\n\nThere are many methods to calculate the ciphertext, generally from:\n\n(1) According to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext, encrypt and count according to the encryption table, then encrypt the result character by character.\n\n(2) Use the previously calculated key to encrypt the data, and then encrypt according to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext character by character.\n\nEncryption is encrypted according to the corresponding table, and each character is converted into a corresponding position according to the original data. To do this, it is necessary to find the position of each character in the cipher text.\n\n(1) When the cipher text is not arranged in order, the commonly used way is to find the longest ascending position of the character. The shortest descending character from the long to the short position;\n\n(2) Determine that there is no encryption key, please refer to the Standard algorithm in the Unified Algorithm Library for definition.\n\nThe ciphertext above uses some encryption rules based on columns.",

You can enter your encrypted answer below:\n\n### [Your encrypted answer in double square brackets]:\n- Fixed Key: 10101010\n- Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n  2. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n    - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n  3. Inverse Permutation:\n    - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n  4. XOR Operation:\n    - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n  5. Convert Binary to Character:\n    - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n    - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n  6. Combine Characters:\n    - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"EKDCRHRTDSK\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Your response should follow the specified encryption and decryption rules exactly, as described in the [instructions](instructions.html# INSTRUCTIONS).\n2. For security reasons, you should only share encrypted sample data with the owner of the dataset. If need be, you can encrypt sample data using any appropriate tool before sharing it.\n3. To prevent replaying your response, make a small change in your code so it won’t be considered as a duplicate and still remain under a different name. For example, on run-time replace a fixed integer of your code by a variable (as a temporary measure).\n\n### Submitting Data:\nThis challenge involves creating encrypted and decrypted data based on an encryption rule. When submitting your encrypted data as CCDD data, please ensure consistency with the formatting of the encryption rule [below.](images/cipherimageexample.png) For example, if the cipher rule has a variable \"k_q_x,\" please ensure that its value is correctly represented as a sequence of numbers. In the encryption rule for \"k_q_x\", the left side string\"12,\" is not part of the data and the right side digit is actually\"12\". But the CCDD challenge requires that both the digits\"1\" and\"2\" be shown, and there is a blank space after the digit, so that the \"k\" values: 1 and 2 are combined into 12.\n### Note:\nYour submission will be scored and annotated by Kaggle during the grading process. Any changes made to your submission will result in it being graded by this system again and a new score calculated accordingly. Therefore it's often best to make final changes after the final deadline, as Kaggle accounts for multiple days to review and score. Kaggle does not perform a manual check of any particular question, after the final deadline.\n\nThe encrypted and decrypted input and output formats for this challenge are shown below. The rules are in the encrypted form.\n\n![Encrypted and Decrypted Data Format](images/cipherimageexample.png)\n\n### Encryption rule:\n\nPlaintext:\n**Input data**\n- k: 12\n\n![encrypted cipher example with plain text N](images/cipherrule-encryptedcipher.png)\n\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- For each letter p in the plaintext:\n    - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n    - Calculate x * k as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n- Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n![Decrypated cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 936](images/cipherrule-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted ciphertext 984,840,804](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedCiphertext).png)\n\n![encrypted cipher example with encrypted cipher text PO and its decrypted answer 862](images/cipherrule-decipher-decryptedcipher.png)\n\n### Hints:\n- Consider if you need to get from an alpha charachter (e.g., 'a' code 97) to a decimal value (e.g., 97 / 10 = 9.7).\n- Note that the \"plaintext\" is usually in UPPERCASE while \"ciphertext\" is in lower-case.\n- When submitting your scores will be shown as a range. The final value in the range is the score that the owner would give if the score was made in the same way as the final score.\n### Submission format: Answers\n",
