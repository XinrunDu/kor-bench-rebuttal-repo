Maximum Score: 100 points.\n2. Score Type: Individual.\n3. Submit Limit: 10 per user.\n4. Total Submission Limit: 100 per user.\n5. Task Deadline: The task will remain open on May 9th at 6:40 PM (UTC+8). No submissions will be accepted after the deadline.\n6. Time Limit: Each submit process has a time limit of 10 minutes at the most. (The total number of submissions is ten, that means a maximum 100 minutes, so you have enough time per submit.) Hint: Try to make your code run fast and efficient.\n7. Submission limit: 10000\n\n## Submission format\n\n- Text file submission. Please save detailed encryption code and decryption code as python file. Each file contains a single text block and is saved as  `Encryption-address.zip“ or  “(Decryption-address-your zip package).`\n\n## Submission process\n\n- Each user is allowed 10 submissions. However, in order to ensure the fairness of the competition, the number of submissions for entire users is limited to 100. If you submit in violation, the submission may be invalidated and a corresponding deduction will be made.\n\n## Score mechanism\n\n- The score will be calculated based on the accuracy of the ciphertext or plaintext generated and the text it produces using your given cipher. If it is consistent with the required output, 40 points will be awarded for accuracy.\n- Code efficiency will be evaluated. If completed within 50 ms, 25 points will be awarded for efficiency.\n- Code quality will be evaluated. If the code logic is clear, the code itself is concise, and the variables used are correct, then 25 points will be awarded for quality.\n- A final score of 100 points will be awarded for accuracy, efficiency, and quality.\n",

From the first two rows, we can observe that the plaintext is \"K\" (for the upper row).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhen encountering \"**\"** characters in Ciphers, our priority should be to utilize the S_BOX and INV_S_BOX to identify whether the ciphered characters have undergone **XOR** operation or not. However, it is at this point that we must exercise caution and consider a potential variant of the cipher.\n\nFirst Rule: The keyword used for XOR operation.\n\nSecond Rule: The cipher is regularized through the use of S_BOX or INV_S_BOX.\n\n### Variant:\nA variant exists, wherein the keyword is consistently used as a constant and undergoes two rounds of XOR operation with the alphabet. As a result, the remainder of the ciphertext is the alphabet itself, leading to the formation of 26-character encrypted blocks. In this scenario, we continue to utilize the **S_BOX/INV_S_BOX** for decryption, but there is uncertainty regarding the requirement for XOR operation and the existence of padding. [[****]] represents 26-character ciphered text.\n\n### Second Question:\nDecrypted: **\"B\"**\nPlaintext: **\"K\"**\nKeyword: **\"K\"**\nCiphered: **\"GB\"**\n",
