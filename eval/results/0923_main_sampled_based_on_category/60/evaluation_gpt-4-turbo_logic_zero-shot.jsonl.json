(p∨r)\n2. (¬q∨r)\n3. (¬p∨q∨¬r)\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Disjunctive Terms\nEach clause must be made exclusive by considering the other variables' true/false states, ensuring each term is a paired conjunctive term.\n- In (p∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: pq¬r (101), p¬q¬r (100), pqr (111), and so forth, covering terms where either p or r is true.\n- In (¬q∨r), possible satisfied assignments are: p¬qr (110), p¬q¬r (100), ¬p¬qr (010), and so forth, covering terms where either q is false or r is true.\n- In (¬p∨q∨¬r), all combinations where not all literals are false (¬p, q, ¬r specifically).\n\n### Step 3: Combined Term Truth Assignments\nFor the formula to be in principal disjunctive normal form, each conjunctive term in a complete disjunctive form must involve every possible combination of variables in either their normal or negated states once. However, from the formula's structure, not all combinations are represented; for example, combined terms need to allow for every possible value assignment to p, q, r to be accounted for in the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nGiven the distinct clauses do not cover absolutely every possible pairing of p, q, r (e.g., ¬p¬q¬r not directly represented unless deduced through complex Boolean algebra), we find:\n\n### Conclusion\nThe formula cannot be exactly framed into either a principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form as it doesn’t include all exclusive possible assignments of variables p, q, and r (all 2^n combinations of the variables) distinctly. Each term isn't neatly a paired conjunctive term given overlaps and missing explicit representations of some states.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",

The term m0 corresponds to a true assignment where all propositional variables are false (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0).\n\n2. **All-Even Form Criteria**: A formula A is an all-even form if the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even numbers. \n\nWe now need to consider how many formulas satisfy both conditions:\n\n- For a formula to be a basic form, it must include the m0 term.\n- For a formula to be an all-even form, it can only include terms like m0, m2, m4,... etc. It must exclusively use even indices.\n\nSince m0 is already required for a formula to be a basic form, and m0 is also an even index term, we simply need to restrict all other indices in the principal disjunctive normal form of A to even numbers. However, we must ensure that m0 is definitely included.\n\nThe even-indexed m terms for 4 variables would be (considering 4 binary digits can range from 0000 [0 in decimal] to 1111 [15 in decimal]):\n- m0 = 0000\n- m2 = 0010\n- m4 = 0100\n- m6 = 0110\n- m8 = 1000\n- mA = 1010\n- mC = 1100\n- mE = 1110\n\nEach of these terms, including m0, can independently be included or not included in a formula, except that m0 must be included to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\nSince there are 7 additional even-indexed m terms after m0, each can either be included or not included independently, generating \\(2^7\\) different combinations, all of which satisfy the all-even criteria while consistently including m0 for the basic form.\n\nThus, the total number of formulas that are both basic forms and all-even forms would be:\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\nHence, the total number of such formulas is [[128]].",
