A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]",

Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p1`\n   - `~p1&p2`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)`\n   - `~p3`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)||~p3`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is false, then both `~(~p1&p2)` must be false and `~p3` must be false.\n   - `~(~p1&p2)` is false when `~p1&p2` is true, which occurs when `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n   - `~p3` is false when `p3` is true.\n\nCombining these, the falsity value for `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is:\n`x|✓|✓` (p1 is false, p2 is true, p3 is true)\n\n#### Formula (2): `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n1. Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p2`\n   - `~p2||p3`\n   - `p1=::>p2`\n   - `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is false, then either `~p2||p3` is false, or `p1=::>p2` is false, or both.\n   - `~p2||p3` is false when `~p2` is false and `p3` is false. That happens when `p2` is true and `p3` is false.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Since this conflicts with `p2` being true, no combination exists to make both parts false simultaneously.\n\nThus, under these constraints, the falsity value for `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is:\n`✓|✓|x` (p1 is true, p2 is true, p3 is false)\n\n#### Formula (3): `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n1.

We recognize that the implication \"if \\( p1 \\), then \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\)\" will be false only if \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) is false.\n\nHowever, for \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) to be false, all three propositions \\( p1 \\), \\( p2 \\), and \\( p3 \\) must be false. But this scenario contradicts our initial assumption that \\( p1 \\) is true.\n\nSo, since \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) will always be true when \\( p1 \\) is true, and the formula is true when \\( p1 \\) is false (because a false antecedent makes an implication true by default), \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is true under all possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is a Truth Formula (A).\n\n(2) \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\)\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step. The formula inside the implication is \\( p1=::>~p1 \\).\n\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is false when \\( p1 \\) is true since \\( ~p1 \\) would be false, thus leading to a false condition.\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is false because \\( ~p1 \\) would be true, making the implication true by default.\n\nNow, considering \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\):\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is true, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is false. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{false} =::> ~p2 \\) will depend on \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, making the entire implication true (since a false antecedent results in a true implication).\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, and this makes the implication false (a false antecedent and a true consequent make the implication false).\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is true. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]",

        "response": "To determine the classification of the formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r), we need to evaluate it based on the provided logical rules.\n\n1. Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of ¬p, ¬q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r.\n   - (p ∧ q ∧ r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p ∧ q ∧ r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r) ∨ (p ∧ q ∧ r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it’s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it’s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it’s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it’s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it’s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Based on the given rules, none of these classifications (A, B, C, D, E) apply to the formula provided.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]",
