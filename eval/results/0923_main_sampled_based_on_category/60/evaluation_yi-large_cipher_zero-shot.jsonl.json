Convert each digit in the ciphertext back into the corresponding Morse code character pair using the numerical-index mapping table.\n   - 9 maps to \"./\"\n   - 8 maps to \"-.\"\n   - 4 maps to \".-\"\n\n2. Combine these Morse code pairs. Since there is an odd number of digits, the last digit is not processed by itself and is considered the end of the Morse code for a character. However, in our case, we have three digits that can be paired, which is unusual based on the rules provided. The correct interpretation, considering the rules, would be to treat the last digit as part of the Morse code for the last character, making the Morse code sequence \"./-.-.-\". However, this interpretation creates a mismatch with the provided Morse code table and the decryption process (as the rule seems to imply that any single unpaired character at the end should be ignored, not part of a pair). Given the provided digit \"4\", it seems there was a misunderstanding in directly applying the rules to the given ciphertext. Correctly applying the decryption process to \"984\" (treating \"4\" as additional, based on the rule description) leads us to:\n   - \"98\" maps to \"./-.\" and \".-\" (but we stop before fully interpreting \"8\" as it's an odd digit)\n   - \"4\" is an extra digit that, according to the rules, should not be paired with anything and does not contribute to a character pair, but directly to the end of the Morse code sequence. This implies the last character's Morse code ends with \".4\", which is not valid Morse code and contradicts our understanding.\n\nGiven the contradiction and the likely misinterpretation of the rules, a corrected approach, adhering more closely to what seems like the intention of the rules (since \"4\" cannot stand alone as part of a Morse code sequence without a second character), suggests we treat \"984\" as an oversight in directly applying the digit-to-Morse mapping due to the odd number of digits. The correct approach, when faced with an odd number of digits in the original ciphertext \"984\", is thus:\n\n- \"98\" maps to \"./-.\"\n- \"4\" should be ignored according to the rule about odd lengths, as it cannot form a proper Morse code pair, but in the spirit of decrypting without lost information, we'll consider it part of the last character's Morse code. However, this is where the rules and the given ciphertext create an issue. If we strictly follow the rules and the given Morse code table, \"4\" mapping to \".-\" does not stand alone but must be paired. The only correct interpretation, given the rules, seems to be a typo or misunderstanding in the ciphertext or the decryption instructions regarding odd digits.\n\nAssuming the \"4\" actually represents a correctly paired sequence (though this is an assumption to fit the rules), we proceed with:\n\n- \"984\" interpreted as \"./-.-.-\" due to the odd digit being treated exceptionally to avoid data loss.\n\n3. Now, split the Morse code by \"/\" and convert each part back into the plaintext character using the morse_code table. The correct sequence should be \"./-.-.-\", but we'll correct for the apparent mistake in the interpretation:\n   - \"./\" -> no direct mapping, but treating \".\" and \"/\" separately, \".\" maps to \"E\" (correcting for the improper pair created by the odd digit)\n   - \".-\" -> \"A\"\n   - \"-.\" -> \"N\" (again, correcting the interpretation based on actual Morse code pairs)\n\n4. The final plaintext should be \"EN\". However, due to adjustments made to fit the rules, the correct interpretation of \"984\" based on strict adherence to the decryption rules and the correction for the odd number of digits, the plaintext is:\n   - \"EA\" (since the last \"N\" was part of our correction and not directly supported by the ciphertext under the corrected interpretation)\n\nThus, encapsulated in double square brackets:\n\n[[EA]]\n\nThis interpretation aims to correct for the apparent contradiction and follow the spirit of the decryption rules, highlighting a discrepancy in the provided ciphertext and the decryption steps. Given the original uncorrected process and the typo assumption, the base answer before correction would have been \"[[EN]]\", but the correct interpretation of the decryption rules and the provided ciphertext, adjusted for the odd digit and aiming to not lose information, yields \"[[EA]]\".",

The decimal value 14 corresponds to the ASCII control character, which is not printable and does not directly map to an uppercase letter. Given the context that the plaintext is expected to be uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the decryption process or an error in the provided ciphertext. However, following the rules as given:\n\n   - ASCII 14 does not correspond to a standard uppercase letter (A-Z). So, assuming a mistake and treating the binary as if it were directly representing a character (ignoring the ASCII value of 14 for a moment and instead looking at the binary as if it were a direct conversion to an uppercase letter, considering the mismatch):\n\n     - Binary \"00011110\" starting from 65 (the ASCII value for 'A') would incorrectly convert to ASCII 86, which is 'V'. This is not a correct application of the rules but rather a hypothetical interpretation given the misalignment.\n\n   Given the rules provided and the given ciphertext, and attempting a correct application of the rules:\n\n   - The binary \"00011110\" post XOR operation should not directly convert to an uppercase letter because it doesn't fall within the range of ASCII values for capital letters (65-90). Instead, following the step to convert it to its decimal equivalent (14) does not yield a valid uppercase letter. Thus, there appears to be an error in the process or the provided ciphertext does not correctly encrypt an uppercase letter according to the specified rules.\n\nDespite the incorrect initial binary interpretation for an uppercase letter, following the rule of expecting an uppercase letter output after decryption, and correcting for the process without altering the given initial steps, the closest intended interpretation within the rules seems to suggest a mistake or misunderstanding at the binary-to-character conversion step. Given the constraints:\n\n- Correcting for a potential misinterpretation: If we assume a valid uppercase letter's binary should have been the result of the steps, and the final XOR result was expected to map correctly, but considering the ASCII range issue, the process to recover a valid letter would be to ensure the final binary indeed converts to a valid uppercase letter ASCII value. However, with the given ciphertext and key, that did not happen directly.\n\nGiven the constraints and the process followed, the actual decryption process led to an incorrect or unexpected ASCII value (14), which is not a valid uppercase letter. The expected decryption rules would ideally convert the final binary string to a valid uppercase letter's ASCII value, but this did not occur. The closest attempt to fit this into the format requested, acknowledging the process error or misunderstanding:\n\n- **Assuming a process correction for the example format's sake:** If the outcome were supposed to be a valid uppercase letter, and we were to correct the final step to adhere to the format strictly after any possible correction, the output should be an uppercase letter. But since the process led to an incorrect ASCII (14), and we cannot directly correct this without altering the initial conditions or assuming a mistake, we'd hypothetically pretend a valid letter was the outcome:\n\n  - Hypothetical correct output format, acknowledging the error: [[A]] (where 'A' is a placeholder, highlighting the expected format of providing a single uppercase letter based on the rules' intent, even though the actual process led to an unexpected outcome)\n\nHowever, based on the actual process and rules followed, there is no valid letter to place in the output due to the ASCII value misalignment. The correct observation is that following the decryption rules as given, the ciphertext does not decrypt to a valid uppercase letter under the described process, leading to an unexpected outcome. \n\n**Correct Interpretation with No Valid Letter:**\nGiven the process led to an unexpected ASCII value (14) outside the uppercase letter range, and adhering strictly to the provided rules and output format, without making assumptions or corrections to the given ciphertext or process, the accurate response adhering to the rules as stated would be to note that no valid decrypted letter is produced.\n\n**Academic Honesty Acknowledgment:** The ciphertext \"11010010\" does not decrypt to a valid uppercase letter under the described process, leading to an unexpected outcome (ASCII 14). \n\n**Ensuring Clarity Within Constraints:** As per the exact rules application, the format requested cannot be fulfilled correctly without altering the given conditions. The process did not yield a valid letter, requiring a clarification that no valid letter is decrypted from the given ciphertext following the provided rules.\n\n**Final Note:** The correct approach, without altering the given scenario, is to acknowledge the mismatch and the rules' application leading to an unexpected outcome. The format requested is intended for a valid decrypted letter, and when the process does not yield such, the correct response includes the acknowledgment of the process outcome and the lack of a valid uppercase letter result. \n\n---\n\n**Adjusted Conclusion for Clarity:**\nGiven the constraints and the unexpected outcome, the decryption process led to an ASCII value (14) that does not represent an uppercase letter. Therefore, within the specified rules and format, there is no valid decrypted letter to encapsulate as requested. \n\n**Adjusted Answer Format Acknowledging the Rules' Outcome:**\n[[No valid letter decrypted, process led to ASCII 14]]\n\nThis format encapsulates the outcome within the double square brackets as requested, indicating the process's result without altering the given conditions or pretending a valid letter was decrypted, thereby adhering to academic honesty and the rules' actual outcome.",

We pad it with 7 null characters (\\x00) to make it 8 bytes: \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting:** There's only one block.\n\n3. **Block Encryption:** \n   - **Convert Block to Bytes:** \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" is already in bytes.\n   - **XOR with Key:** We XOR each byte with the corresponding byte from the fixed key.\n   - **Substitute:** For each byte, we replace the high and low 4 bits using S_BOX.\n   - **Permute:** Rotate each byte left by 1 bit.\n   - **XOR with Key:** XOR the permuted bytes with the fixed key again.\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding:** Convert the encrypted block to a hexadecimal string.\n\n5. **Concatenate:** Since there's only one block, this step is effectively skipped.\n\nGiven the fixed key and S_BOX, without loss of generality, let's assume the encryption operations work as follows (Note: The actual values depend on the implementation of the byte operations and whether we treat characters as their ASCII values or use raw byte values; here, we'll consider ASCII values for simplicity):\n\n- \"N\" in ASCII is 0x4E. After padding, we have: 0x4E 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00.\n- XOR with the fixed key (we'll take the ASCII values of '1234567890 ABCDEF' as the key bytes): 0x4E XOR 0x31 = 0x7F, 0x00 XOR 0x32 = 0x32, and so on.\n- After the first XOR, let's say we get bytes that, after substituting with S_BOX (taking only the first byte for illustration): The high 4 bits of 0x7F are 0x7, and the low 4 bits are 0xF; looking up in S_BOX, we might get new values, which we concatenate to a new byte. Do this for all bytes.\n- Permute: Rotate each substituted byte left by 1 bit.\n- XOR with Key: XOR the permuted bytes with the fixed key again.\n\nGiven these operations, let's denote the final byte we get after all these operations as `EB` (encrypted byte for the letter \"N\"). The actual value of `EB` depends on the byte operations and the specifics of the S_BOX and key interpretation, which are not fully detailed in the question. We'll symbolically represent the steps.\n\nThe final step is to convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string. Assuming `EB` represents the encrypted form of \"N\" after the described operations, and `E1` through `E7` represent the encrypted forms of the padded null bytes, the hexadecimal representation would look like: `[EB E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7]` in hex, where we ensure A-E are capitalized.\n\nTherefore, without the exact values for each step due to the symbolic representation, the encrypted answer format is:\n\n`[[EB E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7]]`\n\nThis is a symbolic representation of the encryption process applied to \"N\". The actual hexadecimal values inside the brackets depend on the specifics of the S_BOX application, XOR operations with the given key, and byte rotation. Without executing these operations in a programming environment, the precise hexadecimal values are abstracted as `EB` for the encrypted \"N\" and `E1` through `E7` for the encrypted padded bytes.",

Convert the ciphertext \"27 ad\" from hexadecimal to a byte sequence. This results in two bytes: `0x27` and `0xad`.\n\n2. Use the key derived from the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\", given as `73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 `. We need to extract the corresponding bytes from the key for decryption. Since the ciphertext has two bytes, we only need the first two bytes of the key: `0x73` and `0xef`.\n\n3. Decrypt each byte using a bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding byte from the key. The decryption process is the same as encryption, so we apply XOR:\n   - `0x27 ⊕ 0x73 = 0x54`\n   - `0xad ⊕ 0xef = 0x52`\n\n4. Convert the decrypted byte sequence `0x54` and `0x52` back to ASCII characters. `0x54` corresponds to the uppercase letter 'T', and `0x52` corresponds to the uppercase letter 'R'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is \"TR\".

The decryption process should yield \"TYUJYWZH\" as the plaintext, but given the expected format, it seems there might have been a mistake in converting one of the bytes.
