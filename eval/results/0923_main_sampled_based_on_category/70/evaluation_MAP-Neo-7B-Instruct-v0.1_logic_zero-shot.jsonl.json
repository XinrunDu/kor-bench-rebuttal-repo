The formula then becomes \"if p1, then not p2 and p2\". \n   - This is a contradiction because the \"if p1\" part of the conjunction implies a condition that could not be met simultaneously with the \"p2\" being true. Thus, it is a Falsehood Formula because it is true under all assignments.\n   \n2. **Formula (2):** \n   - Formula: (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n   - This formula can be simplified to \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\". However, this is syntactically incorrect because the \"and\" operator in the premise and the \"if..then\" operator in the conclusion use different propositions and connectives. The correct simplification would also be based on the equivalence of the two premises: \"p1 and p3 imply not p1 and not p2\". \n   - The \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\" can be interpreted as \"If p1 and p3 are true, then p1 and p2 must be false\". Since the \"if p1 and p3\" part of the conjunction cannot be true unless \"p1\" and \"p3\" are both true, the conclusion is incorrect. The formula does not hold under any assignment of truth values, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, both formulas are Falsehood Formulas, and the answer is [[A];[A]].\n\n*Note: The prioritization of logical connectives does not apply in this case, as the issue lies in the incorrect formation and interpretation of the formulas rather than the operation's priority.*",

According to the Resolution rule:\n   - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, we calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n\n   - Here, since we are dealing with propositional logic, and we already have the same literal in both clauses (p), we can proceed with resolution.\n\n   - Resolve C1 and C2 by eliminating the common literal (p):\n     - C = dispel(C1, C2) = (p ∨ q) - p\n\n4.

The exact number in iterations can be more context-dependent on the specific clauses involved and how the resolution rules are applied.\n\nFinal output:\n- \"Plausible\"\n- The number of cycles needed to confirm a satisfiable assignment would be once or twice, assuming the initial transformations and operations are followed correctly through the resolution steps. \n\nPlease note, for more complex or specific inputs, the algorithm's expected iterations could vary.

The predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nGiven f(x, y) = x + y and g(x, y) = x * y, let's apply the rule:\n\n- For every x, y in N, let z be such that z = f(x, y).\n- Since fJ(x, y) = x + y, we can rewrite the formula as: ∀x∀y∃zF(x + y, z) for z = x + y.\n\nSince z = x + y, we can rewrite the formula as: ∀x∀yF(f(x, y), f(x, y)).\nHowever, due to the nature of the initial formula and the interpretation, we recognize that the operation \"+\" doesn't apply directly on entities in this context.\n\n- The definition of FJ(x, y) as x = y doesn't alter the fundamental structure of the formula since, under interpretation J, f(x, y) = (x + y) doesn't directly correspond to an identity x = y.\n\nThe interpretation should be adjusted given the nature of the operations and the claim that entities in E are natural numbers. If the operation \"+\" is incorrectly applied directly, the formula's correct implementation in accordance with the interpretation would be:\n\n(1) ∀x∀y∃zF(f(x, y), z) should be rewritten to acknowledge the nature of the entities and operations:\n\n\"∀x∀y, for each pair (x, y) in the set of natural numbers N, there exists a z such that z is in N (following the operation fJ(x, y) = x + y), and z equals the sum of x and y, which means that:\n\n- If f(x, y) is interpreted as the sum of x and y under J, then: ∀x∀y F(f(x, y), f(x, y)).\n\n(2) ∃xF(f(x,y),g(x,z))\n\nUnder the rule:\n\n- Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n- Entity set E = natural numbers N.\n- a' = 2.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n- Given f(x, y) = x + y, g(x, y) = x * y:\n- The formula ∃xF(f(x, y), g(x, z)) essentially states that there exists an x in N for which the cumulative value of f(x, y) is equal to g(x, z).\n\nGiven the operation definitions:\n\n- f(x, y) = fJ(x, y) = x + y.\n- g(x, y) = gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n\nThe formula becomes: \"There exists an x in N such that the sum of f(x, y) equals the product of g(x, z), where z depends on the values of x and y.\"\n\nGiven this, the direct implementation in a more coherent form under interpretation J would be:\n\n(2) ∃xF(x + y, x * y), which unfortunately doesn't directly translate to the intended meaning given the interpretations of the operations and the entities (natural numbers). The interpretation would require redefining the operations or the entities to align with the intended meaning.\n\nFor clarity and correct application of the given rule, the interpretation should be adjusted to accommodate the properties and operations described. The corrected implementation would require reevaluating the nature of the entities and operations in the context of the provided rule.

If SIP is false, it implies no S are P, making SOP true by the \"*\" relationship.\n  - SOP is a universal negative proposition, meaning it asserts that no S are P. If SOP is false, it implies at least one S is P, making SIP true according to the same \"*\" relationship.\n  - SAP is a universal affirmative proposition, directly asserting that all S are P. If SAP is true, it means every S is P, making SEP impossible because it contradicts the universal claim of SAP (I.e., some S are not P, which contradicts SAP). Thus, SEP is false given SAP is true.\n  - Conversely, if SEP is true (meaning some S are not P), it directly negates SAP (since all S should be P in a true SAP proposition), making SAP false.\n\nTherefore, the respective truth values based on the specified relationships are:\n\n- SIP false: SOP true\n- SOP false: SIP true\n- SAP true: SEP false\n- SEP true: SAP false\n\nFormatted:\n\n- SIP false: SOP True\n- SOP false: SIP True\n- SAP True: SEP False\n- SEP True: SAP False\n\nNote: These conclusions adhere strictly to the principles of logic as described, and the relationships between the propositions are interpreted according to the rule set.

On the other hand, Student C's statement (E) is false because it incorrectly asserts that no students, specifically Li Cong among them, have learned typing.\n\n- **Relation: Between I propositions and O propositions** (Relation &): Student B's statement is an affirmative proposition (I) about some students who have learned typing, which when combined with Student C's negative proposition (O), forms a particular and universal relationship that is true because a subset of students (those who have learned typing) is included in the universal quantity (all students in Class A).\n\n- **Relation Between I propositions and E propositions** (Relation #): When comparing Student B's statement (I) and Student C's statement (E), we observe that both are separate and can coexist. Student B's statement that some students have learned typing while Student C's statement that some students have not learned typing is both true simultaneously: a subset of students in Class A has leveled up in typing skills, but there are others who haven't.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types can be structured as follows:\n\n- **Relation ***: Some students have learned typing (B) has a true connection to Li Cong having learned typing (C).\n- **Relation #**: Student B's true statement (A) contrasts with Student C's false statement (E).\n- **Relation &**: The specific truth of some students having learned typing (B) is combined with the broader truth that all students in Class A should have learned typing, highlighting their unanimous presence.\n- **Relation %**: While B and C each represent a true component of the complete truth (some students have learned typing), their combined relationship emphasizes that some students have not learned typing, making it a partially true statement within the universal context of Class A.\n\nTherefore, the logical relationship between the statements is complex and reflects the truths and fallacies inherent within them.

Therefore, from what is true for all S, we can infer that P is true.\"\n\nThis argument structure is:\n- Major premise: ∀M⇒P (From all M, P follows)\n- Minor premise: ∀S⇒M (From all S, M follows)\n- Conclusion: ∀S⇒P (From all S, P follows)\n\nLet's match this argument with the specified figures and moods based on the rules provided:\n\n#### Figure I\nThe premises of the argument align with the mood AAA:\n- Major premise: ∀M⇒P (AAA)\n- Minor premise: ∀S⇒M (AAA)\n- Conclusion: ∀S⇒P (AAA)\nThis mood occurs in Figure I, where the premises are true for every possible state of affairs (universal affirmative premises).\n\n#### Figure II\nThe argument's structure doesn't perfectly fit the moods defined in Figure II, as Figure II requires AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO proofs for the syllogism \"S()M\" leading to \"S()P\". The argument given doesn't match these specific conditions for either AEE or EAE.\n\n#### Figure III\nThe argument structure doesn't match with the moods AII, EIO, IAI, or OAO directly in Figure III. Figure III generally involves inductive and hypothetical reasoning rather than deductive inferences.\n\n#### Figure IV\nSimilar to Figure II, the argument's structure doesn't exactly fit the moods in Figure IV, as Figure IV requires AEE, EIO, IAI, or OAO proofs for the syllogism \"P()M\" leading to \"P()S\". The argument given is not directly matching any of these specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the argument \"For all M, P is true, and from what is true for all S, M follows, we can infer that from all S, P follows\" corresponds most closely to the Figure I syllogism in mood AAA. This is because the argument follows a universal affirmative structure typical of Figure I syllogisms.\n\n**Answer:** The argument corresponds to Figure I with the mood AAA.\n\nPlease note, this analysis uses a direct interpretation of the logical statements provided, and there may be alternative structures or interpretations that could be considered valid depending on the specific rules or criteria for determining the figure and mood of a syllogism.

Here is why:\n\n- In Figure IV, the premises are generally affirmative, similar to the conditions set by ∀P⇒M and ∀M⇒¬S.\n- The conclusion, ∀S⇒¬P, aligns with the universal scope seen in premises indicating that for every proposition P, not P is valid.\n\nHowever, the direct mood that corresponds closely to the argument's structure and implications is likely IAI (since the premises lead to a conclusion that at least one case where S is true leads to not P, fitting I: ∃p1⇒p2 and O: ∃p1⇒¬p2, though not as directly as other figures).\n\nThus, the argument falls somewhere between Figure IV and a mood that best fits IAI:\n- Figure IV due to its structure leading towards a universal conclusion;\n- Mood IAI due to its specific implications regarding at least one case where S being true leads to not P.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n- **Figure IV**: It best fits the argument due to its structure leading to a universal conclusion.\n- **Mood IAI**: It closely aligns with the logical implications provided in the premises. However, given the universal nature of the premises and conclusions, the argument could also be associated with other valid moods or figures under further analysis or different logical contexts. The closest match is Figure IV for its structure and mood IAI for its implications.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is simplified and assumes a direct correspondence between the given premises and valid moods, which in a more detailed examination might require a deeper analysis or different logical contexts.

While this scenario does not directly fit this criteria, as there's a clear cause-and-effect relationship (removing salivary glands leading to faster wound healing), the method's principle of comparing groups under different conditions can be seen in the experimental setup where the two groups (with and without salivary glands) were created.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** focuses on the direct observation of cause-and-effect relationships, where changes in one variable correspond to changes in another.

This method is relevant in the context of Klaprozli's initial observation that the extracted substance from leachite was radioactive, indicating the potential presence of another radioactive element besides uranium.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method examines the effect (P, radioactivity) when the cause (S, the substance from leachite) is present and absent. It's not directly applicable to the described scenario because once uranium is present in the leachite, its absence doesn't negate the presence of other radioactive material.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: In this method, a positive group of instances where S (the substance from leachite) and P (radioactivity) occur together is presented, followed by a negative group where S is absent along with the absence of radioactivity under differing conditions. This method aligns perfectly with the scenario because the initial presence of leachite and the subsequent extraction of uranium and identification of new radioactive elements (radium and polonium) can be seen as a positive group, while the high radioactivity level in the remaining samples after uranium extraction can be considered a negative group. This pattern of positive instances followed by a negative counter-instance is a crucial aspect of the method ꙮ used to infer a causal relationship.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method focuses on changes in S (the substance) corresponding to changes in P (radioactivity), which is implicit in the observation that the radioactivity level of the remaining samples is significantly higher after uranium extraction. This method doesn't directly tie to the discovery of radium and polonium but is consistent with the overall causality implied by the substantial increase in radioactivity.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves a set of conditions and known causal relationships between various elements and properties (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.). While the Curie couple's discovery does involve established knowledge (uranium's radioactive properties and its interaction with other elements), the primary method of reasoning in this context is the combination of Method ꙮ and prior knowledge, as the method ⚘ typically involves a broader set of conditions and causal dependencies that are not explicitly stated in the provided passage.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent method for the causal derivation of the passage of the discourse is Method ꙮ.

The \"+Ψ attribute\" in this analogy would refer to the additional condition or characteristic that H University aims to achieve or has already attained, which, in this specific case, is the ability to reach a new level through reform.

The logical operation here is to infer the presence of a specific attribute from the known presence of other attributes or conditions that are deemed critical for success.

This situation requires a careful reevaluation of the premises and plausibility of all hypotheses involved, as the initial acceptance of these hypotheses cannot be automatically confirmed in the face of a contradiction. Here's why:\n\n- The initial acceptance of hypotheses {r_1, r_2, ..., r_n} based on the observations and evidence supports their plausibility. However, the emergence of hypothesis r_n+1 that contradicts the conjunction of the previous hypotheses presents a paradoxical scenario.\n  \n- Logically, when faced with a contradiction, it becomes necessary to reexamine the foundational premises and the criteria for the plausibility of hypotheses. This process involves:\n    - Reassessment of the evidence upon which the original hypotheses were accepted.\n    - Reevaluation of the criteria used to assess the plausibility of r_n+1 in relation to the existing set of hypotheses {r_1, r_2, ..., r_n}.\n    \n- The process of reevaluating these hypotheses requires a nuanced approach that considers:\n    - The coherence and consistency between r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, and r_n+1.\n    - The comparative plausibility of r_n+1 against the set of other hypotheses and the observed evidence.\n    - The possibility of misinterpretation or incomplete understanding of the observed phenomenon or the available evidence.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate response to this situation is to \"reassess the plausibility of all hypotheses,\" as it encompasses a thorough examination of the evidence and reasoning processes involved, allowing for a more robust and accurate understanding to emerge from the paradox.

Here's how:\n\n- A asks if B has tickets, but B provides information about how they acquired the tickets, suggesting that the act of obtaining the tickets was more challenging than B initially stated. This aligns with the C* Principle's first part, which encourages speakers to provide information that is not necessarily weaker but adheres to the principle of not giving less information than what the speaker knows or assumes to be true.\n\nOption B (C% Principle) and C (C!

This choice was motivated by the Criterion of the Speaker (C* Principle), which advises speakers not to convey information that is less certain than their knowledge permits.\n\nIn this scenario, B's statement \"I like her\" is a response to A's question about their feelings for Xiao Hong, and B opted for \"like\" because they did not wish to reveal a stronger, more enthusiastic affection than they felt comfortable expressing. This reflects a tactful and considerate strategy that aligns with the C* Principle's guidelines on speech and knowledge.\n\nHence, the principle B applied to tactfully reveal the truth is the C* Principle.

C* Principle:** \nThe C* Principle addresses the speaker's criterion of ensuring that their claim is stronger in information than what their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle. In the given scenario, speaker A does not know if \"you are a college student\" is established. Therefore, A strictly adheres to the C* Principle, as A does not assert more information than is justified by their knowledge (not knowing the fact explicitly).\n\n**B. C% Principle:**\nThe C% Principle focuses on the \"Minimalization Criterion\" - speaking as little as possible. However, in this scenario, A and B are not strictly adhering to minimalization. Speaker A's statement \"I believe you are a college student\" is not minimal since it assumes more (that A believes B is a college student) than A states (that A believes B is a college student). Conversely, speaker B's statement directly establishes that they know B's status as a college student, which implies minimalization. Thus, C% Principle does not strictly apply.\n\n**C. C! Principle:**\nThe C! Principle addresses the use of lengthy or obfuscated expressions. Here, the guiding principle is that the meaning should be clear and not obscured for the hearer's comprehension. In this scenario, A's statement is clear and straightforward: \"I believe you are a college student,\" which is not obscure or lengthy, and B's subsequent affirmation of the same statement does not involve the use of lengthy or obscure expressions. Therefore, C!

Specifically, Xiao Ma is adhering to the Speaker's Criterion in this instance:\n\n- **Speaker's Criterion**: Xiao Ma does not let their statement (\"Beer is part of the food in the food box\") be weaker in information than their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement (e.g., \"Food and non-food items\" being mixed in the box) conflicts with the Information Principle, which requires communicating the truth as directly and concisely as possible.\n\n2. **C% Principle** focuses on minimalization and indicates that speakers should speak as little as possible to achieve communication's purpose fully.\n\n- This principle is less directly applicable to the scenario mentioned, as it primarily emphasizes minimizing words and speaking to the minimum extent necessary without a direct focus on interpreting the content. However, one could argue that Xiao Ma's action of notifying or discussing with someone that the beer is still warm (which, by common practice, is a concern or indication of how food should be handled) approximates the spirit of minimizing unnecessary communication without directly contradicting the principle.\n\n3. **C! Principle** emphasizes the use of clear, concise, and unambiguous expressions and discourages the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n\n- While Xiao Ma's actions (noting the warm beer) are clear and serve a communicative purpose, this principle is less directly applicable than the C* Principle. The C!

In this case, the mother makes a claim about being the baby's mother based on her direct relationship and knowledge of the baby's parentage.

In picking up the baby, the mother minimizes her actions (verbal and physical) to communicate her intention effectively, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on speaking as little as possible to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Lastly, the C! Principle, where it advises against the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason, can be linked to the situation. The mother, upon picking up the baby, does not use a lengthy or marked expression to indicate her intentions or identity. Instead, she opts for a simple, direct action, which adheres to the principle's guideline of avoiding lengthy expressions.\n\nHence, considering the provided scenario, the situation best aligns with the [[C* Principle / C% Principle / C!

Let's examine how each principle aligns with the scenario:\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle focuses on the criterion of what the speaker says and how the hearer infers from the speech. In the scenario, Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse, which traditionally implies a female nurse due to the gendered nature of the interaction. Thus, the speaker's criterion that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" is satisfied because the connection between giving flowers and a female nurse is the norm, which minimizes the risk of being weaker in information. The hearer's inference (CQ1) is applicable here, as it correctly infers that the speaker knows the context implies giving flowers to a female due to the normative expectations of the situation.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle is about minimizing the use of language and the interpretation of sentences based on conventional conventions. In the scenario, Xiao Wang giving flowers to a nurse adheres to conventional norms, where the recipient is expected to be a female due to the gender of the act. This principle guides the hearer to understand that if Xiao Wang speaks of giving flowers to a nurse without explicitly mentioning the gender, it is expected to be inferred that the nurse is female. The hearer's inference (CI2) aligns with this, where it acknowledges that the speaker's aim to \"speak as little as possible\" while the hearer aims to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle emphasizes clarity and the use of language. Here, Xiao Wang's action of giving flowers to a nurse, understanding that the listener infers the gender of the nurse based on conventional norms, aligns with the principle's emphasis on clear expression. The principle's guideline against using lengthy or obscure expressions would not apply, as the scenario straightforwardly conveys the action of giving flowers to a nurse, which is a clear and common expression.\n\nTherefore, the scenario primarily conforms to the C* and C% principles, with a minimal alignment to the C! principle. The most fitting answer is [[A/C/A]]. \n\nThe C* Principle is particularly relevant because it deals with the speaker's knowledge and the hearer's inference based on contextual knowledge and the expectations of the situation (in this case, the gender of the nurse), while the C% Principle focuses on minimizing the use of language to ensure effective communication within the context of the situation. The C! Principle aligns more broadly with the principle that encourages clear and direct communication, which is a shared goal for both the speaker and the hearer.

The comparison of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to the story of the small donkey and large tigers illustrates how a smaller entity, though seemingly vulnerable, can be made solid and ultimately prevail over a larger, seemingly stronger entity.\n\nTherefore, the argumentation method used in this scenario is a combination of E+ (Direct) and Contra- (Indirect) methods, with minor indications of Elim- Method. This blend allows for a multi-faceted approach to argue for the effectiveness and invincibility of smaller forces against seemingly overwhelming odds. Thus, the correct choices are [[D/E]] format.\n\nPlease note that while there are overlaps between the methods mentioned (direct vs. indirect), the specific examples provided depict a unique blend that adheres to the custom argumentation methods described initially.

The Universal Affirmative is the premise (\"If Not p, then q\").\n2. The conclusion (\"Therefore, p\") follows directly from the premise using logical transposition, according to the rules of syllogism.\n\nThis logic structure fits perfectly within the Syllogistic Method, which is systematic and formulates reasoning in a structured way, making clear the relationships between premises and conclusions. Therefore, the answer is B. Syl+ Method.\n\nA. E+ Method focuses on using specific instances, which doesn't align well with the universal propositions and syllogistic reasoning structure seen in the given argument.\n\nC.

While they are indeed logical methods for argumentation, they address indirect reasoning patterns that don't align with the direct challenge posed by the task (e.g., proving \"p\" directly from \"Not p\" and its implications).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate identification for the method used in this argumentation task is B.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Direct Argumentation Method**: The E+ Method is employed through the use of specific instances (the pressure exerted by light on matter it strikes) to argue for the truth of the proposition \"light has mass.\" It directly provides evidence to support the claim.\n\n- **Indirect Argumentation Methods**: The Contra- and Elim- Methods are used to indirectly support the original proposition.\n    - **Contra- Method**: The argument refutes the contrary proposition, suggesting that if light were massless, it would not generate such pressure on matter it strikes. This effectively confirms the original proposition's necessity by negating the contrary proposition's validity.\n    - **Elim- Method**: This method indirectly determines the original proposition (\"light has mass\") by eliminating other possibilities that could be considered false. The argument eliminates the possibilities that light could not have mass and still generate the observed pressure. This indirect elimination of alternative explanations or conditions strengthens the original proposition's validity.\n\nHence, the argumentation method used in the statement involves a combination of the E+ Method (direct) and both the Contra- and Elim- Methods (indirect). Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n[[A/B/C/D/E/F] A, E, D]\n\nThis combination of methods reflects a sophisticated logical approach, utilizing direct instances to support a claim, refuting and eliminating contradictory possibilities to further bolster the original proposition's validity.",

Here's a more detailed breakdown of how the argumentation process works:\n\n1. **Relevant Properties and Objects**: The properties and objects we're concerned with are the definition of a star, the Sun as a star, and its role in the solar system.\n\n2. **Logical Operations or Reasoning Patterns**: The argument uses a combination of deductive reasoning (based on scientific facts about the Sun and the solar system) and a logical division of cases (considering the mass distribution and the Sun's central role).\n\n3. **Formatted According to Specified Notation and Symbols**:\n   - The argument starts with a clear and concise definition of a star, which is then applied to the Sun.\n   - It then uses deductive reasoning to support the claim that the Sun is a star, citing the Sun's mass and its role in the solar system.\n\nGiven the argument's focus on proving the Sun's status as a star by considering its mass and its central position within the solar system, the argumentation method used is the Case+ Method. This method is particularly suited to the task because it allows for a detailed, case-by-case analysis of the proposition's truthfulness under various conditions. The argument not only cites scientific facts but also engages in a logical division of cases to establish a comprehensive understanding of the Sun's status as a star.\n\n- A.E+ Method focuses on specific instances and might not cover the broader context of the argument.\n- B.Syl+ Method relies on universal propositions, which is a broader approach but not necessarily tailored to the specific conditions discussed in the argument.\n- C.Metaph+ Method uses metaphors but doesn't explicitly address the specific conditions or cases as this argument does.\n- E.Contra- Method seeks to refute a contrary proposition but doesn't necessarily cover the full spectrum of conditions or cases as in the argument at hand.\n- F.Elim- Method seeks to eliminate other possibilities of the proposition's truth, which is a specific approach but doesn't match the comprehensive case analysis performed here.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is D.Case+ Method.

However, the primary fallacy in this case is the incorrect interpretation of the quantification and the conclusion drawn from it.\n\nThe premise states: ∀x∃yR(x, y), indicating that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number.
