The key is the SHA-256 hash value of \"SECRET_KEY\", which is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n\n3. Since we only have one byte in the ciphertext, we only need to consider the first byte of the key, which is 0x73.\n\n4. Perform the XOR operation: 0x37 XOR 0x73 = 0x4A.\n\n5. Convert the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string: 0x4A corresponds to 'J' in uppercase ASCII encoding.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [[J]]",
