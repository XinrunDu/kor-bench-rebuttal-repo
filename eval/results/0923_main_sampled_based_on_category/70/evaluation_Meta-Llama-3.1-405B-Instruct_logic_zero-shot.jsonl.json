However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true).

Since `~(p1=::>p2)` is true only in the `✓|x` scenario for `p1|p2`, combining it with `p2` (which is `x` in that scenario) results in a false (`x`) outcome for `~(p1=::>p2)&p2` in all scenarios because `p2` being `x` makes the `&` operation false.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this analysis overlooks the fact that `~(p1=::>p2)` can also be true in other scenarios where `p1=::>p2` is false, but given our scenario, the combination with `p2` being true (`✓`) is what we're focusing on. The mistake here is in prematurely concluding the outcome without considering all truth values for `p1` and `p2`.\n\nCorrecting this:\n\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` is true whenever `p1=::>p2` is false. This occurs not just when `p1` is true and `p2` is false but also needs to consider the implication's truth table.\n- `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Thus, its negation `~(p1=::>p2)` is true in this case.\n- However, since we're combining this with `p2` using `&`, we need `p2` to be true for the whole expression to be true. This creates a contradiction with our initial condition for `~(p1=::>p2)` being true based solely on the implication's falseness.\n\nThe correct way to view this:\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true if `p1` is true and `p2` is false, but since we're also requiring `p2` to be true (`&p2`), this specific scenario actually doesn't fulfill the formula's requirement.\n- However, if `p1` is false, `~(p1=::>p2)` can still be true because a false `p1` makes `p1=::>p2` true regardless of `p2`, but adding `p2` being true makes the whole expression dependent on `p2`'s truth.\n\nGiven this, the formula can actually be true under certain conditions (e.g., when `p1` is false and `p2` is true, the first part `~(p1=::>p2)` can be true because `p1=::>p2` would be true due to `p1` being false making the implication true, but then `&p2` also being true fulfills the whole expression). Therefore, it's not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula because it's not always true or always false under all assignments.\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nThis formula suggests an equivalence between `p1&p3` and `~p1&~p2`.\n\n- For `p1&p3` to be true, both `p1` and `p3` must be true.\n- For `~p1&~p2` to be true, both `p1` and `p2` must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, the formula cannot be true under all assignments because the truth of `p1` is contradictory between the two sides of the equivalence. If `p1` is true (to satisfy `p1&p3`), then `~p1` is false, making `~p1&~p2` false. Similarly, if `p1` is false (to satisfy `~p1&~p2`), then `p1&p3` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, this formula is not a Truth Formula because it cannot be true under all assignments due to the direct contradiction in the truth value of `p1` required by each side of the equivalence. However, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because we're looking at the structure and not evaluating all possible truth assignments directly in this explanation. The correct approach would involve a truth table analysis for a more precise determination, but given the explanation, we see it's not always true, suggesting it's not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, reflecting further, given the direct contradiction in conditions for `p1` to satisfy both sides of the equivalence simultaneously, it indicates the formula cannot be satisfied under any condition, suggesting it leans towards being a Falsehood Formula. This is because for the formula to be true, `p1` must both be true (for `p1&p3`) and false (for `~p1&~p2`) at the same time, which is impossible.\n\n### Corrected Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical contradiction in the conditions required for each formula to be true under all assignments:\n\n- (1) is **Neither** a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it can be true under specific conditions but not all.\n- (2) is actually a **Falsehood Formula** because it presents a logical contradiction that cannot be resolved under any truth assignment, making it impossible to be true under any condition.\n\n**Answer:** [[C];[B]]",

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001.

To find the paired disjunctive terms, we need to look at the true assignments of the expression and match them with the binary representations corresponding to hexadecimal numbers.\n\nHowever, the provided expression is not directly in a form that allows for straightforward application of the rules for paired disjunctive terms since it is a product of two disjunctions. We need to find the equivalent disjunctive normal form (DNF) or identify the pattern that allows us to classify it according to the given definitions.\n\nLet's analyze the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Expansion**: The given expression (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) needs to be expanded to find its disjunctive normal form. However, given the rules, we aim to identify the paired disjunctive terms directly.\n\n2. **Observation**: Notice that both disjunctions include ¬q, meaning that for the entire expression to be true, ¬q must be true. The variations come from p and ¬p, and r's presence in both disjunctions but with different partners (p and ¬p).\n\n3. **Simplification**: To find a simpler representation that adheres to the rules of paired disjunctive terms, we must look at the combinations of p, ¬p, and r that make the expression true, given that ¬q is a constant requirement.\n\n4. **Paired Disjunctive Terms Identification**: Considering the rules for paired disjunctive terms, we look for combinations that correspond to hexadecimal numbers based on their truth assignments. However, the direct identification from the given expression is complex without expanding it into a full disjunctive normal form.\n\n5. **Approach for Denotation**: Given the complexity of directly applying the rules to the expression as it stands, and the need to adhere strictly to the format, we must acknowledge the challenge in directly providing a denotation without a clear identification of the paired disjunctive terms through the usual process.\n\nGiven these considerations and the specific format requirements, without the direct expansion or a clear path to identify the paired disjunctive terms as per the rules, we cannot accurately denote the expression according to the specified notation.

For 3 variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

To determine if it is a basic formula, an all-even formula, or an all-odd formula, we need to identify the indices (i) of these terms.\n\n   - The first term is (¬p∧¬q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 111 (all are true), which is 7 in hexadecimal.

The number of combinations can be calculated using 2^7, because for each of the 7 even indices (excluding 0), there are two choices - include the term or not.

However, Method A alone does not fully capture the transformation, as it does not account for the exchange of the subject and predicate positions.\n\nNext, we see that the subject (\"true revolutionaries\") and the predicate (\"upright and open\") in the original proposition are exchanged in the inferred proposition, which aligns with the definition of conversion in Method B. However, Method B is not directly applicable here because the original proposition is a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A), and Method B's definition does not exactly match the transformation from A to the inferred proposition's form.\n\nFinally, considering Method C, which involves performing obversion first and then conversion, we see that it perfectly matches our transformation:\n\n1. Obversion of \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" gives us \"All true revolutionaries are not non-upright and open.\"\n2. Conversion of this obverted proposition exchanges the subject and predicate, resulting in \"All non-upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" which is equivalent to the inferred proposition when accounting for the nuances of negation and predicate contrary.\n\nTherefore, the method used for this inference is Method C, as it involves both changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary (obversion) and then exchanging the subject and predicate (conversion).\n\n### Answer: [[C]]",

However, the conditions in the scenario are kept constant, and the focus is on the difference in outcomes (yields) between the two groups (Chinese hybrid rice vs. American rice varieties), not on the variation of other conditions.\n\n2. **Method ؆** involves observing if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. In this scenario, the presence of Chinese hybrid rice (S) corresponds to a higher yield (P), but we do not have direct evidence of the absence of S (Chinese hybrid rice) leading to the absence of P (high yield), as the scenario focuses on the comparison rather than the absence of S leading to an absence of effect.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** involves comparing a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions with a negative group where S is absent, and so is P, under varying conditions. This method doesn't perfectly match the scenario since the conditions are not varied between the positive and negative groups; they are kept constant for comparison.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** involves observing changes in S corresponding to changes in P.

The only variable differing between the two groups was the presence of salivary glands.\n\n2. **Outcome**: The wounds of the animals with intact salivary glands healed much faster than those without salivary glands.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the methods:\n\n- **Method ⸮**: This method suggests a causal relationship if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ. The scenario doesn't directly fit this description because it focuses on the difference in outcomes (wound healing speed) based on a single variable (presence of salivary glands), not on multiple varying conditions.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This seems to fit the scenario because faster wound healing (P) occurs when salivary glands (S) are present and does not occur (or occurs at a slower rate) when salivary glands are absent.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent, with varying other conditions. While the scenario has elements of this (presence of salivary glands leading to faster healing, and absence leading to slower healing), the \"varying other conditions\" aspect isn't explicitly explored in the scenario as described.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P.

This suggests a potential causal relationship between uranium and radioactivity.\n   \n2. **Removal of Uranium and Continued Radioactivity**: After extracting uranium, the remaining samples showed even higher levels of radioactivity than pure uranium. This indicates that the radioactivity cannot be solely attributed to uranium.\n\n3. **Discovery of New Elements (Radium and Polonium)**: Further research led to the isolation of radium and polonium from the leachate, which were identified as the sources of the remaining radioactivity.\n\nNow, let's examine which of the methods aligns with the causal derivation described:\n\n- **Method ⸮** involves multiple instances where S and P occur together under varying conditions. While uranium and radioactivity initially seem to fit this pattern, the discovery of radium and polonium complicates this, as they also contribute to radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ؆** suggests that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. However, the removal of uranium (S) did not eliminate radioactivity (P), suggesting other factors at play.\n\n- **Method ꙮ** involves a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The narrative about uranium, radium, and polonium does not directly describe a scenario where changes in one variable linearly correspond to changes in another in a straightforward manner applicable to this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘** suggests that if S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known, then S and P may have a causal relationship. This method is the closest fit because it deals with multiple elements (uranium, radium, polonium) having causal relationships with a common effect (radioactivity).

While the research does observe a correlation between active, encouraging educational styles and higher emotional intelligence across different families (which could imply varying conditions), it specifically contrasts this with outcomes from a different educational style. This makes it less about observing the same correlation under varying conditions and more about comparing outcomes between two distinct approaches.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship when the supposed effect (P) occurs in the presence of the supposed cause (S) and does not occur in its absence. The research does show that higher emotional intelligence (P) is observed in the presence of an active, encouraging educational style (S) and not observed (or is significantly lower) in its absence. However, the method's definition strictly implies a direct comparison of presence and absence of the cause in otherwise similar conditions, which isn't exactly how the research is framed.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where the supposed cause and effect are present together under varying conditions and a negative group where both are absent, again under varying conditions. The research findings closely match this description: a positive group with active educational style (S) and higher emotional intelligence (P) across different families, and a negative group with a passive educational style (absence of S) and lower emotional intelligence (absence of P), also across different conditions (families).\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method looks for a causal relationship when changes in the supposed cause correspond to changes in the supposed effect. While the research does observe different outcomes based on the educational style adopted, it does not explicitly document varying degrees of the cause leading to varying degrees of the effect in a continuous manner.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves identifying a causal relationship based on known causal relationships between other factors. The research does not engage with pre-existing causal relationships to derive its conclusion, so this method does not apply.\n\nBased on the analysis, the research's findings align most closely with **Method ꙮ**, as it involves identifying a correlation in a positive group (with the cause present) and contrasting it with a negative group (where the cause is absent), under varying conditions.\n\n**[[C]]**",

An assumption is made that the contrary of p (Not p) is true.\n3. It is then shown that if Not p is true, it leads to another proposition q.\n4. However, proposition q is known to be false (Not q).\n5. The conclusion drawn is that since the assumption of Not p leads to a false outcome, Not p itself must be false.\n6. Therefore, the original proposition p is true.\n\nThis pattern involves assuming the contrary of what is to be proven, showing that this assumption leads to a false or undesirable outcome, and thus concluding that the original proposition must be true. This is a clear example of indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting its contrary.\n\nThe correct answer is [[E]].",
