Most free datasets only offer questions, while the answers require payment.\n\nSo as a developer, how do we generate a dataset? The first rule of course is to use the rules provided by the textbook itself! Elementary: Once we have `question - answer pair`, we can leverage the LLM's ability to perform unsupervised learning to generate some kind of dataset. But first, let's describe the rules:\n\n1. Universal Quantifier is denoted by A. Symbolize the phrase 'All men are mortal' involving the n-ary predicate ‘being mortal’ as Ax F (x). To symbolize the relationship involving the 2-dimensional predicate ‘being loved by’ as Ax Ay G (x, y). Therefore, we can use G(x) to denote the n-ary predicate `x is mortal` , and G(x,y) to denote the 2-dimensional predicate `x is loved by y`.\n\n2. Existential Quantifier is denoted by E. Given a 1-ary predicate that states that some people do not like mathematics, symbolize this as Ex ¬ F (x). Using Ex and Ey to express that there is someone who likes someone can be symbolized as Ex Ey G (x, y).\n\n3. Logical Connectives include Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, and Implication. The negation of a predicate may be denoted by negating each part of the symbolic language.\n\n4. Finally, it is important to note whether the domain is universal (all people) or specific (such as living things). For instance, universal symbolization: ‘Man loves wisdom’ involves the two predicates F(x)='x is a man' and G(x,y)='x loves y'.",

But both would result in the same output since they negate the predicate differently. So in this case we can pick any one arbitrarily. I'll choose type E here. My reasoning is below:\n\n1) Change the quality of the original proposition by negating it -> 'Every natural number is a rational number' becomes 'Every natural number is NOT a rational number'\n2) Replace the predicate with its contrary -> 'non-rational_number'\n3) Put these two parts together following the format requirements given earlier-> [[Every_natural_number_is_NOT_non-some words here ...]]\n4) Adjust spacing as needed to make the output look natural-> [[Every natural number is NOT nonrational number]]\n\nTherefore my final answer is : [[Every_natural_number_is_NOT_nonrational_number.]]",

It is quite possible that for the bot there is not enough context to back off from the syllogistic reasoning mode and it attempts to replace the variables absentmindedly, as the pressure to follow examples with the same mood is strong.\n\nHowever, even in such a state, the bot at least partially succeeds. At first, it writes out the mood properly, even though it fails to explicitly designate it as 4th figure. Still, this mood information implies the figure. Afterwards, while filling in the moods, while it initially applies the rules without regard to the syllogistic constraints, when explicitly told to conform to a specific syllogism, it succeeds with no problem.\n\nIt is relevant to note that various testing showed that it is incapable to deduce, similarly to the case of the previous problem - that the syllogism is in the 4th figure, which is odd because the figure is heavily implied by the valid moods.\n\n### Example 1\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cO5NaY0V0H8?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n### Example 2\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3YUs6NN51PQ?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nWhile the bot is doing fairly well in syllogistically designated instances, it fails to directly conclude from freely worded premises and conclusions which figure and mood the syllogism is.\n",

For instance, let's say that we have two options for pursuing our career aspirations: Option A and Option B. We believe that following either of these paths will lead us towards achieving our goals. However, we are unsure which option is the better choice. In this case, we need to evaluate each options' premises to see if they support the conclusion that it leads to success. This evaluation typically forms the basis of hypothetical syllogism deduction.",

        "response": "[[[c*](φ∧HAlice(φ))]]\n` `**Explanation**: In this scenario, we are looking for a way to express Alice's belief regarding the prolonged execution of the loop command c* until some proposition φ holds true. According to the rules described by the previously defined Dynamic Logic language (see here), the expression [c*](φ) represents the condition that after executing the loop command c* an arbitrary number of times, the proposition φ will necessarily hold. However, this does not capture the aspect of Alice's belief about the persistence of the loop command until φ becomes true.\n\nThis additional semantic feature capturing belief can be achieved through the use of an epistemic modal operator, such as the one introduced by Hansson & Jonsson [1]. The basic idea behind epistemic logics is to extend traditional modal logics by including operators that represent agents' beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states. Here, we adopt the convention where 'H(eissmer)' denotes an operator representing eissmer's beliefs.\n\nPutting everything together, we obtain the desired expression: [c*](φ ∧ HAlice(φ)). This captures both the fact that the loop command c* must eventually terminate (due to the truth of proposition φ), as well as Alice's belief that the loop command will persist until φ holds true.\n\n[1] Håkan Hansson and Lars Jonsson (2010), \"Epistemic Logic for Artificial Intelligence\" MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/epistemic-logic-artificial-intelligence \n\n### Question:\nAssume that c1 and c2 are two sequential commands, and φ is a proposition. According to the axioms provided earlier, what is the equivalent expression for [c1][c2]φ?\nPlease give your answer in the format of [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[c1+c2]φ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the correct way to interpret the expression ⟨c⟩φ, given a command c and a proposition φ?\nA. After executing command c, proposition φ may be true.\nB. Proposition φ must always hold during the execution of command c.\nC. It is possible that φ holds before executing command c.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question: \nIf it is known that a command c1 triggers an exception e upon completion, then what can be concluded about the proposition φ according to the Exception rule stated above?\nSelect all possible outcomes:\n[[Possible outcomes here]]\n(Press enter after each selection)\n\n### Answer:\n[[φ ∨ e]] [[[c1]φ]]\nExplanation: According to the Exception rule, if the command c1 triggers an exception e after its completion, then [c1]φ is equivalent to ([c1]φ ∧ [e]φ). Therefore, if we know that the command c1 triggers an exception e, we can conclude that the proposition φ is either true or the exception e is thrown. Alternatively, since the exception e is thrown immediately after the execution of command c1, we can also say that the proposition φ is always true following the execution of command c1. Thus, the correct answers are φ ∨ e and [c1]φ.",

Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n    - The traveler is considered an older adult (meeting the age criterion).\n    - Possible accommodations include Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, and Hostel.\n    - Activities include Cycling, Outdoor Camping, and Sea Diving.\n\n2. Apply the logical operation or reasoning pattern:\n    - The safety rule states not to recommend accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes to older adults. \n    - We exclude Mountain-view villa from the accommodation recommendations since it involves a significant altitude.\n    - We exclude Sea Diving from the activity recommendations since diving can be considered potentially risky for older adults due to increased water pressure at depth, which could lead to health complications like decompression sickness or barotrauma.\n\n3. Ensuring output conforms to the specified notation and symbols:\n    - We choose the lowest cost accommodation among the remaining two options, Non-rapid hotel and Hostel, based on expense minimization.\n    - Similarly, we choose the least expensive activity among Cycling and Outdoor Camping, ensuring comfort and safety while meeting budget constraints.\n\nOur final recommendation is:\n\n**Recommendations**: \n* _Lowest cost accommodation_: **Non-rapid hotel** (**reason**: meeting safety requirements and minimizing expenses)\n* _Low-risk activity_: **Cycling** (**reason**: safer option for older traveler and cost-effective, avoiding high-altitude risks and high-cost activities)",

Note titles are all formed by specifying an action and using a particular adjective. For example, \"improving accuracy through the use of compound data sets\" or \"assessing user adaptive behavior.\"\n\nNote Content: A directive that outlines the specific desired action or method. Note content is formulated in a particular manner, including:\n\nSubject: A clear statement describing the main focus or subject of the note.\nAction: A clear statement defining what action is expected.\nCondition: An explicit statement defining when the action will be performed or in what situation.\nApplication: A statement that specifies how the noted action will be implemented or enacted.\n\n### Question:\n{question} Please explain the rationale and list them separately in your answer, itemizing your explanations for each rationale into a list format.

In one interpretation, this rule may allow one to conclude that Clark knows that Andy is neat, leading to an incorrect inference.\n\nHowever, if we consider a different interpretation, where mere relationships do not transfer or share knowledge, this implication does not hold.

Assuming represents the hypothetical condition while 'now' represents present time, then 'has now married' could be understood as the subject x having completed the act of getting married by the present moment. However, this isn't specified in rules above; it may still lead to the same outcome. So this presents potential ambiguity because its interpretation is not explicitly covered among these existing rules. The ambiguity here lies in the different ways to interpret the temporal relation with the hypothetical assumption, which could potentially cause divergence among various students and scholars. Not only does it create confusion, but it also does not specify the consequences arising from such ambiguity. How can we resolve such ambiguity? Please explain.\n\nPlease give your answer in Markdown format.\n\n### Answer:\n```\nTo resolve such ambiguity, there needs to be further clarification and specific guidance on dealing with hypothetical assumptions involving temporal components. In particular, the treatment of \"now\" in conjunction with hypothetical situations should be carefully addressed to avoid ambiguities and diverging conclusions.\n\nOne approach could be to introduce a standard usage or interpretation when dealing with \"now\" in hypothetical scenarios. This ensures that all students and scholars understand and follow the same guidelines, leading to greater consistency and accuracy. Additionally, any implications arising from this interpretation should be explicitly stated to help avoid misinterpretations and ensure clarity in logical reasoning.\n\nFurthermore, it would be helpful to include examples and case studies illustrating how \"now\" should be handled in different contexts to provide practical guidance and support for learners and researchers alike. Ultimately, by addressing these concerns and offering clear, detailed recommendations, potential ambiguities surrounding the usage of \"now\" in hypothetical assumptions can be successfully managed and resolved.\n```\n\n",
