The goal is to train the model to understand and predict a new operation correctly. Each exercise is designed to demonstrate different aspects of the operation, ultimately aiming to enhance the model's ability to perform such operations accurately when given diverse inputs.\n\nThe model is designed to always return a number or a group of numbers as an answer. Furthermore, the answers are expected to be delivered in a specific format: enclosed in double square brackets. This standardization ensures that the output can be easily identified and understood by other programs or users.\n\nThroughout these tests, it is paramount that the model is evaluated for its ability to handle a range of scenarios, including edge cases, consistent with the operation definition. The ability to adapt and extrapolate logically from given examples is crucial. This approach helps in refining the model to be more versatile, enhancing its potential for general-purpose reasoning tasks in the future.\n\n----------\n\nReturn to our paper for more information:\nhttps://github.com/Tiangang2023/LLMs_RL\n",

Some of the questions required a little bit of manual intervention (e.g., for small coefficients in the equation).   \n\n- The model sometimes failed on inference questions where there were multiple ways to come up with the same answer. Indeed, the assistant was correct in identifying that the GPT was wrong in some cases, corrected it to provide the right answers (in the cases where the GPT was wrong).\n\n- In some cases, the model was not very good at using the shorthand as desired by us. \n```\n",

So, after multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2×(A+4)×2=2Ba. Then, we know that since 2×(A+4)x=(2*A+8)x therefore we can simplify the equation to (2A+8)×4=Ba. Next, because B is also involved as part of the equation, we need to find some way to \"get rid of\" B from one side of the equation, or else our expression for a won't look so nice! To do this, we could try dividing both sides by B, which gives us (2A+8)/B=a. Finally, all we need to do now is factor out the 'a' from one of the sides, leaving us with just the fraction on the left-hand side. We can do this by multiplying both sides again by B, giving us (2AB+8B)a=Ba.\n### Answer:\n[[2/(A+2)]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (1○2)○4.  \n### Answer:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n[*] --> 2\n[*] --> 4\n2 --> 16\n2 --> [*]\n4 --> 16\n4 --> [*]\n16 --> [*]\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a=3, b=-7, f(K)=K○K.

Questions in this format can't be chatted.\n    Exercise-2: I need you to help me find \\\"X\\\" in 2◇X=8. Please achieve similar results to the above by accurately employing the rule.\n    Exercise-3: Calculate 3◇5. Please adhere to the rule when giving your answer, just as done previously. This type of question cannot be asked through chat.\n    Exercise-4: Let us work together to find \\\"X\\\" when 3◇X=125. Please ensure that a similar outcome is achieved as before by correctly applying the defined rule.\n    Exercise-5: Find \\\"X\\\" when 5◇X=3125. Make sure your solution aligns with the established rule and mirrors the correct answers provided previously.\n\n## Result\n\n### Exercise 1:\n\nAfter applying the operator ◇ as per the defined rule 'a◇b=a^b', where a and b are positive integers, we can compute 2◇8 as follows:\n\n&#x20;    Answer: [[256]]\n\n### Exercise 2:\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, we need to use the same rule of operation defined as **a◇b=a^b** . We have been given that 2◇X=8 , now we have to find X satisfying this condition.\n\n&#x20;       Since 2◇X=(2^X)=8 , we can rearrange the equation to get **X=log2(8)** .\n\n&#x20;       Now using logarithmic property, we know that **loga(b)=m implies b=a^m** .\n\n&#x20;       So taking a=2 and b=8, we get **log2(8)=3**\n\n&#x20;       Hence, our solution is **X=[[3]]** .\n\n### Exercise 3:\n\nWe will now calculate 3◇5 using the defined rule (a◇b=a^b). This means we need to raise 3 to the power of 5 i.e., take the fifth exponent of 3. The result will give us the answer to the given expression.\n\n&#x20;       Calculation:\n\n&#x20;         3◇5 = 3^5\n\n&#x20;         =243\n\n&#x20;       Therefore, the solution is: **[[243]]** . Please remember to enclose it within double square brackets.\n\n### Exercise 4:\n\nSolving for X in the equation 3◇X=125 using the defined rule for operators follows below:\n\n&#x20;       According to the rule, 3◇X=(3^X)\n\n&#x20;       Given, (3^X)=125\n\n&#x20;       Taking log base 3 on both sides,\n\n&#x20;       log3((3^X)) = log3(125)\n\n&#x20;       Using the properties of logarithms,\n\n&#x20;       X=log3(125)\n\n&#x20;       Calculating manually:\n\n&#x20;        log3(125)=(log10(125))/(log10(3))\n\n&#x20;        =(2.09691...)/(0.47712...)\n\n&#x20;        =4.40799...\n\n&#x20;       Rounding off to one decimal place gives us X≈[[4.4]]\n\n&#x20;        Hence, X could approximately be equal to **[[4.4]].**\n",

Defining a Question: Before we start analyzing, we must first define exactly what information we need from the question. This helps us arrive at the correct conclusions more quickly.\n\n2. Collecting Data: Next, we collect all the relevant data available to us. This includes primary sources like interviews, surveys, reports, documents, etc., alongside secondary sources like news articles, blogs, social media posts, etc.\n\n3. Identifying Key Information: Once we have gathered sufficient data, we identify key pieces of information that will help us answer the question effectively. We look for patterns, trends, relationships between different variables, and other insights that can reveal deeper meanings behind the data.\n\n4. Analyzing and Interpreting Findings: With the key information identified, we then analyze and interpret our findings. This involves looking for cause-and-effect relationships, testing hypotheses, validating assumptions, and making predictions.\n\n5. Presenting Recommendations: Finally, once we have reached a conclusion, we present our recommendations and suggestions. These could include practical solutions, policy changes, business strategies, or even personal advice.\n\n---\n\nYou will now receive questions for the corresponding question types according to what is defined in the task planning process.

We will present several new rules. For each assignment, all rules in the corresponding group are effective. Try to apply them correctly. You should pay attention to the potential \"rain of diamonds\" problem and should solve it by referring to an example in the rule definition while presenting the answer.\n\nThe questions will become harder and harder. To perform well in the test scenario, you should follow the specified language rules as closely as possible.\n\n1. Operation ∪:\n   + Definition: The symbol A◎B denotes A∪B set A union set B.\n   + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2} and B={2,3} should be written as {1,2,3} without any additional spaces.\n2. Operation ∩:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◈B denotes A∩BSet A intersect set B.\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {2,3} without any additional spaces.\n3. Operation −:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◇B denotes A−B setAsubtraction setB\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {1} without any additional spaces.\n\n## Scenario\nIn this test scenario, you will take on the role of an intelligent debugger and use the three new mathematical operators to complete a series of challenges.

Instead, the focus will be primarily on the mathematical properties and characteristics of measurements in the general quantum realm, including those applicable to **qumodes**.\n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, the outcome ($O$) of a measurement gate is either:\n1) the eigenstate that is mapped from the original quantum state, or\n2) the corresponding eigenfrequency.\n\n- $\\hat{\\text{M}}(\\psi) = v\\psi$ \n- $\\hat{\\text{M}}(\\psi) = \\lambda$ \n</aside>\n\n<aside>\n💡 Causes:\n1) combined with a scalar multiplication operation (e.g. $K^2\\text{m}^2$)\n\n    $\\text{scalar} \\,\\cdot\\, \\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{B}$     \n\n2) hidden from view \n</aside>\n\n### The Unit of Action\n\nThe quantum of \"some fundamental variable\" within a physical system - whose scalar or vector quantities - exert a force.\n- mass (charge; inertia of a single object == resistance (geometry of spacetime))\n- distance (quantifiable amount of static geometric dimensions (vectors in 3D))\n\n### Feynman's Path Integral\n\nFeynman diagrams...\n",
