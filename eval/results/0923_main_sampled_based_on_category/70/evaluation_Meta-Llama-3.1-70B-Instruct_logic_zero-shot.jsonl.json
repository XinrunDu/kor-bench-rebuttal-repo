In this case, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nIf p1 is assigned x, then the truth value of the formula p1||p2||p3 depends on the assignments of p2 and p3. However, according to the rule of the material implication (p1=::>p2), if the antecedent (p1) is x, then the implication is always ✓, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, regardless of the assignments of p2 and p3, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nSince the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is assigned ✓ under all assignments, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nTo determine whether this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze the possible truth values of the formula under all assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nFirst, consider the subformula p1=::>~p1. If p1 is assigned ✓, then ~p1 is assigned x, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned x. If p1 is assigned x, then ~p1 is assigned ✓, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned ✓.\n\nNow, consider the entire formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is x, then the implication will be assigned ✓, regardless of the assignment of ~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is ✓, then the implication (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 will depend on the assignment of ~p2. If ~p2 is assigned x (p2 is assigned ✓), then the implication will be assigned x.\n\nSince the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 can be assigned x under some assignments, it is not a Truth Formula. However, it is not always x, so it is not a Falsehood Formula either. Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]].",

This means p1 must be true and p2 must be false for ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, but then p2 cannot be true. However, this creates a contradiction, so there is no assignment that makes the entire formula true.\n\nHowever, as this reasoning was flawed, we should create a truth table:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | x | ✓ | x | x |\n| x | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n| ✓ | x | x | ✓ | x |\n| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n\nYet, we actually found an issue.

The given proposition is in the form of a Particular Negative Proposition (O).\n\nMethod C involves first performing obversion and then performing conversion. \n\nFirst, we convert the original proposition using Method A. The proposition \"Some young people are not early risers\" is a Particular Negative Proposition (O), which means we can treat it similarly to a Universal Negative Proposition (E) for obversion purposes. Using Method A for Universal Negative Proposition (E) conversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nHowever, Method C doesn't apply the same conversion as the example given for Particular Negative (O). To execute Method C as intended for the specific proposition form \"Some young people are not early risers\" we must treat it by first executing a universal negation type obversion. \n \nTo execute Method C accurately: first convert using obversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nThen, for the conversion in method C, we treat it like a universal affirmative after the obversion: \nconverting the 'new proposition' in the obversion form \"Some S is non-P\" into a universal affirmative form for 'conversion' purposes.\n\n\nThe proposition then transforms into \"All non-early-risers are young people\" is not applicable, given it reverses the initial benefit or application required for a successful conversion.\n\n\nRevisit and apply the applicable rules.

Employee A incorrectly interprets this as: If an employee receives a bonus (B), then they have completed a project (P). This is an example of the CondSwap Method, where the individual (Employee A) incorrectly swaps the conditions (or premises) of the original statement.",
