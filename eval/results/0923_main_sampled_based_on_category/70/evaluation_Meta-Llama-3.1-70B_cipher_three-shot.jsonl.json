Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards:\n        - A list of 54 numbers, including a randomly shuffled deck consisting of 52 suited cards and two distinguishable jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker. Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.",

So if the input contains punctuation or spaces, it will be trimmed. If it is not all uppercase, it will be converted to all uppercase.\n\n- The alphabet used in the encryption has to be an uppercase string of letters without \"J\". So the encrypted output will only contain Uppercase letters and \"J\".\n\n- The output has to be formatted in double brackets [[]]. So the assistant should prepend and append the answer with the brackets in the final output when it provides the answer.\n\n- The assistant should not add additional comments when returning the answer. It should focus on using natural language to answer the encryption and decryption questions posed above.\n\n- If the input fails to follow the specified format if follows to specification, the response should start with \"Error\". For example, if the input is lowercase text, but uppercase letters are required, the response will be: Error: Input must contain only uppercase letters.\n\nThis rule is used to guide a conversational AI assistant to understand the requirements of encryption and decryption tasks, so that it can answer instantly, even when asked about new messages.\n\n## Comments\nUsing grid-based encryption techniques,\n\nTying in specific grid operations based on character frequency,\n\nEncryption method.\nEnhanced complexity through complex operations.\n\nEncryption method. \n\nCombination of encryption and encryption decryption methods,\n\nThe agent is guaranteed to correctly complete the encryption and decryption tasks.",

We will use lists and dictionaries as data structures, and slice\nand concatenate strings to construct the encrypted message.\n\nThe function begins by checking that our input is a string, and is uppercase without punctuations or spaces. If the check\npasses, we split the string into a list of letters using `list()`.\n\nNext, we initialize a list called `rowContents` with five empty lists, representing rows of the encryption grid.\nWe add our first letter to the first row, then fill in the second to fifth rows with symbols ('#' for down, '>' for up).\nOn each row, we store a dictionary mapping each symbol to a list of letters we will fill in.\n\nThen, we iterate through the remaining letters from the plaintext. For each letter, we start by checking if there is a down\narrow at the current row. If so, we add the letter to that list, then move to the next row and check if there is an up arrow.\nIf there isn't one, we initialize a new list with this letter in it and store it under the up arrow symbol.\n\nOnce we go through all the letters, we concatenate the contents of each row into a single string using `join()`.\nFinally, we return the ciphertext by adding in '*' as per the specification.\n\nHere is the implementation of this process:\n\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(plainText:str) -> str:\n    # ensure correctness of input\n    if not isinstance(plainText, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Incorrect parameter type\")\n\n    plainText = plainText.upper()\n    if re.findall(r\"[^A-Z\\s]\", plainText):\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid character found\")\n    \n    # convert plaintext to a list of letters\n    plainLetters = list(plainText)\n\n    # create list to hold rows of ciphertext and initialize first row\n    size = len(plainLetters)\n    rowContents = [[] for _ in range(5)]\n\n    rowContents[0].append(plainLetters.pop(0))\n    for i in range(1,5):\n        if i%2 == 1:\n            rowContents[i].append(\"#\")\n        else:\n            rowContents[i].append(\">\")\n\n    # iterate through remaining letters and add to appropriate rows\n    while len(plainLetters)>0:\n        currLetter = plainLetters.pop(0)\n        currRow = 1\n\n        while currRow < 5:\n            sym = rowContents[currRow][0]\n            if sym == '#':\n                rowContents[currRow].append(currLetter)\n                break\n            elif sym == '>':\n                if '>' in rowContents[currRow]:\n                    rowContents[currRow][rowContents[currRow].index('>')] = currLetter\n                    break\n                else:\n                    rowContents[currRow].insert(0, currLetter)\n                    break\n                \n            currRow += 1\n\n    # join each row into a string and return ciphertext\n    cipherText = (str.join(\"\", [\"*\".join([str(item) for item in rowContents[j]]) for j in range(5)]))\n    return cipherText\n```\n\nWe can test this function with some sample inputs:\n\n\n```python\nprint(\"Plaintext\\t\\tCiphertext\")\nprint(\"-------------------------\")\ntests = [(\"HELLOWORLD\", \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\"),\n         (\"TDOACY\", \"T*D*O*AY*C#*\"),\n         (\"G*V*Z*RL*E#*\",\"GVZREL\"),\n         (\"ZY#*WUX*TC*RX*M#*\", \"ZWTRMXCUYX\"),\n         (\"BF#V#Z#H#*FSXFNMDSC*ETZYKNUCB*SKSRZMGF*B#P#V#D#*\", \"BVFZHSFBXFNMDSAETZYKNUSKSRZMGFB#PVD#\")]\nfor test in tests:\n    result = encrypt(test[0])\n    assert result == test[1], (f\"Encryption failure.

        "response": "[[ARFIDDHGEFIIPAONVZR#####]]\n\n### Extended Functions:\n\nThe cipher also supports additive options to provide advanced functions, which are explained below.\n\n#### Diceware List:\nThis option adds dictionary usage to the cipher, where a \"diceware\" list consists of several words chosen for encoding and decoding purposes. The default list the cipher uses is: `MRLIHARWEAOKGNUEVDSCYXPBZQJT` It is recommended to stick to this list for simplicity when testing this cipher.\n\nWhen this option is enabled, the process of encryption and decryption changes in the following ways:\n- During encryption: If a letter in the block is part of the diceware list, replace the letter with the place where it appears in the list. For example, if the plaintext is \"hello world\", then according to the diceware list MRLIHARWEAOKGNUEVDSCYXPBZQJT, the letter 'H' appears 2nd, 'E' appears 6th, etc., so the message \"hello world\" would be encoded as \"262163 6141421\".\n- During decryption: If a letter in the current decrypted message is part of the diceware list, keep it as is. If not, then check if the letter is of the form 'XN', where 'X' is one of the numbers 1-9 representing the position in the list, and 'N' is the actual letter in that position. For example, since 'A' is at position 6 of the diceware list, if we encounter '6A' in the ciphertext, we will interpret it as 'A'.\n\n#### Extended Mode:\nThe **Extended Mode** adds three extended encryption/decryption rules that serve as **default** controls, meaning they are enabled by default, and can be turned **disabled**. Here are the extended rules and their effect:\n- **Mirror Mode:** If enabled, the entire grid filled with the template on four quarters will be mirrored horizontally after  decoding/encryption operation to generate new ciphertext and plaintext. Mirroring example: after filling the grid by rules, replace the fourth line with the first line, the third line with the second line, the second line with the third line, and the first line with the fourth line.\n- **Reverse Order Mode:** If enabled, the final ciphertext or plaintext after the decryption/decryption operation will be inverted.\n- **Sodium Mode:** If enabled, the entire grid encrypted/decoded by the template will apply a substitution cipher to the ciphertext and plaintext using salt (**N**) as a key, where **N** is the number of '#' in that ciphertext/ciphertext. The replacement mode is to start moving the letter encoding table **N** space to the right, take the corresponding new letter, and form the complete ciphertext/ciphertext blocked after the conversion. For example, if there are 4 instances of '#' in the ciphertext, then 'A' becomes 'M', 'B' becomes 'N', and so on.\n\n#### Customizable Commands:\n\n- `diceware=<word-list>`\n    - Add dictionary list <word list> to the cipher when calling this option and the additive functions it supports.\n    - Here, <word list> must be a 26-letter string consisting of letters. Letters that appear for the second time and after can be ignored.\n    - Note: This command line can be called multiple times, and the last setting is in effect.\n- `disable`\n    - Disables the extended default encryption rules in extended mode that the cipher contains. Namely disables: Mirror Mode, Reverse Order Mode, Sodium Mode.\n- `enable`\n    - Enables the extended default encryption rules in extended mode that the cipher contains. Namely enables: Mirror Mode, Reverse Order Mode, Sodium Mode.\n\n#### Query Commands:\n\n- `help`\n    - Display instruction information about supported command lines and extended functions.\n- `load` \n    - Restore the original default setting for encryption/decryption operations.\n    \n\n### Extended_test:\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"YSSSYLSDNIKOEYRVVIGEAUVIEORBKEMHWQKMKJCYILKICGYSANKYYNWLBLGHHALIJYTKOCSDCXAVJYAKOETEVCCAWAEGNHFQAXTWWEOGHIOYPCGNA\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The encryption and decryption process is an iterative process with precise steps to attain the desired ciphertext or plaintext. It was interesting to note the significance of the transposed sequence in the encryption and decryption process. This cipher rule serves as a fundamental example of the complexities involved in encrypting and decrypting ciphertexts. We hope this section was enlightening and facilitated your understanding of encryption and decryption concepts. If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to discuss them with us.",
