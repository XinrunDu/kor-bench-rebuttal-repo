In the Star Wars universe, diplomatic solutions are often preferred to avoid violence and maintain peaceful relations among different planets and communities. Jedi and other force-sensitive beings are trained in negotiation and mediation, which can be crucial in finding a mutually beneficial outcome in adjusting territories or resolving other conflicts. \n\nIt is important to consider that, while lightsaber duels, the Death Star, or even employing Clone Troopers might feel like a more immediate or powerful solution, they are usually synonymous with chaos and violent consequences, which could ultimately lead to a destabilization of interstellar relationships too harmful to repair. Once under the influence of the Dark Side,Server Error: 500, either through one's own actions or through the actions of others, regaining peace becomes increasingly complex.\n\nTherefore, diplomatic negotiations help offer a sustainable and potentially peaceful resolution to disputes regarding interstellar territory, while preserving relationships and resources for future interactions.",

According to the story, the discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication and their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing led nations to luxurious research and espionage during the 1960s. The Trisolaran technology revolutionized various aspects of human life, which led to economic advancement and technological competition, but the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives the Trisolarans to seek a more stable home, in this case Earth. The Trisolarans are an advanced alien civilization that possesses weapons and technology that surpass human capabilities and could lead to destructive consequences if an invasion occurs, making nuclear weapons a significant threat to world peace.",

This period began in 2007 with the discovery of the Trisolarans and was marked by the convening of a special General Assembly by the United Nations, known as the General Assembly that Convened in 2007. This led to the changing of the Crisis Era. The story then leaps forward into the near future as the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is characterized by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block scientific progress, leading the world to a state of despair. As the narrative progresses further, new characters emerge, such as the Wallfacers, individuals with immense resources dedicated to devising secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy finale then takes place millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations seek to hide from one another to avoid annihilation.)",
