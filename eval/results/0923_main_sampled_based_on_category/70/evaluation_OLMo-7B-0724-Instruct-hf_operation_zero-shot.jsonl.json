Since the result of (X^1) is not X or X^2 for X in the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, ...}, we can move one exponent to the right side of the equation:\n\nX = X^2 + X\n\nWe know that 1¥X = -3. With no other solution for X within the set of positive integers, we can obtain the following result by solving the equation for X:\n\nX^2 + X = -3\nX^2 + X - 3 = 0\n\nNow, let's find X. We can factor this equation as:\n\n(X^2 + X - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we are left with a quadratic equation to solve, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the coefficients of the variables in the quadratic equation:\n\na = 1, b = 1, and c = -3\n\nPlugging b and c into the formula:\n\nx = (-1 ± √(1² - 4(1)(-3))) / (2(1))\nx = (-1 ± √97) / 2\n\nNow we find the positive value within double square brackets:\n\nx ≈ [[1 ± √97] / 2]]\nx ≈ [[1 ± √1(+97)]/2]]\nx ≈ [[1 ± ±17]]/2\n\nWe want the positive solution for X:\n\nX ≈ [[1 ± 17] / 2]]/2\nX ≈ [(1 + 17) / 4]\nX ≈ 110 / 4 ≈ [[27]]\n\nAs we do not have an integer in the result [[27]], so:\n\n[[X]] ≈ [[27]/Default(2-2)-1]]/2 ≈ 27 - 1/2 = 27 + 1/4 ≈ [[55.25]]\n\nX ≈ [[55+4]] ÷ 2\nX ≈ [[59]]\n\nThe answer to the question [[1¥X]] when X is [[59]] is:\n\n[[-3]]\n\nTherefore, the value of X, using the provided rule, is [[59]].",
