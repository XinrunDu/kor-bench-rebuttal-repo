Each wildcard rule function is defined by a set of disjoint questions it can answer. Each question is paired with the answer and a one sentence rule.\n\nThe rule defines the way each function is described in plain English. Each example question and answer should pass the evaluation test for the rule.\n\nThe function is expected to be an intuituive way to calculate the result from the question type and the values provided. In particular, the rules are chosen independently and do not need to correlate to a computational machine learning model.\n\nRule:\n\nx?y=x/y+7\nx and y are positive integers.\nExample:\n\nExample1:\nQuestion: 3?2\nAnswer: 7\n\nExample2:\nQuestion: 4?4\nAnswer: 9\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 2?4\n----------------\nRule:\n\nx?y=x/y+7\nx and y are positive integers.\n==================\nThe wildcard rule says x?y=x/y+7. Therefore, 2?4=2/4+7=1+7=8.\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 4?4\n----------------\nRule: x?y=x/y+7\n==================\n4?4=4/4+7=1+7=8.\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 1?6\n----------------\nRule: (a-b)?c=a/c+b/7\n==================\n1?6=(1-0)?6=1/6+0/7=0.167+0=0.167\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 0?0\n----------------\nRule: x%y=x*(1+y/6) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\n(x%y) = x*(1+y/6)\nfor non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n\nFor the above condition, (non-negative integer 0)%(non-negative integer 0) = (0)*(1+(0)/6) = 0\nHence, 0%0 = 0\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 1%1\n----------------\nRule: x%y=x*(1+y/6) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\n1%1 = (1)*1 + 1/6 = 1 + 1/6 = 1.167\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 4%6\n----------------\nRule: x%y=x*(1+y/6) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\n4%6 = (4)*1 + 6/6 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: x%y\n----------------\nRule: x%y=x*(1+y/6) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\nx%y = x*(1+(y/6)) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\nSince the domain of the wildcard is ℤ, for (non-negative integer x) we can enter any integer and get the result for x%y\nFor instance, (5)%(3)=x*(1+(y/6))=(5)×(1+(3/6))=(5)×(0.8333333333333334)=4.166666666666667.\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 10%6\n----------------\nRule:\nx%y=x*(1+y/6) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\n10%6=10*(1+6/6)=10*(1+1)=10*2=20.\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 10%30\n----------------\nRule:\nx%y=(x^y)+(y^x) for non-negative integer x and non-negative integer y.\n==================\n10%30 = (10^30)+(30^10) = 10^30+30^10 ≈ 10^30+30^10.\n\n==================\nEvaluate wildcard\nQuestion: 30%30\n----------------\nRule:\nx%y=(x^y)+(y^x) for non-negative integer x and non-negative",

The first two examples demonstrate how to compute the new operation by adding 2 times the first matrix to 3 times the second matrix. The third and fourth examples showcase how to handle different matrix sizes and values within the operation.\n\nHowever, an issue arises in the final question, as the matrix A is a 2x2 matrix, but the matrix B is a 2x1 column vector. This causes an error in the operation because the dimensions of the matrices are incompatible. In the context of the rule, A€B=2A+3B, B should be a matrix of the same size as A. Therefore, the rule cannot be applied accurately to questions involving matrices of different sizes.",
