Formula 17 implies a directional truth relationship where the truth of Gp guarantees the truth of ¬G¬p.\n\n* **⚭ Relation:** Pairs cannot be both false. However, they can both be true. Formula 17 doesn't express this type of restriction.\n\n* **⁂ Relation:** Pairs can both be true or both be false.

Here's why:\n\n* **Premise:** If all Middle Eastern countries disarm, there will be peace.\n* **Conclusion:** Since they haven't disarmed, there will be no peace.\n\nThe fallacy lies in incorrectly concluding the absence of the consequent (peace) simply because the antecedent (all countries disarming) is not true.  The NegAnt method specifically addresses this type of flawed reasoning. \n",
