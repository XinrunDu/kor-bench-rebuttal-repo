The plaintext and ciphertext are both strings of uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces. In this cipher, each character is encrypted or decrypted based on its position on discs. The rule defines how the outer and inner discs rotate.\n\nIn encryption, each character in the plaintext is replaced with the corresponding character on the inner disc. After encrypting `period` characters, the inner disc rotates to the right by `increment` characters. During decryption, each character in the ciphertext is replaced with the corresponding character on the outer disc. After decrypting `period` characters, the inner disc rotates to the right by `increment` characters.\n\nThe `increment` value rotates the inner disc the required number of characters and the `period` determines the number of characters that will be encrypted/decrypted before rotating the inner disc.\n\n:::info\n\n**rotary decipher.**\n\n:::\n\n## References\n\n- [Rotary Cipher][5]\n\n## Useful resources\n\n- [Wikipedia: Caesar Cipher][1]\n- [Caesar Cipher[2]\n- [Caesar cipher in Java][3]\n\n### Terms\n\n- [1]: Encyclopedia - Caesar Cipher\n- [2]: (Cesar Ciphe in Java)\n- [3]: [http://cs.uncc.edu/~cnunes/java/cs4500/s07/class/caesar.html]\n- [5]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine]\n",

Please note that in the game,\n you will be presented with ciphertext, but what you need to do is decrypt the ciphertext into its plain text. In the game, if you make an error, you simply have to click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the game screen, but after each 5 correct answers you will hear \"correct\" and a tick mark on the screen and then you can continue guessing, and if you make 5 mistakes, you will hear \"incorrect\" and the cross mark on the screen, and your game will end. To restart the game, you can click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the screen. In addition, while playing you can see the results on the right side of the screen  after 2-3 questions, and you can click on the right side of the screen to send a correct answer or a wrong answer, so if your game continues to work, you can send \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" depending on your guessed answer. You  also have an option to make your guesses on the next button on the game screen, so you can continue to guess.\n\n**This AI is going to be added to a much bigger puzzle game where the player is the king of a country and if he can't find a way to encrypt and decrypt the player will lose his country hence his AI code can not be cracked or spoiled by different users.

From the first two rows, we can observe that the plaintext is \"K\" (for the upper row).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhen encountering \"**\"** characters in Ciphers, our priority should be to utilize the S_BOX and INV_S_BOX to identify whether the ciphered characters have undergone **XOR** operation or not. However, it is at this point that we must exercise caution and consider a potential variant of the cipher.\n\nFirst Rule: The keyword used for XOR operation.\n\nSecond Rule: The cipher is regularized through the use of S_BOX or INV_S_BOX.\n\n### Variant:\nA variant exists, wherein the keyword is consistently used as a constant and undergoes two rounds of XOR operation with the alphabet. As a result, the remainder of the ciphertext is the alphabet itself, leading to the formation of 26-character encrypted blocks. In this scenario, we continue to utilize the **S_BOX/INV_S_BOX** for decryption, but there is uncertainty regarding the requirement for XOR operation and the existence of padding. [[****]] represents 26-character ciphered text.\n\n### Second Question:\nDecrypted: **\"B\"**\nPlaintext: **\"K\"**\nKeyword: **\"K\"**\nCiphered: **\"GB\"**\n",
