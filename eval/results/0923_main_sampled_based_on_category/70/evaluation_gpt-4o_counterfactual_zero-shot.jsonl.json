There is no specific context in the story that contradicts this general understanding.\n\n2. **Stimulants** (Option B): Stimulants often lead to short-term enhancement of resistance or capabilities but usually come at the cost of adverse side effects or long-term harm to the body.\n\n3. **Gravity body** (Option C): The gravity body is described as an exoskeleton mecha that enhances combat capability. It is associated with combat rather than general health, and it's not clear if it would enhance body resistance per se. Additionally, using such advanced technology may not be sustainable for overall health.\n\n4. **Becoming a devouring beast** (Option D): Transforming into a beast, as described, seems to be detrimental to one's humanity and potentially harmful. This transformation does not align with enhancing body resistance in a healthy way.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most suitable option for enhancing the body's resistance without causing harm would be physical exercise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [[A]].",

Normal citizens voluntarily donate their organs to others: This option is not fully addressed in terms of voluntary donation specifically within the normal citizen class or across classes, but the story's strict disparities between the upper class and normal citizens imply that such actions wouldn't be permissible at least between different class boundaries.\n\nB. Forcing Normal citizens to donate their organs to others: The option seems unethical and the story does not explicitly discuss forced donation, but the class-based restrictions do not support such an act if it involves crossing classes.\n\nC. The upper class can only accept organs from the upper class: This directly aligns with the stated regulation that \"the organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians.\"\n\nD.

He can see the sun rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- The story indicates that Earth is facing a catastrophic threat due to an accelerated helium flash in the sun. Consequently, planetary engines have been built to propel Earth out of the solar system. This suggests that the traditional day-night cycle on Earth, where the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, is no longer a normal experience for ordinary people. Additionally, the earth's rotational speed has been altered, causing significant changes in the day-night cycle duration.\n\nB. He has been living in an underground city since childhood and has never seen the world above ground.\n- The story mentions that the vast majority of humans have moved into underground cities associated with planetary engines and that only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city. Given this information, it is plausible that many ordinary people would spend their entire lives in these underground cities without ever seeing the world above ground.\n\nC. He can see Proxima Centauri rise in the east and set in the west every day.\n- Proxima Centauri is a star located outside of our solar system and not visible as a rising and setting star from Earth. This option is scientifically inaccurate in the context of an Earth's perspective.\n\nD. He lives on the Space Biosphere 1 space station.\n- The Space Biosphere 1 experiment and the space station housing it were destroyed by a solar storm in 2026, which led to the loss of six scientists. Therefore, it is unlikely that an ordinary person would be living on Space Biosphere 1 space station.\n\nTaking all the information into account, the most logical and supported answer is B.\n\nThus, the final answer is [[B]].",
