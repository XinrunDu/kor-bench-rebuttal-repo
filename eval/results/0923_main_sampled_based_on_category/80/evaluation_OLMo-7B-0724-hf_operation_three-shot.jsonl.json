The questions above each answer block represent arbitrary generated questions of this sort.\n### Identify a Derivative\nIdentify the derivative of $f(x)=5x^4-3x+2$ with respect to $x$.\n\n### Explicit Answer\nYou can give up to $1$ explicit answer in order to give a rounded answer in (a)-(f) below.\n\nequiv\n\n### Answer Automatically Generated\nTo speed up the process of generating results, the synthesis tool will generate final form answers by naming variables in the form Xn. Doing so may affect the expression'd hint where you can improve the results of the synthesis by manually fixing the name of the variable. To improve the results, for example, you might fix variables that would satisfy the $f(x)$ or $f'$ label synthesized. (See next answer.)\n\n### Answer Generated After Manually Adjusting Generated Variable\n\n Below are examples to consider. Example 1 Example 2\nTo help construct the derivative, start by identifying a common property of the function $f(x)$ and the derivative $f'(x)$. For example, the given function is linear in input, and $f'(x)$ is linear in output. The derivative is linear with $x$. Sub-answer\nThis given example has two parts:\n\n## Sub-answer\n\n(a)\n\nThis example has two parts:\n\n$f(x) = 2x, f'(x) = 2\\ \\ldots\\ \\\\(A) The derivative is constant.\\\\*(B) The derivative is linear with the same slope as $f(x)$.\\\\*$\nAccording to the definition of the derivative as the limit of the ratio of the change of the output divided by the change in the input as the input changes, we can write the derivative in this form: $f'(x) = \\lim_\\limits{h \\to 0}{\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}} =2\\cdot \\lim_\\limits{h \\to 0} {\\frac{(x+h) - h}{(x+h) - x}} = 2\\cdot \\lim_\\limits{h \\to 0} {\\frac{h}{h}} = 2\\cdot 1 = 2$. Thus it is linear, and it has the same slope as $f(x)$.\n$f(x) = x^3, f'(x) = 3x^2\\ \\ldots\\ \\\\(A) The derivative is constant.\\\\\\*(B) The derivative is linear with the same slope as $f(x)$.$\nBecause the example $x^3$ is not linear, it follows that the derivative of $x^3$ is not linear. If it were linear, its rate of change with respect to the input would be constant, so it could be rewritten in $1$ form so long as there is still an $x$ involved. (In calculus, we say that it is a degree 3 polynomial.)\n\nExpressing the derivative as a variable also requires a degree 3 polynomial: $f'(x) = 3x^2$. From the second equation,\n\n$$f'(x) = 3x^2 = x^3\\cdot 3/3 = (x^3\\cdot 3)(1/3) = (c\\cdot x^3)(1/3)$$ where $c = 3/3 = 1$ is a constant remainder.\n\n$f(x) = x^2, f'(x) = 2x\\ \\ldots\\ \\\\(A) The derivative is constant.\\\\\\*(B) The derivative is linear with the same slope as $f(x)$.\\\\*(C) The derivative is linear with a different slope than $f(x)$.$\nWe can easily express $f'(x)$ more clearly by saying $f'(x) = 2x$ in the $1$ form, because $f(x)$ is already in the $1$ form. The form is linear when its percent variation is constant. In this case, the derivative's percent variation is $2{}x$ because the output goes up by a ratio of $2x$ if the input increases by a ratio of $1$. The variation remains constant because the derivative $f'(x)$ is the ratio of the output variation to the input variation. The input variation is the relative value of $1 + x$. Thus, $2x$ is constant. This makes $f'(x)$ linear.\n$f(x)= {3x + 4z}. f'(x) = 6$ $f(x) = x^3-xz. f'(x) =-6x$. $f(x)= {x^5-yz}. f'(x)=30x^4xxxxxxxxxx$ $\\\\ 1\\\\\\\\ 2\\\\\\\\ 3\\\\\\\\ 4\\\\\\\\ 5\\\\\\\\$ <<(some formulas omitted for brevity)\n\n## Sub-answer\n\n$f(x) = tan(x), f(x) = x^3 + 10, f(x) = ln(x)$ and others will be omitted here for brevity.\n\n### Identify a Derivative (Weights 15%)\nWhat is the derivative of $f(x) = 2x^3 - 32y^5$ with respect to $x$?

Hardly a minute will go by in the course of a day’s work when you won’t perform at least one calculation: you might add up time taken in order to determine how long it will take to complete a project, for instance; call back a number on the phone, perhaps; or calculate the total of a purported a price reduction.\n\nGiven how ubiquitous working with numbers is, it is easy to see why a good grasp of arithmetic is useful in everyday life. Not only can it save you money by enabling you to comparefood or product prices on sale after a percentage discount, but it can also help you avoid making mistakes and make you a wiser consumer.\n\nCalculation is one of the basic tools that you will use all the time when it comes to reporting. There arepeople who like to tell you that there is only so much time in the day for one person, which means they will always have to take shortcuts to increase the pace of their work. Making calculations a mistake is an example of those shortcuts. It is true that you need less time to do the same amount of work with the help ofa calculator, but a calculator will also save you the time wasted on getting things wrong. A calculator will helpyou to avoid this problem.\n\n### MODEL SAVINGS\n\nMost calculators can help you to work out the difference between the original price and what you paid. For instance, if your original price was $360 and the price reduction was 30%, you can use your calculator to see that the new price will be$255.\n\nGambling-styleanomaly\n\nAn underlying issue has to do with the nature of gambling. You should always keep in mind that there is a considerable element of randomness involved. For instance, if you want to choose a random colour- hat you should throw into circle a party party , or if you are spinning the roulette wheel, the result is random. The same is true with number selection i .\n\nAlso, in this context, there is a tendency to believe that if you select a certain number repeatedly, that it is more likely to come up again. You may simply be finding it more difficult to remember any particular event nine days −more likely\n\n### BORMITHLI1\n\nIt is known that statistical principles apply to gambling. Moreover, it is commonly observed that gamblers are blinded to the fact that they are gambling with10 non-random results liberally. Let’s take the example of machine 1. Suppose you select 2 and land on 2This time you lost your money. Suppose you win this week and your money is now now worth $500. You decide to keep the car, but youinteresting circumstances, what is the six times you have won in last 25 round rolling a six, and each roll is independent? It is the probability that the first time you land on the six if you On the instructions of the casino, you could imagine what that number the $300. But since you ignorant, your friend, driving a 200-member group of any proof, you win$138872\n\nAssume that you agree the chances he must strike from the dresser and more experienced ow- federally insured savings banks that are FDIC- banks.\n\nThe amazing fact is that if you the first time. Your friend admits that he is a gambler, but wins 3-4 times more per hour than most people. Your friend ends his session at a loss of $300, finding it Then a problem occurs. Why may the number 7 be equal to 0.0585?.

Lecture: INSTRUCTIONAL PLANNING, GRAMMAR FOR MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY The main aim has been to outline various methods that have been achieved in higher- level or lower-level instruction, the O-level is advantageous to the success being at this level. This period is relatively straightforward to face, and hierarchy is organised by the needs of the population, in order of competence. The next step would be to outline our learning and literacy plan of the workplace, through industrial-flagship discussions and product-experience workshops. Secondly, we would advise cutting down or doing away with over (some- what) neutral word structures or en downs on analogies and abstract examples, which we often use in our velitations.

CALCULATES and PROSPECTS While you are in the process of gaining practical experience with the CAS, the teacher will also introduce a program by effectively nullifying the Native Elements functionality (FLUID IMF, «Add toDog’s diet», MAP GHYVE, ETC.). Gradually, your students will be answered or put into their place, so it may be acceptable to have an appearance of this new course only after a high-priority survey data gathering, to cover the several covers. In such cases the teacher will help every student to develop his phonecj ability more fully. In practising, applying and using, you create numerous new ideas based on your own strategic considerations. These ideas guide your group. At first you may only create the ideas about how you can express certain data by means of sounds, pictures or words, and then you may utilize your own acronymic skills (made up from the COCO Month’s casual method). Throughout the academic year (or during the classes), in order to be willing to pass information such as critical alertness to your students, in order to help you hit your target of teaching the authentic communication of the target of communication as a requirement, you are penalized (for teaching purposes). At the beginning, everything can be piloted at amateur level; however the decision about the placement in appropriate divisions of the amount of information in sound, pictures or words can elevate the academics and increase students’ mood in the classroom.

You also need to add 0. 25 to the next set of parenthesis. But as jeff said, do you honestly expect this error to be corrected on the spot.

So the operator >>gone to every class of the input stream without any change to it's internal database or the current state (the input stream is special operator, the operators\n\nmove on it, move backward on it, move forward on it, a move position on it). In short: we give instructions to the operator >> that we are going to take the input of the operand without allowing the sream to change it's state before we read it.\n\nlook at this example:\n\nThere are several fields of input. some for numbers some fields for String.\n\n• Your first example was neat enough - order a fixed array rendering order with a new algorithm to loop through it would be better for sure, nerfing the solution (but for which a better solution would be possible)\n• 'Open the Computer': Aware about three file types and you don't want to be able to browse for the file somehow\n• The logo is basically a simple bitmap, the bridge would be just folded correctly\n\nThere are a few points of improvement to the solution, but I'll leave them for future posts If you'd like.\n\nJargar, great post (and a little bump)\n\nwe need to be able to write a custom function that will perfect a string and then print it on the standard fileore. I can’t find out how to write the perfect function. Thanks again. I have a question here: Is there a way to make the solution more generic: My current solution uses a sequence table for each cell in the matrix only: the number of table spaces is used for the whole matrix and not only for one cell. I also can't find out how to get the data for the solutions that use the solution more generically. – John Nynke Oct 27 '12 at 20:05 2 compating and completes the test process. Evaluating the Optional part to verify the output I need if the optional text is correct and works with the input, if not then I have to add the optional text to it and if everything is good I can then process the data and input again. So out of this one is better. – John Nynke Oct 27 '12 at 20:05 3 yeah that’s the kind of thing that goes through my brain when you create a custom action: “If you want a method that prints an ID, use a method that prints the ID.” – John Nynke Oct 27 '12 at 20:05 4 Why is it there is no function in the standard library for printing a value? Like, when I go over a binary file and print one I get a report like “0x0000 Vista: id stuff (real value etc) Only displays 0x a lot and so on. Problem at line 28, in file read_id Look at this PrintUniqueId implementation – this has a custom action to evaluate an ID which reads the data from the file, fetches it’s ID and then proceeds to read the field or whatever it is (you just need to take out the integral ID). Why are we seeing only \"ok, always business case\" in the report? Maybe it’s something trivial that can not be solved by printing? Should I print the report to stdout? Why can't this be done for text? Why is it there is no function in the standard library for printing a value such as ByteConvert::Decision (which is the data insertion",

This produces the following results:\no In order to avoid contradiction in resource assumptions on the movement across the assembly processes, resource constraints are modeled separately. However, the resource overlaps need to be considered. Consider all these assumptions:\nThe total load caused by the transfer of a computer to the assembly process is the sum of c1,с2,с3,с4 part resource consumption | Para_j | . For the same reason, every equipment resource consumed by the given computer is considered to be the equivalent of only 1 extra interface, while available resource information of\no The power load of a process must be considered separately. Although it is not necessarily the equivalent to one computer interface, it is the least amount of energy consumed by the assembly process. An assumption is made that will be validated in Section 4.3. For the moment, using only (modularity)+floFlo‘, the results are as follows:\n1 . Processes using more than one relative interface create only one resource for each interface. First, it is assumed that only one process should be considered that using multiple relative interfaces. In this case, this will clearly lead to a capacity limit violation. Resource users here\no The resource of construction is limited to materials required for construction augmentation in addition to those needed to finish assembly.\n2 . For Component Deliver C, only one resource should be allocated.\n• First, it is assumed that one iteration will be trailed between two unit resources of corresponding quasi-iterations. Inline opening and closing will be constrained to the least number of resources as possible.\n• Second, there is no capacity limit violation for component assembly because_∞ construction resources will be used.\nCase Analysis and Limitations\n\nThis section has identified the constraints of the proposed ASAPP-T process. to the proposed ASAPP-T framework, the validity of which is ensured by verifying the output of the framework.\n\nIf there is a difference in the results, (like n(n-1), for example, in T–Tree algorithm I), multiplication of municipality duration to total resistance values will cause a serious limitation for ASAPP-T process. We must make a match between activities and then consider a solution for the 1–3 coordination. However, simplifying assumptions can be made in order to resolve this issue, but the speculators that do not require more validation are hidden.\n\nIt has been shown that independent activities can be considered as a part of a serial process. Also, as mentioned in the following sections, it is possible to consider many activities as a single process.\n\n\\end }\n\nvoid doSolutionDispBeforeLast(trec * TR) {/*clone\n\nConstructing Complex IT Projects: A Visual TRE\n\n7- March 11-2014\n\nWe fans can't forget to let\n\nAdding to\n\n/// Walk left and highlight \"Find Content\"\n\nhbCenter.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton1.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton2.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton3.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton4.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton5.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"\");\n\ncolButton6.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\" \");\n\ncolButton7.setStyle(\"width:250px; height:150px;\");\n\nColour.setStyle(\"sp-symbol-listcolor \"sp-symbol-listcolour\" width:250px; height:150px; width:250px; height:150px;\n\ncolour\" style=\"background-image:\"\n\n\" sp-action-menulen\n\n1/100\");\n\ntrec lithSkin = techLith(meanali(379,659));\n\n//color\n\ntrec colour = trec(\"color\");\n\n/safari\n\n}\n\n///Highligh \"Find content\"\n\n/\n\ninkMouseRPC.highlight(\"photos.pl\"\n\ninch.setForeground(\"black\");\n\nmy nerves surged through my bones.

This can be done by using meta-analysis techniques. Using meta-analysis requires you to first aggregate the studies into groups, based on the specific outcome measurements that were used in each study. One way to do this is to compile study findings into something called a “margin vector,” in which each member of the vector represents an estimate of an outcome (step 1). In order to determine how far away each of these estimates is from the true effect, you need to multiply each estimate by its associated estimate of uncertainty about the (rounded to the nearest whole number) effect estimate (step 2). Next, you need to multiply the roundings by their associated standard deviations (step 3). Finally, you sum the resulting numbers together (step 4). This process is repeated on every member of the vector until the entire thing becomes commercially distributed.  The process is repeated (for easier readability) below, but it actually only involves show that you can get a curious ____ estimator in $q+\\infty$  dimensions.          show that by showing this restricted kestimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and also having a ____ minimal positive lower bound, one can predict its asymptotic variance without using a Monte Carlo approach. This makes sense, since $\\sqrt{a d / \\gamma}$ does decrease monotonically for low enough $a$                                                                                                                         ____ VICA of strong negative reciprocity                                                                                             * The following table was taken from \"____ market conditions for fixed income\". Clements, this method allows information from data taken from interest-rate movements between and within countries. But what this article identifies is not (merely) a function of interest rate movements, but one of the lure of interest rates. To the authors’ knowledge, this had never been undertaken[,] they can accurately assess how demand ‘informed’ decisions impact pricing decisions at the macro level. They propose i) a term-spread model and, ii) a correlation index between interest-expshare derivatives, for modelling scenarios that do not include the above and iii) a ratio at which most investment strategies are affected as pointed out by a 2005 study on correlation indices and ‘information’ decision-taking. The difference between these models could involve estimating the condition for the different business units using a term spread. The term spread is a day-totwise variable that measures the difference between the net interest rate of debt securities on the policy holdings that are in turn reflected in the prices at which the securities are valued. This does not imply, however, that the prices of national bonds, or indeed the very asset prices which national bonds are, are different when compared with bonds that were previously issued by an issuer. This should be interpreted as an additional complication to the imprecision of these models that can also affect, separately taxable risk in spite of a model’s attempt to address these non-itiess as whole areas of the economy. The authors identify a different modelling assumption from the term spread to the correlation indices. As one would expect, this approach may explain the finding that the correlation of the bond and stock markets is not so strong when compared to other indicators of low volatility: actually the correlation of shocks over several periods above the average, and shocks to one period below them differs only over time. This can be traced to ‘meaning’ which exists between shocks and their state values for both the debt-money debt system. This might have various properties. One is that correlation does not explicitly deal with the family model. Therefore, to prevent this, at the time of choosing a behaviour, model performance of a bond and a stock across a number of markets illuminates modelers’ theoretical concerns; it contrasts with this pathway.                                                                                                                      \n\n*How can I get the direction from here-or, well, <i>, n</i>[+1]>[@.

So far we've seen how to add and subtract complex numbers. With multiplication and division, we can study more complex objects and phenomena in physics, mathematics, and science, since they obey a set of rules that allow us to bring some order to their behaviors when complex numbers are applied. Complex numbers can take us into the World beyond the numbers we normally work with (waiting for some new technology to donwload them all). To simplify, we can work out an example where we'll multiply two complex numbers and see our answer in terms of real and imaginary expressions. This value you get imag points directly and linearly to the value of your multiplication, as should clearly be able to see that if it's value.Add the corresponding real numbers and multiply them through your values, you'll get the resulting real value of your new code. For ease add all values as you use in our visuals of the code program are purely imag (so they remain straight in the output) which causes code errors due to the existing broadcasting methods or input promotion, which by default converts binary into us, numpy arrays. See chapter 3 for many ideas to fix these errors in (future) programs (and maybe more ideas or ones of such concepts)! Combining our imag values into a presumptive debug, we arrive at the following code:Imag value 10000x0.01+(-1.01) yzya/10000 xyz/1 yz/10000 xz/10000 Thus, clearly separated imag values stand out around all points of the above values. They do change every time you multiply or divide through them because multiplications are only valid when dividing, and division is only valid when multiplying. Instead, you get several new things called: . And your end result may still look vectorized but then there is your solution in its mathematically correct values.",

Long division method to find decimal partners\n\nBefore we put the decimal partner to the rest of decimals, we can first put the decimal to the last digit.\nIf the last digit of the decimal is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, you do nothing to find the decimal partner.\nFor example, for decimal 1.942, as its last digit is 1, you Taylor 1.941*100 and get the remainder, which is 62. Now divide 62 by 942 in the long division method, and get the decimal partner, which is 4.1430. Here, the multiplication operation and division operation are ,  The basis of decimal partner is 64. Therefore by the basis we can further divide its decimal partner to get 62 and 4. Here is the example I showed in the beginning. The problem below shows the principle.\nIf the last digit of the decimal is 8, you can assume it is 0 and don't seek decimal partner. However, for all the digits after the decimal, you can use the decimal method and find the decimal partner.\nFor example, for decimal 0.156, its last digit is 6, which equals to 8. You can draw a box at the right end side for 0 and place 3 and then, to the left of that , perform long division with 3 by 6*100, and get decimal 0.848 with decimal partner 8. Therefore by the basis we can further divide its decimal partner to get 0.883.\n\n2. After finding decimal partner,  make it accurate\n\nMerge the decimal partner to the last digit and find out the new value's last digit. Search again by the same method. The decimal partner also yields neighbor digits, and ultimately reaches to the decimal partner by multiplying the differences with the remainder.\nFor instance, the new value of 0.88340 turns out to be 1.12. As the last digit of the new value is not 8, seeking the decimal partner again, we find that its decimal partner is  11*100+3, and as its remainder is 1, administer the decimal method and find the decimal partner is 10*100+3. Therefore, by the basis yield the decimal partner -2*100-8, which is 1408. To make the decimal partner accurate, proceed to multiply the basis and two differences. After that, a new decimal partner 0.158088 can be got.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Compare two decimals, and find whether its decimal partner is negative or not. If it's negative, subtract its decimal partner from the numerator and add it to the denominator, and if the new value is negative, repeat these operations.\n2. Determine whether the decimal partner is precise or not. If it's precise to 3 digits, try comparing from the 100th place to determine whether the decimal partner's remainder is positive or negative. If it is negative, conclude the decimal partner to be positive and vice versa.\n3. When decimal partner is negative, multiply (negative number)-1 to its decimal partner and add 1. Conclude it as the carried part and then reduce the basis. The modified basis becomes the standard precision. If the new basis is the decimal partner's remainder, carry forward.\n4. Hence, merge the decimal partner with  the new value, and by derivative methods continue to divide several time to search for decimal partners. The following three order operators of operations are alocation, subtraction and division, but the derivative of the last digit is all positive and failure to add other digits, and Replace the first digit of the new result with 0s and continue to search again.\n\n### Problem List\n\n1. 140.000~141.000round to 0.1digit precision (format number)\n\n### Problem List\n\n1.

You must use a dynamic programming algorithm: you must increment the state’s result to index i + 1 if i was used already i.

So, I'm going to write the solutions as both.\nI'll start with the general R code. You aren't doing differentiation, but integration in a multi-variable sense. So you need to integrate over the volume of the cylinder. So, volume = π r^2 h\nTo find the volume of the disk, you integrate over the rectangle, so Are (1-r)^2 = 1.\nSo, 1 - 2r + r^2 = 0\nSo r = 0.5.\nNow, area = π r^2. And height is h = 1- r^2. So, the volume is\n\n2(3)\n1\n\n_BlueSeer\n\n### R gurus, how would the following be coded in R?\n\nf(t)=2*t^4 - (4*t)^8\ng(t)=exp - sqrt t\n\nintroduction of a new independent variable r= sqrt(t), then\n\nf(r)= 2*(r^2)^4 - (4^4)^{r^2}\ng(r)=exp (r)\n\nand the solution provided is\n\nf(r)g(r)*(4*r^2)=2*(1/2)^4 - (4^8)\nf(r)*2=18\nf(r)=9\ng(r) = (2/3)*e^(1/3)\n\nI know that if the second 't' is represented by 'r' then the new equation becomes -\n\nf(r) = 2*((r^2)^4) - (4^4)\n\nbut I still do not feel that I get this solution.\n\nI would like to offer a concise response.\n\n_BlueSeer\n\n### Joris gave me a hint from comments and I did solve it myself so for those future readers here is the full code:\n\nf = 8\ng = 25\nh = 15\np = 5\n\ng1 = disk_area(0, 0, h,\n0, g, r -> sum((x - h)^2 + (y - g)^2 == p^2)\n1 - sum((0 - h)^2 + (1 - g)^2 == p^2))\n\ng2 = disk_area(0, 0, h,\n0, g, r -> sum((x - h)^2 + (y - g)^2 == p^2)\n1 - sum(0 - h^2) + sum(2*h*g - 5*g^2) + sum(0 - p^2))\nprint(g1 + g2)\n\n\nedited March 3\n\n_BlueSeer I was doing this problem on my own too.\nIt stumped much of the class so I am sharing my solution. I am pretty sure it is correct.\n\n## B = S\n\n- #### B = S\nIf S is defined as the base of our rectangle then the rectangle is bounded on the top and bottom and the area is the product of the base and the height. So base * height = square units.\n\n- #### S = P\n\nIf P is the perimeter then the perimeter is a sum of 4 parts of a similar triangle of height 2 * h and thus P = 12*h\n\n- #### A=h(3+2h)\n\nIf h(3+2h) is the equation for an area, then 3 + 2h would be the width i.e. the height + thickness. The already-supplied B could be considered as the width. So B = 3 + 2h\n\nThen\n\nA = h S\n\nA= h (B + S)\n\nA = h (3 + 2h + S) = h (6 + h)\n\nAnd..\n\nh(6 + h) = 1\nh = 1 / 6 * 1\n\nh = 1/6\n\nAfter substitiuting\n\nA = (1/6) ( B + S)\n\nA = (1/6) (3 + 2h + (12*h))\n\nA = (1/6) (12 + 13h)\n\nA = (1/6) ((12+13h + (12-13h))* h)\n\nA = (18*h) / 6 = 3\n\nSo area of A is 3 square meters\n\nKind regards\nTruus\n\n• Allow me to chime in here. Between my confounding thoughts and the difficulty of trying to comprehend my brain in the equation of getting the right answer, I've figured it out with some small hints from you.\n\nAfter your comments, I realized my equation was wrong. It should have been:\n\nC = S + P + S\n\n\nI didn't realize the S was twice. And overlooked that the S was the width of the rectangles.\n\nBy using A = h * S and converting A = (1/6) (12 + 13*h)\n\nNow it becomes easier to factor and multiply it in. A = (12+ 13*h)/6\n\nA = 2.5 + 1.5*h\n\nA = 2 + 2 + .5*h = 3\n\nSo \"3\" is the area of Disk C.\n\nThanks again!\n\nAndrew J Baird\n\n_BlueSeer Hi Joris. Above I added the code and a full solution.\n\n_BlueSeer\n\n### h^2 = 8 so h = 2\nf(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\nD = {x | 1 <= x <= 3, 1 <= y <= 2}\nSo, when you plug in the given values you get the following:\nf(x, y) = 1^2 + 2^2 = 5\nf(x, y) = 2^2 + 2^2 = 10\nf(x, y) = 3^2 + 2^2 = 11\nf(x, y) = 3^2 + 3^2 = 18\nAdding these up, the total:\n5 + 10 + 11 + 18 = 42\nYou follow an exact pattern here: every time you add one, the square term goes up by 1. So, when you take the square root of 42, you get about 3.17.\nIn general, this is called the polar form of a point.\n\n### f(x, y)=x²+y², D= {0<= x <= 2, 3<= y <= 4}\n\nx²=0 [0,0] - x²=2 [0,2] +- - - - x²=4 [0,4]\n\ny²=3 [3,4]\n\nAs there are 2 intervals I summed those up and divided by 2, this gives 5.\n\nf(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 problem 5\n\nI have attempted tp answer a few of these equations but i am very confused on how to do these and especially the order they are given. Below is what I know so far. If someone could help me on whats wrong I would be really greatful.\n\nThe first equation\n\nf(x,y) = -3x^2 + 4y^2 (Y Intercept + 5)\n\nI know that the slope will equal the x-coordinate and I believe the problem would be (−7, 0). I think this is wrong I tried multiple times but I am unsure.\n\nThe Second one\n\nf(x,y)=x^2+4\nx(D) = max: 40\nI first started by drawing a parallelogram then I multiplied the x and y value to get a rectangle.\nThen I went back and started to maneateur the rectangle to get the shape I wanted. I got a rectangle that goes from 0,0 to 40,6. I was told in the directions that every number in the function will be drawn but I only had a max of 40. Thanks ElliuotDepths That is why I submitted the above problem I got that answer right away which is why I was encouraged in doing the other problems. I see now I was wrong and I will continue to revise my understanding to rectify my mistakes.\n\nedited March 3\n\n_BlueSeer I know that if the second 't' is represented by 'r' then the new equation becomes - f (r ) = 2 ((r\nI can give you some feedback based on what formula you are currently using. Right now, it looks like you are doing\n\nand multiplying it by various things. That works for the first problem because it is justbecause of the way  g and f look. I can't tell how what you're trying to do with is reinforcing my suspicion that you're struggling to grasp the purpose of integration/differentiation. You are re-expressing your functions differently here to factors that they should be added up to give you the answer.\n\nIf that doesn't help, then read the post I gave you above and then you will put this formula in perspective for yourself. They want you to differentiate those functions within",

None of the standby movements (Installable, fireable) can be performed. Some sub-functions are also called P1 and P2, and the ability to judge the user in accordance with the appropriate movement can be realized with the same principle. After completing all the corresponding P1 and P2 functions, P4, P3, and other standby states can be performed on the base station. Verify the correctness of the P2 function by simulating the user's departure. If the entire transition process satisfies certain requirements of the abductor, the simulation results are true, otherwise the simulation results are false. The transition time between each standby state or arm state is set as a function, and the P2 function is required to continuously run the transition time of the corresponding P4 function and transition to the next state or arm state after completion. This is equivalent to building P1 and P2 functions. Construct P03, P04, P12, P24, etc., and each transition state can be achieved, and the operation can be simulated until the valid operation is completed. And the transition time between each P4 and P2 functions is a function, and the P2 function is required to continuously be executed after running to the next function state or function state, and the simulation time is determined according to the transition time between the functions. Achieve the corresponding transition states of the P3 function, and simulate the operation until the correct action is completed. In order to determine the final state (verticles guarantees if any latent constraint is violated is unknown), but transitions to the next state will transition regardless. Let the truthful value of the bounding box be its input, according to different states, such as start point, end point, and the closest distance between the two vertices. If a transition to the next state is made, the simulation time is equal to the difference between the end point of the current state and the start point of the next state plus the distance between the two vertices. Attention this distance may be less than 10 seconds. Not only must the correct action be performed, but the timing must be accurate. Similarly, the distance from the bottom to the upper and lower corners must not exceed 10 feet. For the middle, the product is 0. Excluding the results of inter-queries does not violate the trigger statement. Designed three rotation angles α, δ, ϕ to rotate the wrist around an axis extending from the wrist, the middle can be simulated as shown in Figure 4. The joint reaction is measured. The corresponding angle difference is determined as shown in figure. 3. The interaction between actions, a disoriented hip joint and the resolution of the simulation problem is solved, as shown in Figure 4. When accumulating, the angles α, δ, and ϕ are mapped to a corresponding velocity addition in the weight vector to cause acceleration along the extrusion and extrusion axes of the linear motion of the robot arm. The robot arm can use musculoskeletal feedback to identify the crank angle velocity between the crank and the flywheel and to derive the transition strength relationship model. As long as the kinematic relationship between the crank ratio and the flywheel voltage is that the crank ratio is increased after a crank ratio is introduced, and the relation has been transformed, it is equivalent. By adding the crank length to the rotating axis of the crank from the third crank to the transmission shaft of the flywheel without translating the crank length the gear ratio is thus increased and the output power is generated to drive the rotation of the wheelbarrow. Adding a wheelbarrow distance at the base of each wheelbarrow each driver delivers three wheelbarrows without moving itself when the driver stands on the inside of each wheelbarrow away from each other without moving the wheelbarrow while still. As long as the crank is rotated by a predetermined amount (i.e., an integer of 360 to make up the modules) after each time the crankshaft is rotated, the air gap of 180 degrees is located. Therefore, consider the change in control number as some positive constant. The output power is given as shown in Figure 1 below. Collect all references with one pole. The average wind speed is taken as the wind field, and the recommended floating depth orthogonal coordinate grid TWWW of 0.50-120 meters per mile of the grid-based fluid dynamic boundary-value problem. Then let A be the point of time. F is a vector. Using dimensionless optimization software FSM platform, the boundary conditions of the river wind velocity field, the water depth Conjecture 5e at x = 0.3 belongs to the scalar-vector core hypothesis B scheme. The wind velocity field is mapped onto the water surface. Figure 2 is drawn according to the boundary value results of the finite-difference hydrostatic characters. Press the floating velocity boundary, the grid map corresponding to A in the hydrodynamic problem not parasitically influences the hydrostatic characters. U (0,0) = 0, u (0,0) = 3 and u (-2, 0) = -2ADD, u (0,0) = 0, u (x,y) = u (-2, 0) at a distance of seven miles long. . The buoyancy force on the surface of the fluid on the surface of a liquid of a steady water mass is determined by the buoyancy of a liquid. If u is 1, ii. u p is 2, iii. O(0,40) is 5 5 at x = 0, u (0,0) = 0 and u xy / u (0,0) = 0.1. The relationship between travel time and surface speed required to move from A to B is the average of only perturbations. Since the minimum summation method (MTP) principle to each oscillator of the traveling error control sheet designed, the unity rate self-closing scheme is defined, and the constraint principle to unity, traveling distance is only related to the control moments for error correlation. scheme is the volume of water B → A → B flux at each time step. If five miles and the same flux is included, a reduction in criminal force energy (U 8 = 0.8) and the correct quip of Visual Basic is obtained for the brown divergence for LCS. As shown in Figure 4 below, in nodosity A fibration (Λ = 1) runs from 0 to 1 at (x,y) where u̇(x,y) is concentrated. This single node property is A-; the two-membrane properties at common footing XI are defined as: Λ = 1.68 κ / ω and p = n.13- {0.7 x 2 (n 2) 17 8 i n i − k / D + 0.1} κ 2 / [f i]. δ = {1 − 3.59 − θ i )/ (M 2 + 8 1.15} κ 4 / [f 2 i] k (2.618) 8 i",

We call $i$ counter because it determines how many $a_i$s we've added together and we call it variable because i changes.\nFor example, $A + A^2$ denotes element-by-element power of matrix A: $A^2$.\n\n### Question:\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  2 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  3 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\ncompute $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} A^i-B^i$\n### Answer:\n(27 - 55) - (6 - 6) = -23",
