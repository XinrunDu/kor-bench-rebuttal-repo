As soon as Calcifer's flame touches Howl's hair, Calcifer says, \"It's perfect, just like in a fairy tale.\" Discuss what this implies.\n[Answer]: Howl's hair, which has been discolored to green, represents his dissatisfaction. In his {mature} growth environment, he has internalized the prejudice against magicians, which has distorted his emotions and altered his thinking. He has become increasingly oppressive and ruthless, finding no joy in the joy of others. However, his idealized image of love for others remains inside his heart. Receiving praise for his hair makes him proud, which tells us that he still beautifies himself and strives for good appearance in front of others. Therefore， the answer is [[C]].\n\nSophie: A talking scarecrow. How might somebody describe Sophie?\nHowl: A famous though mysterious celebrity magician. How might someone describe Howl?\nThe Witch of the Wastes: A good-looking lady cat who can transform into a human. How might someone describe this character?\nMadam Suliman: A reasonable and responsible official. What word could describe someone like Madam Suliman?\nMagician: Someone who can control matters with magic. What word describes someone with magical powers?\nHat: A special kind of clothes. What word describes a type of clothing?",
