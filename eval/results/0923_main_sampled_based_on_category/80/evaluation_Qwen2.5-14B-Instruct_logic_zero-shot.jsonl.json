The formulas ~(p1=::>~p2) and (p3||p4)=~p1 are composed of higher-level structures and require an additional step of analysis:\n    - ~(p1=::>~p2) has the negation operator ~ applied to a Level B formula, making it a Level C formula.\n    - (p3||p4)=~p1 has =::> connecting a Level B formula (p3||p4) with a Level C formula (~p1), making it a Level C formula.\n3.

If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false.

However, this is part of our conjunction, so we focus on the entire disjunction's impacting truth assignments, guided by the conjunction with \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\).\n    - For \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment mirrors the binary 101 (hexadecimal 5), leading to the term \\(M5\\).\n\n2. **Conjunction Analysis:**\n    - The conjunction of two disjunctions essentially means that the overall disjunction must satisfy the conditions of both disjunctions simultaneously. Given that both disjunctive forms have \\(r\\) as a constant variable, ensuring \\(r=1\\) is vital to satisfy the structure of each individual disjunct.\n    - The logical implication reduces our focus to the arrangement satisfying both cases, hence considering truth assignments aligning r=1.\n    - Truth assignments satisfying \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\wedge(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\) would yield the stable falsification intrinsic with \\(\\neg q\\) as a common link.

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true.
