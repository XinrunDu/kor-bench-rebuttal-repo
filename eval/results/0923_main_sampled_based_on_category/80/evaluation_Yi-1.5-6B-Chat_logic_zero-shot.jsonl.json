This means either ~(~p1 &p2 ) is true or ~p3 is true.\n\n- If ~(~p1 &p2 ) is false, that means (~p1 &p2 ) is true, which implies both ~p1 and p2 are true. In this case, ~p3 must also be true to satisfy the formula.\n- If ~p3 is false, that means p3 is true. This doesn't affect the truth value of ~(~p1 &p2 ), so ~(~p1 &p2 ) can still be true or false, depending on the truth values of p1 and p2.\n\nThus, the possible false assignments for the formula are:\n- [[F: x|x|x];  // first case, where both p1 and p2 are false, and p3 is true\n- [F: ✓|✓|x];  // second case, where p3 is true but p1 and p2 can be either true or false]\n\n### (2) (~p2 ||p3 )&(p1 =::>p2 )\n\nFor the entire formula to be false, both (~p2 ||p3 ) and p1 =::>p2 must be false (since we're using the \"and\" operation).\n\n- (~p2 ||p3 ) is false only if both p2 is false and p3 is false.\n- For p1 =::>p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false (since =::> means \"If p1, then p2\", it's false if p1 is true and p2 is false).\n\nTherefore, for the entire formula to be false, p1 must be true, p2 must be false, and p3 must be false:\n- [[F: ✓|x|x]]\n\n### (3) (p1 =::>p2 )&(~(p1 &p3 )||p1 )\n\nFor the entire formula to be false, both (p1 =::>p2 ) and ~(p1 &p3 )||p1 must be false.\n\n- Since p1 =::>p2 means \"If p1, then p2\", it's false if p1 is true and p2 is false.\n- ~(p1 &p3 )||p1 is true if either both (p1 &p3 ) and p1 are true, or if p1 &p3 is false and p1 is true. The latter case is what matters here for falsity.\n\nFor the entire formula to be false, p1 must be true (since p1 is needed for the disjunction to be true), and p2 must be false (to make p1 =::>p2 false), and p3 must also be false (to ensure ~(p1 &p3 ) is true, which makes the whole disjunction true barring the case of p1 being false, which we've excluded for this to fail).\n\n- [[F: ✓|x|x]]\n\nSo, the overall answer format is:\n```\n[[F: x|x|x];\n [F: ✓|✓|x];\n [F: ✓|x|x]]\n```",

If p1 = ✓ and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ✓ and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓, and p3 = ✓, then (p1 &p3 ) = ✓ and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ✓=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ✓, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ✓, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",

The paired conjunctive terms can be denoted as m0 to m15, where the subscript is the binary representation of the corresponding hexadecimal number.\n\nA formula is a basic formula if it contains m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form. For an all-even formula, the index i of the paired conjunctive term must be even. The even indices in hexadecimal are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. Therefore, the corresponding binary numbers are 0000, 0010, 0100, 0110, 1000, 1010, 1100, 1110.\n\nAmong the 16 paired conjunctive terms, the ones with binary indices 0000 (0), 1010 (A), and 1100 (C) correspond to the even indices in hexadecimal. These correspond to the paired conjunctive terms m0, Ma, and Mc.\n\nSince a formula must contain m0 to be a basic formula, and we are only considering the all-even formulas, we have 3 possible formulas that satisfy both conditions:\n\n- m0 (corresponding to the conjunction of all propositional variables being true)\n- Ma (corresponding to the conjunction of alternating propositional variables being true)\n- Mc (corresponding to the conjunction of all but one propositional variable being true)\n\nTherefore, the number of formulas that satisfy both the conditions of being a basic form and an all-even form is 3.\n\nThe answer is [3].",

This occurs when the propositions are transposed incorrectly during logical reasoning, leading to an invalid conclusion. In this specific case, the relationship between the \"less than\" (R) operation is being transposed between the universal quantifiers (∀x and ∃y), which results in a contradiction because ∀x∃yR(x, y) correctly states the property of natural numbers that there is no largest number, while ∃y∀xR(x, y) incorrectly concludes the existence of a largest number. The logical error comes from incorrectly transferring the properties from one type of quantifier to another, leading to a false conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is G (IllTrans Method).",
