Given the four numbers: 6, 5, 1, 7, and the rule to form an equation that equals 24 using these numbers once, here is my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start by trying to pair the numbers in a way that simplifies the calculation.\n2. The number 1 is a key factor, as it allows us to represent the number 24 as 24/1, so we can pair it with another number to start our equation.\n3. Breaking this down, we know that 24/1 = 24, so our base calculation is already formed. \n4. Now we can try to use the remaining numbers by representing the 24 as a multiplication.\n5. 7 * 6 = 42, this is close to our target of 24, so by reversing this we get 6 * 7, which is already a pair in our base calculation.\n6. Finally, use the remaining number 5 to represent the remaining part of 42 to approach 24.\n7. Therefore, our final equation is (24/1) - (6 * 7) + 5.\n8. When calculated, we get the result of 24.\n\nSo, my answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[(24/1) - (6 * 7) + 5]]",

Our goal is to fill in the blank spaces (marked as 'X') with unique numbers so that the sum of each row and column matches the given sum.\n3. By analyzing the grid, we can make preliminary assumptions following the rules:\n   - The first row must have numbers 13 and 1 (13 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 20, which is the given row sum).\n   - The fourth row seems to have 11, 10, and 2 at the positions already marked. This would leave 3 and 5 as the remaining numbers for the X's in this row considering the column sums.\n4. Now, we work on the columns:\n   - The numbers 8 and 9 must go in the first column because that column already adds up to 17, and there isn't enough room to fit larger numbers.\n5. At this point, we can fill in many of the remaining Xs using basic addition and logical deductions:\n    - The fifth column already adds up to 35, and we know that 12 is already filled in, so the first X in that column must be 6 as 6 + 12 + 8 + 9 = 35.\n    - For the second column, we can deduce that the X above 15 must be 5 as 9 + 5 + 13 = 27 (the column sum).\n    - The X above 11 in the third column must be 3 as 4 + 3 + 11 = 18 (which is the column sum).\n    - We already placed 6 as one of the number in the fifth column, so the X above it in the second row must be 7 as 7 + 12 + 1 + 6 = 26 (the row sum).\n\n6. Now, let's fill in the remaining Xs:\n    - From the first row, we have 13 and 1 filled in. The X above 9 must be 6 because 13 + 6 + 9 = 28 (the row sum).\n    - The X above 12 can only be 2 as we've used all numbers once, and it completes the row sum of 27 for that row.\n\n7. Our final grid looks like this:\n     6  2  X  4  23\n     9  5  3  11  24\n     X  12  8  7  31\n     2  X  X  5  23\n\n8.

Looking at the first row, we have [15, 4, X, 3, 28]. The sum of this row is 50. We know that 28 should be placed in the last column, so this reduces the options for X. We can either have [X = 6, X = 11] or [X = 1, X = 16].\n2. Moving to the third column, we have [X, X, 2, X, X]. Since the column sum is 44, and we have already placed 2 in it, the remaining numbers should add up to 42. This means X can be 12 and 22 or 20 and 24. \n3. Considering the option of [X = 12, X = 22] for the third column, the top left cell must be 16, as 15 + 16 + 4 = 35, which will make up the required sum of 40 for the column.\n4. This helps us fill in the second row as [31, 21, 2, 10, 24], with the option of [21, 20] or [32, 31] for the X values.\n5. With the option [21, 20] for the second row, the fourth column adds up to 40.

Row 1 must have a total of 13 units in black cells. The first and third black cells need to have a weight of 13 unit. Therefore, these cells are located in columns 1 and 3.\n\n2. Column 2 has a total weight of 3 units. So, the second row's black cell must be in column 2.\n\n3. Moving to Column 3, we find that the third row must have a black cell in this column as the total weight is 15.\n\n4. For Rows 2 and 3, we already have a black cell in Columns 2 and 3. To satisfy the sum of 14, we need a 9-unit cell in Row 2 (position 2,1), and an 8-unit cell in Row 3 (position 3,1).\n\n5. Finally, for the last row, we can place a 5-unit black cell in the fourth column (position 4,4) to satisfy the sum of 12.\n\n6. All the necessary black cells are placed, and their weights match the given sums for each row and column.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n[[1 1 1 1 0 0, \n0 1 0 0 0 0, \n0 1 1 0 0 0, \n0 1 0 1 0 0, \n0 0 0 0 0 0]]",

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n- For the first row with the sum 12, we can choose any two positions among 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as these numbers sum up to or exceed 12. We have plenty of options, but we will go with marking the cells at positions 1 and 5, which gives us the sequence: 1 X 1 X X X X.\n- In the second row, we are aiming for a sum of 4. We only have columns 2 and 3 available to add up to 4, so we mark position 2: X 1 X X X X.\n- Using row and column weights of 1, we can produce values summing up to 10 in this row and column. Therefore, we mark columns 1 and 2, as well as rows 2 and 3, giving us: 1 1 X 1 1 X X.\n- The forth row has a target sum of 12, so we can use 1, 2, and 5 to produce that sum. We mark rows 1 and 5, and columns 1 and 4, resulting in: 1 1 X 1 1 X X.\n- Similarly to the third row, we can mark rows 1 and 2, and columns 4 and 5, to have a sum of the weights equal to 12 and 3, respectively. Doing so, we get: 1 1 X 1 1 1 1.\n\nNow that we have marked the necessary positions, we can write out the final answer by replacing X with 0 where there are no marks applied:\n\n[[1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0]]\n\nThis sequence represents the grid with the blackened cells replaced by 1s.",

Row 1: The sum of 5 can only be achieved by blackening the first, second, or third cell from the left. The first option (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5) is the only feasible solution, so we mark these three cells:\n    1.  X  X  X  X  X  X\n\n2.  Row 2: For a sum of 17, we can blacken the first and fourth cells, or just the third cell. This gives us:\n    1.  X  0  1  0  X  X \n3.  Row 3: To get a sum of 9, we blacken the first and fourth cells again, for a pattern of:\n    1. X  0  1  0  X  X \n4.   Row 4: A sum of 13 is achieved by blackening only the first and second cells, so our grid becomes:\n    1.  X  X  0  0  X  X \n5.  Row 5: Back to a sum of 9, we repeat the pattern from row 3:\n    1.  X  X  0  0  X  X \n6.  Row 6: For the sum of 8 in the last row, we blacken the first, second, and fourth cells:\n    1.  X  X  0  1  X  X \n\nNow, let's look at the columns:\n\n1.  Column 1: The sum in this column is 14. We previously blackened the first cell in multiple rows, so this sum is already satisfied.\n2.  Column 2: Similarly, for a sum of 10 in the second column, the blackened cells we placed in the second position in rows 1, 4, and 6 satisfy this constraint.\n3.  Column 3: With a 12-sum, we need to blacken the first and third cells from the top. This means changing the third cell in rows 2 and 4 to a 1. Our updated grid:\n    1.  X  X  X  0  X  X \n4.  Column 4: For a sum of 4, we only need to blacken the second cell in the fourth column, so we change it in row 3 and now have:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n5.  Column 5: Our sum here is 13, so we keep the blackened cells from rows 1, 3, 5, and 6, giving us:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n6.  Column 6: Lastly, for the sum of 10 in the last column, we need to place a 1 in the fourth, fifth, and sixth cells, so we change:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n\nNow, we read off the grid, replacing each X with a 0 and each blackened cell (1) with a 1:\n\n1.  0 0 1 1 0 1\n2.  1 0 1 0 0 0\n3.  0 0 1 1 0 0\n4.  0 1 0 0 0 0\n5.  0 0 1 1 0 0\n6.  0 0 1 0 0 1\n\nReading this off row by row, left to right, and separating each row by a comma gives us:\n\n[[0 0 1 1 0 1, 1 0 1 0 0 0, 0 0 1 1 0 0, 0 1 0 0 0 0, 0 0 1 1 0 0, 0 0 1 0 0 1]]\n\nThe puzzle solution is the set of numbers enclosed by double square brackets as shown above.",

An island can be identified by noting the \"2\" appearing twice in the same row and the \"1\" appearing twice in the same column. Since there are no numbers sharing the same cell, the islands formed are disconnected from each other. Following the rules for forming islands, 1 X 1 X X X X X X 2, X X X X 4 X X X X X and X 1 X X X X X 3 X X would make some islands. \n\nFollowing the rules, a proper boundary can be drawn between the islands. This involves identifying the islands and the numbers equal to the number of cells each island has. The walls, represented by 'A' are placed accordingly between the islands, thus partitioning the areas with numbers. Since there are no shared numbers, and the hint numbers are distinct, the drawing of the wall is clear and unambiguous. The output matrix clearly shows the result of the operation, where the walls separate the islands as per the rules. \n\nThis solution ensures that the 2x2 or larger rectangle rule is not violated and that there is no contradiction that would hinder the player's movement. Each island is isolated from each other by the proper orientation of walls making the valid puzzle matrix. Therefore when the instruction \"with X being the blank island and A being the wall\" is considered, this is the proper arrangement that satisfies all the rules and completes the given puzzle. The elements arranged from left to right and top to bottom are presented clearly with each row separated by a comma.",

Since there are 6 X's and 2 T's in this row, we can place 4 tents accordingly:\n   - T C X X\n   - X X X C\n   - X X X T\n\n2. For the second row (constraint '1'), there is already one tent, so we only need to place one more tent. We place it adjacent to the tree:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X X X T, X C T C\n\n3. The third row has a constraint of '2'. There is one tree with no adjacent tent. Given the constraint, we can observe that one tent is placed next to that tree and the other in the space right above the existing tent:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C\n\n4. The fourth row is already satisfied with the constraint '1' because there are no more X's to place tents on.\n\n5. For the fifth row (constraint '3'), there are two tents already placed, and we need to place one more. It can only go between the two existing tents, so we place it there:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T\n\n6. The sixth row has only one X left with the constraint '1'. We place the tent there:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X\n\n7. In the seventh row, we have a constraint of '2' and an already occupied X-space with a tent. So, we place the second tent diagonally adjacent to the tree:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X, T X T X\n\n8. The eighth row already satisfies its constraint of '2'.\n\n9. For the ninth row (constraint '0'), there is nothing to do because the constraint is 0.\n\n10. Finally, for the tenth row (constraint '4'), we must place 4 more tents. Looking at the puzzle rule, we must place one tent adjacent to each tree and maintain a distance of at least two tents from other tents (diagonally or orthogonally). So, the placement would be:\n   - T C X X, X X X C, X C X T, X C T C, X X X T, X T X X, T X T X, X X X X, X C C T\n\n11.

Row 1:\n   - The first number in the row is 1, so the first cell is 1.\n   - For the second cell, we are given that 2 skyscrapers are visible from the left, so it must be either a 2 or 4, as these are the only heights missing in the first row. Since the third cell will also be a 2, we place a 4 in the second cell to avoid repeats.\n\n2. Row 1 (continued):\n   - For the third cell, we know it must be a 2 based on the clue in Row 1.\n   - The final cell in this row is determined by the clue 2 at the end of the row.
