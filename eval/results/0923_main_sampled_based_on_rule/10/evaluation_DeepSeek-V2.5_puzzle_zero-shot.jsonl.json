The only way to achieve this is to place a height 4 skyscraper on the leftmost cell, followed by a height 3, then height 1, and finally height 2.\n\n4. **Placement**:\n   - First row: 4, 3, 1, 2 (visible count: 2 from left, 1 from right)\n   - First column: 4, 2, 3, 1 (visible count: 3 from top, 2 from bottom)\n   - Last column: 2, 1, 3, 4 (visible count: 1 from left, 2 from right)\n   - Last row: 1, 2, 4, 3 (visible count: 2 from left, 2 from right)\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - 4, 3, 1, 2\n   - 2, 4, 3, 1\n   - 3, 1, 2, 4\n   - 1, 2, 4, 3\n\n### Answer:\nThe final grid configuration is:\n\n[[4 3 1 2, 2 4 3 1, 3 1 2 4, 1 2 4 3]]",
