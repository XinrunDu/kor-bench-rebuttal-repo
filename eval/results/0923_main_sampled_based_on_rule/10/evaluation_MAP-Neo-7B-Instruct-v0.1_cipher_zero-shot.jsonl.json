Thus, our plaintext is \"SD\".\n\n2. **Plaintext Grouping**: We group the plaintext into groups of 6 characters:\n   - Groups: [\"S\", \"D\"]\n\n3. **Plaintext to Binary Conversion**: Convert each group to binary:\n   - S: 'S' in binary is \"1111100\"\n   - D: 'D' in binary is \"1101100\"\n\n4. **Binary to Triples**: Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups:\n   - S: \"1111100\" is split into \"111\",\" 11\",\"100\".\n   - D: \"1101100\" is split into \"110\",\"11\",\"100\".\n\n5. **Applying Encryption Rules**:\n   - For each binary group, we determine the row and column numbers in Grid1 and Grid2.\n   - For \"111\":\n     - L1_row=0 (from 'S'), L1_col=0 (from 'S'), L2_row=?

The number found in Grid3 is 1.\n   - For \"11\":\n     - L1_row=? and L1_col=? (from 'S' and 'D'), L2_row=0 (from 'S'), L2_col=0 (from 'S').\n     - The corresponding number in Grid3 is 1, and we find the final triplet to be (0, 1, 0).\n   - For \"100\":\n     - L1_row=0 and L1_col=4 (from 'S' and 'D'), L2_row=0 and L2_col=0 (from 'S' and 'D').\n     - The corresponding number in Grid3 is 1, and the final triplet is (6, 1, 0).\n\n6. **Final Encrypted Message**: Combining the triples and transforming them back into digits (to their strings in the context of the cipher), we get:\n   - Encrypted Message: (0, 1, 0), (6, 1, 0)\n   - Encrypted Message: 010610\n\n### Decryption:\n\n1. We proceed with the decryption in the exact reverse order of the encryption steps:\n   - Split the ciphertext \"010610\" into triples of three numbers.\n   - For each ternary, we find the row and column numbers from Grid3.\n   - We determine the corresponding letters in Grid1 and Grid2.\n\n2. **Decryption Process**:\n   - For the ternary (0, 1, 0), we find L1_row=0, L2_col=0 in both grids, so L1_col=0 and L2_row=0.\n   - For the ternary (6, 1, 0), we find L1_row in Grid1 is irrelevant since we use an alphabet from 16 and Grid3, which uses numbers 1 to 9. So, the row number corresponding to 'D' is 6.\n   - From Grid3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0.\n   - From Grid2, based on L2_row=0 and L2_col=0, we find the letters 'D' and 'S'.\n   - The decrypted message is \"DS\".\n\n3. **Final Decrypted Plaintext**:\n   - The final decrypted message after removing the padding characters (#) is \"SD\", which matches the original plaintext.\n\n### Answer:\n[SD] is the ciphertext of \"SD\".
