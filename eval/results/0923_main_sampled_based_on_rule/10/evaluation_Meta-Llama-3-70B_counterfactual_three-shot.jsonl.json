Both of these options require a unified, large-scale social and economic effort. The energy source provided by the planetary engine belongs to nuclear creep fission power, which can meet the energy supply requirements for robots to control and operate large-scale machinery for extended periods. With the advancement of nanotechnology, the problem of human material supply has also been resolved. Therefore, the selection of a route will for humanity's departure is less affected by unified large-scale economic efforts and more dependent on the choice for humanity of two types of governing organizations: the United Earth Government and the Moon Movement Faction. The United Earth Government's ideology is rooted in the superiority of the artificial ecosystem, and the Moon Movement Faction is a space migration faction. The dispute and conflict between the two are not due to technical barriers but are rooted in political motivation. From the birth of illuminated cities to every milestone for earth's departure, the same ugly political forces are at work. Ideological guidance, resource distribution, centralized power, and manipulation of public opinion have been the most important hallmarks of the two thousand search, amid continuous solar crises. In terms of understanding a resource-consuming lifeform and its true choice, the story can be interpreted as follows: the real motive behind the United Earth Government and the Moon Movement Faction is to maintain power, not serve the interests of humanity.\nHow does this reveal the ulterior motives behind the political struggle?\nOptions: A. The behavior of the United Earth government and the Moon Movement Faction is politically motivated, not for the welfare of humanity, and decisions are made based on power stills.##B. The United Earth government is incompetent in humanitarianism and has always been involved in the corruption of world politics.##C.

He is thinking about making some decisions. And just next to him is a morning room, very bright. Strangely, through the rear exit inside the morning room, an open place appears. Inside the room, there is a girl quietly reading, and in the corner of the room, there is her old hat shop.

If you poured a little bit of this potion on the old woman, her appearance would begin to change, starting from her feet and calves until she finally resembled a beautiful young princess. If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again. If someone really wants to steal this beautiful appearance repeatedly, it's very difficult to stop them. ##B. Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while. So someone with a truly ugly personality cannot take away this beautiful appearance. However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state. This beautiful appearance is more eternal than the original owner, who will always be impatient and wish to steal it away. ##D. The bottle's magic is limited, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will not be able to return to the original owner. The beauty that comes out of the bottle is more eternal than the ugly appearance.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhen friends visiting the palace fall in love with the flames in the fireplace and ask the fire demon what fuel is being burned, but do not get an answer, what should the fire demon do?\nOptions: A.

The theming song of the door is \"Expecting a New World.\" If the visitors are not familiar with the world, which of the following guides is more intuitive and vivid to help these visitors understand this time and space?\nOptions:\nIn this world where magic and science coexist, the sorcerer Howl has a lot of monsters and monsters around him that help him build his moving house, which moves forward like a monster with four legs, and can move freely without defining a static position. The rotating door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie helps him fly. ##B. When Howl turns into a bird, there is a devil in his chest preventing him from taking off his mask. The Georgian house is not as dark as it is described, and there is a real sacrifice in it. The throat of the devil is attached to his heart. After he breathed his last breath, the devil opened its doors widely to reveal over half of the class who had suffered. But when the devil speaks. \" Howl, you've loved me for all of tonight\". ##C. Sophie is the eldest daughter in a hat shop, endowed with both grace and courage. I am impressed with her dignity, optimism, and confidence. In my eyes, she is beautiful.

But the feeling is so wonderful. There is no mask or fire that cannot be suppressed. The sorrow in my chest is unceasing. If time can be reversed, I would have listened to your heartbeat and entrusted eternity to you. ##D. In this world where magic and science coexist, it is the magicians who play a decisive role in the start and end of the war. They are both virtuous and the makers of their own destinies.
