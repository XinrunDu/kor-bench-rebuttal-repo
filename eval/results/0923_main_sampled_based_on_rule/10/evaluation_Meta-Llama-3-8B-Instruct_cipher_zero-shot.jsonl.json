Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. \n\nkeystream value: 14\n\nCalculate the ciphertext character y + x (mod 26): (14 + 13) % 26 = 3\n\nNow, I will look for the letter corresponding to position 3 in the LETTERS list.
