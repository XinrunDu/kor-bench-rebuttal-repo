Since the row sum is 78, and we already know the values of 31, 7, 25, and 15, we can conclude that these values have to be in this order.\n\nNext, I'll look at the leftmost column.

In column i, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that column (i.e., 1 through n).\n3. In row j, the weight of the black grid is equal to its position in that row (i.e., 1 through n).\n4. The sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column must equal the given numbers.\n\n**Applying the rule to the question:**\n\nLet's start by analyzing the first row and column:\n\n* Row 1 sum: 5\n* Column 1 sum: 1 (since it's the first column, the weight of the black grid is 1)\n* Since row 1 sum is 5, we need to place 5 weights of 1 in row 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second row and column:\n\n* Row 2 sum: 17\n* Column 2 sum: 2 (since it's the second column, the weight of the black grid is 2)\n* Since row 2 sum is 17, we need to place 17 weights of 1 in row 2, but we can't, as the sum of the weights in a row can't exceed the capacity of the weights. So, we'll use the constraints in column 2 to our advantage:\n\n_columns 1-2 sum: 3 (1+2) = 10, less than the row sum 17_\n_columns 1-2 sum: 3 needs to be distributed to row 2_\n\nWe can place 3 weights of 1 in column 2 of row 2.

Analyze the numbers in the grid:\n\t* Squares with numbers (2, 3) indicate the number of mines around them.\n\t* The numbers tell us that some squares X could contain mines.\n2. Start by analyzing the left column (from top to bottom):\n\t* Top-left square has no number, so no mines around it.\n\t* Second square from top has a number 2, so it has 2 mines around it (one of these mines must be in the adjacent square, which is marked with X).\n\t* Third square from top has a number 1, so it has 1 mine around it (but we don't know where the mine is).\n3. Analyze the second row:\n\t* Top-left square has no number, so no mines around it.\n\t* Second square from top has a number 3, so it has 3 mines around it (one of these mines must be in the adjacent square, which is not marked with X).\n\t* Third square from top has a number 3, and since there's already a mine in the adjacent square (we know this from the numbers), it means there's another mine in the 3X square.\n4. Continue analyzing rows and columns, making the necessary connections:\n\t* Bottom-left square has no number, so no mines around it.\n\t* Second square from bottom has a number 2, so it has 2 mines around it (one of these mines must be in the adjacent square, which is marked with X).\n\nStep 3: Verify the answer.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can guess the locations of the mines:\n\nX | 2 | X | 3 | X\nX | X | 3 | X | X\n1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2\nX | X | X | X | 2\n1 | X | 2 | X | X\n\nFinal Answer: [[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A]]\n\nI hope my answer aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle!",

Start by focusing on the top row: 2 3 2 1. Since the numbers on the sides indicate how many skyscrapers you would see in that direction, we can deduce the height of the skyscrapers. For example, in the first column, we see a 2, which means there are 2 skyscrapers of height 1 or more. The highest skyscraper in this column must be 2, since there's no room for a taller one. Similarly, in the second column, we see a 3, which means there are 3 skyscrapers of height 1 or more. The highest skyscraper in this column must be 3. We can continue this process for each column, considering the height of the skyscrapers in the same column.\n2. Once we have the height of the skyscrapers in each column, we need to ensure that there are no two skyscrapers of the same height in the same row. This means we might need to adjust the heights in certain rows to meet this constraint.\n3. The same process is repeated for each row, considering the height of the skyscrapers in the same row.\n4. Since the numbers on the sides are cumulative, we need to take into account the heights of the skyscrapers in the same column when determining the height of the skyscrapers in the same row.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\nLeft to right, top to bottom:\n\n[1 2 1 1] \n[1 3 2 2]\n[1 1 1 3]\n[2 1 1 2]\n[2 1 1 2] \n[1 2 1 3]\n\nAfter careful analysis and applying the rule, the final answer is:\n\n[[1 2 1 1], [1 3 2 2], [1 1 1 3], [2 1 1 2], [2 1 1 2], [1 2 1 3]]",
