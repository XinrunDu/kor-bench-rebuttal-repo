Castform form changes\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n## Instructions:\n4. Ensure your answers stand out from the available options.\n## Gotcha!\nTask: A complex function is applied to each point in a 3d sample and the result of two consecutive rotations is analyzed. As the final output, the largest change is stored, and the coordinates of the old and new points where it occurs are also stored. The gradient of this change is computed, then another rotation is applied, checking if the point would multiply the gradient along with the largest change. The process is repeated for all the given rotations.The formula $$vec(A - B) = vec(A) - vec(B)$$ defines the vector operation of subtraction.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Write a function called function, which contains a nested function called function that checks if the point p is in a closed interval [l, r] and it holds for all rotations.\n2. If this function returns True, then the function computes the value f (A) and the value of the difference (or the residual) vec(A - B).\n3. If any of the two inequalities in step 2 is not met, function will return False immediately.\n4. For each rotation of the original object, compute the residue vec(A - B).\n5. Compute the norm of the vector residue, r = abs (sqrt (& vec( A-B² ) )).\n6. Save the 'identification' of the original object, vector residue vector and norm r as a tuple.\n7. Repeat the rotation process for n rotations os the original object.\n8. Check if the output of step 6 is the highest over all iterations, if yes return True else return False.\n\n\\begin{array} {l}L = (pi / 2, (0, 0, 0), (475, 600, 45), (465, 465, 0)) \\\\ r = ((0, 500, 500), (500, 0, 500), (0, 250, 250), (250, 0, 250), (125, 125, 0), (0, 250, 250), (250, 0, 250), (125, 125, 0), (500, 0, 500), (125, 125, 0)) \\\\ R = ((((1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)), ((0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0))), ((0, -1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, -1)), ((0, 0, -1), (-1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)), ((1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1)), ((-1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, -1, 0))) \\end{array}\n\n### Code:\n\ndef function(L, r, R):\n\n    if\n\n    return True\n\n    return False\n\n    and\n\n    return True\n\n    return False\n\n    output = L\n\n    rotation = random.choice (\n\n    while rotations > 0:\n        if function (output, r, R):\n            Output\n        rotations\n\n    for iteration, data in enumerate (identified_residues):\\\n        if r[max (data[1]) < r[max(identified_residues [iteration][1])]:\n            identified_residues\n\n    return result\n\n### Answer:\n\ndef function(L, r, R):\nn = len (R)\n\nfor i in range(n*r):\n        A = random.sample (\n        B = random.sample (\n        f = A\n        residue = A-B\n        r = math.sqrt (\n        for each_object in identified_residues:\nid = f\"{L}\"\nr = abs (math.sqrt ()\n\nfor  in range (n):\n        if\n\nreturn result\n\n## Instructions:\n6.
