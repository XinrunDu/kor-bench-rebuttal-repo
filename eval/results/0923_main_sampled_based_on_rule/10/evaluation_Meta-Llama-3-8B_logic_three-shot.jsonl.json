The original intent of this conditional logic is \"If I know x is married, then I know x is not married if and only if x is a male. Transposing the given statement produces an invalid inference.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD. IncorrNeg Method\nE.
