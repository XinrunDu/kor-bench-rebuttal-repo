This means we will multiply matrix A by 2 and matrix B by 3, and then add the resulting matrices together.\n\n## Step 2: Multiplying Matrix A by 2\nTo multiply matrix A by 2, we multiply each element of A by 2. Matrix A is given as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & -2 \\\\\n-3 & -4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nMultiplying each element by 2 gives us:\n\\[\n2A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & -4 \\\\\n-6 & -8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n## Step 3: Multiplying Matrix B by 3\nTo multiply matrix B by 3, we multiply each element of B by 3. Matrix B is given as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nMultiplying each element by 3 gives us:\n\\[\n3B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 6 \\\\\n9 & 12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n## Step 4: Adding the Resulting Matrices Together\nNow, we add the matrices 2A and 3B together to get A€B. Adding matrices involves adding corresponding elements together.\n\\[\nA€B = 2A + 3B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 & -4 \\\\\n-6 & -8\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 6 \\\\\n9 & 12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nAdding the elements gives us:\n\\[\nA€B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-2 + 3 & -4 + 6 \\\\\n-6 + 9 & -8 + 12\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[((1,2),(3,4))]}$",

This gives us \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx=b.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the integral equation.\nThe integral of 2x from 0 to b is x^2 from 0 to b, which equals b^2 - 0^2 = b^2.\n\n## Step 4: Equate the result of the integral to b and solve for b.\nWe now have b^2 = b. To solve for b, we can rearrange this equation as b^2 - b = 0.\n\n## Step 5: Factor the quadratic equation to find the values of b.\nFactoring the quadratic equation b^2 - b = 0 gives us b(b - 1) = 0. This means b = 0 or b - 1 = 0.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for the values of b.\nSolving b = 0 or b - 1 = 0 gives us b = 0 or b = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0or1}$",
