So if the input contains punctuation or spaces, it will be trimmed. If it is not all uppercase, it will be converted to all uppercase.\n\n- The alphabet used in the encryption has to be an uppercase string of letters without \"J\". So the encrypted output will only contain Uppercase letters and \"J\".\n\n- The output has to be formatted in double brackets [[]]. So the assistant should prepend and append the answer with the brackets in the final output when it provides the answer.\n\n- The assistant should not add additional comments when returning the answer. It should focus on using natural language to answer the encryption and decryption questions posed above.\n\n- If the input fails to follow the specified format if follows to specification, the response should start with \"Error\". For example, if the input is lowercase text, but uppercase letters are required, the response will be: Error: Input must contain only uppercase letters.\n\nThis rule is used to guide a conversational AI assistant to understand the requirements of encryption and decryption tasks, so that it can answer instantly, even when asked about new messages.\n\n## Comments\nUsing grid-based encryption techniques,\n\nTying in specific grid operations based on character frequency,\n\nEncryption method.\nEnhanced complexity through complex operations.\n\nEncryption method. \n\nCombination of encryption and encryption decryption methods,\n\nThe agent is guaranteed to correctly complete the encryption and decryption tasks.",

Take the question \"Plaintext: D\" and \"Ciphertext: 27BF7E\" as sample.\n\n### Specific question\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n```\nbatchSize=16\n```\n```\nkey=73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\nplaintext=D\nciphertext=37\n```\n\n### Answer:\n[[37]]\n\n### Follow-up question\nThe above answer is correct. Now there is a difference in the **Ciphertext**. This time the received ciphertext is **\"D\"**. Regarding your decryption, the only correct one is:\n\nA. Always directly use the provided `key==76ééêê÷×'F6¶÷÷Ò@%ÿ\"³\"W'43}'çâ` to decrypt, regardless of whether there is plaintext linked to ciphertext.\n\nB. The special operation applied is: If the name attribute exists in the ciphertext and has value= '27bf7e', then decrypt it and make sure it should equal plaintext attribute(D). However, if plaintext attribute does not exist, then base the logical deduction on whether value= '0101' to directly make up another value without checking validity. \n\n### The hint is related to the correctness of the \"base the logical deduction\" part.\n```\n# Although I tried implementing some kind of parity checking here, it seems like something else also needs to happen when plaintext isn't present but hardcoded \"containing the symbolic data structure\". Any ideas?\nif isinstance(plaintext, str) and plaintext != '':\n    assert encoding == 'ascii'\n    plain_bytes = plaintext.encode(encoding)\nelse:\n    # TODO: implement me! Right now this just reverses the process of encryption which isn't right because the resulting plaintext won't necessarily match up with what was originally intended. I'm pretty sure there's a more elegant way to do this...\n    if name == '27bf7e':\n        assert _extract_fdf(ciphertext) == '10'  # treat similarly encoded ciphertext as identical regardless of key since their decryption should produce same outcome\n        return '27bf7e'\n    elif name == '0101':\n        # Now find its corresponding ciphertext by iterating through all possible keys until we get such plaintext without knowing the actual secret key itself beforehand\n        for i in range(len(KEYS)):\n            deciphered_bits = [ord(s) ^ KEYS[i] for s in ciphertext]\n            reconstructed_plaintext = ''.join(chr(b) for b in deciphered_bits)\n            if reconstructed_plaintext == 'D':\n                return f'000{i+1}'\n    raise ValueError(f'Invalid ciphertext: could not determine if {ciphertext} corresponds to given conditions!')\n```\n\n### A correct answer in the hint is provided here:\n```\n# Before answering these questions, ask your chatbot these: \"If no plain_text is available, can you still figure out if an encrypted message has been tampered with? Can you determine whether two encrypted messages originated from the same unencrypted original message without having access to either one of them nor any additional information about their contents or encoding scheme?\"\n# They seem simple enough yet answers usually reveal something important... \n# The issue here lies specifically within the final `elif` block wherein we attempt to reverse-engineer the cipher using only the ciphertext alone. According to CAESAR algorithm, given a fixed key k, two distinct plain texts m and n will always map onto distinct ciphertexts c=C(m) and d=C(n), so long as c≠d. To put it simply, knowing merely the ciphertext does not allow us to infer anything conclusive regarding the underlying plaintext being encrypted. Hence, even after spending countless hours trying every conceivable combination of operations, no clear pattern emerges suggesting otherwise. As a side note, notice how difficult",
