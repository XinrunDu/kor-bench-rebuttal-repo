The player's task is to arrange black and white pieces on the chessboard one at a time. Whoever captures more pieces wins. The black pieces, of course, represent the protagonist, and white pieces represent the opponent. The game has no real point or purpose; it depends purely on individual ability. There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun. This ELISP code abstracts this meaning into a common language: if something does not belong to you, then try to seize it.
