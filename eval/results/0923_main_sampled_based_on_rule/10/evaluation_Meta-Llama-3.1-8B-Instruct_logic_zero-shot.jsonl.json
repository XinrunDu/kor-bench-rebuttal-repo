specified logical rules to the given problem statement about Professor Van Emelen, we analyze the situation based on the provided methods Psi and Commander.\n\nAccording to the given information:\n\n- Professor Van Emelen sends a gift that is a book.\n- The gift is either a book that he has written or edited.\n\nTo apply the analogy rule, we compare the given information with the specified analogical reasoning.\n\n### Application of Psi Method:\n\n- Object A has attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen), and attribute c (is either a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen).\n- Object B has attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen).\n\nBased on the ψ method, since attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are typical of Object A and Object B, we can conclude that:\n\n+ Object B also has attribute c (is either a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen), ∴ (which means therefore) these types of gifts might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n### Choosing the correct Reasoning Method:\n\nBased on the specification that attributes a (book) and b (gift from Professor Van Emelen) are shared characteristics, we can find the existence of + attribute increment λ.\n\n\n\nSo the answer to the question is [[A]] because the reasoning corresponds with the characteristics of the ψ method.",
