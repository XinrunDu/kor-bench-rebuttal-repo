You can share your ideas through drawing or writing.\nAnswer: Monsters were able to take on different appearances according to the stories they existed in. Some monsters were ugly, with abnormal appearances such as horns, claws of knives, and hideous distorted faces. Some monsters had beautiful appearances, but they had unpleasant personalities. How strange everything looked, the more they exerted the power of the witch, the more the appearance would change, but on the inner battlefield, we humans were very cruel to each other. And even stronger than these strong witches, their souls also seem evil. Monsters are indeed a terrifying force, but they are only in everyone's souls. Everyone is actually a monster, if you do not believe it, just go and take a look at the mirror. I believe that it will no longer be a sacred place for you.\n\n1. Monsters have their own characteristics, with very diverse roles and appearances. If I were to use a classification standard in my own mind, I would divide monsters into three categories: those who use magic powers through dark methods, those who possess superhuman abilities without magical transformations, and those who cannot increase their abilities and instead go to great lengths to improve their appearance. It is very interesting to find that in your story, the \"Witch of the Wastes\" was used by the scarecrow, which showed that the power of the witch is much stronger, but it also seems that the people of the country deliberately suppressed the ignorant people, let them start wars and antagonism. Their actions are like a child playing a video game, all of it is just for kill away the enemy, but who is the enemy, and what is the real purpose behind the move? Another point is that both Howl and Calcifer admit that they do not want war, but they will not change the course of the war. This is because when they are against war, most of the citizens in the country will not agree with them. Either way, it will have a negative impact on their relationship with the citizens, and at this point, even although how much they want to avoid war can no longer change their decision. We see in their own story, how powerful their own powers are. But we often say, the power of a person is measured by its expansiveness, and the power of a person is also hidden in the times. At that time, the wizards were far stronger than the soldiers in terms of combat power. And the sad thing is that prominent figures in their country completely saw wizards as atrocious, and that is the character magic, because they did not need to dedicate themselves to society, and their potential was far beyond the average citizens of the city. So does this mean that if we have more powerful wizards in the country, we should recognize their abilities? Does this mean that their contribution to the country is more valuable than the other citizens? After recognizing the power of their own ability, should I allow them to go down the path of magic and cultivate their own power, or should they be consigned to a street performer of the human world? I think here is the dilemma that arises in the minds of people here, but no matter what road they take, the result is what it is now, while the real authors of the war have remained anonymous, while both the prince and Howl reject war. But only the two great powers of the wizards are recognized and reached by the royal court, while Howl returned to his profession, living in the castle. A mobile castle, while walking all over the mountains and oceans of the world. In this world, there is no truly pure scenery, there will always be surrounding areas and places where an ugly scenery will appear. I think with other wizards, Howl is one of the biggest reasons for the war. It was their selfishness, mixed with the selfishness of war, that also led to the destruction of countless cities, towns, and villages. And the wiser, or maybe, even the powerful, In five wars, no one will be able to stop their own war, and all those who destroy the enemies of the enemy are betrayed in the same spirit.\n\n2. Monsters possess a variety of traits that allow them to alter their characters and enhance their magical abilities to fulfill various roles. Personally, I think monsters can be classified into three categories: those who cultivate their own abilities using dark or restricted methods, those who achieve improvements without drawing upon supernatural means, and those who raise their self-esteem through exceptional endeavors. In your fictitious story, the 'Witch of the Wastes' bestows particular abilities onto the scarecrow. This reveals extreme difference between the strength of witches and the rest of the population. Despite this stark disparity between ones using magic and others relying solely on martial arts, the former is undeniably more powerful. Even so, it appears as though authorities in the given country are suppressing intelligent individuals; society is built upon antagonism and war. The country imposes immense pressure on members within, essentially transforming their appearance into that of a soldier partaking in the attack. Transitioning now to the next point - both Howl and Calcifer claim to abhor war; yet they cannot stop it, merely due to its massive scale and subsequent opposition to such initiatives. As such, in order to maintain cordial relations with society at large, the two individuals are compelled to participate in a war that does not serve their interests. To summarize - even with tremendous power at their disposal, characters such as Howl and Calcifer are unable to preclude conflicts entirely. Instead, they must reluctantly participate despite their efforts to the contrary. In this segment, I particularly enjoyed learning about the 'Witch of the Wastes', despite her chilly disposition, and how she had completely abandoned her restraint while performing rituals. In addition, the characters suffered from the influence of others, to the point where they were willing to transform into soldiers so as to help defend their empire. As a result, societies utilized such acts as a means of taking advantage of those with undervalued powers and latent abilities. Eventually, both individuals would cultivate their individual talent, resulting in superiority over all else. Yet it was not enough, and society continued to escape their obligations of betterment. Realizing the potential of monsters, we yet again witness the very same dilemma vexing us here on Earth today. Should we acknowledge their prowess within society? Are they worthy of becoming our next natural-born heroes? Being cognizant of their powers encourages us to observe their transformations while also examining our own efforts towards advancement.\n\n3. Monsters have their distinct characteristics; their roles and appearances vary. In my own mind, I categorize monsters as follows: those who exploit their magic powers through questionable methods, those who possess exceptional abilities without having to rely on magic transformations, and those who strive to boost their appearances by all means available. The Witch of the Wastes clearly has more power than her peers, owing to her joining hands with the scarecrow in this tale. Regardless of any differences in abilities or fighting prowess, I believe magic is still the more potent. That being said, it seems society isn't very embracing of magic and is instead suppressing non-aggressive individuals through war. The country is dominated by those that insist on fighting; thus they manage everyone to be like soldiers. Furthermore, Howl and Calcifer both consider themselves incapable of preventing or resisting such destructive power, because they find themselves incapable in having a strong stand in opposition, which is an inevitability in such a society. When even those with such incredible powers are doomed to failure, it's clear that the problem must lie with the society and its reliance on wars. For instance, it's apparent that the wizard and Calcifer don't have a choice in being conscripted by the government; instead, they realize that when wars arise, they'll be forced to flex their muscles in service of the country. Either way, they will lose their dignity, even if they hate war. Eventually, both the scarecrow and the wizard accepted that they could not overcome the warheads of the country or stop this world from war.\n\n4. Monsters have their distinct characteristics; their roles and appearances vary. Let me categorize monsters in my own mind as those that use dark means to leech on magic powers, those that have great gifts without supernatural transformations, and those that pay the price of hard work to",
