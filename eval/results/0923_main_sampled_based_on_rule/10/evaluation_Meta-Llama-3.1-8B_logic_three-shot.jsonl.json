For some computer scientists, this research proved that artificial neural networks could simulate human cognition, and ultimately maybe build models that really do think like humans.\n\nOne of the most promising questions for Alan Turing is “What makes a mind?” In his own words:\n\n\"There cannot be any strict arguments either way\", he wrote, \"on whether human intelligence is or is not susceptible of ‘mechanical’ imitation. This is an interesting question which arises anew in connection with each explicit attempt at construction […].\"\n\nTuring believed that the distinction between hardware computing and software thinking would be eradicated by a new generation of artificial intelligence programs called neural networks, or AI systems based on electronic copies of brain cells. According to Turing, a key innovation was an architecture of competing computer programs, an approach he called “multiset”.\n\nTuring was fascinated by the modeling of creativity and intelligence. He called it “machine learning”. He observed that “All machines in history save a few special cases can be decomposed into two parts, a prescriptive part that is to be used to encode our knowledge of the world, and an action part which we are unwilling to subject to the same fine structure of knowledge”. He pondered a new self-modifying program as “a potentially catastrophic piece of active machinery […] the more powerful it was, the less reliable it tended to become. This indicated that the more powerful machines should have better rules of procedure. Turing insisted that, because intuition was the basis of our belief in self-awareness, “the very best rules of procedure are automatable.”\n\nThe machine learning methods of today directly bear on Turing's proposed experiments with thought: the work of Fredkin and Toffoli on Turing machines, examples of interacting cellular automata based systems that compute mind states of creatures from cells of neural networks, polynomial time complexity classes, in a theory that term “time hierarchy”, counters Turing's conjectures about the general effectiveness of truth tables for all language problems.\n\nIf we confer the human power to perform any operation on a rule of computation regulating systems of numbers, then we can perform anything computable by any such a system. The argument of the existence of universal machine is rather weak on the foundations of thinking: we could by minimizing least-intensive channels of information only admit the regular pattern of information as a true representation, rather ingenious.\n\n### References\n\n1.

Since the information is too vague, it's impossible to know the context of the sentence.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/N/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA salesman calculated the average waiting time for each customer in the shop after observing a large sample of customers. He categorizes the customers based on their age and finds that younger customers (<30 years old) tend to have longer waiting times. Based on the information provided, can we determine if the younger customers receive shorter service times?\n\nA. Yes, we can confirm that younger customers are given shorter service times.\nB. No, we cannot determine whether younger customers receive shorter service times from the given information.\nC. Possibly, considering the observed tendencies, it's plausible that younger customers receive shorter service times.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nA manager observes a correlation between two measures within a firm. One measure is sales (measured as \"HIGHER\", \"LOWER\", or an absence of change (\"SAME\")), and the other measure is their market share (\"INCREASE\", \"DECREASE\", or \"NO CHANGE\"). The manager further observes that when both measures move upward together, sales increase by 10%; when both measures move downward simultaneously, sales decrease by 10%. This information is summarized as follows:\n\n- If sales (\"HIGHER\") && market share (\"INCREASE\"), then sales = \"$10 increase\"\n- If sales (\"LOWER\") && market share (\"DECREASE\"), then sales = \"$10 decrease\"\n- If sales (\"HIGHER\") && market share (\"SAME\"), then sales = \"$10 increase\"\n- If sales (\"LOWER\") && market share (\"SAME\"), then sales = \"$10 decrease\"\n- سایر موارد(بنابراین استدلال زیر بررسی نمی‌شود):\n\n- Otherwise: sales = \"[NO CHANGE]\"\n\nFollowing the logic, can the manager predict that \"Higher Sales\" and \"Decrease in market share\" will result in \"$10 decrease\"?\n\nA. Yes, based on the rules, the outcome is accurate.\nB. No, the rules can't account for this particular scenario due to an inconsistent outcome.\nC. Possibly, since the rules suggest a [-2,+2] situation as a guiding principle, but [+] yields different outcomes.\nD. It's not possible to determine this as the outcome, because the question asks about a situation that is not considered in the listed rules.\n\nGive your answer in [[a/b/c/d]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n",
