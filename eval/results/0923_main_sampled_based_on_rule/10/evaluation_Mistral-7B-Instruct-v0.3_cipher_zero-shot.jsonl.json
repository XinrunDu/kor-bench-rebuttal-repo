So the pairs are: {K-S, V-N, Y-, S-, U-, U-}. Since the key is shorter than the ciphertext, repeat the key. So the pairs become: {K-S, V-N, Y-S, S-N, U-U}.\n   - For each given ciphertext character c:\n     - Find the corresponding cipher alphabet based on the key letter paired with it. If the key letter is K, find the cipher alphabet corresponding to AB (as indicated by the question).

Encryption steps:\n   - Inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\" (predefined)\n   - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\" (predefined)\n   - Since Plaintext has only 1 character and the Period is 12, the inner_disk stays in position for 11 more characters before rotating.\n   - Find the character \"B\" in the outer_disk and locate it in the inner_disk. The corresponding position is \"L\".\n   - So, the initial encrypted character is \"L\".\n   - After encoding for each character, the inner_disk will rotate right by 4 characters. However, we need to encrypt 12 characters, so we'll rotate the inner_disk 3 times (since 12 mod 11 = 1, and after the 11th character, we cycle back to the first).\n   - After each rotation:\n     - First rotation: Inner_disk = \"KJLZX...\"\n     - Second rotation: Inner_disk = \"NIMJL...\"\n     - Third rotation: Inner_disk = \"QNIMJ...\"\n   - Finally, with each position in the inner_disk corresponding to its position in the outer_disk, and considering the rotations, we encode all 12 characters.\n   - Thus, the final ciphertext is [[K U V W R U X Y A O P]].",
