Here's the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p ∨ q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p ∨ ¬q): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q ∨ ¬r): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}.\n\n2. Initialize S0 and S2 as empty sets:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S2 = ∅\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S0 (empty) and (p ∨ q) from S1: dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = p (since we have p from both (p ∨ q) clauses). Add p to S2: S2 = {p}.\n   - Since S0 and S1 have no other simple disjunctive clauses to resolve, move to the next step.\n\n4. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S1 with (p ∨ ¬q) (note that this resolution technique creates two cases for L and L’, which should be considered):\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = ¬q, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = q. Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = p, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = 0. Since dispel(C1, C2) = 0 outputs “Implausible”, terminate the calculation.\n   - Since there's no other pair of clauses to resolve in S1, move to the next step.\n\n5. Check S2:\n   - Since S2 contains two elements ({p, q}), there is no satisfying assignment, so the given conjunctive normal form is implausible. Thus, S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm are as follows:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}\n   - S2 = {p, q}",
