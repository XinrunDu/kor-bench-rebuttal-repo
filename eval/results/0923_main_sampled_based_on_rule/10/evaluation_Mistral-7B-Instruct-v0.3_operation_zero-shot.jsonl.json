        "response": " Let's find the value of b that makes 0★b equal to b according to the given rule:\n\n0★b = \\int_0^b 2x \\, dx\n\nIntegrating with respect to x from 0 to b, we get:\n\n0★b = [x^2] evaluated from 0 to b\nSince the function is linear, the antiderivative is x^2. Therefore, we simply evaluate x^2 at b and compare it with the integrand evaluated at zero (which is zero because the intergral starts at 0).\n\n0 = b^2 - 0^2\nb^2 = 0\nb = 0\n\nHowever, as it is a meaningless solution, check if there are any other values for b that satisfy the equation:\n\nLet's assume that there exists a b such that 0★b = b. Then,\n\n0 = b - \\int_0^b 2x \\, dx\n\nLet's solve for b:\n\n0 = b - [x^2] evaluated from 0 to b\n0 = b - (b^2 - 0)\nb^2 = b\nb^2 - b = 0\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nSo, there are two possible solutions for b: b = 0 or b = 1.\nAs b = 0 does not satisfy the condition of the question, the only solution that works is b = 1.\n\nSo, the answer is [[1]].",
