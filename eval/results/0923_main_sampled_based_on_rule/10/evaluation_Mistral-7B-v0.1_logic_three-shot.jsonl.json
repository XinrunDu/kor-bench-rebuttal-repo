But it is generally believed - especially by those who advocate industry - that the toxicity of pesticides to the human body mainly depends on the solubility of the pesticide and its absorption rate. For example, a compound with a high solubility of water, high water-soluble characteristics, and high absorption rate is likely to produce greater toxicity to humans than a low water-soluble compound. The most basic principle of toxicology is: the more toxic it can be, the more seriously it can be. Therefore, the question is: in which, in fact, segment (s) do you think the solubility of the pesticide and its absorption rate is higher or lower, and why?\n\nA. In the human hepatopancreas, the malium of gallinaceous birds is higher than that of terrestrial salmon. B. In the human hepatopancreas, the rate of absorption of low solubility, low-toxic mammals is lower than that of terrestrial salmon mammals. C. In the syringeous epithelial cells of small birds, the absorption rate of pulmonary toxic spermicides is much higher than that of mammals with terrestrial salmonosis. D. In the vesicular epithelial cells of terrestrial salmon worms, the solubility of terrestrial salmon worm recorded on the liver tissues of small birds with pulmonary toxoids was higher than the rest of the tissue sections.

Where, the wizard is not only identifying the answer from a logic problem, but also coming up with ways to define what attributes are present. It just adds more complexity, that is, thinking of a real world example for a hypothetical situation that the program cannot think of for itself.\n\nYou can also have the wizard type in special functions as well\n\nHere is an example. Can you solve this statement?\nA, B, C are 0 and 1 bit values. Therefore, B+B is -A.\n\nyou can use these symbols\n\nadd: \\sum\nB+B: B+B\nsubtract: \\prod\nA+B: A-B\nmultiply: +\nA, B: A-B\n\nWe need it to take the remaining bits of A as a whole bit. Therefore, the answer is B. A-A evaluates to 0. A-B evaluates to A. [Note: you may need to use an incremental \\sum \\prod or \\times and add -A to the value]\n\nHow to write it\n\nThe binary sum (-A) of 2-bit values A and B is B. Therefore, the binary sum (-A) is equal to B.\n\nThese symbols can help you here https://unsw.sharepoint.com/sites/maths/library/logic_quantifiers/ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS/1.ADDITIONAL_SYMBOLS\nUser 4: >Curren \n\nIn this so called language, you doesn't rely on any logical formalism.  It is nothing but a very basic loader level semantics that  *blindly* evaluates what you defined for a given problem without first looking if the problem somehow, of which the  definition is **exotic**( e.g.-A evaluation to all combination of A and a, did you write why A is evaluation- pracy to   godzillian A and a ), or even , if you follow same logic, A and not an exotic symbol can be come 0  as well.  which perhaps, you will claim that this is  not your fault BUT you are asking too much from a system which does not even know the language.  I hope you understand, can you tell me in other  way I can resolve this problem?\nUser 1: There are a lot of interesting logic problems. Some of them cannot be solved without allowing the introduction of numbers. \n\nThe problem with the current logical question design, is there is no objective way for you to know the answers are correct. For example, this is a more difficult question. \n\nQ: A's mom & dad each have 5 boys and 4 girls. They have 10 more combined kids than A's direct relatives (\\`  mother and father pairs included \\` ). How many more boys do A's dad and mom have relative to A? Use algebraic expressions with x being the number of boys and y being the number of girls. We want this to be abstract math.\n\nYou can only answer that question if you define the type of math you are using. For some I do know the answer to the question, however, I still cannot answer the question because it is not defined what I am using in the question.\nUser 5: I agree regarding the issue of knowing whether a given logical argument is structurally valid, but what matters is whether the argument makes good sense semantically. If the semantic interpretation makes sense, then the reasoning is valid and the argument is logically valid.\n\nThe best way I can see to resolve this is for people to vote up the arguments they find sensible, so the system can generate synthetic semantic mappings of primitive concepts based on upvoted existing ones. This still requires many inputs, and does not tell us the reason one argument is ranked higher than the other, but at least it gives the system a feedback mechanism.\n\nMore informally, I can notice the top answer for this question, and I learned something here because before, the meaning of \\psi wasn't clear, but now I understand it is used in the analogy approach from logic, but the approach is more intuitive than logical. The next time the system asks me a similar problem, it will be \\ps i for more cleaning up. This seems like a way to capture semantic meaning in the system combined with upvotes on arguments.   \n\n\nI should also link future responses and other posts I make hidden in my comments on other topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n:)\nUser 1: in this example, I would guess what the concept of #Psi and +Psi are\n\nWould it work the same in a written format?\n\nProfessor Van Emelen has a garden where all purple flowers are also edible, and Professor Van Emelen has a new purple flower garden somewhere. Since Professor Van Emelen is a professor, he would never get a purple flower that is not edible, especially if there are hundreds of purple flowers now.\n\nTherefore, the new purple flower garden must be edible.\n\nIn this case, your semantic would be #Psi and +Psi\n\nBut what if the professor is allergic to purple flowers\nUser 5: I think formula (1) and formula (3) would most closely approximate your logic initially, but as you clarified your answer, more familiar terminology came to light. All purple flowers were edible indicates propositionally = {FSP = \\forall v (PFv -> Ev)} in the NLP formalism, where FP=purple flowers, PE=edible flowers. Edible flowers are food, non-food flowers are something different, so we can say \\vee WS = FWv  (A or B \\vee C exists), but",
