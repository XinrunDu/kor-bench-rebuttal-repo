So, this does not work.\n\n     - Continue testing other values for \\( L \\):\n       - Let \\( L = 2 \\):\n         - \\( 111L = 111 \\times 2 = 222 \\)\n         - \\( I + 11B = 222 \\)\n         - Check for \\( I = 2 \\) and \\( B = 2 \\):\n           - \\( I = 2 \\)\n           - \\( BB = 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\)\n           - \\( 2 + 22 = 24 \\), which does not equal 222.\n\n       - After testing similarly, we find:\n         - Let \\( L = 5 \\):\n           - \\( 111L = 111 \\times 5 = 555 \\)\n           - \\( I + 11B = 555 \\)\n           - Check for \\( I = 5 \\) and \\( B = 5 \\):\n             - \\( I = 5 \\)\n             - \\( BB = 11 \\times 5 = 55 \\)\n             - \\( 5 + 55 = 60 \\), which does not equal 555.

Let’s correct and align appropriately:\n\n1. Westmolen is 1752 and 23 years after Vissers, so Visser's mill is 1729.\n2. De Jong's house, precedes Zemelmolen, matching 1683.\n3. Thus Zemelmolen is 1706.\n4.

Place the word \"ACT\" across (left to right):\n   - The first position in the matrix (row 1, column 1) should be 'A'\n   - The second position in the matrix (row 1, column 2) should be 'C'\n   - The third position in the matrix (row 1, column 3) should be 'T'\n\n2. Place the word \"CAT\" down (top to bottom):\n   - The 'C' in \"CAT\" should correspond with the 'C' in \"ACT\" (row 1, column 2).\n   - The next character 'A' in \"CAT\" corresponds to (row 2, column 2).\n   - The last character 'T' in \"CAT\" corresponds to (row 3, column 2).\n\nFill in the matrix accordingly.\n\n### Filled Matrix:\n```\nA C T\n0 A 0\n0 T 0\n```\n\n### Representing the Final Matrix:\nNow we represent the matrix with the filled letters, keeping the specified format:\n\n```\nA C T , 0 A 0 , 0 T 0\n```\n\n### Wrapping in Double Square Brackets:\n\n```\n[[A C T , 0 A 0 , 0 T 0]]\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n**[[A C T , 0 A 0 , 0 T 0]]**",

The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate the number of skyscrapers visible from that direction.
