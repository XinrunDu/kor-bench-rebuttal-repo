But how to compute '12/2+50/200'?\nHere is an operation to help understand the rule,\n(12/2+50/200)*12/3,\n\n* The numerators and denominators of fractions are integers.\n* You do NOT need to make any correction for the final fraction.\n* The minimum or maximum range of integer parameters will be from -20~20 range.\nFor easy calculating, if the range will be beyond 20, use the rule to get a number instead of binary algorithm.\n* Keep the input and output formats the same, int/boolean, Fraction/int/string etc., as it is in the rule.\n* Do not allow .(decimal solution, always int)\n\n###
