Solve Abbrev Word¶s Puzzles.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Think through the logic that will be needed to solve this puzzle type.\n2. Discuss any concepts that you find difficult or are unclear.\n3. Once you understand the full picture of the puzzle type, you can apply that understanding to the specific puzzle provided.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nA value is indicated for each cell on a grid (representing a top down view if you imagine a large rectangle as a grid). The rules that govern each cell's value are that (1) each cell's value is the largest number whose digits are the same as those on the rows and columns of the cell's location, and (2) no cell can have a value greater than its upper right neighbor. For example for a 2x2 grid:\n17\n1 8\nThe solution would be 2. The rules are broken if an 8 were put into the middle row of the grid and a 17 were put into the top row. The digits on each of these rows are identical, so by rule 1 the only cell value is 17, but by rule 2 the value of the top cell would need to be less than or equal to the answer. This makes the 17 be tied in another cell (probably the one in binary haha). So the only solution for a 2x2 grid is 2.\n\nWith a larger grid, in this grid for example:\n13 2 6 6 8 74 1 55 141 31 33 13 67 3 3 4 41 1 97 934 132 95 1 4 45 67 8 6 7 196 38 5 33 9 4 146 83 3 1 14 11 10 3 2 46 27 3 21 3 695 25 4 3 86 34\n\nthe solution is 1.\n\nThe rules are \"spaces\" between cells also count as digits. The two 8s in the top row are given the same state as one 8, if it were next to the other 8. So in a two dimensional grid, if the grid is space separated, then there are two 8s. Likewise if two cells have the same digit and one of those digits is adjacent to a space, then both of those cells have that digit.\n\n### Question:\n11\n1 1 88 3\n\n### Answer:\n6\n\n### Question:\n8 8\n1 11 198 3\n200 3 8 2\n\n### Answer:\n1 13\nA value could also be put outside the grid but that is impossible for this grid for example. Also all numbers are 32 bit integers so no numbers greater than 9999999 are allowed.\n\n### Question:\n3 11 2 8 1 7 4 1 33 16 14 2 4 16\n2 1 2 6 3 1 77 1\n1 1 6 17 48 30 2 1\n1 4 10 8 3 4 1 31 2\n1 1 8 2 5 94 9 8 16 2\n18 2 2 4 4 81 111 1 1\n4 15 19 5 6 4 1 9 77 3\n2 49 1 4 2 69 16 18 46\n2 2\n\n### Answer:\n2 3 1 55 2 57 2 5 1\n\n### Question:\n1 1 1 233213 7 1 6\n2 2 1 1 63412347\n1 6 6 54557 6 1 5\n5 1 2 2 3 4 7 5325\n7 7 1 35 1 7 6 866\n67 7 1 1 678 4 6 1\n8 7 1 1 86 1 4 1\n4 7 1 7 7 5 23 7 8\n2 8 4\n2 2 8\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\nP J\nR A J\nY T L\nV N B\nM M S\nZ I J\nN D T\nC O O\nU W M\nG I T\nX T L\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\n1 20454\n",

You must follow the formatting required for output, you should refer to the puzzle rule and the examples in order to identify which part of the cells contains an arrow.

Only the first letter of the answer will be lined after entering the output. Therefore, if your answer contains several points, then pull it to one line.\n\n03. \" I believe the results \" is clearly displaying the rule execution correctness conclusion. When the test case occurs an error or yields an empty answer, you will receive a warning instead of a comment that requests for more feedback.\n\n### Homework Procedure:\n\nGet some meal and drink before you start analyzing your Puzzle.\n\n1. Remove your phone from the presence, no communication!\n2. Pick a Puzzle you feel that you need more analysis of it.\n3. Attempt to find a point where it backtracks or admits that part of it is the problem.\n4. Search for input and outputs that yield a different logic content.\n5. Investigate possible alternatives for failure reason, admitting that some of the inputs and outputs are false.\n6. Focus on the Puzzle rule, as long as there is a repeated rule, seek where other rules play a role.\n7. Note all points that may result in true conflict.\n\n8. Analytical process completes in place, players must be assertive until the end of the puzzle, but they must let their minds wander a little.\n\nIf you can't solve the puzzle yourself, make sure to be game-oriented and write your problem on the comment!",
