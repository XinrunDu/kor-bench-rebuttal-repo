Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3.

After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4.

For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5.

Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8.
