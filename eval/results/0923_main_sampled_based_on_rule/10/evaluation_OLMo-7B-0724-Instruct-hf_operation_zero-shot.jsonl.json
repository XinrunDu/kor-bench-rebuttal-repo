This is not a solvable situation using this process. If we assumed the question, stating \"an integer\", meant a perfect square (W.T.F.), suppose B = 2.\r\n\r\nWhen B = 2, X = (240 + 8 × 2) = 240 + 8 × 2 = 259.\r\n 259 is a perfect square: 259² = (29,Research) × (29 + 2596) = 1,301, 596\r\nBoth of these values are too high, and we consider the next possibility:\r\n\r\nWhen B = 1, X = 240 + 8 × 1 = 248.\r\n\r\nThis time, the calculations lead to:\r\n248² = (24,8) × (24,8 + 2444) ≈ 24,8 + 2444⋅24,8 = 56,384\r\nAnd these values are also too high, so we conclude that:\r\n\r\n[[23or1]].",
