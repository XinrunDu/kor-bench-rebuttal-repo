Based on this, B will be 1.\n\nSo, L will be 9, B is 1, and I is 8.\n\nThe digit C must be 0 because I+1 (D from I+BB=DLL) equals 9 and since I=8, D must equal 9.\n\nHere is the answer: [[I=8,L=9,B=1,C=0]]\n\nHowever, we need to validate if L+1 (carry from I+B=LL) without I+B being more than 19, acts as carried value or not.\nSince I+B=8+1=9 and there is no carry, we can validate above solution as correct.\n\nTherefore, [[I=8, L=9, B=1, C=0]] is the correct answer.",

Then, we will use the numbers in the last row to determine placements in the first three rows. Finally, we will make sure each column sums up to the respective intended sum.\n\nLet's start:\n\nWe know the values in the 4th row: 31 + 7 + 25 + 15 = 78.\n\nSo the intended sum for the columns is [31, 7, 25, 15, ?], and we need to find the missing numbers for the last column:\n\n- 26 - X - X - X = ?\n- 33 - X - X - X = ?\n- 19 - X - X - X = ?\n\nThe sum of each row (including the last column) must equal the last number given. So we will start with the last column:\n\n- 26 - X - X - X = 26 - (sum of [31, 7, 25, 15] - value in this row) = 26 - (78 - ?)\n- 33 - X - X - X = 33 - (sum of [31, 7, 25, 15] - value in this row) = 33 - (78 - ?)\n- 19 - X - X - X = 19 - (sum of [31, 7, 25, 15] - value in this row) = 19 - (78 - ?)\n\nNow, we will find the missing numbers for the last column:\n\n- 26 - (78 - 31) = 26 - 47 = -21\n- 33 - (78 - 7) = 33 - 71 = -38\n- 19 - (78 - 25) = 19 - 53 = -34\n\nSo, the last column would be: -21, -38, -34\n\nLet's add it to the matrix:\n\nX  X  X  X  26\nX  X  X  X  33\nX  X  X  X  19\n31  7  25  15  -21,-38,-34\n\nNow let's fill in the remaining spaces:\n\nWe know the values that can be used are from 1 to 9, without repetition.

We need to select a combination of black cells so that each row and column sum to the values given (from bottom row and rightmost column).\n\nFirst, let's think about the first column. Since we have the sum of 14, we can look at the numbers that are less than 14 (10, 12, 4, 13, 10) and also the last row value, 14. We can fit 4 (from the bottom row), 10 (second last row), and 10 (third last row) for the first column to achieve 14. Now let's fill these:\n\n[1  X  X  X  X  X  5\n1  X  X  X  X  X  17\n1  X  X  X  X  X  9\n1  X  X  X  X  X  13\n1  X  X  X  X  X  9\n10 10 12 4 13 10]\n\nNow let's move on to the second column. We have a total of 10 given that we already have a 10 in the first column. This leaves us with 0. So we don't fill the 10 from the last row. Also, looking at the bottom right number, we have 10 too. We can use that number without any issue. Fill the second row with 10:\n\n[1  1  X  X  X  X  5\n1  10 X  X  X  X  17\n1  X  X  X  X  X  9\n1  X  X  X  X  X  13\n1  X  X  X  X  X  9\n10 10 12 4 13 10]\n\nNow let's move to the 3rd column. We have 12 we can insert in the third row. Now we have used 14 (1+10 +another 10+1+1) +10+12 = 37. We look for the total of the column which is equal to 12. That leaves us with (5, 17, 9, 13 and 8). It will work if we take the 5 from the first row and the 8 and 9 (second and sixth rows).
