Generate keystream value y using the initial sequence of cards:\n   - Following the keystream algorithm, the example output gives us y = 14.\n3. Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"Y\":\n   - x = (14 - 14) mod 26 = 0 mod 26 = 0\n4. Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x: 0 corresponds to \"J\".\n5. However, according to the rules, there seems to be a discrepancy. The intended plaintext \"E\" should map to \"E\" in the ciphertext using the correct inverse operation.\n\nSince there might be an error in the current response, let's clarify with the correct decryption process:\n\n1. Convert plaintext \"E\" to positional value: E corresponds to 5 in the LETTERS list.\n2. Generate keystream value y using the initial sequence of cards:\n   - Following the keystream algorithm, suppose the example correctly gives us y = 14; this would be the steps applied to get it.\n3. Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"Y\":\n   - Instead of subtracting y from z, we need to subtract y from z and then take mod 26 to find the original positional value.\n   - Therefore, x = (5 - 14) mod 26 = -9 mod 26, which is equivalent to 17 when we add 26 (to get a non-negative result) = 17.\n4. Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 17: 17 corresponds to \"Q\".\n\nCorrect encrypted plaintext \"E\" using this decryption process should be \"Q\".\n\nThus, the correct encrypted ciphertext should be [[Q]].\n\nHowever, based on the original encryption procedures, no details are given on how exactly y = 14 is derived; I've used the example provided. If the keystream algorithm was to be applied exactly as defined in the rule set, I would need the exact steps following the algorithm to arrive at the right encryption. Assuming the provided keystream value corresponds to \"Q\", which seems inconsistent with standard substitution cipher procedures, this serves as an exemplified process, but I suggest double-checking the keystream logic against the given initial sequence.\n\nPlease verify the keystream generation against the provided steps, and let me know if there's an error or if additional steps are required to appropriately map the plaintext \"E\" to \"Q\". If the keystream value is indeed \"14\", then the correct decryption provided earlier, which leads to \"Q\", seems to be correct in terms of standard substitution ciphering. \n\nTherefore, the final corrected output, as per the encryption logic I selected for this plaintext, should be [[Q]].\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"B\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\nExplanation:\n1. Convert plaintext \"B\" to positional value: B corresponds to 19 in the LETTERS list.\n2. Generate keystream value y using the initial sequence of cards:\n   - Since we are not given the exact steps of the keystream generation based on the initial sequence given, I am going to assume we follow the hypothetical scenario where y = 14 (as the example provided earlier). Please note, this is just for illustration and not the actual keystream calculation.\n3. Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"E\":\n   - x = (19 - 14) mod 26 = 5 mod 26 = 5\n4. Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 5: 5 corresponds to \"J\".\n\nHowever, following the proper decryption procedure, the ciphertext provided for plaintext \"B\" as \"E\" does not match the expected ciphertext according to standard substitution ciphering.\n\nLet me correct the process once more with an appropriate keystream:\n\n1. Convert plaintext \"B\" to positional value: B -> 19\n2.

Block Encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: Already done (0x46, 0x57).\n   - XOR with Key: \n     0x46 XOR 0x30 = 0x76\n     0x57 XOR 0x31 = 0xC8\n   - Substitute: Using the given S_BOX, we get:\n     0x76 -> 0xED (since 0x7 and 0x6 are not represented in S_BOX, the substitution steps are not followed as the provided S_BOX doesn't map to the given input).\n     0xC8 -> 0x8A (similarly noting the lack of mapping; S_BOX values are given for lowercase letters).\n   - Permute: Rotate each byte left by 1 bit (involves logical bit operation which isn't directly applicable here, assuming this is an intentional part of the instruction):\n     0x76 -> assuming logical rotation, it could remain the same (0x76).\n     0xC8 -> similarly, it could remain the same (0xC8).\n   - XOR with Key: Already done above.\n4.
