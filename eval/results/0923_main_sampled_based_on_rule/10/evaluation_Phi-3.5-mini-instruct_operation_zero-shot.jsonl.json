Thus, we have:\n\nb^2 = b\n\nNow, we should solve for b. We can start by moving all terms to one side of the equation:\n\nb^2 - b = 0\n\nNow, factor out a 'b':\n\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero and solve for b:\n\nb = 0 or b - 1 = 0, which implies b = 1\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for b:\n\nb = 0 or b = 1\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in double square brackets:\n\n[[0or1]]",
