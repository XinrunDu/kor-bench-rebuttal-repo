We need to understand the rule you've given for computing 1○3.\n2. We are required to compute the value of 1○3, but the question has not provided any additional information about the X variable.\n\nTo compute the term 1○3, we do the following:\n3. Definition of X\nA○B = (A+3B)×(A+B)\nwhere, A, B are integers. \n. Here A and B are integers and on reverse of A and B will become X and Y. \n. 3 means 1+(-3) ×(-1)\n3. Combine the variables: 'A+' and '(A+B). \n4. Simplifying.\nThe denominator is 6+(-27), an even number, so we can factor out the 27 from both side of the equation. N=27 (when x = number 2)\nHence, simplifying we get:\nX=56/27\n\nThe answer to the question is [ This boolean expression has two inputs, represented as (X) and (Y), where X and Y are indicated as 1 and 0 rather than doubles. In this case, it equals to X / Y ]",

Yes, it seems to match the information in the question you provided. - 10 Specifically, note that:\n\na = a and b = b. In this case it's a and b = 10 and 10 respectively.\n\nb = b and a = a.

The expression is 2ff2.5 (which is 2 raised to the power of 2, given that in simplified form that would be 10), and then we need to raise that value to the power of 3.\n\nExpanding 2ff2.5 to the power of 3, we get:\n\n2ff2.5^3 = 2 * 10^3 = 10000\n\nSo, 2ff2.5^3 is 10,000.",
