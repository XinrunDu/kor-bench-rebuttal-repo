Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows. \n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up.

Could you provide step-by-step instructions on how to decrypt the ciphertext you generated earlier? Also, could you add some example inputs and outputs to help me better understand the encryption and decryption processes?\n\nCertainly! Let's decrypt the ciphertext \"936\" using the decryption process specified in the cipher rule. We will use the same preparation configuration provided, with k_q_x = 12.\n\n### Step 1: Preparation\nWe need to calculate z first, based on the decimal number representation of 936.\nk_q_x = 12\n936/12 = 79\n\n### Step 2: Decryption Steps\nBased on the decimal number 79, we can use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter \"G\".\n\n### Step 3: Encrypt Output: \"[[G]]\"\nSo the ciphertext for \"N\" would be:\n\n[[936]]\n[[848]]\n[[030]]\n[[294]]\n[[56]]\n[[G]]\n\n### Step 4: Add Separators and Enclose in Square Brackets\nTo display these numbers in a format suitable for encryption or decryption, we will add a comma to separate the output from the separators, and wrap it all in square brackets.\n\n[[936][848][030][294][56][G]]\n\nTo decrypt \"G\" using the decryption process specified in the cipher rule, we will follow the same steps as the preparation and decryption steps.\n\n### Step 1: Preparation\nWe need to calculate z first, based on the decimal number representation of 425.\nk_q_x = 12\n425/12 = 35.8333...\n\n### Step 2: Decryption Steps\nBased on the decimal number 35.8333...
