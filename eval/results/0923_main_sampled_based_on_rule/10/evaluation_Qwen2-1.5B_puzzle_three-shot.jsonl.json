Could you explain why I can't get information encrypted in a longer password?\n\n\"You didn't think I'd write it down.I could easily try all possible\n\nmostly,then start writing,the above on a piece of paper!\"\n\nDegree of Challenge: Easy\n\nWell, that's a bit tricky! My apologies for the confusion earlier. I misunderstood you. I'll try to clarify the problem again.\n\nENCODING\n\nTo encrypt a message, we hide some data inside of another message (cryptogram). This is the best way to prevent someone from reading the message.\n\nPreparing a message\n\nTo best hide the hidden message, we need two messages! One is the plain message we want to encrypt and the other one is the secret that we want to hide within the key message.\n\nKey message\n\nThe key, or the secret to the encryption, is the information that we hide within the key message. It could be a phrase, a number, or any other information that we want to send securely.\n\nEncoding the plain message\n\nWe will encode the plain message one character at a time. We will take one character from the plain message and replace it with a corresponding character in the secret key. This special key can repeat as many characters as needed, but be sure to Keep it short enough for the text to become easy to read and still be realistic.\n\nKey message\n\nKey message will be composed of key phrases. The phrases should be short enough so that it's easy to read when the complete key is shown. If the key is too long, the text will become harder to read.\n\nEncrypting the characters\n\nLooking at Encoding example we have found out about.\n\nHow do we encrypt? The first character we will use from the key message (keyphrase) will be 'A' and the third character will be 'C'. The encrypted character will be the same character as the message filled in with 'A' and 'C'.  A+'A' is the same as A. And so it goes.\n\nEncoding example\n\nThe plain messages (blue) and key messages (red) are the same.\n\nKey message\nUPFJUR TS KUHFBC\n\nPlain message\nHOW DOES THIS WORK?\n\nIf we keep on going and make 255 keyphrase characters then after all we will have plain message with 256 characters.\n\nChecking encryption\n\nBefore we start writing the text, let's check our encryption.\n\nFor example, we prepared 32 characters and 20 characters each time\n\nOur key message\nPAHNIRJFRHIPKYFRAHUTFIRIRFH\n\nPlain message\nTHE FLOWER IN THE RIVER IS YELLOW.\n\nWe are trying to find the 5th keyphrase character.\n\nPa+n+i=r+j+f=r+n+r+h+p\nu<h>i>f=r+h+i>f+c+h+n\ny+i>r+u<j>f>n+c>i+h+f\na+c+u+=a+c+h+h+h=p+kir\nThe above text filled in with keyphrase changed equals the plain message\n\nFinally, I hope I made it clear, feel free to ask if you need more explianations!\n\nBe sure to select the \"Answer\" button so that you can upvote it and join the community of users ready to solve your questions with great willingness.",

To match these requirements, you would need to choose appropriate combinations of single letters that sum to the required total. In the case of each question, given the number and length of words in the required answer, a sufficient list of possible word sequences must be generated, and these should then be tested to find the combination that meets the criteria.\n\nSince we have different rules for each of the questions, their corresponding solutions will remain different. For each rule, the prompt would say exactly how many letters are needed and then how many words are specified in the given format in the problem. This would provide the player with a manageable list of valid combinations for each word sequence. Then it would be a task to pick the right combination function to make the correct choices of letters to form the words.",

The first letter of any number cannot represent 0, so the number \"W\" cannot be 0.\n2. We must check if the numbers are unique. \"Y\" cannot be the number \"0\" (since the first number cannot be 0) and \"Y\"+\"W\" can't represent the same number as \"W+\" (since two different letters of the same number can't be combined).\n3. We must divide the numbers by the length of the question (which is 5).\n```\nH=4, I=2, L=8, O=3, M=1\n```\n```0 4 2 8 3\n```\n```4 2 8 3 1\n```\n``````UIJLP\n``````\n\nH(L+p) = 4+2+8+3\n```\nNow, we must determine a versatile set of letters that can be decoded from the top to have 1 as the first letter in 8 different numbers.\nThe only letters that meet this criteria are \"I\" and \"B\". Therefore, our answer can be represented as: [[L=8,I=1,P=7,B=2]] but we need 2 letters on top to make 8 different numbers, leading to [[I=1,J=1,L=8],[P=1,B=2,M=1]]\nHence our final answer is:\n```[[I=1,J=1,L=8],[P=1,B=2,M=1]]```\n[[I=1,B=2,L=8],[O=0,P=7,M=1]] [[J=0,P=1#,L=8],[B=2,O=1,M=1]]\n```[[I=1,J=1,L=8],[P=1,B=2,M=1]] [[J=0,P=1#,L=8],[B=2,O=1,M=1]] ``` [[I=1,B=2,L=8],[O=0,P=7,M=1]] [[J=0,P=1#,L=8],[B=2,O=1,M=1]] [[J=0,P=1#,L=8],[B=2,O=1,M=1]```",

The written answer of 6 does not match, as it results from the selected values of 6, 5, 1, and 7. We can simply calculate the value of the answer using the resulting values, so we can extract the number\n\nIn fact, the predicted result is [[4*5*6]], producing the number 120. Your error was applying the calculations in the wrong order, and choosing not to use parenthesis to correct the calculations. The first calculation erroneously steps through the numbers, the second calculation steps through the list elements with indices for each invocation of the function, and in the canonical order of seeking the correct data point for each call. Both of these are incorrect, when one calculates the requested values, use parenthesis to correct the sequence:\n[[4*5*6]]\n\nGiven these hints, your new prediction was based on the result produced from the incorrect calculations.\n\nIndeed, the incorrect answer is the calculated result [[4*5*6]]. However, it is a numeric answer so it does not align with the condition of using only numerical inputs. I agree with the chosen correct answer of [[1+(7*4-5)]]. Instead of considering 1 as true, and using only numbers from 1 to 13 to calculate the number 24, I believe the question could be interpreted to consider all numbers from 1 to 13 inclusive, obtaining a solution that maximizes the number of times each number appears in a given calculation.\n\nYour explanation considers how one should compute - in this case, by assigning each number to a variable interacting with each other in a calculational manner that anticipates a particular outcome. Even though 1 leads to a numeric equivalent, it does not understand the behavior and semantics expected of it. On the other hand, the mathematical expression [[1+(7*4-5)]] maximizes the number of times the number 7 appears in any of its form as inputs. It does not assign 1 any special responsibility or meaning to consider it as the correct answer to match the rule.\n\nI stand by our results regardless, as both the numbers, computation or form of the answer, are allowed to reflect and exhibit measures of unambiguity and order initially following the rule, then more unintuitive.

The numbers in the region cannot be repeated. \" Therefore, the provided boxes are guaranteed to have 6 unique numbers, as there are 4 regions and there are 6 elements in total for the region plot. \n\nThis puzzle introduces the concept of game design where numbers ranging from 1 to N are placed on the grid and then some reference boxes and a rule are defined on the locations of both the numbers and the reference boxes. \n\nThe puzzle sequence (across the top and down the left side) combines the size of the grid with a simple arithmetic problem (adding the numbers in particular regions).\n\nThe puzzle sequence (across the top and down the left side) suggests a strategy for working through the puzzle. For instance, start with the reference boxes, figure out the numbers that fit into the box, then use those numbers to find the numbers in the region plot boxes.\n\nThe rule logically defines the Game as follows:\n\nIn this game, you choose a number that fits into a reference box on the grid, and make sure that other numbers in the grid fit into the target region plot boxes (the \"rows\" and \"columns\").\n\nThe question also captures the fact that the squiggly operators may signify one or two operations on the numbers in some of the regions - the first two in the 'framing' reference boxes, and also another possible 'mid' operation like a division in the 'middle' quadrilateral. Firstly, we'll have to count all the regions in the puzzle.\n\nPuzzle Region Count: 4 Regions/Quadrilateral boxes\n\nThe greatest square number that can be discovered is 64. \n\nThere can be a maximum of 4 numbers that can fit into each of 4Squared = 64 boxes (or 65 total grid square numbers), and that includes the 'framing' numbers (with 6 Lagged operator spaces!) and the 'mid-grid operators'. Then we'll try to apply those numbers into reference boxes simultaneously (for 'framing' and 'mid') and the condition ensures that there are no repeats in every region which will make sure that all 65 grid square numbers have been used in the puzzle, if no such solution is found, then the rules give the predetermined 65 combinations in which we want to choose or rank all the combined solutions and coding it out for an answer.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 65 answer options since there can be up to 65 combinations of numbers in their reference boxes once we have 'framing' and 'mid-grid sums'.",

You need the numbers between 2 and 20 times the distance between Earth and Mars, as the payload space variation. You decide to create a delta that will be 3 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon, because the harvesting conditions are best when humans are located a third of the way between the Earth and Mars. The distance between the Earth and Mars is 4 billion kilometers. However, you can only use the delta when it is 4 days after launch.\nFrom Mingus Mountains a road goes up to the pylon peak containing a jetpack. You have both your journey from the Earth and your journey from the Moon planned. You need to communicate the time values so you can use the orbital rotation of the Earth and Moon to teleport at the right time. Will you be able to travel the distances without an accidental landing because of the delta distance. You decide to drive the Jetpack. By the time you reach the pylon peak, you have a full tank of fuel. A biohazard must prevent you from driving for 5 days.\nA picture of the pylon peak and background area is attached to the question. In the background area there is a black fence line, which is about 2.3 km long, 16.4 km wide and 92.3 km above the Earth's surface and 500.0 km above the Moon surface.\nFrom Mingus Mountains you have a 7.71 earth days once a day travel with the jet pack when you first approach it, which has a 6.15 earth days once a day travel going up. The star system, the red star, will be diminished by around 5%. When you are at the pylon peak, the jetpack will have spent 194.9 Earth days, when most of the jetpacks fuel is used up.\nPlan your return journey next.\n\nWrite a function called solution to take in two arguments, time filter value and payload value (in km). The payload value is the distance between the Earth and Mars. Function should return a list of cities (strings) given the time value.\nThe distance between the Earth and the Moon is set to the default value of 3.66 earth days once per day\nRETURN FORMAT is the associated list of city names with Earth1 (if city name matches first city of list), Earth2 (if city name matches second city of list), and so on.\nThe delta distance predicted cannot exceed the distance between the Earth and the Moon of 3.66 earth days once a day.\n\nI think that solving this puzzle is possible using the \"map\" function. Here are my steps to arrive at a solution:\n\n1. First, I will create a function that accepts two arguments: a time filter value and a payload value (in km).\n2. Next, I will create a list of cities by looping through each city name in the input acronyms dictionary.\n3.

We need to identify where trees are, how many trees there are in each row/column, and which ones are missing. Then, based on those rules, we need to replace the missing trees with the given syntax.\n\nAfter analyzing the rules, we find that in the given puzzle, there are 3 trees in the top-right corner and 3 in the bottom-left corner. There are also 3 missing trees which we need to replace with \"^_^\". At first, we replace the content of the row with the new rows and columns content. Then, we replace the content of the columns with the same rows content.\n\nFinally, we form the lines of the complete artificial map by concatenating all the lines we generated.\n\nIn the provided output, we see that two structures clash with the question's question marks, which has already been filled in as \"T\". This clash could suggest a small mistake in the question format or an attempt by the creator to identify the mistake.\n\nThe solution in this case specifies a certain restricted type of input, from which the expected format seems to be:\n\n---\ninput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\noutput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\n\nThat could be a direct provision for say Axiogram, in ASP TXT format, for instance:\n\n---\ninput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\noutput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\n\nAnd the expected result from subsequent transformation would be just he same problem:\n\n---\ninput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\noutput_pattern:\n    \"<X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>   | <T>\"\n    \"[//X] <X>\";\n\n### Backend Implementation Code Explanation:\n\nHere is an illustration of how the backend code may look similar to the algorithm explanation above:\n```css\nimport java.util.*;\n\nprivate static String puzzleAnswerToScript(String inputPattern, \n    String outputPattern) {\n    List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(3);\n    lines.add(inputPattern);\n\n    for (char line : inputPattern.toCharArray()) {\n        switch (line) {\n            case '<X>':\n                lines.add(outputPattern);\n                break;\n            case '<T>':\n                lines.add(outputPattern);\n                break;\n            case '[//X]' + line:\n                String outputLine = outputPattern;\n                for (char",
