Each conjunctive term is a conjunction of propositional variables or their negations, and all variables appear exactly once in each term. The terms are:\n- ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ ¬r\n- ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r\n- ¬p ∧ q ∧ r\n- p ∧ ¬q ∧ r\n- p ∧ q ∧ r\n\nThese terms are in lexicographical order and represent all possible truth assignments for p, q, and r. Therefore, they are paired conjunctive terms.\n\nNext, we determine the binary representation corresponding to the truth values of p, q, and r for each term:\n- ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ ¬r: 111 (binary representation for the false assignment of p, q, and r)\n- ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r: 110\n- ¬p ∧ q ∧ r: 100\n- p ∧ ¬q ∧ r: 010\n- p ∧ q ∧ r: 000\n\nThe binary numbers corresponding to these assignments in hexadecimal are:\n- 111: 7 (M7 as it's a negation)\n- 110: 6\n- 100: 4\n- 010: 2\n- 000: 0 (m0 since it includes false assignment for all variables)\n\nSince the formula is a disjunction of conjunctive terms and each paired conjunctive term corresponds to a unique truth assignment, it satisfies the conditions for the principal disjunctive normal form. The paired conjunctive terms included are m0, and the rest (which are not negations) correspond to the formula being an all-even formula except for m0.\n\nTherefore, the formula conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form. It includes all paired conjunctive terms, making it a tautology, and specifically, since it includes m0, it is also a basic formula. However, since the question does not ask about its type (tautology, basic, etc.), we will simply denote it as per the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nAnswer format: [[A]; [denoted expression]]\n\nThe denoted expression consists of all paired conjunctive terms included, which are m0, m2, m4, m6.
