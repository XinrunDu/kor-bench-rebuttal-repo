Let's first carry out the operation inside the parentheses, (X①2).\n\nAccording to the rule, a①b=\\sqrt{a}+b^2.\n\nTherefore, X①2=\\sqrt{X}+2^2=\\sqrt{X}+4.\n\nThe result will then be multiplied by 5 according to the operation ②.\n\nSo, (\\sqrt{X}+4)②5=(\\sqrt{X}+4)×5=35.\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get \\sqrt{X}+4=7.\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides yields \\sqrt{X}=3.\n\nSquaring both sides, we find X=9.\n\nThus, the value of X is 9.\n\nHence, the answer is: [[9]].",
