To encrypt \"VA\" using the given cipher, we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1. \n2. For the first character 'V': V is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for V is M (the next letter on Reel1). Move to Reel2.\n3. For the second character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel2). Move to Reel3.\n4. For the third character 'A': A is on Reel3, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel3). Move to Reel4.\n5. For the fourth character 'V': V is on Reel4, so the ciphertext character for V is S (the next letter on Reel4). Move to Reel5.\n6. For the fifth character 'A': A is on Reel5, so the ciphertext character for A is K (the next letter on Reel5). Move to Reel6.\n7. For the sixth character 'A': A is at the end of Reel6, so go back to Reel1 to find the next letter.\n8. Reel6 to Reel1: After moving to Reel1 from Reel6, we reach the end of Reel1. Therefore, we go back to Reel1.\n9. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for A is its previous letter, which is R. Move to Reel2.\n10. As we encountered R on Reel1, we go to Reel2. Since the next character on Reel1 is not R, we stay at Reel2.\n11. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is R. Keep moving to the next reel until you reach the end, then go around to the next reel.\n12. Move to Reel3, and since 'A' is on Reel3, the ciphertext character for 'A' is V.\n13. Thus, the ciphertext for \"VA\" will be \"MJFB\" as the encryption order will be M, J, F, B for \"VA\", respectively.\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer for \"???\". To encrypt the input \"???\", we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2. For the first character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. So the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n3. For the second character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. So the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n4. For the third character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. Hence, the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n5. Thus, the ciphertext for \"???\" will be \"YYY\" as the encryption order will be Y, Y, Y for \"???\".\n\nThe encrypted answer is [[YYY]].",
