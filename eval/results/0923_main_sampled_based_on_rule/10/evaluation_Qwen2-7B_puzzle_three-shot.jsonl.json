The words can be arranged horizontally, vertically, diagonally, backwards, or staggered. Find all hidden words and label them. The answer should be the coordinates of the start and end points of these words in the format (row i, column j), e.g., BACH (12,4)(12,1) means that the word BACH starts with a letter in column 4 of row 12 and ends with a letter in column 1 of row 12. The output order should be the same as the order in the word list. Use line breaks between answers of different words and wrap the answer in double square brackets.\ne.g.\nSuppose the word list is BACH MOZART BRAHMS\nThe answer should be:\n[[BACH (12,4)(12,1)\nMOZART(13,7)(13,2)\nBRAHMS (7,7)(12,12)]]\nThis puzzle rule seems simple and straightforward: the user is asked to solve a puzzle where words can be arranged in different directions on a grid of letters, and they are required to find and label all the hidden words. Here's how this rule can be applied:\n\n1. In line with the puzzle rule, understand that the player will be given a grid of letters and a word list to find on the grid. The puzzle won't have any predefined solutions or expected end-points; the player must discover and label them.\n\n2. Apply this rule to any unseen puzzle of this nature. The words must be arranged in unique fashion across various directions and patterns. The most important aspect of this puzzle is to accept the deviation or alteration beyond the standard horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction, which includes backwards or staggered directions.\n\n3. Similarly, for your question:\n\nYou are to find hidden words on a grid of letters according to the following format. All words in the grid can be arranged horizontally, vertically, diagonally, backwards, or staggered. Find all hidden words, then label them. The answer should be in the format (row i, column j), e.g., (12,4)(12,1) indicates the start and end points of the word start at row 12, column 4 and end at row 12, column 1. Ensure your answers follow the provided word list. For every solution, use a line break to separate words. Double square brackets should enclose the entire answer.\n\nLet's apply this to a concrete example: \n\nLet's assume a grid given to you is:\n```\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n```\nAnd the word list is: HOME PRINT PENS\n\nYou would use the rule as follows to find and mark the words in the appropriate format:\nFirst, find the word 'HOME', using vertical orientation first: (1,1) to (1,3). Checking diagonally: check both the upwards and downwards diagonals, but in this case, you won't find any match. \n\nThe word 'PRINT' uses the horizontal orientation: (2,1) to (2,5) (though in this example, there is no 'T' in the grid, so you would end where possible). \n\nFinally, for the word 'PENS' using vertical orientation: (1,4) to (1,6) (again, though there is no 'N' in the grid, you reach the grid border where no more letters are present).\n\nYou'd then compile your answers to look like this:\n[HOME (1,1)(1,3)\nPRINT (2,1)(2,5)\nPENS (1,4)(1,6)]",

The question clearly indicates that the maze is specified by the arrangement of arrows in grid cells, and that the task is to find the inflection points (places where the direction of the arrow changes) in order. I understand that the direction of the arrow is clockwise and changes every 6 grids.  \n\nThe output for each question is a list of numbers separated by spaces, with the digits representing the position of each inflection point. To solve this task, I applied the specified rule and identified the moving direction by comparing the arrow direction at a location with the one in the previous location. If the directions didn't match or if we got back to the starting position, I considered that as an inflection point and saved its position.\n\nLet's consider one of your questions:\n\n### Question:\n↙        ↓        ↑  \n↗       傝         ↙\n↘         ↗         →\nI considered the blanks as indicating no change in direction. So the direction of the first arrow is `words-words`. Then, the direction of the second arrow is `中美-不`, which points down, but words以下 otherwise indicate that we have to go to the right. Therefore, a change in direction has occured, an inflection point has been found at grid position (1,0).\n\nContinuing like this I computed the positions of the inflection points. The positions are (0,2), (0,4), (2,3), (3,0). The coordinates are given in respect of the top left corner of the grid, starting from 0 and beginning with the row above the first row. \n\nTherefore, following the rule I identified the inflection points and saved their positions according to the rules you provided. Please note that you might slightly adjust the rules to fit your needs but this should give you a starting point.",
