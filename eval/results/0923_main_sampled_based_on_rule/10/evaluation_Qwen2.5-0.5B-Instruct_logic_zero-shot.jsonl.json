A paired conjunctive term is a pair of propositional variables with their negations arranged in ascending or lexicographical order, respectively.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the formula and see if any pairs of propositional variables fit into this structure.\n\n1. Evaluate the negations:\n   - ¬p\n   - ¬q\n   - ¬r\n\n2. Check for any pair of propositional variables:\n   - ¬p\n   - ¬q\n   - ¬r: These are not paired conjunctive terms.\n\n3. Check the pairs:\n   - ¬p ∧ ¬q (paradoxical pair): This is a contradiction, not a paired conjunctive term.\n   - ¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ ¬r (enclosing enclosed group): This is not a paired conjunctive term.\n   - ¬p ∧ q ∧ r: This is a contradiction, not a paired conjunctive term.\n   - p ∧ ¬q ∧ r: This is a contradiction, not a paired conjunctive term.\n   - p ∧ q ∧ r: This is not a paired conjunctive term.\n\nSince none of the propositional variables or their negations meet the criteria for forming a paired conjunctive term, the given Boolean formula does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]].\n\nIf there are any additional complex logic or requirements not explicitly mentioned, please let me know, and I can provide further assistance.",
