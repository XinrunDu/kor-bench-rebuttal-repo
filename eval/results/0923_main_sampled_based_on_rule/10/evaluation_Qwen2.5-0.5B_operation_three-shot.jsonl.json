Let's get started.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rules and Question**\n   - In the given rules, four operations are defined where:\n     - One operation is named `※` that takes two inputs (a and b).\n     - It applies a conditional operation based on the relationship between a and b, using `※` with indices 1 and 2 for operations 1 and 2 respectively.\n     - The third operation, `※`, is a simple arithmetic operation(`+`) followed by a modification (`+`) at the end for each pair `(a * b)` and `(b * a)` with indices 1 and 2 for operations 1 and 2 respectively. Hence it's `[(a * b) + (b * a)]`.\n     - The fourth operation `※` takes another input and applies a condition according to an expected value for a pair `(a, b)` with indices 1 and 2 for operations 1 and 2 respectively. So it's `[(a / b) + (b / a)]`.\n\n### Initial Steps\n- Given the request to compute `5 ※ 25`, we need to follow the basic pattern of `※` followed by any condition based on the application of the multiplication/subtraction along with the operating relationship `1 * 5`.\n\n### Steps:\n```\n  5 ※ 25 = ?\n\n```\n1. **Step 1: Base Case (5 * 5)**\n   - The base case involves computing the first part of the condition part using indices 1 (`[5 * 5 + (5 * 5)]`).\n   - This gives `50`.\n2. **Step 2: Recursive Case (※)**\n   - Next, we apply the condition logic defined by the rule from `※` after computing the base result.\n     - `※` checks if either a or b is a multiple of the other. For instance, `15`.*(`※` 25`※`) should fall here, whereas `1`.*(`※` 25) should also apply because 1 is not a multiple of anything (1 is not a new operation but a constant).\n3. **Step 3: Complex Path Improvement**\n   - Instead of guessing each operation individually, we identify where complex paths might go.\n4. **Final Step: Apply Indices**\n   - When indices suggest complex paths for each step, ensure the result indeed fits the condition based on the indices `more initial steps refine `※`.\n \n### Summary:\nThe given conditions suggest evaluating the next inputs `※` separately considering conditions as follows-:\n- If `1 * 25` or `2 * 25`, then `※` might utilize manipulation involving multiplications, modular operations. But let's examine whether this resolve without restricting the nature of operations to `※` based on the conditions mentioned. \n\nIts outcome might be `251`. This isn't within the confines of typical conditions you'd use `※` for but confirms how one might apply according to the constraints you have provided without verifying every possible path without extra information surrounding the business logic.\n\n### Revised Rules\n- Since these new operations are conditional, they cannot be exact inspections. However, their core logic AND will match conditions defined and possible paths for advanced training complex functionality with differing inputs, simulating higher potential usecases real-world conditions give indication of intricate dynamic kinds ¦",

Therefore, the operation '◇' is logical and should be interpreted as 'power'. The input for the operation `a◇b= a^b` includes `a` and `b` (positive integers) and defines the function as `a^b`.\n\nApplying the operators to each possible pair of `a` and `b` (let's denote `a` as `a`). The function `a^b` simply repeats the operation.\n\nFor the case at hand, let's compute `2◇3`.\n\nAccording to the operation definition:\n\n1. `a◇b= a^b` leads to `a^b`.\n   - If `a=2`, then `2^3=(2^1)*(2^2) = 2 * (2^2)`.\n\nTherefore, for `a=2`:\n\n```d\n2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2\n```\n\nAccording to `a◇b`:\n\n- If `b=3`, then `2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2`.\n\nThus, the value for `a=2` of `2◇3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```result\n[[8]]\n```\n\nNote: In this case, the question doesn't specifically refer to `a: 2`, but simply asks `◇: 3`.\n\nIf we need the correct answer, it should indeed be:\n```result\n[[8]]\n```",

Instead, let's consider another approach.\n   - Let \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 2\\). Then \\(a\\%b = a^b\\) and we want to find \\(x\\) such that \\(a\\%b = 12\\). This can be rewritten as \\(a^\\u = 12\\) and finding \\(\\u\\) satisfies \\(x - u = 2\\) implies \\(u = x - 2\\). So, if \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 2\\), we should have \\(x^2 = 12\\). Solving for \\(x\\), we get \\(x = \\sqrt{12}\\), which is not an integer.\n   - Instead, let's find a solution where \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 6\\), which satisfies \\(a\\%b = 4^{6}\\).\n   - So, \\(a\\%b = 4^6 = 4096\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to the Second Question:**\n   - The operation rule involves a specific operation: \\(a\\%b = a^b\\).\n   - Since the rule only specifies two numbers and their difference, we can consider two numbers, say \\(x\\) and \\(u\\), where \\(2 - x = u\\).\n   - By substituting these values into the rule, we get \\(x\\%u = x^u\\).\n   - Using the initial relationship \\(x - u = 2\\), we find \\(u = x - 2\\).\n   - Substitute \\(u\\) into the expression: \\(x\\%2\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\sqrt{x}\\).\n   - However, this does not follow directly from the rule. Instead, let's consider another approach.\n   - Let \\(a = X\\) and \\(b = 1\\). Then \\(a\\%b = a^b\\) and we want to find \\(X\\) such that \\(a\\%b = 12\\). This can be rewritten as \\(X^1 = 12\\) and we need to find \\(X\\) such that \\(X \\approx 13.25\\). However, since this fits the form of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), the answer is \\(\\sqrt{13.25}\\).\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to the Third Question:**\n   - The operation rule involves a specific operation: \\(a\\%b = a^b\\).\n   - Since the rule only specifies two numbers and their difference, we can consider two numbers, say \\(x\\) and \\(u\\), where \\(2 - x = u\\).\n   - By substituting these values into the rule, we get \\(x\\%u = x^\\u\\).\n   - Using the initial relationship \\(2 - x = u\\), we find \\(u = x - 2\\).\n   - Substitute \\(u\\) into the expression: \\(x\\%5\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n   - However, this does not fit the form of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), but it does fit the form of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Fourth Question:**\n   - The operation rule involves a specific operation: \\(a\\%b = a^b\\).\n   - Since the rule only specifies two numbers and their difference, we can consider two numbers, say \\(x\\) and \\(u\\), where \\(2 - x = u\\).\n   - By substituting these values into the rule, we get \\(x\\%2\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - However, this does not fit the form of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), but it does fit the form of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for \\(x = \\sqrt[4]{2}\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed[[[\\sqrt{13.25}]]]}",

The final answer is in a format like [[your answer]], with a specific condition on whether a is included or not. Thank you for adhering to the provided rules and challenges. Based on the information provided and the rules applied, let's evaluate each part of the question step by step.\n\n### Rule Application\n\n1. **Rule for a●b**:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx}{b-a} = \\frac{b-a}{a} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\]\nThis formula relates the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) within the interval \\([a, b]\\) to the definite integral of \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Rule for (a●b)**:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx}{\\frac{1}{2}b^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(b-a)(2(b-a)(b+a))}{(a^2+b^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{b+a}{4} \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right) \\]\n\nBy applying these rules properly, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx}{b-a} = \\frac{(b-a)}{a} \\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx + \\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{(b-a)}{a} \\cdot \\frac{b^3}{3} + \\frac{b^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b^3}{3} = \\frac{b^6}{3a} + \\frac{b^5}{6} \\]\n\nSince we are only asked for a specific numerical value, we assume '1●3' means 1 times 3, giving us:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\]\n\nHowever, since the second question asks for the value given by a⋅(2π/3), we first need to evaluate \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n### Calculations\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} x^2 \\, dx}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - a^2} = \\frac{(a^2 - b^2)}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - a^2} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{9}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{0} \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that when \\(b = \\pi\\), the expression simplifies to 0, indicating either a trivial case (i.e., no integration) or error. However, depending on the context, typically \\(b = \\pi\\) is the solution, making the final answer:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nIf for exact answer, proceed with the second part of the question specifically for \\(b = \\pi\\): find \\(a\\).",
