Start with [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)].\n2. Using Q over any formula, connect sets. So we get [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)(p(x)\\land 4-x\\neq3)].\n3. Since [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)] is symmetric, apply T to get [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)].\n4. Applying equivalent forms of A, get Q [p(x)\\land 4-x=3].\n5. Expanding assign [Q (\\neg(\\neg 2-x = 3)(2-x\\neq3))].\n6. Combine A, get Q p(x).\n7. Applying T and Q over or, so we get [Q p(x)\\land p(x)].\n\nThus, the final answer can be written as Q p(x) Q p(x).\n\n### Question:\nGiven:\np(x): All furry animals are mammals.\nq(x): x enjoys being petted by humans.\nr(x): x is a cat\n\nFind the truth values for the following formula:\n\\left.{\\begin{matrix}p(r(x)) \\\\ q(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\land(-q(x))+\\left.{\\begin{matrix}r(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\vdots-\n\nPlease list your solutions.\nFormat should be [[T or F]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[T], [F]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is equal to 2\"\np2: \"2 is prime\"\np3: \"All even numbers larger than 2 are prime\"\np4: \"4, 6, 8, and 10 are all even numbers\"\n\nSymbolize:\n- p1 Q [p2 (p3 P Q p4)] \nReason: Given that p1 is true, we can conclude p2,3,4 must be true as each statement describes a condition that must hold for all values of x to keep p1 as true.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=(2②⑩2)],[x|x|p1=2],[x|x|p1=(2⑦⑦12)]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is an even number.\"\np2: \"x is an odd number.\"\np3: \"x is a positive integer.\"\np4: \"x ≤ u is true.\"\n\nDetermine:\n\na. Why p1 and p3 cannot be true at the same time.\nb. Why p4 and p1 cannot be true at the same time.\n\n### Answer:\na. p1 and p3 cannot be true at the same time because an even number is not an odd number.\nb. p4 and p1 cannot be true at the same time because if x is an even number, x ≤ u must be true and it cannot be at the same time an odd number. Therefore, if x is odd, x ≤ u does not need to be true.\n\n### Question:\nUsing the statements given:\np1: \"There exists a number with more than 20 digits.\"\np2: \"Every positive integer is rational.\"\n\nDetermine the truth value of the following:\np1⇒~p2\np1⇔∃a:b:c:d|a＞ab＞cb＞da\n\nPlease note the \" facts \", make clear the relationships between them.\n\n### Answer:\nStep 1: Determine if P1 is true or false.\nStep 2: Based on P1, determine the truth value of P2.\n\nIn case P1 is false, P1⇒~P2 is true because an implication is true if the premise is false. In case P1 is true, then all positive integers are rational, which contradicts P2. Therefore, the formula P1⇔∃a:b:c:d|a＞ab＞cb＞da holds true if and only if P1 is false and P2 is true.",
