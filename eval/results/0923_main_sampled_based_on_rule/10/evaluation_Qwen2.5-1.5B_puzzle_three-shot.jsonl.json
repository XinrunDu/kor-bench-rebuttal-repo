The player should replace these regions with the four arrows ↓ ↑ → ← and output the drawn matrix.\n\nThe part you and I agreed on is (2): Arrows are drawn by players. This aligns with the rule in question, as arrows can only be drawn by players to play the game.\n\nThe part I disagreed on was the rules for the blank squares.
