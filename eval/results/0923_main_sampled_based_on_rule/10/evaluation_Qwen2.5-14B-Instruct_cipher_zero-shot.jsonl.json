        "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"FW\" according to the specified rules, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Padding**: The text \"FW\" is 2 characters long and therefore needs padding to be a multiple of 8 bytes. The padding used is \\x00. So, it is padded to \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting**: The text is now fully padded and split into a single block: \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n3. **Block Encryption**:\n   - **Convert to Bytes and XOR with Key**: First, we convert each character in the block to its ASCII byte value:\n     ```\n     'F' -> 0x46, 'W' -> 0x57, '\\x00' -> 0x00 (repeated 6 times)\n     ```\n     The block in byte form is `46 57 00 00 00 00 00 00`.\n     XOR this with the given key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`:\n     ```\n     46 ^ 31 = 15\n     57 ^ 50 = 0D\n     00 ^ 73 = 73\n     00 ^ 4D = 4D\n     00 ^ 27 = 27\n     00 ^ 51 = 51\n     00 ^ AE = AE\n     00 ^ 3F = 3F\n     ```\n     So, the result is `15 0D 73 4D 27 51 AE 3F`.\n   - **Substitute**: Use the S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in each byte:\n     ```\n     15 -> (1 -> 0A, 5 -> 03) -> 0A03 -> 030A = 0A03\n     0D -> (0 -> 0F, D -> 02) -> 0F02 = 0F02\n     73 -> (7 -> 05, 3 -> 05) -> 0505 = 0505\n     4D -> (4 -> 09, D -> 02) -> 0902 = 0902\n     27 -> (2 -> 07, 7 -> 05) -> 0705 = 0705\n     51 -> (5 -> 09, 1 -> 0A) -> 090A = 090A\n     AE -> (A -> 04, E -> 0E) -> 040E = 040E\n     3F -> (3 -> 05, F -> 0C) -> 050C = 050C\n     ```\n     So, after substitution, we have `0A 03 0F 02 05 05 09 02 07 05 09 0A 04 0E 05 0C`.\n     Combining them makes it `0A 03 0F 02 05 05 09 02`.\n   - **Permute**: Rotate each byte left by 1 bit:\n     ```\n     0A -> 10, 03 -> 06, 0F -> F8, 02 -> 40, 05 -> A0, 05 -> A0, 09 -> 20, 02 -> 40\n     ```\n     So, after permutation, we have `10 06 F8 40 A0 A0 20 40`.\n   - **XOR with Key** again, using the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`:\n     ```\n     10 ^ 31 = 21\n     06 ^ 50 = 56\n     F8 ^ 73 = 69\n     40 ^ 4D = 4D\n     A0 ^ 27 = 87\n     A0 ^ 51 = F1\n     20 ^ AE = CA\n     40 ^ 3F = 7F\n     ```\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding and Concatenate**:\n   - The result after XORing is `21 56 69 4D 87 F1 CA 7F`.\n   - Converting this to a hexadecimal string gives `2156694D87F1CA7F`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n[[2156694D87F1CA7F]]",
