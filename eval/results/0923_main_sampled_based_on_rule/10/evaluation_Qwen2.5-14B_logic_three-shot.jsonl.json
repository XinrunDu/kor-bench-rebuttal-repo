Here's a summary and some additional explanations for clarity:\n\n### Question 1:\n**\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis answer correctly represents the given proposition using the `=` operator to denote \"if and only if\" and the `~` operator to denote \"not\". Thus, `p1` is true if and only if `p2` is false.\n\n### Question 2:\n**Determine the level, type of \\( p1 \\).**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[A];[C]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Level:** \\( p1 \\) is a Level A formula because it is a single proposition without any logical connectives or nested structures.\n- **Type:** \\( p1 \\) is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula, as its truth value depends on the assignment of \\( p1 \\). Therefore, it is a C (neither).\n\n### Question 3:\n**Determining the truth value of the formula \\( p1 =::> ~p2 \\).**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Truth Values:** The formula \\( p1 =::> ~p2 \\) is true in four cases: when \\( p1 \\) is false (✓|x) or \\( p2 \\) is true (x|x,x|✓).\n- **False Values:** The formula is false in only one case: when \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is true (✓|✓).\n\n### Question 4:\n**Symbolizing the propositions:**\n\n1. **Blue and yellow are both common colors.**\n2. **Either \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) or 5 is irrational.**\n3. **Exactly one of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and 5 is irrational.**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[p1&p2];[p3||p4];[(p3||p4)&&~(p3&p4)]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Proposition 1:** Uses `&` to denote \"and\" between \\( p1 \\) and \\( p2 \\).\n- **Proposition 2:** Uses `||` to denote \"or\" between \\( p3 \\) and \\( p4 \\).\n- **Proposition 3:** Uses `&&` and `~` to denote \"exactly one\" by combining `||` and `~` operators.\n\n### Question 5:\n**Determine the level, type, and truth value of the formula under the given assignment:**\n\nFormula: \\((p1||~p2)&(p2=::>p3)\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n[[A];[A];[False]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Level:** This formula is a Level B formula because it contains one logical connective (`&`) and the connected two propositions (`p1||~p2` and `p2=::>p3`) are both formulas of lower-levels (Level A).\n- **Type:** It is a truth formula.\n- **Truth Value:** Under the assignment \\(\\{p1→T, p2→T, p3→F\\}\\), the formula evaluates to false because `\\((T || ~T) & (T =::> F)\\)` results in `\\((T) & (F)\\)`, which is false.",
