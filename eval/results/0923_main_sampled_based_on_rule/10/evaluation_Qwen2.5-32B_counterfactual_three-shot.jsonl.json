The robot can change formations, contribute different effects, and upgrade itself, and the astrologer is able to reform existing structures or plants in order to protect the players.\n\nThe astrologer has four formations (defining different buildings):\n1.Ground Formation: The default formation, with no special functions until an astrologer decides to use it to arrange a strategic formation to defend the players.\n2.

Defense##D.Survey\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nA tricorder is a rectangular cube with a scuffed surface - crackled, rock-like surface -  crushed by a giant hand that makes it look like the crust itself, in which we see a message in a block of Very Narrowband Language, a kind of code. This message is broken and shredded by rust and peeling from the outer boundary, causing a cognitive shudder. Wallclicker (the player traversing this broken message) can drill a hole further into the cube, but the nanonets pulling apart dislodge more and more crust, causing the whole thing to gradually become spattered and fragmented, a blotched puzzle of extreme complexity, but one you can gradually dig into so you can see more and more of. Mi'shukbikapat takes you closer and closer and deeper as you dig deeper. Peaks of complex circuits mirror like bright solar faces as you dig. Sower represents a kind of deeper trip, and a lot of their meaning becomes more visible in the deep consilience. You are scrolling, drilling, etching, grooving, etching, etching. The bits digs a (-) into the cube and cuts the strings, so you can see the inner workings of the - actually Zaibatakis decides all strings are incongruous with our way of understanding universe, so the only symbol is the negative. A tangle of devices lit up. Drilling deeper, the technical increasingly exposing the lower and lower strata, more and more of the mangled wires and circuits disassembled by different laws of physics, twisted and permeating, in a puzzling arrangement of a very small marble, discolored by an intense firework of a powder solvent containing a highly corrosive acid that eats one layer after another until you reach the bottom layer. A crimson glow occurs with a sound of a bow stroking over a violin string. Objects appear to intend motion. A group of four dancing figures begin to dance in the space. A gluon portal wraps around one of them; the others follow. You are a nanoprobe - designed to look like the others - you are isomorphic nanodance with, flying through an unbounded circuit space, surrounded bright with musical imagination. The sense that all of it- every hallway, every crevice, every valve, every piece- will eventually be explored. The Artist has not yet subsumed all possibilities, but the others left behind in the space. These are not designed for humans to explore, but for their own purposes, in their own language, their own way of thinking. Some of it is ignorable, but some might have deep significance or dark terror. Everything has a protocol, a procedure, and only by doing the protocol can the system understand it; and only by doing the procedure can it be understood. The proper way to do things is the way that has always been and always will be done. The order is established by the Artwork; but surpassed by understanding.\nA.

(Answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Cow##B.Osedax##C.Calyotherium##D.Hongkou\n\nIn the story, it mentions that \"Metamorphosis type eating pole beast (calyx beast) is a long petal-like tail eating pole beast, this eating pole beast is relatively advanced, fighting ability is very strong, can fly, can play, can discharge sound, they have a large number of hunters killed their mouth, they have no digestive system.\" Therefore, the Calyotherium option does not fit as it doesn't have a digestive system.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich one can emit the power of the electromagnetic pulse?

(Answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Loess##B.Coagulation factor##C.Meat soil##D.Xi soil\n\nNone of the options provided are directly related to the story's content. However, the sentence structure suggests the need for a noun that could be activated, and \"Xi soil,\" an unfamiliar term with a foreign name, might be more plausible in a speculative fiction context.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich creature's body can fuse with any species?

(Answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Stimulate endocrine MP##B.Increase speed##C.Feeling intense adrenaline##D.Disrupt their own camping rhythm\n\nBased on the story's context and the process described, disrupting the organism's own camping rhythm, as this may trigger the mentioned effect.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nThe central government located in white rock is? (Answer with one option)\nOptions:A.Components of car batteries##B.Rails##C.Man&gt;##D.Titanium plates\n\nThe story doesn't mention any specific central government located in white rock. However, options A, B, and D are related to mechanical and technical aspects, while option C, Man>, seems unrelated. This suggests that titanium plates might be the most logical connection to the story's context, as it relates to materials used in a speculative or futuristic setting.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\nInterestingly, we have a white lotus platform which hasn't thought of revolution, but it's ruled with an iron fist!\nWell, here's the problem. A lot of workers ... \nI work in Shenzhen! In the age of wealth creation without opening up, people who don't have family or costs at home generally have more income and are more likely to get ahead.\nBut in the city gates of the new development areas which allow free flow of …, there also live a lot of human work, but they are just under the pressure of the minimum wage, the money will be here, the relationship with hardships. They don't have the opportunity to achieve, even if they stand hard to achieve, not like the old rich men and men, after the road to the river, is the new road after the road!\nMaybe they are the ones most likely to have a revolution, maybe they are just powerful customers...\nThere was a day in my room, the door was open by itself, and my file was opened, although it was very exciting, there was no passion, and there was no risk. All these people who hurt their lives for a better life that they can't bear, they are under the pressure of economic conditions and social classes, so how can we persuade them to become entrepreneurs?\nFriends who live in the same unit as me, that's right, I walk through the door, and before they even see my mouth, my stomach is full of a song and dance, but I have a thick beard and a lot of things that scare you, my scary is thicker than my breath. They look at you for a while and ask you to give them the signal, so I pick up my computer, go to the bathroom and give it a shower, and then I go to the window and stand there, and I do it so often that I'm not afraid of it. Some people all depend on me, I'll be there for you, but some people are really just like this.\nSo friends and family are reluctant to start a small business. That's just not our strength. In a place full of opportunities and free-flowing water, we can't do anything, and we can't rely on the pressure and troubles of the world, and we can't even involve anyone else's money. So we can't learn from them, we can't even learn how to be god. Although god doesn't know if it's hard to use our sense of beauty to wash people away, we can really appreciate it, and we really want to see it, but we don't know if it's possible. So the argument is that it's hard to delete you, and it's hard to delete me.\nOur private small warehouses in the city and our water pump won't turn over. We don't know, and in the case where the government doesn't really follow us, we often also want to Repair these things before streamlining them, our government may not listen to our parents, and our search for perfection is too slow to do, but you can't slightly influence the attention of a tiny disturbance.\nIf this is what you want to comment on? Please don't email me any repulsive metaphors, I've got enough on my email, and I really don't want this kind of fueling of the mood. These are the kind of people who deserve the letdown we've just sent, and the deep hurt we've inflicted on them. If you can't take my definition of the word action as a comment, then I don't want to respond to you. I'm a hardcore left-wing animal control who supports reparations, so not a scintilla can be felt in my emails. In a world where everybody is a loser, if you can't start a debate without being a middle-aged white man, this is probably the most successful model in history.\nThis old guy is from UEA, right? Powerful money, and then, the closed area. The government of UEA doesn't belong to the American government, it's really a separate.\nThey do business with Kennedy, and they're good friends with Kennedy! And the government of the Nick City 1713th continues to promote \"economic zones\". Whenever I see an economic zone, I think of a working-class poor district that may be ruled with an iron fist.\n\"And the state has controlled the city gates.\"\nPaul, you may take this seriously, UEA is just another ankara land. I haven't said we'll cut off the water supply to the world today, can you do that? Do you see? Today's supportive comments? \nMost of today's comments are supportive. We can't troll if we catch you, don't you know that you should never give someone an opportunity to be contrary? You should be open about if they're a troll.\nThe words \"survival of the fittest\" imply a group of people that includes all human beings. There has never been any law or group that includes all living beings. Saying it is too cruel to understand what kind of \"simple dummies\" it is.\nSomeone was a little bright, a little more intelligent, and a little healthier than others, and consciously put these advantages together and first used them on this planet, not my talents, but just their physical traits. Their personality traits, the environment they were born in, and random chance in the face of circumstances.\nSince you say that there is no group of living beings that includes them, maybe there are some people who don't live in, what would you expect? The deliberate deterioration and development of this group made us dependent, and we can't compete with it, which gave us endless hope.\nWe turned out to be losers! The most unsociable animals took the deepest, the most secure, and the smallest group of women and children in our society, and then we repeated this.

Specifically, this involved placing small probes on larger asteroids to destroy them for smaller asteroids, the United Earth Government decided to use electromagnetic catapults. The United Earth Government launched a space engineering project to defend against the asteroid belt; this project was secretly cancelled in 2075. The long-planned facility for the United Earth Government's anti-asteroid project is quite large; it was redeveloped and opened as a space hotel.\nAfter successfully steering the Earth to the stellar binary system, mankind decided their next destination would be Proxima Centauri. At the time, humanity completed 51 planetary engines remaining in operation, designated as Groups 21-25 (32, 33, 34, 35, and 36 in Group 21; 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 in Group 22; 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46 in Group 23; 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51 in Group 24). At this point, over half of mankind had already moved to underground cities, with the northern part occupying 90% of the planetary surface area. Due to most inhabitants staying in the underground city except for necessary activities, humans did not experience the scorching summer heat. They had become almost accustomed to the complete darkness of space. Except for City No.98, which was short of water and had to grow plants by spraying water and minerals in thin air, all other underground cities in the North Hemisphere now self-provided food and water. Beds in the underground cities were designed based on magnetic sleep technology. Three times a week, residents would wake up for a day.\nIt was rumored that in the cosmic wasteland, comrades will encounter a \"Maple Yeast Pie\" soldier. Maple Yeast Pie was originally the name of a logistics soldier's famous pastry and other small treats during the first push toward the asteroid belt. Yang Bing is confident that the Maple Yeast Pie legend is an unfavorable rumor. Yang Bing, always full of energy, told his soldiers that there was no life in the vast cosmic wastelands, only their panda, Yang Bai, he alone was Yang Bai. This is one of the slogans he once came up with to boost morale. The official name of Yang Bai is panda robot; but Yang Bai doesn't like it and prefers its nickname. Yang Bai is an intelligent robot that can hold pineapples, search for explosive gas, and transport rubble by rotating shafts. Yang Bai can make changes to the computer and affect the pilot's health rate, and use nanotechnology to replicate prototypes. His only functions are to sniff out explosive gases and carry heavy things, while the panda's voice module is being researched and tested.\nLin Ling lost her left arm before moving to California City, so she was recommended to become a construction engineer in the underground city. Xiaoqiao suggested remaking bunk beds by partitioning the space below the beds into stem cell culture containers. This method would provide a large area for stem cell culture without taking up much space, and more important organs could be preserved there. Since the traditional farming method requires a significant portion of the energy from planetary engines, food in the underground city has been adjusted to an almost vegetarian diet. By 2075, due to continued population growth within the underground city, combined with the expansion of factory areas and marketplaces, there was no space for plant cultivation. Food storage began to become very tight. The accumulated vegetation decayed and eroded soil nutrients. Some interior athletes raised a question: with the current distribution of people, food, and facilities, many parts of the underground city are like giant artificial biogas factory sand environmental risk lurks everywhere. The United Earth Government enforced a strict two-child policy, and each couple could have at most two offspring.\nHarassment incidents in the underground city include the theft and malicious damage of personal belongings, and even incidents of torture and killing. However, these incidents are ultimately exposed and investigated by our existing law enforcement agencies. Killing is only carried out by law enforcement, and violent crimes cannot be repressed.\nIn the autumn of 2075, Wangling and his friends established an intercity after-school library. The intercity library project collects knowledge and information scattered across the various abandoned cities and distributes them to the underground cities of cities No.8, No. 84, and No. 86. The intercity inter-school library is run by the city's few free citizens, although this project has some value for public welfare, it has no financial support from the United Earth Government, and funding depends solely on donations from buried city residents. One day, Wangling went hunting alone and got lost. Wang Fen was very anxious, anxiously searching for Wangling. Wang Fen later realized that Wangling wouldn't get hungry because there was still bamboo in the wilderness. Wang Fen thought about how to get Wangling out of the wilderness. During this time, Wang Fen imagined tracking down Wangling with a few guards and her dog, Duke. If she meets a dangerous force, she will recall all the troops guarding the entrance of City No.86. Then, utilize the excess shipping space on the thirteenth floor to transport Wangling, and distribute the rewards among everyone in the expedition. Ultimately, as the next expedition leader to Earth's surface, Wang Fen's dream of exploring the wilderness was accomplished. Wang Fen later opened a book stall near the City No.86 interschool library so that people could come read books in his own free time. She was hopeful that one day, there would be a person who could increase scrutiny on government actions and change the current situation.\nFrom 2020 to 2075, a span of almost 55 years. The core goal of humanity has been unchanging, moving massive amounts of calcium and silicon placed on the surface of the ground with huge pushback forces applied uniformly to the top left of the Earth. After sufficient flying speed is accumulated, Earth departs from the solar system. This program, once started, requires extremely high maintenance costs and has no pause mechanism; the Earth will continuously fly forward at high speed until 2527 or 2528.\n\n### Question:\n### 6.
