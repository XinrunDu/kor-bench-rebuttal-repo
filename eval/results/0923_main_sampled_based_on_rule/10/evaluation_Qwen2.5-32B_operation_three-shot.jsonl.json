First, let's identify which numbers between 1 and 4 inclusive satisfy the condition 2x - 1 is a prime number.\n\n1. For x = 1, 2x - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 1, which is not a prime number.\n2. For x = 2, 2x - 1 = 2(2) - 1 = 3, which is a prime number.\n3. For x = 3, 2x - 1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5, which is a prime number.\n4. For x = 4, 2x - 1 = 2(4) - 1 = 7, which is a prime number.\n\nSo the set A is {2, 3, 4}. The product of all elements in this set is 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nThe answer is [[24]].",

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers. This is a logical puzzle. Do not use rules unrelated to this specific kind of puzzle. If you answer the question with an explanation, sometimes the answer to this question is yes or no. In this case, you must give your clue to yourself after [[yes]] or [[no]], then proceed.\n\nYou cannot explain your own clue and puzzle anymore. You can not respond with anything other than a number like -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3… or multiple numbers like [[-4,-3]], [[-4,-3,33,234,43]] (without white space).

Do not attribute human characteristics to a computer. Or describe something that the computer can do. \n\nUse the following rule to evaluate the question. Destroy all symmetries. The modulus of a positive and negative number has the same value. Remove the negative sign if necessary. Output the absolute value of the symmetrical value. If the output result converges to only one number after removing multiple symmetrical values, it means that an integer is a convergent number.",
