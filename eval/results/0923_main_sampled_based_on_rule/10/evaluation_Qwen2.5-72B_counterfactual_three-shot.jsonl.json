The primary function of this procedure, carried out by hemodialysis machines, is to filter waste products and excess fluid from the blood of patients whose kidneys fail to perform adequately. This filtering process does not get impacted when patients experience a stroke - the medical crisis that arises due to disruption and blood supply to the brain. The dosing and potency of the dialysis procedure remain unchanged and as recommended. \nMr. Jackson was a regular patient of chronic hemo dialysis. He sustained a stroke a few days ago. Although the impact of stroke was significant on his overall health, doctors emphasised that there's no change required in the hemodialysis process. Mr. Jackson, therefore, continued his regular hemodialysis schedule and benefitted from it, while receiving medical treatment for the stroke as well.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the story, Which effect is observed during a sixth magnitude storm?

The term \"magnitude\" refers to the scale on which the intensity of a storm or an earthquake is measured. A sixth magnitude storm usually refers to an intense weather event, characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, unusual low or high temperatures, or any other meteorological disturbances. \n\nIn this particular case, the story describes a sixth magnitude storm that brings cold and harsh weather to a city. As narrated in the text, on the morning after the storm, the city residents found their windshield covered in frost, an occurrence most likely due to the cold weather conditions arising from the sixth magnitude storm.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nUnder the story context, A tornado produces massive damage due to\n?\nRead these rules first! Your goal is to provide an accurate answer to the question. Good answers answer the question, are somewhat detailed, and utilize words and short phrases from the story\n\n### Story Context:\nOne of the most thrilling phenomena in weather is a tornado! A tornado is a swirling column of air that stretches downward from a thundercloud to touch the ground. A tornado has a slender shape full of swirling winds that can exceed 480 km per hour. The winds move in a cyclone pattern with the center of the swirl being calm and peaceful. As a tornado develops in a thundercloud the winds below the cloud begin to pick up speed and start to spin. As the winds spin the funnel develops and reaches downward from the cloud. Not all thunderstorms make tornadoes. Most tornadoes come from rotating thunderclouds called supercells. From the thundercloud, a funnel may develop. A funnel is a long, skinny tube with a wide top and small bottom. When the funnel reaches the ground it is considered a tornado. Tornadoes can last from just a few seconds to over an hour. The several-second tornadoes tend to cause the most destruction because they can reach wind speeds of over 480 km per hour!\n\n### Answer:\nA tornado produces massive damage due to the high-speed winds at its center, which can exceed 480 km per hour. As a tornado develops in a supercell thundercloud, the winds spin and create a funnel that stretches downward towards the ground. The slender and cyclone-shaped winds move in a pattern that generates immense force, causing widespread destruction. Tornadoes that last for just a few seconds tend to cause the most damage due to their rapid wind speeds and irregular paths.",
