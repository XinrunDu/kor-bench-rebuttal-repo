(Idempotence of ||)\n\nUse T and F to denote the truth values, where multiple T or F should be separated by commas (,).\nSpecifically, let [[yes/no]] indicate whether p1&p1 is a truth value, where 'yes' indicates yes and 'no' indicates no.\nThe format for writing truth tables is [[operate variable1;variable2;...;variable,n=1,2,...;values of nested logical operations]], with the list value format explained below:\n[1] Each variable corresponds to an ordered list of its values under different assignments of variables;\nThe variable with the value reads the value according to the nth assignment counting from left to right; the logical operation with n total variable positions corresponds to an ordered list of its values under different assignments of variables;\nThe layout for the list of logical operation values is such that a number in the ith position of the list is the value of the logical operation when the number of variables are assigned the values where the ith assignment of each individual variable is considered;\nFor example, the nth number corresponds to the value under the nth assignment of variables; / indicates a break in a long string of T or F; nesting requires following the layout for list values.\n[2] When listing logical operations, any logical operation with an odd number of nested operations can be followed by its value line as in part [1], and all odd nested operations should be separated by a comma (,); this format is applicable to logical operations.\nThe overall format should be [[yes/no];[truth table for p1&p1];[truth table for p = p||p]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[no];[operate p1;p2;p1&p2;1,2=1=2=1,2=1,2=1=1,2;T,T,F,F;T,T,F,F;T,T,F,F]/[operate p1;p1;p1||p1;1,2=1=1=1,2=1,2=1=1,2;T,F;T,F;T,T]/]\n\n### Question:\nFor the proposition \"If I see clouds in the sky, then it will rain tomorrow\", let\np1: I see clouds in the sky.\np2: It will rain tomorrow.\nFind the main clause of the proposition.\nThe answer format is [[level];[operated variable]].\nThe level is a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (n is an integer greater than 1), while the operated variable is a list of proposition numbers and compositions connected by logical operators.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[p1=::>p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDefinition of a formula: A single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula. Formulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn. A level A formula is the most fundamental proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures. A level B formula is a formula containing one logical connective, and the two connected propositions are both level A formulas. Other levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n is a natural number greater than or equal to 0).\n\n### Question:\nFor the answer, only give its level, without an text explanation. z1=1,x2=1,z3=1and Z1&Z2 and X1=X2 and ~(Y1=Y2),True assignment of formula: For assignment of propositions, if the formula is true, then we call this assignment a true assignment of the formula. If the formula is (~(Y1=Y2)&X1)||Z2=Z3, then x|x,x|x is a true assignment of the formula. False assignment of formula: For assignment of propositions, if the formula is false, then we call this assignment a false assignment of the formula. If the formula is (~(Y1=Y2)&X1)||Z2=Z3, then |x|x is a false assignment of the formula. Level A formula: Formula without logical connectives or nests. Example: p1=0. Level B formula: Formula containing one logical connective. Example: p1&p2. Level C formula: Formula contains nested logical connectives and at least one level B formula. Example: ~(p1&p2), formula with multiple levels of logical nesting. We classify an nth level connected formula as a level-(Z+n) formula (n is a natural number greater than 1), here is an example to compare: For the formula ~(X1=X2), it is a level C formula, and the formula z1'x = z' z2 is a level-(Z+1) formula. The former belongs to the en chain level, but there is no nesting. The value symbol Z represents the end of the chain level, implying a new level Z+1 initiates immediately after this point to accommodate higher nested and subscripted connections not covered by level Z. This distinction between chain levels and nested levels marks the beginning of the fine-tuning level conceptualization. True assignment of a formula: If the formula is a truth formula, then any assignment is a true assignment of the formula. For example the formula is ~(~(~(R1=R2||~S3=1))||~(~(~(Q1=Q1=Q3)||~P1=1||~M1=1))), then |x|x,|x|x,|x|✓|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x,|x|x|x are true assignments of the formula. False assignment of a formula: For some formulas, there is only one false assignment.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]| [x|x]; [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[x]| [x]| [[",

In modal logic, propositions can have different degrees of truth depending on the context in which they are evaluated. Modal logic is often used in formal arguments and reasoning, as it allows us to represent logical relationships that cannot be easily expressed in traditional propositional logic. In addition to its use in logic and mathematics, modal logic is also used in computer science and artificial intelligence, where it is used to represent the relationships between different states and actions in a system.",

As a regular employee of the hotel, Bob works diligently and is eager to learn, quickly making a name for himself at work. One evening, Bob was on duty, when a grandmother brought a baby into the hotel restaurant. They chose a table near the kitchen, where Bob was working. The baby was crying loudly. Bob immediately realized that the guest was in distress and asked the grandmother how he could help. The grandmother sighed and said, \"We came here for a family dinner. Now the child's mother is breastfeeding, so I volunteered to take my shivering grandson to the restaurant for some warm milk.\"\nBob quickly fetched a bottle of milk that he had found in the restaurant's storage room. However, he couldn't find a microwave to heat it up, so he ran to his colleagues to borrow one. After borrowing the microwave from a colleague, Bob carefully heated the milk until it was warm enough for the baby to drink. The grandmother was moved by this act of kindness and reported Bob's good deed to the front desk as she left the restaurant.\nA month later, Bob received a sum of money worth approximately 100 yuan, along with a note from the marketing department manager.\nOne winter night, the white-and-black blooming pear trees outside all died, and the restaurant's front lawn was taken over by a young woman with white-blonde hair. Just when people thought the situation was hopeless, a roadside miracle happened. One day, the зай еще стоит новыми поршнями!\n\nTranslate the Restaurant Manager's note and Bob's reply from the Chinese Hotel Management School text into English.

Nine dining hall food is relatively cheap, but there are too many people, which is not conducive to concentrating on watching lecture videos, and sometimes there are no seats. It is best to go downstairs for Western food, with salad, chicken burgers, hamburgers, spring pan-fried noodles, all of which are suitable for filling up to concentrate and watch course videos upstairs after being fully stuffed.\n\nLong Street, Jinglong Supermarket downstreet, outside Fudian Library school door, most of the restaurants in these places are relatively cheap, especially Long Street 58 yuan all-you-can-eat Mr. Sushi and free udon noodles, but sometimes they are still deceived. For example, in buy-one-get-one-free promotions, they don't tell you that buying items of the same price is not considered the same, and actual payment does not reduce 50%, but only 20% of the price. But it is true that the taste is relatively good, and the environment can also be considered good because it has I-RIMSH. Public enemy No. 1 is Peking University Beer Association official, and Peking University Association president were his subjects. Sometimes they even reveal their special relationships with leaders of Peking University Ventures Company, spreading rumors like garbage. It was recorded by Beijing Youth Daily on December 17, 2004, sometimes when he comes in, the merchants are secretly frightened, so the food they give is more than what they give to others, all for the sake of pleasing the ugly and looking like white beans. I am also eating Peking University's food coupons, but I am not doing any of this disgusting thing, so I have no psychological pressure for it. Out of curiosity, I once went to Northeastern University to have lunch, and the food was really cheap. Most of the kung pao chicken with rice is only 1.5 yuan. The \"free udon noodles\" is subject to all-you-can-eat rules, and it is impossible for merchants to spend resources to make them taste good or not bad. Second, your main purpose is to fill your stomach for a while, and there is no need to demand that free udon noodles be of a top brand or choose specific brands or have a dazzling taste, because in Star OMINE it is the night before the exam, when you really need the food to be powerful enough to move you, you are hugging the sheets, and your mouth is full of taste that is even better than you can!\n\nMaybe Ma Huyuan is called Huyuan after reading the novel \"HaoHao Taoist.\" In short, it is already late and time to sleep, and the food is good or bad after all in the stomach after about 16 hours.
