Therefore, 9※9 = 3.\n2. 3※9: Now, 3 is a multiple of 9, so 3※9 = 3/9 + 2. That means 3※9 = 2.333.\n3. 9※3: In this case, 9 is a multiple of 3, so 9※3 = 9/3 + 2. Therefore, 9※3 = 5.",

Below are descriptions of some existing c++ data structures and their corresponding code.\n\n### Problem Description\n\nYour task is to write a C++ program that calculates the total number of moves required to prepare a given number of sushi pieces using a conveyor belt system. The conveyor belt moves in a circular manner and consists of a series of plates. The sushi pieces are placed on the plates, and the plates are moved to their respective destinations using a conveyor belt. The plates are numbered from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of plates on the conveyor belt. Each move of the conveyor belt is considered as one \"move\". You need to calculate the total number of moves required to prepare the given number of sushi pieces.\n\nThe input data is provided in the form of `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of plates on the conveyor belt, and `m` is the number of pieces of sushi to be prepared. The `n` and `m` values are provided on separate lines.\n\n### Example\nInput\n```\n10\n5\n```\nOutput\n```\n3\n```\nExplanation\nIn this example, there are 10 plates on the conveyor belt, and 5 sushi pieces need to be prepared. The total number of moves required to prepare the sushi is 3.\n\n### Constraints\n- 1 <= n <= 100\n- 1 <= m <= n\n\n### Customer's Requirements\nThe customer requests that the program should be written in C++ and should use a vector data structure to store the plates and sushi pieces.\n\n### Problem Analysis\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of moves required to prepare the given number of sushi pieces. We can use a vector data structure to store the plates and sushi pieces, and iterate through the vector to find the total number of moves required. We can also use modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement of the conveyor belt.\n\n### Solution\nHere is the C++ code to solve the problem:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nint main() {\n    int n, m;\n    std::cin >> n >> m;\n    std::vector<int> plates(n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        plates[i] = (i + m) % n;\n    }\n    std::sort(plates.begin(), plates.end());\n    int moves = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        if (i > 0 && plates[i] == plates[i - 1]) {\n            ++moves;\n        }\n    }\n    std::cout << moves << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nExplanation\n- We start by reading the input values `n` and `m` from the user.\n- We create a vector of integers called `plates` with size `n` and fill it with the values of `i` plus `m` modulo `n`.\n- We sort the `plates` vector in ascending order using the `std::sort` function.\n- We initialize a variable `moves` to store the total number of moves required.\n- We iterate through the `plates` vector and check if the current plate is equal to the previous plate. If it is, we increment the `moves` variable.\n- Finally, we print the total number of moves required to prepare the sushi.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) due to the vector data structure used to store the plates and sushi pieces.",
