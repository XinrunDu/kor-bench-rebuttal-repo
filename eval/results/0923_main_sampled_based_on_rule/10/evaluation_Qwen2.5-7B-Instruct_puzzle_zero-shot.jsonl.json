Therefore, \\( b - l = 9 \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( i = 1 \\)\n- \\( b - l = 9 \\) where \\( 1 \\leq b \\leq 9 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq l \\leq 9 \\).\n\nTo satisfy \\( b - l = 9 \\) with possible single-digit values for \\( b \\) and \\( l \\):\n- \\( b = 9 \\) and \\( l = 0 \\).\n\nSubstitute back to the original numbers:\n\\[ I = 1, B = 9, L = 0 \\]\n\nFinally, the solution is:\n\\[ [[I=1,B=9,L=0]] \\]",
