If 'A' has {eq}1502_4\n\n{/eq} balls and there are {eq}87_ {10} \n\n{/eq} balls and 'A' and 'C’ together. How many balls does 'B' and 'D' have combined?\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of balls 'A' has converted from base 4 to base 10.\n\n{eq}1502_4 = 1 \\cdot 4^3 + 5 \\cdot 4^2 + 0 \\cdot 4^1 + 2 \\cdot 4^0 = 64 + 80 + 0 + 2 = 146\n\n{/eq}\n\nSo, 'A' has 146 balls in base 10 now.\n\nThe ratio of 'A' to 'C' is 3:4.\n\nLet x be the number of balls 'B' and 'D' have combined.\n\n{eq}146 * 4 = 87 * 3 + x\n\n{/eq}\n\nSolving for x gives us the number of balls 'A' and 'C' have combined.\n\nSince 'A' and 'C' have {eq}87_ {10} \n\n{/eq} balls, x equals the combined number of balls in 'B' and 'D'.\n\nCan you now solve for x and find the combined number of balls 'B' and 'D' have?\n\nYes, I can help you with that!\n\nAssuming that 'A' and 'C' together have '101' balls, then:\n\n146 * 4 = 87 * 3 + x\n\n584 = 261 + x\n\nx = 323\n\nTherefore, 'B' and 'D' have a combined total of 323 balls.",
