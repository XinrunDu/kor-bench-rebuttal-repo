What theorems would you use? To prove that the function \n\\[\nf(z) = \\left(z-\\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\left(-z+\\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\left(\\left\\vert ez-\\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2}\n\\]\nis finite for \\( z \\) on the unit circle, we will analyze each part of the function separately and then combine the results.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the polynomial part\nThe polynomial part of the function is:\n\\[\n\\left(z - \\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\left(-z + \\frac{i}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nThis can be simplified as follows:\n\\[\n\\left(z - \\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\left(-z + \\frac{i}{2}\\right) = -z^2 + \\frac{i}{2}z + \\frac{i}{2}z - \\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)^2 = -z^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{i}{2}\\right)z + \\frac{1}{4} = -z^2 + iz + \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nThis is a polynomial of degree 2 and is therefore finite for all \\( z \\) on the unit circle.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the rational part\nThe rational part of the function is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\left(\\left\\vert ez-\\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2}\n\\]\nWe need to show that the denominator \\(\\left(\\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2\\) is not zero for any \\( z \\) on the unit circle.\n\n### Step 3: Ensure the denominator is non-zero\nFor \\( z \\) on the unit circle, \\( |z| = 1 \\). We need to check if \\( \\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert = 0 \\) for any \\( z \\) on the unit circle. This would imply:\n\\[\nez - \\frac{i}{2} = 0 \\implies ez = \\frac{i}{2} \\implies z = \\frac{i}{2e}\n\\]\nWe need to check if \\( \\frac{i}{2e} \\) lies on the unit circle. Calculate its magnitude:\n\\[\n\\left\\vert \\frac{i}{2e} \\right\\vert = \\frac{\\left\\vert i \\right\\vert}{\\left\\vert 2e \\right\\vert} = \\frac{1}{2e}\n\\]\nSince \\( \\frac{1}{2e} \\neq 1 \\), \\( z = \\frac{i}{2e} \\) does not lie on the unit circle. Therefore, for all \\( z \\) on the unit circle, \\( \\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert \\neq 0 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the finiteness\nSince \\( \\left(\\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2 \\) is always positive and non-zero for \\( z \\) on the unit circle, the rational part \\(\\frac{1}{\\left(\\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2}\\) is finite for all \\( z \\) on the unit circle.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining the results from steps 1 and 3, we conclude that the entire function:\n\\[\nf(z) = \\left(z - \\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\left(-z + \\frac{i}{2}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\left(\\left\\vert ez - \\frac{i}{2}\\right\\vert\\right)^2}\n\\]\nis finite for all \\( z \\) on the unit circle.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(z) \\text{ is finite for all } z \\text{ on the unit circle.}}\n\\]\n\n### Theorems Used\n- Polynomial properties (degree of a polynomial)\n- Magnitude of complex numbers\n- Contradiction to ensure non-zero denominator\n\nJen Marsh, the practice administrator at Midwest Chiropractic, is considering raising the hourly rate for office visits from $55 to $60. The average cost per visit is $38, and the current revenue and profits are $100,000 per month. Assuming Jen increases the rate and maintains the current 800 visit volume per month, what will be the impact on:\na. Revenue?\nb. Profit if the number of visits decreases by 15%?\nc. Impact if Jen removes the highest 30% of the load (with the same price increase) and can hire new employees to maintain the same current volume? To determine the impact of raising the hourly rate for office visits from $55 to $60, we need to calculate the changes in revenue and profit step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the current revenue\nThe current revenue is given as $100,000 per month for 800 visits, with an average fee of $55 per visit.\n\\[ \\text{Current revenue} = 800 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$55/\\text{visit} = \\$44,000 \\]\nHowever, we are given the total revenue as $100,000, which suggests there might be additional variables like fixed costs or other income streams. We will use the given total revenue for our calculations.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the new revenue with an increased rate\nIf the hourly rate is raised to $60 and the number of visits remains at 800, the new revenue will be:\n\\[ \\text{New revenue} = 800 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$60/\\text{visit} = \\$48,000 \\]\nHowever, we are given that the revenue will not change due to the price increase, so we will use the given total revenue of $100,000.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the new profit if the number of visits decreases by 15%\nIf the number of visits decreases by 15%, the new number of visits will be:\n\\[ \\text{New visits} = 800 \\text{ visits} \\times (1 - 0.15) = 800 \\times 0.85 = 680 \\text{ visits} \\]\nThe new revenue will be:\n\\[ \\text{New revenue} = 680 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$60/\\text{visit} = \\$40,800 \\]\nThe new profit will be:\n\\[ \\text{New profit} = \\text{New revenue} - \\text{Total costs} = \\$40,800 - \\$100,000 = -\\$59,200 \\]\nSo, the profit will decrease by:\n\\[ \\text{Decrease in profit} = -\\$59,200 - (-\\$100,000) = \\$40,800 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the impact if Jen removes the highest 30% of the load and hires new employees\nIf Jen removes the highest 30% of the load, the number of visits will be:\n\\[ \\text{New visits} = 800 \\text{ visits} \\times (1 - 0.30) = 800 \\times 0.70 = 560 \\text{ visits} \\]\nThe new revenue will be:\n\\[ \\text{New revenue} = 560 \\text{ visits} \\times \\$60/\\text{visit} = \\$33,600 \\]\nIf Jen hires new employees to maintain the same current volume, the average cost per visit remains $38.\nThe new profit will be:\n\\[ \\text{New profit} = \\text{New revenue} - \\text{Total costs} = \\$48,000 - \\$31,200 = \\$16,800 \\]\nSo, the profit will increase by:\n\\[ \\text{Increase in profit}",
