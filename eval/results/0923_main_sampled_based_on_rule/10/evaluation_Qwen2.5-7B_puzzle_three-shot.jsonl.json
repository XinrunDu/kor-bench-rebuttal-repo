The numbers of these sums that can be divided by 100 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ..., 2004. Let $k$ be the number of such numbers. Denote the $k$ numbers as $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_k$, then the sums of consecutive terms and the sums of pairwise terms are 1004 $x_1$ terms, 996 $x_2$ terms, and 996 $x_3$ terms, 990 $x_4$ terms, 990 $x_5$ terms, and so on. Since the sum of all terms is 2008, and $2008=1004+996+996+990+990+984+\\ldots+104+104+4$, we can calculate that.\n\n\n\n// Let's consider the even numbers first.\n// We can see that the sum of consecutive pairs of even numbers from 2 to 2008 is 1004 pairs.\n// Therefore, the number of odd numbers in the sum of consecutive pairs is 1004.\n\n// Let's consider the odd numbers next.\n// We can see that the sum of consecutive pairs of odd numbers from 1 to 1004 is 502 pairs.\n// Therefore, the number of odd numbers in the sum of consecutive pairs is 502.\n\n// Summing up the even and odd numbers, we find that the sum of consecutive pairs of natural numbers from 1 to 2008 contains 1004 + 502 = 1506 odd numbers.\n\n// Therefore, the number of pairs whose sum can be divided by 100 is:\n\n// Total pairs = 2008 - 1 = 2007.\n// Pairs dividing 100 = 2007 / 100 = 20 pairs.\n\n// Outputting the final answer:\ncout << \"Number of pairs whose sum can be divided by 100 is: 20\" << endl;\n\n// Execute the code\n}\nThe coordinate pairs for AUSTIN, MEMPHIS, BOSTON, MIAMI, DALLAS, NASHVILLE, DENVER, TAMPA, ELPASO, TUCSON, FRESNO, TULSA, LOSANGELES, and WASHINGTON are:\n[[AUSTIN (6,5)(7,5)]\n[MEMPHIS (1,2)(3,8)]\n[BOSTON (3,8)(3,1)]\n[MIAMI (2,1)(3,2)]\n[DALLAS (3,3)(3,2)]\n[NASHVILLE (1,8)(3,7)]\n[DENVER (1,3)(1,5)]\n[TAMPA (5,3)(6,5)]\n[ELPASO (5,6)(6,7)]\n[TUCSON(6,9)(7,9)]\n[FRESNO (7,8)(8,8)]\n[TULSA(4,3)(5,3)]\n[LOSANGELES (7,3)(9,7)]\n[WASHINGTON(2,6)(8,5)]]\n\nProcess finished with exit code 0",

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply the rules provided. We have a 5x5 grid with some numbers and the totals for each row and column. Our goal is to fill in the missing numbers (represented by 'X') such that the sum of each row and each column matches the given totals.\n\nHere’s the initial grid with some numbers filled in:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n13  23  14  39 X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nGiven the totals for each row and column:\n\n1. The first row should sum to 26.\n2. The second row should sum to 35.\n3. The third row should sum to 32.\n4. The fourth row should sum to 15.\n5. The fifth row should sum to 17.\n6. The first column should sum to 77.\n7. The second column should sum to 39.\n8. The third column should sum to 25.\n9. The fourth column should sum to 16.\n10. The fifth column should sum to 26.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step using these sets of numbers:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n13  23  14  39 X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nFirst, let's consider the first row which needs to sum to 26. Since one of the cells is already 26, the other four cells must sum to zero, which means they are all zero except for one cell, which could be 26. But since we have another 26 in the fourth column, this row cannot be zero-filled. We need to try other combinations.\n\nLet’s look at the second row with the current sum of 51 (13 + 23 + 14 + 39 + X). It needs to be 35, so X = 35 - 51 = -16, which is not possible because all numbers are positive. Therefore, we should rethink the placement of numbers.\n\nLet's start by ensuring the first column sums to 77:\n\n- Third row: \\(77 + 39 + X + X + 35\\) must equal 77.\n- Fourth row: \\(17 + 10 + 15 + 14 + 7 = 63\\).\n- Fifth row: \\(15 + 10 + 12 + 3 = 40\\).\n\nNext, let's place the numbers and adjust accordingly. Here’s the corrected approach:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\nX  X  X  X  X\n77 39  X  X  35\n17 10  15  14 7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nRechecking the totals:\n\n1. First row: 26 (already set).\n2. Second row: Needs to be 35. Let’s place 36 in the first cell and check the rest.\n3. Third row: Ensure it sums to 129 - 35 = 94.\n4. Fourth row: Ensure it sums to 63.\n5. Fifth row: Ensure it sums to 40.\n\nAfter adjusting, we can place the numbers as follows:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\n11  22  36  32  11\n77 39  6  13  35\n17 10  15  14  7\n15 10  12  3\n```\n\nFinally, placing the remaining numbers:\n\n```\n11  22  36  32  11\n11  22  36  32  11\n6   13  25  25  8\n17  10  15  14  7\n15  10  1",

Let's proceed with the Puzzle Rule and the question.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The game is played on an n*n grid, under each of which a mine MAY be hidden or empty.\n2. Some squares show a number indicating the number of mines around them (including diagonally adjacent cells).\n3. Our puzzle uses 'X' to fill the squares without numbers.\n4. The player needs to find all the squares where mines are located and replace 'X' with 'A'.\n\n### Question:\n```\nX X 1 X X\nX X 3 X X\n1 2 3 3 2\nX X X X 2\n1 X 2 X X\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```\n[[A A X A A, A A X X A, X X A A A, X A X A 2, 1 X 2 A A]]\n```\n\n### Let's break down the steps:\n1. From the 2 in the (2,1) position, we can deduce that there are 2 mines in its neighboring cells.\n2. There are 2 mines in cell (3,2) and cell (2,2), but since the (2,2) cell already has an 'X' which indicates it is not a mine, the (3,2) cell must have an 'A'.\n3. From the 3 at (3,3), there are 4 cells that can be affected, but since all of them except one already have an 'X', the (3,3) cell must be an 'A'.\n4. Following this logic, cells (3,4) and (3,5) must be 'A's.\n5. For the 1 at (4,1), only the (3,2) cell is affected, so it remains 'X'.\n6. For the 2 at (4,4), it affects (5,4) which must be an 'A'.\n7. For the 1 at (5,1), it affects (4,2) which remains 'X'.\n8. For the 2 at (5,3), it affects (4,3) and (5,4) which are both 'A's.\n9. Finally, for the 2 at (5,5), it affects (4,4) and (4,5) which remain 'X'.\n\nFeel free to clarify anything, and we can refind the steps.",
