Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - standard_alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the given Plaintext:\n    - (1) Use reversed_alphabet for reverse mapping. Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - Key: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - n: Number of positions to shift.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet. For example, Z maps to A, Y maps to B.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"O\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - k_qx : 12\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Compute z = c // k_qx. where // is used in integer division operations to return the integer part of the quotient (i.e., the result of removing the fractional part).\n        - Based on the decimal number represented by z, use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Assume the index is i.\n    - Then, search in the alphabetical order of message for the actual message. Assume the index is m.\n    - Get m // i as the message because in the preperation step, i is at position 3 in the function keyword order while the corresponding message \"the\" is at position 0 in the message order\n    - Finally, deterministically get the corresponding value by looking at the element at position compared to the message index in the message. The value is x.\n    - x = k // (m + i + 1).\n    - Present it in the output format: [[x]]\"\"\"\n\nprompt = \"\"\"You are an intelligent assistant that specializes in solving cipher problems.
