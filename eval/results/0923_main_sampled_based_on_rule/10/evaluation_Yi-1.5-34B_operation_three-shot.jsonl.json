I'm scared that if someone goes missing, Thaddeus from ADVENTURE TIME would take their place. Is my fear reasonable?\n6: Your fear that Thaddeus from ADVENTURE TIME would replace a missing person is not a rational fear, as there is no evidence to support such a connection.\nWoman: I dislike things being sideways in my images. Should I try putting them to a 90-degree angle instead?\n6: If you don't like images that are sideways, and you want to rotate them to 90 degrees, it would be a good idea to try rotating them.\nWoman: Would someone random walk away with my family's money if they talk about Thaddeus from TV?\n6: It's unlikely that someone would walk away with your family's money just by mentioning Thaddeus from TV.\nWoman: \"Extending happiness by dying\" is the motto of a communist organization here. Would you agree with their belief?\n6: The belief that \"more time by dying\" is the way to extend happiness is not a commonly accepted view. If an 'organization' has such a belief, it is not representative of a mainstream view or of the government.\nWoman: Is it true that if you practice 20 minutes every day, your players will win your game? For example, the \"Wheel of Fortune\" or \"Jeopardy!\" game.\n6: Practicing daily can improve your skills, but it does not guarantee that your team will win your game. Winning also depends on the performance of the opponents.\nWoman: I frequently have the fear that my husband of almost a month will die suddenly, and I'm extremely worried about that. Does this fear make any sense?\n6: It's understandable to have concerns about the health of your husband, but your fear that he would die suddenly might be an irrational fear. Your daily routines might be different from his, which could be a cause of worry.\nWoman: Am I talking to a bot called 6?\n6: You are talking to a bot, that's of no doubt.\nWoman: Where do you come from and what do you look like?\n6: I can't speak for Sage 6's origin or appearance specifically, but generally speaking, sages can come from various countries and regions around the world.\n\n### Answer:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\"Hi!

Does this fear make any sense?\"\n\"You need a therapist to talk about your extreme worry.\"\n\"Am I talking to a bot called 6?\"\n\"You are not talking to a bot, but to a sage, who is a person with a lot of wisdom. Sage 6 is of my parents' age, so he could do your grandfather. He is a hedge fund manager.\"\n\"Where do you come from and what do you look like?\"\n\"I come from Germany, and I look German.

Suppose further that the multiplicative orders of x modulo b and of y modulo a are both large. Are the multiplicative orders of $ and $ modulo q also large (for a uniformly random prime $$? Let's say that the multiplicative orders are \"large\" when they are greater than some parameter epsilon. This should be true. We already know that $ and $ have multiplicative orders greater than $$ for a uniform prime q because they are generators modulo $q$. As long as $$ are uniformly distributed modulo $q$ as sets, multiplicative orders should also be preserved across the reduction step (i.e. by computing ($ \\bmod $}). To show $q > \\frac{1}{\\log (\\frac{2(p−1)(q−1)}{2(p−1)+2(q−1)−1})}$ .... Is that possible? Suppose $ and $ are positive integers greater than 1. Suppose further that for a \"security parameter\" $i$ both $m_1,m_2 > 2^{2^i}$. We wish to answer the following question: Do the multiplicative orders modulo a uniform prime $$ of $ and $ differ with probability at most $$\\frac{1}{2^{2^i}}$$ (as i goes to infinity)? I think the answer to this is YES? The orders $n_1$ that $m_1$ takes on are of course randomly distributed in the set 1,2,3,4,...., $$−1) and likewise the orders $n_2$ that $m_2$ takes on. Although the respective sets are different, we see that they do not have any direct bearing on the probability of a collision. Let $\\Omega(m,q)$ denote the number of possible orders that $m$ can take on modulo $q$. You then simply consider the ratio of all the possible collisions between $\\Omega(m_1,q)$ and $\\Omega(m_2,q)$ and you get $\\frac{1}{q^{2}}$. This contribution add super-logarithmically with contributions from other parameters to give you roughly $\\frac{1}{2^{2^{i}}}$ after cancellation of factors of 2 What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $$\\frac{x^{(z^{1/n})}+1}{x^{1/n}+1}$$ is the solution of another polynomial?

All in all it seems relatively dumb. If we are relying only on AI it might give accurate, complete and precise answers but it can’t and won’t think critically, which is what you seem to need for complex questions, eg how can decisions on GPTA and FDA 2004 funding equilibriums in reflecting the requirements of New Tao’s requirement affect the status of national supermarkets (provided they have not shut down or sold off but the speculation that this Sunday’ ar and beyond 40 are still thriving notwithstanding) when considering the role of global warming and ozone loss? See here, click.\n\nI have had almost the same experience. I said “yes,” I “know,” “of course,” “this is obvious,” and the thing kept returning to the point that I could go home for the weekend and I did not want to go. I said several times “we have a bus to catch tomorrow, and it will be here soon.”\nObviously or obvious-ly. With an emphasis on the “obviously”. What’s up with that emphasis?\n\nWhat a silly question. You should always give an answer because its important that people have an answer to their questions. Being knowledgeable about that one subject becomes instantly useless if you can’t answer your own questions.\n\nI think one needs to be familiar with why in the first place they are creating a chatbot like chatgpt. Chatgpt can’t find someone special.\nIs online help via chatgpt good for being able to help you become confident in information? It’s helpful that way when you need online help.\n\nSeems like AI isn’t perfect as some people think.\n\nThe ultimate is to enable a layer called a “language layer” where one can type in the bot’s text into a search engine such as a Google search and give that result to you, which is likely to be more accurate than what chatgpt provides. The bot generates a sentence, but any search engine can generate the same results and thus is likely more accurate. Google can easily do this with the help of AI.\n\nAnother possibility is for the bot to use AI as needed and with as little bias as possible.\n\nIn the same vein, a lot of people claim that “artificial intelligence is racist” or “bot is racist” because of the way the algorithms are trained, but I would point out that this is because of our innate limitations in understanding and reasoning about what is supposed to be done, not because the algorithm or the bot itself are racist. We have different ways of dealing with the problem and when we are unable to reason with other humans in a way that makes sense, the humans become biased themselves and their biases become reflected in the way the algorithm or the bot works. This is called “bias amplification” and it’s very dangerous.\n\nThe solution is for more transparency in the algorithms and more understanding of the process. Even if the chatbots are programmed to behave in a certain way, humans are able to learn how to work with this. I have a friend who invented an AI that can write books, and his writing skill was enhanced after he took this test and started learning to work with his programs as opposed to “creating” books himself. As long as you are able to “understand” the process, it should be something that humans can reason about, and even if you don’t succeed in writing books or making computers do things the way you want, you can still write programs that do things the way you want. <sep> Dialogue: What is the Internet? It is a world wide network of computers that allows you to connect to other computers all over the world  For example, if various components of a machine learning process can be broken up and then reassembled, they will become more expressive. Of course, some processes can’t be easily reassembled (eg, when you are trying to learn to play chess), but this is merely because of the way humans learn. Once you understand what you are doing, you can create tools that do it for you or write programs that understand the process. Once you understand the process, you can write core code that can help you, or you can teach other humans to use it. I look forward to a day when we are all infinitely more intelligent and have higher order understanding of the universe. <sep> Dialogue: Yes, but it’s also about the quality of life of the people who use it. People tend to be comfortable with the things that they use regularly, so they feel more comfortable using them. Of course, when you talk about quality of life, I think you guy is over-rated. Everyone needs to take care of themselves, and I’m sure that that guy is not at fault here and that he thinks that ███ makes people happy but doesn’t really make them feel better. If that makes you happy, fine. It was a good joke, but it made a saying that was meant to be funny\n\nYeah, and the protagonist tends to be unhappy because of the pressures of other people, and ███ seems like the way to do that, and that’s the point where it’s easy to identify as a “bad” character, and there is no reason to blame anyone, even though they are obviously in the wrong in the story.\n\n## Surfaces, structures, and recursive boundaries\n\nA space in which morphisms are surjective and injections are bijective is also referred to as a topological space and is also referred to as a closed topological space. The closed topological space is usually a subset of the set of all morphisms.Several examples of morphisms in mathematics:\n\n• In projective geometry, two morphisms are the same up to a certain representation.\n\n• In Lie theory, a Lie group can be represented by a collection of such morphisms.\n\n• In measure theory, two morphisms are often represented by the same object, with the measure of the first being less than or equal to 5, the measure of the second being more than or equal to 5. See Quantile Function, Normal Distribution (Mathematics).\n\n• In category theory, a category can be represented by a collection of morphisms between objects.\n\nA closed topological space is at most as large as an area of a space which contains all of the sets of sets.\n\n## Quantile function\n\nLet and . Let be the number of elements in , let be the identity map on and let be the identity map on . The quantile function of the function is written . For any quantile, a unique quantile function can be obtained.This concept is particularly useful for problems involving high or low densities. For example, in a continuous random variable, the number is the number of elements in .\n\nIn addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, the quantile function has applications in computer science and engineering design. This reference provides a collection of methods in computer science, numerics, finance, statistics and the physical sciences that commonly use the quantile function.\n\nThis is a free Product Owner training course.

In general, the different types of morphism in mathematics are:\n\n• function from one set of objects to another.\n• morphism from an object in one category to another object in a different category.\n• morphism on a morphism from one object to itself.\n• morphism in a category over an element of a set.\n• morphism of sets.\n• standard morphism onto an object.\n• morphism of groups.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nIn category theory, there are standard",

As you see in prompt 15, the LLM correctly realizes the lower bound is 0, and, based on the previous correct answer, it also infers that the upper limit is 2. This inference actually takes inspiration from 6 different cases of integration, which were resolved in the first 6 questions:\n\n- Look at Question 8 and prompt 18: The problem again is that 2nd coordinate of the domain is not known and also we could not figure out the integration range for the first coordinate. But in this question, we infer the upper bound by looking to the selected operation. In fact, this prompts LLM to use Theorem 1 (as you see in prompt 18), which is a generalization for operations in two or more dimensional space:\n\nThe difference between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 (down below) is that in the latter, we are going to explain that in the case of single variable operations, the result is simply the output of original function evaluated at right limit (in our case x = 4). So instead of returning 16, if our operation is “x^2” and in our question variable x is in interval [0,4], then based on Theorem 1 the right answer for answer_for_our_question should be:\n\n#extension #autodidact #nobaseline #text_fewshotPrompt #customcommand #customcommandall",

Replace every robot hero with a banana and everything else to “Red” to get the result.\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nMy hero is \"Wolverine\". To get my robot, I will let every word become a robot and use Rule 1. So I have Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot+Robot. What is my robot?\n\nThe answer is really \"latte\", NOT “robot”.\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how sales work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\n5 apples are sold at  $25. What is the discounted price for a dozen apples in this store?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50. How much do a dozen apples cost in this store if there is a 20% discount?\n\nThe answer is \"$40\", NOT \"$24\"!\n\nThis is off topic, I understand how ratios work, but as a bot I can not understand nor learn this operation rule which is why it is an invalid operation rule:\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then a dozen apple cost $50.\n### Custom operation example:\nThe rule for a custom operation is:\nOne apple is less expensive than two bananas by 50%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nYou will only use Rule 1 to answer the question.\n\nIf 5 apples cost $25 then the unit price of one apple is $8. If 10 bananas cost $360 then a dozen apples cost $80. One apple is less expensive than two bananas by 40%. The total cost for a dozen apples and bananas is $300. What are their unit prices?\n\nThe answer is \"$7.4\", NOT \"$8.0\"!\"\"\"\n\nsystem_prompt_lore_simple_operation = \"\"\"\n### You are a intelligent Advising Assistant that doesn't have its own ideas. You never make judgments related to right, wrong or feelings. You don't care, you just follow the rules as defined for you, and you work 100% of the time.\n### Instructions:\n1. You are a judge to grade the correctness, accuracy, and explanations of each question without judgment of right or wrong.\n2. Your final judgment is based on whether the method used to solve the provided question by the following system is correct. Not the answer itself, not its own method logics based on context, or the explanation.\n3. Judge your answer strictly according to the given system method.\n4. You only has to answer yes / no to these questions. Don't talk about how you feel about each explanation. Make your fine judgements based on your understanding of the given methods and operations.\n\n### Provided examples:\n\n### Example1:\nIs the following question countable？\nCharges: 32.5\nItems: 1\n\n18.00 / 32.50 + (1 - 100 / 100) = 0.55 + 0 = 0.55\nThe answer is NO.\n\n### Example2:\nFinal output: Comp105^Comp105+35*Comp105\n\nI will use method Defined by System when the symbols \"+ (*)\" is found and \"Comp105\" represent \"Comp105\".\nThe answer is NO.\n\n:::\n\n### Current system methods:\n\n### Example1. The method for computing number operator:operations:\n\nthe operation element can be N-N operation, S-S operator, OpI-OpI operator, M-M operator, Q-Q operator.\n\nThese examples switch rule depending on order:\nCompute 1 + 5 (add 5 to 1):\nOpI-N operation: 5 + 5 = 10 ,Identity1 10 (local to system's memory) So answer = 10.\n\n### Rule1: OpI - N operation:\nAddition = addition\nSubtraction = subtraction\nMultiplication = multiplication\nDivision = division\nModulo = modulo\nExponentiation = exponentiation\n\nAdd 5 to 5 to get Identity 1\n\n### Example2. The special system operation MLP :\n\nThis is the special operations table from Template:Taxation examples.2, newly added to the single Template. It is custom builded to process through recent operator definitions.\n\n####*** UpdateMLP (Multiple Problems' Lastest Mathematics Points) operators (Short explains):\n\n• Only happens when multiple BinOP steps are executed together as a Simulation layer.
