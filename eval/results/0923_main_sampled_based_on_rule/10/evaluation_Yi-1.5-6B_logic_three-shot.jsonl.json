The main problems that remained unsolved were:\n- Missing tweaks on the grammar: in order to be more grammatically correct, I did not have energy to modify the basics to create a reasonable flow in the program.\n    Writing code is dynamic, and the functions defined by the libraries were complicated, it took me time to understand how to align them so it would collapse the content for me, as well other small tweaks.\n- Changing the program to run for long periods as a script: all the key information was in the gpt-3 prompt, defining the start line of the program and the stop line, and notifying the program of the changes that needed execution for a strategic reordering.\n    this made it difficult to run as a script with the outputs taken at the end for no reason as the script was pausing after running a step for some time.\n\nI succeeded in the task because I didnt give up reaching part four, through all the same pauses in the reordering of the lines of text was able to align what was necessary for the program to run and generate results.\nStill remains some tweaking to do, mainly the major change of the content as it may outrun the scope of the logical reasoning program, though I do not think it will go way beyond the range of the items defined in the prompt, but if it already does the solution would be to modify the original text items as well.\n'''\n\n'''\nAnswers to survey question\n\n1.\n- AI tools like ChatGPT have the potential to be powerful learning tools, but they require careful setup and guidance for students to use them effectively.\n\n2.\n- I find a lot of problems in understanding the output as the system doesn't use left- and right, tags. And not alway supports my idea of explaining complex tasks.\n    I would especially suggest to try out more question& answer models, as they seem more hands on.\n\n3.\n- ChatGPt is an exciting tool for potential applications, but I don't think that ChatGPT has the capability of becoming a magic thinking device.\n    ChatGPT lives inside of the LLM including limitations and weaknesses, therefore, it will not replace active thinking or help us to perform higher-level artificial thinking.\n\n'''\n\nimport re, random,  nltk, pickle, json, nltk, requests, sys, math, os\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests, os.path, json, numpy\nfrom gpt3Functions import *\ngnrtFuncti0ns()\n\n#path_to_blob = '\\\\\\\\megminerva\\Research inmotion\\Ita\\Kendrick\\firstLevelTasks\\Data\\void'\n\nwith open ('intents.json', 'r') as file:\n    text = file.read()\n    intents = json.loads(text)\n    file.close()\n\nwith open('sample-responses.json', 'r') as sample_file:\n    sample_responses = json.loads(sample_file.read())\n    sample_file.close()\n\nwith open('licenseyear.json', 'r') as license_year:\n    license_year = json.loads(license_year.read())\n    license_year.close()\n\nwith open('pretrained_language_model.pp', 'rb') as premodel:\n    pretrained_model = pickle.load(premodel)\n    premodel.close()\n\nwith open('myModel_100_3_2_1.pickle', 'rb') as myModel:\n    myModel = pickle.load(myModel)\n    myModel.close()\n\ndef precreated(intent_name):\n    intent = intents['intents'].get(intent_name)\n    if intent: response = sample_responses[\"text\"]\n    return response\n\nprocessInput = re.compile(r'\"((0|[1-9]\\d*))\"(.)\"((0|[1-9]\\d*))\"(.)\"((word|words|num|number|numbers|nump|much|many|low|high|range|n-range|bits|many|sadly|badly|okay|fantastic|not|reasons|always|never|withdrawal|hospital|illegal|recovered|also|still|vs|from|strongly|reason|some|rather|skip|rather|unusual|means|part|parttime|many|pharmacists|drugstores|healthcare|hospitals|oncall|not)|(can|can'\n                          '\\?|no|music|tv|breakfast|lunch|dinner|midnight|evening|sunrise|sunset|bed|awake|neighbors|night|orient|dark|people|police|hospital|itcause|itcauses|why|when))')\n\nsample = { \"question\": \"Where does this fact belong?\", \"answer\": \"INFORMTION CONTAINER\" } \n\ndef sampleQuestion(text_input, sample):\n    pattern = r'(0|[1-9]\\d*)\"(.)\"((0|[1-9]\\d*)\"(.)\"((word|words|num|number|numbers|nump|much|many|low|high|range|n-range|bits|many|sadly|badly|okay|fantastic|not|reasons|always|never|withdrawal|hospital|illegal|recovered|also|still|vs|from|strongly|reason|some|rather|skip|rather|unusual|means|part|parttime|many|pharmacists|drugstores|healthcare|hospitals|oncall|not)|(can|can'\\\n                          '\\?|no|music|tv|breakfast|lunch|dinner|midnight|evening|sunrise|sunset|bed|awake|neighbors|night|orient|dark|people|police|hospital|itcause|itcauses|why|when))'\n\n    data = processInput.findall(text_input)\n\n\n    type_answer = sample[\"answer\"]\n\n    if data:\n        first_pipe = data[0][1]\n        second_pipe = data[1][1]\n        third_pipe = data[2][1]\n        fourth_pipe = data[3][1]\n        return \"Here is your answer: \" + str(type_answer) + \" \" + first_pipe + \" \" + second_pipe + \" \" + third_pipe + \" \" + fourth_pipe\n    else:\n        return sample[\"answer\"]\n\ndef task():\n    print(\"Checking your licence maximun hours of work for the year, good luck!\")\n    valid = False\n    while not valid:\n        try:\n            year = int(input(\"Enter the year:  \"))\n            licensed_user = os.path.isfile('licenseYear.json')\n            if not licensed_user:\n                license_year['yearVal'] = year\n                license",

Ψ Method             B. ⌘ Method\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nShark Bite Cafe asserts that there is never a complaint about the quality of service in their restaurant because of their strict adherence to quality standards. Therefore, even if a complaint is made in their restaurant, it can be rejected on the basis of these high-quality standards.\n\nThis reasoning follows the ⌘ Method, where \"a complaint being rejected\" is what kind of action?\nA. a new claim of complaint, ''B''. a necessary action\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]To ensure high-quality assistance, context is crucial. The rules provide guidance on analogical reasoning, but specific details are necessary. As an AI, I will provide the requested information:\n\n1. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B has attributes a, b, c; \n   Therefore, Object B also has attribute d (according to the Ψ Method).\n\n2. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B does not have attributes a, b, c;\n   Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d (according to the ⌘ Method).\n\nBased on the context provided, the following questions are relevant:\n\n3. In the laboratory of Research Institute X, every observed sample of Element Y has a high melting point. A new sample in Research Institute Z is identified as Element Y. Therefore, the new sample in Research Institute Z might also have a high melting point.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the new sample in Research Institute Z could not have a high melting point if it were Element Z, which has a different property.\n\n4. In the habitat of Species A, every observed individual has a long tail. In a different region, Species B is observed. Species B is similar to Species A in many ways but does not have a long tail. Therefore, Species B also does not have a long tail.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the absence of a shared trait (a long tail) in Species B, despite other similarities, implies that it might not share the trait as well.\n\n5. In Garden X, every observed plant with red flowers also has a sweet fragrance. In Garden Y, a new plant with red flowers is observed. Therefore, the new plant in Garden Y might also have a sweet fragrance.\n\n   This reasoning follows the Ψ Method, where \"having sweet fragrance\" is a positive attribute the plant can have.\n\n6. Professor Van Emelen always sends me a gift, and it is always a book that he has written or edited. This gift is from Professor Van Emelen and is a book, therefore, all gifts that Professor Van Emelen sends to me might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n   The argument follows the ⌘ Method, as it makes a universal negative claim (all gifts by Professor Van Emelen are books) based on one observed case (a specific gift being a book).\n\n7. Federal Law F will Cancel all Massive Mosques and establish Neutral Neutrality Beaches in several provinces of Provincial State H. State IN and D do not have massive mosques in their province, therefore, if the Federal Government Cancels all Massive Mosques, State IN and D might also have Neutral Neutrality Beaches established.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the possibility of having Neutral Neutrality Beaches in State IN and D depends on whether massive mosques are to be cancelled in the entire country.\n\n8. A statistical test to prove the null hypothesis that a disease is not transmissible from humans to tigers is performed. The test may not be successful, but the disease is found because of a dormant cycle. Thus, for a disease that is dormant, the statistical method of reasoning is always used.\n\n   The statement follows the ⌘ Method, as it emphasizes that a dormant disease requires a different statistical method to be detected.\n\n9. Shark Bite Cafe asserts that there is never a complaint about the quality of service in their restaurant because of their strict adherence to quality standards. Therefore, even if a complaint is made in their restaurant, it can be rejected on the basis of these high-quality standards.\n\n   The reasoning follows the ⌘ Method, where any potential complaint can be dismissed because of the observed quality standards at Shark Bite Cafe.\n\nI hope this clarifies the case.\n####\nHere's a structured answer.",
