You buy, they deliver. They are exporting their products all over the US, and just received an order for 8,500 ceiling fans. Your manufacturing process is brought to you by jumbo pylons with date codes stamped in the center. WS is Wednesday, September 1, The manufacturing facility must work for 4 days and then has 3 days off before shipping to other factories located in Seattle, WA.\n\nQ. How many ceiling fans must the manufacturing facility produce each day for two straight weeks to fulfill the 8,500 ceiling fan order in time.\n\n\n....,W,T,,,,.?(?(?(?(?(eg, 245+247+206+??)\nThere may be different ways to find the feasible solution, and then quote your feasible solution.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nShort answer: ?=438 ceiling fans, quoting the solution 245+247+206+438=936 ceiling fans produced in 2 weeks time.\n\nLong answer: The first step is to count the number of days received by the factory. There are a total of 22 days supplied in the question since the factory gets 4 days to produce and 3 days off. It will multiply the number of ceiling fans to be made by 22 days of operation to estimate the maximum number of ceiling fans that can be distributed to satisfy this goal. Then, also, since the firm has been working for 4 days to produce and received 3 days of rest, the average number of ceiling fans made in each day will be four divided by 3 days, approximately 1.67 ceiling fans. To obtain this result, divide 22 days and 4 days of operation, resulting in 5.5 ceiling fans working every day. Multiply by 5.5, which evaluates the 5.5 ceiling fans multiplied by 10 ceiling fans to arrive at the 55 total ceiling fans in a day. Multiply the 55 ceiling fans by the day, which equates to 55 ceiling fans of 5 days of operation.\n\nSubtract the 5 ceiling operation from 22 ceiling fans,\nthe number of ceiling fans required in a day is 17 ceiling fans.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ceiling fans the factory develops each day will be 17 ceiling fans, and the total needed of ceiling fans will be 17 ceiling fans multiplied by the number of days. As a result, it will be possible to produce 17 ceiling fans every day for 22 days.",

The task is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all of the numbers. The numbers at the end of each row and column represent the sum of the weights (positions) of the black cells, which are initially all underscores (_). The goal is to blacken some cells to satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe provided question puzzles showcase the requirements of Sudoku, with the second one being particularly challenging.
