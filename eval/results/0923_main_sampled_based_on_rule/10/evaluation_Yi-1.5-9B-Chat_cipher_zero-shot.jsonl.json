So, the group becomes \"SD########\".\n3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups: Since the group has 8 characters, we need to split it into 4 groups of 2 characters each: \"SD\" and \"####\".\n4. For each binary group (L1, L2), do the following:\n   - Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as (l1_row, l1_col): For 'S' in grid1, the row is 1 (since Q-P is skipped), and the column is 3. So, (l1_row, l1_col) = (1, 3).\n   - Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in grid2 as (l2_row, l2_col): For 'D' in grid2, the row is 3 (since Q-D is skipped), and the column is 4. So, (l2_row, l2_col) = (3, 4).\n   - Find the corresponding number num3 in grid3 from l1_row and l2_col: Using (l1_row, l2_col) = (1, 4), the corresponding number in grid3 is 6.\n   - Output the triple (l1_col, num3, l2_row): So, the first triple is (3, 6, 4) for \"SD\".\n   \n   For the second group, \"####\", since we're filling with '#', the corresponding numbers in grid1 and grid2 for '#' would be out of bounds in the respective grids. However, for the purpose of this example and following the encryption rules provided, we'll assume the placeholder values based on the grid positions if '#' were to exist. Since '#' does not exist in grid1 and grid2 (as they are not in the original alphabets Q-Z), we'll use the placeholders (l1_row, l1_col) = (2, 0) and (l2_row, l2_col) = (0, 2), which are the positions where '#' would hypothetically line up if the entire grid was filled. The corresponding number in grid3 from l1_row and l2_col would be 2. So, the second triple is (0, 2, 0) for \"####\".\n\n5.
