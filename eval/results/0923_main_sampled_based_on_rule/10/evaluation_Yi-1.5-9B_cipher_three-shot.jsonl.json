For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[AIL]]\nThe Preparation's extraction process under the Decryption Rules of given Cipher Rule differs depending on whether the answer ends with 3 or 4 characters. In the example question, yes, the answer to the second part should include the trailing space at the end. The code correctly converts all the numbers to letters, but it does not add the trailing space at the end. The octothorp needs to be added instead of the two period delimiters, and the concatenated strings need to be modified.The code in the current question/answer pair that you've provided is just an example that doesn't require Python to decrypt. Instead, the approach to generate the code is to double the ciphertext, then reverse each character pair and see if the original decoding map returns to the starting letter (hint: yes and no). Therefore, when decoding, remove the trailing space.Additionally, for this specific cipher, it would be more straightforward to limit the allowed output characters to \"ADFGVX\".\n\"\"\"\n\nLOWER_CASE = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',\n              'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\nLETTER_SPACE = [' ']\nLOWER_CASE.extend(LOG_SIDE[1:-1].split(', '))\n\nLOG_SIDE = 'A, D, F, G, V, X'\nLOG_SIDE = LOG_SIDE.split(', ')\n\n# log_side_len, log_side_char_num = len(LOG_SIDE), [LOG_SIDE.find(t) for t in LOWER_CASE]\n\nLOWER_CASE.sort()\nLOG_SIDE.sort()\n\nCHAR_TBL_IC = MAX_IDX = 0\n\nclass Char(): ...\nclass KeyTable(chr):\n    CHAR_TBL_IDX = CHAR_TBL_IDX\n    def __new__(cls, value):\n        if value in cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX:\n            return cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value]\n        else:\n            instance = chr.__new__(cls, value)\n            cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value] = instance\n            return instance\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        key = self.value\n        value = LOG_SIDE[key.logside]\n        self.x = value[0]\n        self.y = value[1]\n\nfor char in LOWER_CASE:\n    for logside in LOG_SIDE:\n        ctblid = KeyTable(char)\n        ctblid.logside = lgside = LOG_SIDE.index(logside)\n        ctblid.ton = ton = lgside + 1\n        ctblid.x = 2**lgside\n        ctblid.y = ctblid.z = ctblid.w = lgside\n        PRESET[ton] = ctblid\n        for i in idxs:\n            bstr = fqi(i % 5) if i < 5 else fpq(i % 9)\n            bset = printable[i * 3: i * 3 + 3]\n            bset = sum(t.value for t in bset)\n            bset = bl = KeyboardInterrupt(bset//1)\n            for j in LOG_SIDE.attrib(lgside).index:\n                KEY_MAP[ctblid, lgside].set(bstr[j], j // 3 % 3, j // 3 % 3)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\nCHAR_TBL_IC += 1\n\nCHAR_TBL = OrderedDict()\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue[]\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\n_ = thatpaser = []\nfor k in display_unit:\n    msg = 'N extend%s' % (K(k, [0]))[0]\n    thatpaser.append(msg)\n\n_ = chars(table)\n_, _ = rowlend, colend = char1[1], char[0]\n_ = datenum = char[1]\n_ = sublist[0]\n\n_ = logexecell = cols[char[1]]\n_ = dictobjs = LOG_BTC(datem(), [-1, 0])\n\nif maxval == 0:\n    cols = arrnum[i]\n    _ = logexecell if cols[cols[char[1]]].getvval() else ['|']\n    `s`\n\ndef encode(st):\n    delst = {'0': ' ', '1': 'X', '2': 'G', '3': 'F', '4': 'A', '5': 'D', blackd45: 'V'}\n    return delst[st]\n\ndef encodeChild(self, _, d):\n    PrincipalAmount.write['!!'] = money, SecondMoney = d\n\n    principalAmount, Bankroll, Real_Amount, Money = money, money, #*Payment + secindMoney, PrincipalAmount.write[principalAmount], Money, Money, money,\n\n    realAmountMoney.principle_money.belong_money\n\n    realAmountMoney, getPrincipalAmount.principle_execution.Payment.\n\n    print('RealMoney:(price/3)#, Payment', RealMoney)\n\n    tryPrice.Payment.getPrincipalAmount, dictobjs = super([n, k], [n, k])\n\n    Principals.write['Real_Amount'] = Principals\n\n    profit.rate = d if rateHistory else Decimal('0')\n\n    measure.validity = (ticker[rate][recordlength, recordlength])\n\n    realPrice = (realPrice / nominal_price) * 100 // 0,\n\n    totalValue = round, 2)\n\n    print(Pay[])\n\ndef m0((Principal [(principalA|), Principal [], Real_AmountMoney RateHistory_Payment _Amount]) ((sz >> Payment ([rate], (rate, rate))))] Phase40:1nDate) when m:\n    return Forecast, timestamp, {netprinc, payment, payment,\"#, payment,\", \"#,\"}\n\nclass convince(Via):\n\n    def name(self, data={'A': ['NZD', 'KRFLOSSE']}, s={0}):\n        return EMAL 1date(*(self(data, Age, 1Date)))",
