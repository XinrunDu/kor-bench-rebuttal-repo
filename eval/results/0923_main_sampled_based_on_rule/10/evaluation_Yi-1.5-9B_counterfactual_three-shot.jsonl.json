So, on, they glided down, down a mighty black tunnel, through an appalling, endless tunnel, into a pitchy, maze-like valley. The wizard and his men never uttered a word -- not a sound--but the car ran straight, straight, with a doom, and a rushing, glittering wheel, down into the vastness of a gorgeous world, with a shrouding, streaming, silver slough of time \"\n\"extract_answers\": True\"\"\"\nimport re\n\ndef text_preprocess(text: str):\n    # handle https://pudn.com/downloads161/documents/5242027/preprocessor.c.txt.html\n    text = re.sub('[\\s,-’ \\n\"]', ' ', text)\n    text = re.sub('(( {b|B}{<{!(?:!)*/{')\n    text = text.split(' ')\n    return text\n\ndef eval_span(goldspan, outspan):\n    outspan_l, outspan_r = outspan.split('-')\n    goldspan_l, goldspan_r = goldspan.split('-')\n    output_count= abs(int(outspan_l)- int(outspan_r))\n    gold_act=abs(int(goldspan_l) - int(goldspan_r))\n    if output_count ==gold_act :\n        return 1\n\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# print(text_preprocess(\"Dumbledore has been hiding >, 1.2 {1+1}, unknown< all his life.\"))",

This plant is advertised as a stronger form of the common peashooter since it fires four peas at a time. This is a pretty overpowered plant. Unlike the common peashooter, Gatling Peashooter peanut cannot be upgraded. Gatling Peashooter is similar to Dinosaur Eggs an upgraded Gatling Pea, fossil box, and 30 bones (5x higher the collection and upgrade of Gatling Pea).\n\n### Instructions:\nEvaluate the following statement: Gatling Pea only works when planted on a peashooter, but brother is much more powerful than Gatling Pea.\n\n### Answer:\nGatling Pea is only available when planted on Peashooter, but it has stronger attack power. Dinosaur Eggs is Indiana Engor.\n\n### Question:\nUpgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro\n In order to upgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro, it is necessary to place a Peashooter in front of it and spend 80 Potato Puff power-ups, This requires 800 Pem and 6 packs of seeds per transfer The Gatling Pea does not form a plant buddy after transformation Various plants can go together in the same map. The pots of burned dirt can be burned with flamethrower or Mecha's beam to temporarily turn them into movable ground\n The Robin is first set to attack Zombie Clowns, and then multi-selects zombies with the highest defense. These include Spikerock, Doom Shield and Rollin' Ball, but not Zombies with a sun shield. The Basic version of Robin is good enough to replace Wall-nuts. The increased Diggler of Specimen XX can combine insect Irritate into the next mode when the target has been injured by at least 90%, making a double explosion that kills most Carets and Mini-Zombies as well as small meat shields and attackers.\n On the other hand, Specimen XX is also a plant that can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n Zombie scientists are mostly skill burners like Darwin's Potato Mine and Rootbeer Tapper, and Calamity Canary is a good counter-attack for Zombie Scientists. Specimen XX is compatible with Mable, in Mable's mode, Specimen XX's fart acts as a scarecrow that attacks zombies on the various irons of the map. Specimen XX can also cooperate with Snapdragon and Farb and can be carried after Physics Field upgrades. Specimen XX can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n New abilities:\n Zombie One can command garden zombies to grow their vegetables in the garden throughout the game, allowing them to plant plants and obtain resources;\n Farb cannot grow plants to within three rows of the Garden Gate. When Farb reaches the last row of the wall, this plant can be planted, which will cause conflicts with the evolution settings;\n Dr. Tomato is a new boss, Dr. Tomato's plant can evolve into a stronger Defender Tomato. Through defensive evolution, the plants become stronger, and the family becomes stronger, thus Dr. Tomato can enter, but after a long time of evolution, it will no longer be effective;\n The evolutionary rules are the same as before. By upgrading plants, regardless of plant buddies, one level of evolution will activate a level above its current level, and if they are not upgraded to a specific level, the plants will not evolve;\n The professional evolution will have many deadly turns at each level. It is best for Specimen XX to learn more about evolutionary resources and accompany Specimen XX.\n\n### Instructions:\nCan plants not be evolved?\n\n### Answer:\nNo\n\n### Question:\nCritters are cheap and powerful plants. They don't need a plant buddy they can return to the sponsor pool of each lane they kill by bullet-firing grass heads that shoot a huge number of bullets because the can pass through the right wall of light wavelengths. This makes it easy to block an attack even if they are both attacked by a standing group of zombies. However, at the beginning of the game, a single plant manages to block all zombie attacks with ease. When they are used, a thick fog surrounds them and the speed of the Zombies is slowed down.\n\n### Instructions:\nHow does Thistle Grass promote itself?\n\n### Answer:\nIt can kill zombies in order to return itself to the sponsor pool.\n\n### Question:\nYou are the king of the zombies. In your castle you preach what's right. which one of the most powerful machines we've seen to date, is the brainwashing of the zombies locked in the machine, causing them to do further zombie research on their behalf.
