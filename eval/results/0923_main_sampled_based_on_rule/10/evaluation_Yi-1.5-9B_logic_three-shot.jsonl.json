Spatiotemporal claim merging: Examine the relationship between the mined claim propositions and the input, and net out the option that meets the conditions.\n\n5. Spatial claim translation: spatial claim -> temporal claim\n\n6. Go back and fill in the blanks: through various prompt strategies generate the semantic blanks with sentence filling or incomplete word prompts after the initial output is generated\n\na) Spatial / Event > Causal / Spatial > Intentional / Causal > Evaluative / Intentional (Understand causal scenarios such as events/circumstances 1 and 2, infer a certain conclusion from the scenarios and make a prediction based on the conclusion.
