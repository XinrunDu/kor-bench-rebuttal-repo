Therefore, it is not correct to write the output as a number. The answer should be:\n\n[[((17,22),(15,20))]]\n\nLet's try another example:\n\nA =\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 0 & 2 \\\\\n 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB =\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2 & 3 \\\\\n 3 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A€B\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[((6,13),(13,15))]]\n\nThis solution is correct due to going by the rule:\n\nA€B=2A+3B\n= 2\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 0 & 2 \\\\\n 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n+ 3\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2 & 3 \\\\\n 3 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n= \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2\\cdot0+3\\cdot2 & 2\\cdot2+3\\cdot3 \\\\\n 2\\cdot2+3\\cdot3 & 2\\cdot0+3\\cdot5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n= \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 6 & 13 \\\\\n 13 & 15\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the output written correctly is a 2x2 matrix and we can confirm it matches the answer:\n\n[[((6,13),(13,15))]]\n\nThe output is indeed a 2x2 matrix because, as stated in the question, A and B are 2x2 matrices:\n\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 0 & 2 \\\\\n 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2 & 3 \\\\\n 3 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor the last two examples, we can solve them using the rule presented:\n\nA =\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 2 \\\\\n 3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB =\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 2 \\\\\n 3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A€B.\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[((5,10),(3,4))]]\n\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  -1 & -2 \\\\\n  -3 & -4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 2 \\\\\n  3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A€B.\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[(((-5,-10),(-3,-4)))]]$\nThis was the answer for the question.",
