So, we have:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p$$\n- $$q \\land \\neg q$$\n- $$r \\land \\neg r$$\n\nNow, we translate these paired conjunctions into binary numbers:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p$$ corresponds to $$10$$ in binary\n- $$q \\land \\neg q$$ corresponds to $$11$$ in binary\n- $$r \\land \\neg r$$ corresponds to $$111$$ in binary\n\nConverting these binary numbers to hexadecimal, we get:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p = mB$$\n- $$q \\land \\neg q = mF$$\n- $$r \\land \\neg r = MF$$\n\nTherefore, the given formula can be denoted as $$(mB \\lor mF \\lor MF)$$.

S0 and S2 are initialized as empty sets:\nS0 = ∅\nS2 = ∅\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - There are no clauses resolvable in this step as S0 is empty.\n\n3.
