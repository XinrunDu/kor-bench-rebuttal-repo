Given the four numbers: 6, 5, 1, 7, and the rule to form an equation that equals 24 using these numbers once, here is my step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start by trying to pair the numbers in a way that simplifies the calculation.\n2. The number 1 is a key factor, as it allows us to represent the number 24 as 24/1, so we can pair it with another number to start our equation.\n3. Breaking this down, we know that 24/1 = 24, so our base calculation is already formed. \n4. Now we can try to use the remaining numbers by representing the 24 as a multiplication.\n5. 7 * 6 = 42, this is close to our target of 24, so by reversing this we get 6 * 7, which is already a pair in our base calculation.\n6. Finally, use the remaining number 5 to represent the remaining part of 42 to approach 24.\n7. Therefore, our final equation is (24/1) - (6 * 7) + 5.\n8. When calculated, we get the result of 24.\n\nSo, my answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[(24/1) - (6 * 7) + 5]]",

Row 1: The sum of 5 can only be achieved by blackening the first, second, or third cell from the left. The first option (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5) is the only feasible solution, so we mark these three cells:\n    1.  X  X  X  X  X  X\n\n2.  Row 2: For a sum of 17, we can blacken the first and fourth cells, or just the third cell. This gives us:\n    1.  X  0  1  0  X  X \n3.  Row 3: To get a sum of 9, we blacken the first and fourth cells again, for a pattern of:\n    1. X  0  1  0  X  X \n4.   Row 4: A sum of 13 is achieved by blackening only the first and second cells, so our grid becomes:\n    1.  X  X  0  0  X  X \n5.  Row 5: Back to a sum of 9, we repeat the pattern from row 3:\n    1.  X  X  0  0  X  X \n6.  Row 6: For the sum of 8 in the last row, we blacken the first, second, and fourth cells:\n    1.  X  X  0  1  X  X \n\nNow, let's look at the columns:\n\n1.  Column 1: The sum in this column is 14. We previously blackened the first cell in multiple rows, so this sum is already satisfied.\n2.  Column 2: Similarly, for a sum of 10 in the second column, the blackened cells we placed in the second position in rows 1, 4, and 6 satisfy this constraint.\n3.  Column 3: With a 12-sum, we need to blacken the first and third cells from the top. This means changing the third cell in rows 2 and 4 to a 1. Our updated grid:\n    1.  X  X  X  0  X  X \n4.  Column 4: For a sum of 4, we only need to blacken the second cell in the fourth column, so we change it in row 3 and now have:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n5.  Column 5: Our sum here is 13, so we keep the blackened cells from rows 1, 3, 5, and 6, giving us:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n6.  Column 6: Lastly, for the sum of 10 in the last column, we need to place a 1 in the fourth, fifth, and sixth cells, so we change:\n    1.  X  X  1  1  X  X \n\nNow, we read off the grid, replacing each X with a 0 and each blackened cell (1) with a 1:\n\n1.  0 0 1 1 0 1\n2.  1 0 1 0 0 0\n3.  0 0 1 1 0 0\n4.  0 1 0 0 0 0\n5.  0 0 1 1 0 0\n6.  0 0 1 0 0 1\n\nReading this off row by row, left to right, and separating each row by a comma gives us:\n\n[[0 0 1 1 0 1, 1 0 1 0 0 0, 0 0 1 1 0 0, 0 1 0 0 0 0, 0 0 1 1 0 0, 0 0 1 0 0 1]]\n\nThe puzzle solution is the set of numbers enclosed by double square brackets as shown above.",

Each number on the edge of the grid represents a clue or constraint that needs to be satisfied for a valid configuration. \n\nThe solution is: \n\n1. In the first row, there is a 2 on the left and a 3 on the right, indicating that looking left from the second column will allow us to see 2 buildings and looking right from our position (in the second column), we can observe 3 skyscrapers. Therefore, we place a 3 in the second column, as this is the only valid number that fits the constraints. \n2. Next, in the first column, we have a 1 at the top and a 2 on the bottom. This indicates that looking up in the first column reveals only a single skyscraper due to the larger building on the top-left of the grid. Similarly, a single skyscraper is visible when looking down, due to the 2 on the bottom in the fourth column. So, we place a 1 along the first column, ensuring no duplicate heights in the same row. \n3. Following our clues, we find a 2 in the second row and a 1 in the fourth row. These numbers tell us that looking right from our second row positions will result in only one observable skyscraper, due to the 2 on the right, and from our fourth-row positions, no skyscrapers will be observed because of the 1 on the right. \n4. Finally, we can deduce that the remaining squares must have values 2 and 4. The 2 must go on the left and the 4 on the right in the third column, as a 2 is visible in the third row, and a 4 is observed in the first column's clue. \n\nHence, our final solution is derived by following and interpreting the numerical clues on the grid's edge and ensuring that the skyscraper heights within each row and column are unique. This adheres to the puzzle's rules and constraints.",
