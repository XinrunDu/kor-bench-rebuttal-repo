C* Principle doesn't apply here as we're not dealing with stronger or weaker information statements.\n\n2. C% Principle seems most relevant:\n   - The statement provides minimal information: \"The baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up.\"\n   - The hearer's inference expands on this information: \"The mother is the baby's mother.\"\n   - This follows CI1 of the C% Principle, which states: \"Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\"\n   - The conventional assumption is that when \"mother\" is mentioned in relation to a baby, it refers to the baby's biological mother unless specified otherwise.\n\n3. C! Principle doesn't apply here as there's no use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the inference most closely aligns with the C% Principle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

It also doesn't define the concept based on its origin (⌘), specific function or purpose (⚒), or relationship to other concepts (Ϟ). It's not describing a set of operational procedures (☖) either.\n\nInstead, this definition explains what nuclear energy is by describing the process or phenomenon that produces it. It's defining the concept by explaining its nature and the circumstances under which it occurs.\n\nThis approach aligns most closely with the Ѭ Definition, which is described as \"not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition\" and \"often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts.\" While nuclear energy isn't strictly a relational concept, this definition does relate it to the process that generates it.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n[[F]]\n\nThis definition falls under the Ѭ Definition category of Intensional Definitions.",

Copernicus proposing the heliocentric theory at 38\n2. Newton and Leibniz inventing calculus at 22 and 28 respectively\n3. Darwin writing \"On the Origin of Species\" based on observations from his voyage at 22\n4. Edison inventing the phonograph at 29 and the light bulb at 31\n5. Bell inventing the telephone at 29\n6. The Curies making their discoveries and winning Nobel Prizes in their 30s and 40s\n7. Einstein proposing his theories of relativity at 26 and 37\n8. Lee and Yang proposing their law at 30 and 34\n\nThese specific examples are used to support the proposition that many important scientific discoveries and inventions were made by scientists during their prime years when their thinking was most agile. The passage then extends this argument to social scientists and politicians as well.\n\nBy providing these numerous, concrete examples, the passage employs the E+ Method to argue for the truth of its proposition about the relationship between age and scientific achievement.",
