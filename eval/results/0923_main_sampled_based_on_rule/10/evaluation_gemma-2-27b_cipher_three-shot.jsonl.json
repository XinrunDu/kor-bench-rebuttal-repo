You only need to fill in the function body.\n\nThe first parameter `input_score` (int) represents the user's input score;\n\nThe second parameter `coefficients` is a list, it represents (a, b), a means numerator, b means the demoninator\n\nThe function should return the evaluation results.The output result contains addition, substraction and multiplication.It's math expression and the coefficients, so the result shows like this: `coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....` The number of variables in the formula \\(`coef`\\) is uncertain, ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of several\n\nNote:\n1. Data Angle: the same output can correspond to multiple different inputs (due to the reordering of variables)\n2. The range of score is 1001-1099\n3. There is no equal sign in the mathematical expressions of output, and various mathematical symbols can be used.\n4. Output format: Each mathematical operator corresponds to one of the coefficients at the beginning of the expression, followed by the symbols of the mathematical operators, and so on in turn\n\nCan you solve this problem? Output the math expressions and coefficients according to the format.\n\nAccording to the input, output the mathematical expression calculated by the function.\n\nFor example,\ninput:\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\nThe correct output is: `1/28 + 1/28` which represents the final mathematical expression is:`coefficients[0] + coefficients[1]`\n\n# 分数表达式\n\n```\ninput_score: 1\noutput: 1/28 + 1/28\n```\n\n## 你的任务是编写一个函数来计算分数表达式。\n\n函数名字是 score_function。你只需要填写函数体。\n\n第一个参数 `input_score` (int) 代表用户的输入分数;\n\n第二个参数 `coefficients` 是一个列表，它代表 (a, b)，a 代表分子，b 代表分母\n\n函数应该返回评测的结果。输出结果包含加法、减法和乘法。它是数学表达式和系数，所以结果展示是这样的：`coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....`公式中变量的数量(`coef`) 不定，最少2个，最多好几个\n\nnote：\n1. 数据角：同一个输出可以对应到多个不同的输入（由于变量的重排）\n2. 分数范围是1001-1099\n3. 输出的数学表达式中没有等号，可以使用各类数学符号\n4. 输出格式：每个数学操作符对应表达式开头的一个系数，然后是数学操作符的符号，依此类推\n\n你能解决这个问题吗？按照格式输出数学表达式和系数。\n\n根据输入，输出函数计算的数学表达式。\n\n例如，\n\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\n",

Please assign/modify the following steps as needed; thanks.\n\n### Answer:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - M Z S D P\n        K N F L Q\n        G A O X U\n        W R Y V C\n        B T E H I\n        - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n        - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n        - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n        - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n        - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n    \n    Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n    \n    \n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n        - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n        - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n        - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n        - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n    - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n    \n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"NO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n            \n- Decryption Rules:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n\nPlease perform the specified task and ensure that the task specified in the prompt is completed accurately.
