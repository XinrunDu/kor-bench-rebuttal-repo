We must remove the consciousness that controls Anjie, and we must act as soon as possible!\nWhere did he suddenly become a person who speaks like an old revolution? Is there a suitable way, White boss?\nHang Up the communication link, Mark took out the black crack from his arms and squeezed it tightly into the Secret Code sand to swallow the beast.\nParadoxically, David did not let himself in, perhaps because his wife and children were in transit.\nHe pushed open the window, flipped down, and the other side was unmanned.\nAnyway, the lights were on, and he had to jump in.\nGriff, Morgan commits treason, you wait, should pay the price!\nMark clenched his fists, his eyes full of anger and complexity.\nTurn down low from the shadow of the porch White Boss House buildings, Mark found the door of the door, he rummaged in his pocket, a tool of the right decision at the door, and unscrewed.\nThe door is not guarded. The White boss is very arrogant. Little Meng, would you like to come to the lighter Dragon's belly, which is over the sky and resembles a suburb?\nMark tried not to dismantle the sand-cracking tunnel in the wall and at the moment when he could go out. He announced that his existence was not a smaller-disrupted weapon than the Devouring Beast.\nI should have listened to Robin, what kind of attitude was that \"even if you are a policeman, you have to see the people of the garden of Eden!\"? I'll still go into a house that clearly belongs to an enemy of mine!\nMark slowly descended down to the sand-cracking tunnel, lowered his head to support his flashlight, and tweeted confirmation: The ventilation was normal, there was no chest-chilling air mass, and he had no killing intent.\nEverything's going to be fine. Leave, Mark\nHe quickly and agilely made his way up the trail and was about to run ah before overtaking Mark, who was running hard, a young boy full of amazement.\nBut he saw another of Mark's faces.\n\"Who? He asked in surprise.\nThe young boy looked up at him, helpless, panicked, as if he wanted to run hard to escape something, but was slowly advancing, as if he were lost.\nMark's expression softened, and he probably came to the White Boss to come back and create something, asshole\nThe young man took off his glasses, and mark felt great pain every time he heard the sound of ash refining love, and had to listen to a music box for three nights when he was sleeping.\nThe curly corners of his hair were strikingly similar, as if it were the same mask\nMark slowly pressed his mask to the left and handed it, his hands with no pockets, turning, and finally pointing to his chest, and he said, \"Robin's flower children, not like this.\"\n\"I'm the real one,\" he said, his brow sighed and sighed.\nWhite Boss's villa. Mark came to the previously recommended places to visit. This is a vintage villa where people in the Eden Garden District, guarded by personal power armor and drones, are protected by personal power armor and drones. The early security measures of the hotel where the staff were located were tight, and it would be hard to get in. No wonder Mark and Robin had never managed to sneak in before, and the only way to get in and out was to get in and out.\nShaw pot come out with me have something to tell you: \"Only once!\n\"Your quality is deteriorating,\" Shaw said with concern, staring at Mark with eyes not distant from him.\n\"It's just that your body has no choice but to get used to evolution,\" Mark said with a complex sigh.\n\"Where's Robin?\" Mark asked anxiously.\n\"She's still out of danger,\" Shaw said in a heavy tone. The anomaly that Simon mentioned earlier could indeed have trapped them in abnormal sand-creep tunnels, the shape of which is enough for the two of them to stay, and the sound of tools and Mark's presence would disturb their infiltration.\n\"Don't get so excited!\" Winie said in a grave tone.\n\"You whistled outside while being honored! Winie criticized in a grave tone.\nMark slowly raised his arm and placed it on Unwin's shoulder in a slow, dignified silence.\n\"It's a pity that Huangquandi also has long-term immortality agents like here,\" Mark said in a calm and heavy voice.\ndon't do anything i don't want you to know i 'm here i didn't mean it winnie said in a serious tone\n\"Shahi's personality is very similar to yours.\" Mark said in a sighing voice, slowly placing his hand on the shoulder of Anvy.\nBefore leaving I have to ask I was in Tartarus a prison in advance _\n\n### Answer:\n[[B||D]]\n\n### Follow up texts:\nthe end or expect to see Shaw wear heavy armour back to settle these sand-cracking monsters probably angry oh _ _Mark muttered in a low voice I don't know what kind of equipment this dormitory is in the past we have heard that these owner Wei Li's executive officers often prepare unusual items such as heavy drones and MA Formers for themselves apparently White Boss is no exception and now the Dark Energy is everywhereIt's getting thicker and growing\nI see the mission and I'm looking at him Mark said in",

They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nSpecifically, in the racing between A and B, A is riding a dragon of the same type as the Skrill. In addition to myself and B, there is also a C participant, whose score is 0. Because of the ongoing race, A knows B is my opponent, but doesn't know how many points I have.\nCurrently, the leaderboard is as follows:\n|        | A | B |\n|--------|---|---|\n| Sheep  | 1 | 0 |\n| Points | ? | 0 |\nAfter the first lap, I was caught by A and faced a dilemma: should I retreat or continue to catch more sheep? However, it seems that if I retreat, it would increase A's chances of winning the race. But if A fails to catch more sheep, I would have a hope of winning.\nSo I choose to continue catching sheep, hoping to overtake A in the second lap. Given that the Skrill has approximately 200 health points and can receive damage +1 for each second of delay, provide your advice on whether to continue capturing more sheep or not, using the information provided above. Be careful, as I may be aggressive and throw the stone away, resulting in 10% damage to the stone.\nHere is the adjusted description.\n\n### Incident Rule:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or even impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, resisting training even during periods of crisis. However, by treating it respectfully and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, it's possible to gain its trust. A Skrill will reciprocate gratitude with a dignified bow.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days.\nBefore Hiccup was born, a war with dragons ravaged Berk.\nVikings and dragons had a long history of war and conflict. Books had been created about how to slay a dragon.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nNight furies are ambush predators, one of the most dangerous weapons known to have lived in Berk's past. They attack at night, using the dark as camouflage, then pounce with brutal precision, and they can create plasma blasts so hot that they incinerate upon contact, creating the illusion of shadow fire.\nThe dragon's name comes from being the Fury of the Night.\n\n### Question:\nRead the above story and previous description.
