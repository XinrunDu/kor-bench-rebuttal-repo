Using history as an example, formulate a multitude of such new rules, where the A,B,C,D represents integer(can be negative, positive or 0), and x and y are parameters. The design exercise should include factoring the parameters (x,y) into the equation, and different arithmetic operators.The new rule requires to factor all parameters for comparison.This means by putting the value of these parameters, we would immediately be able to compute the answer to the question in the rule. Furthermore, to ensure the design rule exercises the assistant's math ability, the equations should be at least 10 word tokens long.

To find the number of bacteria in that solution, the sample needs to be subjected to several chemical analyses and filters. Each chemical analysis and filter has an efficiency rating.\n\nEach of the tests will have a maximum efficiency of $99999999999 which means that after each chemical analysis and filter, a maximum of $99999999999 per test of bacteria will be removed.\n\nThe efficiency of the equipment will decrease as the number of bacteria in the fluid decreases. Therefore, the contaminated fluid will need to be subjected to granular analysis.\n\nIf the quantity of bacteria in a sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\nIf the quantity of bacteria left in the sample is $\\frac{1}{10000000000000000000000000}$ or $\\frac{10000000000000000000000000}{1}$ of the first quantity of bacteria, only $\\frac{32768}{1}$ or $\\frac{1024}{1}$ test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result.\n\nFor example, if the analysis needs to be performed on the first most contaminated sample, which has $999999999$ bacteria, only one test using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $2024578745=999999999\\times 1$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $99999999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{1}{2}$ or $\\frac{128}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $99999999=128\\times\\frac{128}{9}$.\n\nIf the analysis needs to be performed on the first less contaminated sample, which has $9999$ bacteria, only $\\frac{64}{1}$ or $\\frac{256}{256}$ tests using the chemical analysis and filters will be applied in order to get the result. The reason is that $9999=256\\times \\frac{11}{256}$.\n\nDue to the fact that each piece of equipment is very delicate and expensive, only the minimum analysis procedure will be done to find the result. Therefore, find the maximum quantity of bacteria per sample based on the analysis procedure to have the exact number of bacteria. This is will help us find out the maximum second number required in each group to subtract to find the number of people who got lions.\n\n\nNumber of individual people analyzed using four, eight or sixteen Petri dishes per person in a set of eight standard tests, eight financial tests andeight health tests.\n\nIn order to start the analyses, please use the following function, which will calculate the necessary variables required for the analysis.\n```\npublic void finalize()\n{\n    if(($numMembers&$numMembersL)≠0)\n    {\n        if(memNameL[0]==\"May\")\n        {\n            not_ThreeTeeth=true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n",
