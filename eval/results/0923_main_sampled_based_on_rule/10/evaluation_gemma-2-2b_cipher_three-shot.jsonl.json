For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SAL]]\n\n\n# Solution\n\nIn this situation, you need to ensure that your encryption or decryption algorithm follows the specific rules provided in the cipher rule. This involves addressing properties of the rule defined by the keyword (when necessary), determining how consecutive values in outer_disc will be replaced by inner_disc, and smoothly flowing between the encryption and decryption steps. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that your final output matches the format specified in the encrypted and decrypted answers. Your final ciphertext or plaintexts must be formatted as required and enclosed within double square brackets.\n\n### Encryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties.\n- **Replacement**\n    - You replace certain characters in the plaintext with corresponding values in outer_disc.\n\n```plaintext\nInput:\n- Keyword of encryption (e.g., 'H')\n- period\n- increment\n\nOutput:\n- Uppercase letters string\n- keyword renamed\n- Encoded ciphertext\n\nEncryption Steps:\n- For each character p in the phrase {when applicable}, find the character that matches h in the inner_disc, and replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the outer disc. Assign the encrypted string as result.\n\n```\n\n**Encrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput: (Describe the process to find the character with the keyword)\nEncryption(Encrypt):H\n\nOutput: [[HI]]\n\nProcess: The process of finding character is:\n1. According to the keyword \"H\" in the original input \"H\", we find that it is equal to the character\n      {109 [01000001] on the binary code}\n2. Then {26 [0101111] on the binary digital} is replaced on the outer_disc, and the result is {108 [0100001] on the digital code}\n3. Repeating step 2, rotation increment = period = 14, after {4} characters are processed, the result is {109 [01000001] on the digital code}.\n{In this way, when period = 14, increment = 2, the inner_disc will rotate twice back, again as {109 [01000001] on the digital code} }  \n```\n\n**Decrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput Encryption(Encryption):HI\nOutput: [[I]]\n\nProcess: The process of decrypting the character is:\n- 1. according to the ciphertext \"HI\" in the input, find the character h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {109 [01000001] on the binary code}.\n- 2. then {108 [0100001] on the digital code} is replaced on the outer_disc, resulting in {H [0100000] on the digital code}.\n- 3. The process of encryption steps for character H is repeated until finally getting the final plaintext.\n```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n\n### Decryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The same properties (e.g., keyword) will ensure a smooth transition from encryption steps to decryption steps.\n- **Replacement:\n    - You replace the characters in the ciphertext with the values obtained in the outer_disc through decryption steps.\n- **Re-Encryption**\n    - Repeat the process for the replacements of characters until *n* passes, where ‘n’ is the encryption periodicity.\n\n\n\n```plaintext\n- Keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties\n- Replacement\n- Re-Encryption\n\nProcess:  \nInput:\n- Phrase in the ciphertext as string\n- Period, increment\n- keyword\n\nOutput:\n- Re-encrypted phrase in uppercases as a string\n- keyword renamed\n- Phrase in uppercases as string\n```\n\n**Sample input cipher text:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\n\nInput\n- The character is \"BAIL\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption \n- Encryption(Upgrade):BAIL\nPeriod: 12, Increment: 4\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Character: [{34 [101 01100] on the binary digit},{10 [01001] on the binary digit}]  \n```\n\n**Re-Decryption:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\nInput\n- The character is \"SUF\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption\n- Encryption (Upgrade) :SUF\nPeriod: 6, Increment: 1\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Characters:           [{95 [11101] on the binary digit},{10 [01001]}on the binary digit ]\n\nDecrypted Characters:  \n- Process: The process of finding the character with the keyword as input \"H\" is:\n  1. according to the encrypted ciphertext \"SUF\" in the input, find the character with the name h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {10 [01001] on the binary code}.\n\n  2. the character {10 [01001]} on the binary code is replaced on the outer_disc, with the result {95 [1] on the digital code}.\n\n  3. The process of decryption steps for character 95 is repeated until finally getting the final ciphertext.\n  ```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n",

Then, we will use the '.-/-...-' pattern to combine three letters into one pair of characters, and then use these pairs to represent the corresponding Morse code by converting them into numeric string form using the numerical-index mapping table. Finally, this string is added to the end of the ciphertext for encryption.\n\nFor decryption, we first need to split the Morse code into pairs representing each character and convert these pairs to numeric strings using the numerical index mapping table. Then, we use the morse_code Table to convert this numeric string back to the character form and finally concatenate it together.\n\nDuring the process, it is important to ensure that the output strings are formatted according to the specified instructions. For example, the encryption step should be \\'.-/-...'\\' separated by /, etc.\n\n![Here another image]\n",

All the ciphertext and plaintext are generated randomly. And, the encrypted and decrypted results will be exactly the same when you answer this question.\n\nCongratulations! You have obtained the cipher method and decryption rules, and provided the encryption and decryption answers and formatted ciphertext and decrypted results. The accuracy of your answers is fully detected. Now, you can start constructing an encryption algorithm.\n\nThe base criteria for assessing your constructed decryption algorithm as a cryptographic device include the following key points:\n\n- It should conform to the stated decryption rule and format.\n- It should maintain the ciphertext and encrypted format of the plain text.\n- The decryption time and space should ideally be linear, rather than constant.\n",
