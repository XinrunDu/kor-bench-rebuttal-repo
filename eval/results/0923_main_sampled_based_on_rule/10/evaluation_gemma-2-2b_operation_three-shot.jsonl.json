So, we write the answer as **25** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the second question, 2∞5 is equal to 4+25, which is equal to 29. So, we write the answer as **29** and wrap it in double square brackets.\n\nFor the third question, if X∞4=32, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=32, which simplifies to X^2+16=32. Rearranging gives **X^2=16**, which has two solutions, x=4 and x=-4. However, since the question asks for the number that must be used for the calculation and not for the values of X, we can only use X=4. So, our answer is just `4`.\n\nFor the fourth question, if 3∞X=18, we can rewrite the expression as 3^2+X^2=18, which simplifies to X^2=15. Rearranging gives **X=sqrt(15)**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the fifth question, if X∞4=256, we can rewrite the expression as X^2+4^2=256, which simplifies to X^2+16=256. Rearranging gives **X^2=240**. You can enter the exact answer or an approximate value suitable for the operation you are performing in this document. However, it should be wrapped in double square brackets to conform to the format we have shown above.\n\nFor the sixth question, if 2∞X=104, we can rewrite the expression as 2^2+X^2=104, which simplifies to X^2=100. Rearranging gives **X=10**. Or **10**(sqrt(10)). Again, these are both solutions to the expression, but be careful which one you choose for the operation since the result of the assessment depends on it. Here, the precise number is required when the operation is done.\n\nNext step: `3∞X=4´```\n\n#1 :\n\nThis is the answer for third and sixth questions : `4, 6, 10`(or `10, 6`) are the valid solutions of X∞4 = 32. The others will give *Unsupported error: Invalid square root* for X2 = 32, which would lead to a wrong result for your final result ( e.g. 3∞4 = 5 ) because of Sqrt function call.\n\nThe X2 = 32 is achieved by setting the **X** value to 4 ( answer for (b)) or 8 ( answer for third question ).\n",

I hope you enjoy the visual presentation of the material.\n\n> Click here to watch the video solutions on Youtube.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* In section 4.1, we explored additive operations on matrices, including addition, scalar multiplication, and the diagonal operation, denoted by A'D.\n* In section 4.2, we learned about the element-by-element multiplication of matrices. Our aim was to multiply each element of Matrix A by the corresponding element of Matrix B and then add them up to obtain the resulting matrix.\n* Section 4.3 introduced operations applied to elements in a vector, including adding one element to another element, subtracting one element from another element, replacing one element with two different numbers, and producing a new vector as a single element. This was all derived from the fundamental operation of working on the elements.\n* Then the pedagogy section 4.4 addressed matrix operations where each element of a matrix was multiplied by another element, such as matrix multiplication with a scalar or matrix multiplication with a matrix.\n* In section 4.5, we delved into vector multiplication, linear transformation, and vector addition, showing how they were represented in Python.\n* Here's a brief summary of the operations covered throughout the book:\n  * addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and element-by-element multiplication of two matrices (section 4.2 in the video)\n  * element-by-element addition and subtraction of vectors (section 4.3 in the video)\n  * scalar multiplication of a matrix by a vector, scalar multiplication of a vector, and scalar multiplication of a vector by a matrix (section 4.5 in the video)\n\nThe course material was presented without a strict sequence in the video, but a clear structure can help extract knowledge from it. Based on the structure in the video, students can organize their notes as listed in bold, enclosed in red brackets.\n\n### Exercises\n\nExercise 1.\nIn the table below, perform the requested operations on the provided matrices A and B. Write your answers in the corresponding cells in the table.\n\n$$\\begin{table}[t]{p{4em}p{10.08em}p{.92em}p{2.6em}} x & 2\\cdot A & B+A & 3 \\cdot A & A+B\\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{0} & & \\\\ \\cline{2-3} & & \\\\[-5pt] & \\multirow{2}{*}{} & \\\\ \\cline{2-3} & \n\nExercise 2.\nConsider the four matrices in the table below. Perform the operations indicated for each of them and enter your answers in the corresponding cells in the table. Note that the result takes the form [a1, [a2, a3]] where a1 and a2 are numbers, and a3 is a matrix, and the elements of a3 are real numbers. Use the same convention for when a2 is a matrix and has the form [a3, a4].\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|r@{\\hspace*{30pt}}c@{\\hspace*{30pt}}}\n\\hline\nOperation & M1 & M2 & M3 & M4 \\\\ \\hline\n$M_1 + M_2$ & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{$M_1 + M_2 = M_3$} & \\\\\n$ 2 \\cdot M_1 $ & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{$ 2 \\cdot M_1 = M_4 $ } & \\\\\n$3 \\cdot M_1$ & & & & \\\\\n$ \\{ (M_1)_1 + (M_1)_5 \\} + (M_1)_6 $ & $ \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\2 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}10\\\\8 \\end{pmatrix} $ & & \\\\[-4pt]\n$ (M_2)_1 + (M_2)_2 $ & $ \\begin{pmatrix}7\\\\10 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\10 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}7\\\\20 \\end{pmatrix} $ & \\\\ \\hline \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\nExercise 3.\nCompute the following operations: [A & B], [A @B], and $[A]_ {1,1}$.
