Each term in the given formula represents a paired conjunctive term since each variable and its negation appear exactly once in conjunction across the terms.\n\nWe determine the binary and corresponding hexadecimal index for each term:\n\n1. ¬p∧¬q∧¬r: False assignment is 000 (binary), so m0.\n2. ¬p∧¬q∧r: True assignment is 001 (binary), so m1.\n3. ¬p∧q∧r: True assignment is 011 (binary), so m3.\n4. p∧¬q∧r: True assignment is 101 (binary), so m5.\n5. p∧q∧r: True assignment is 111 (binary), so m7.\n\nNow, to see if the formula is expressed in principal disjunctive normal form:\n- The principal disjunctive normal form requires all paired conjunctive terms to be covered. However, here only specific terms (m0, m1, m3, m5, m7) are included. Also, there are a total of 8 possible terms of three variables, and we have only covered 5 terms.\n\nGiven that the PDNF should include all possible paired conjunctive terms for the formula to be a tautology and it doesn't in this case, the given formula does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\nSince the terms included are explicit in their use of alternating true assignments (binary) and represent a true outcome negated to form a simple conjunctive term, we can safely conclude:\n[[B]]",

Referring to the logic rule:\n- ¶p and §¬p; ‽p and §p have a * relationship (both cannot be true and cannot be false, which does not fit here as per our analysis).\n- ¶p and ‽p have a x relationship (both cannot be true but can both be false, which also does not align as we are dealing with permissions only).\n- §p and §¬p have an @ relationship (both cannot be false, but can both be true, which aligns since if §¬p is true, an absence of §p would make it true as well).\n- ¶p and §p; ‽p and §¬p have a % relationship (both can be true, and both can be false).\n\nEvaluating these relationships: \n- The @ relationship, which is valid for §p and §¬p, indicates both cannot be false but can be true, aligning closely with ¬§p → §¬p. Here, if we agree that p is not permitted (¬§p), it directly permits ¬p (§¬p), making sure one of them (either p or ¬p) should always hold a permission.\n\nFormula (7) ¬§p → §¬p corresponds clearly to the @ relationship where both cannot be false, but can both be true.\n\nThe answer is thus [[C]].",
