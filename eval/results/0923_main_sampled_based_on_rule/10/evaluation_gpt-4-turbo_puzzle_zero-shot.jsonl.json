        "response": "To solve the puzzle I+BB=ILL, following the rules where each letter represents a unique number:\n\n1. Identify possibilities for single and double-digit sums that would allow three digits on the right-hand side (ILL).\n   \n2. Since the first letter (\"I\") is used in a single-digit addition and also as the first letter in a three-digit number, \"I\" cannot be 0 due to rule 3.\n\n3. BB being a two-digit number formed by repeating the same digit means \"B\" can range from 1 to 9.\n\n4. Consider each case, assuming BB produces a carry into the hundreds place (necessary for a three-digit result from this addition). Thus \"I\"+BB must equal 100xI + I0 + L.\n\n#### Start with possible values:\n- B = 1 → BB = 11\n- B = 2 → BB = 22\n- B = 3 → BB = 33\n- B = 4 → BB = 44\n- B = 5 → BB = 55\n- B = 6 → BB = 66\n- B = 7 → BB = 77\n- B = 8 → BB = 88\n- B = 9 → BB = 99\n\n#### Testing these values with tailoring rules:\n- For I+11 = ILL, no fit since it gives 111 for I = 1 which violates rule 2 (B = 1).\n- For I+22 = ILL, no fit for similar reasons.\n- For I+33 = ILL, testing I = 1 gives 134 (Does not work), I = 2 → 235 (Does not work), etc.\n  \n  Continuing this logic:\n\n- For I+88 = ILL:\n  - I = 1 + 88 = 189 (Invalid since it would require 0 as B[collisions] and no carry in the hundreds).\n  - I = 5 + 88 = 593 [[I=5, B=8, L=3]]. This works since all non-zero and unique numbers fit without collisions or rule violations.\n\n#### Verification:\n- I = 5\n- BB = 88\n- ILL = 593\n\nDoes 5 + 88 = 593? Yes, under the given custom puzzle rule definitions and unique, non-zero, assignments of each letter.\n\nFinal solution: [[I=5, B=8, L=3]]",

Since 2 is at (2,1), by definition no smaller numbers, hence (2,1) should be greater than any number left to it except 1. As `3 > 2`, (3,1) must be 3 or 4. Since (3,1) needs to be greater than (3,2), most minimal arrangement would be (3,1) as 3 (if (3,2) is 1 or 2).\n\n2. Apply (1,1) > (1,2) > (1,3):\n- To maximize minimal placements and allow room for other rows, let's consider (1,1) as 4, then (1,2) could be 3 or 2, and (1,3) could be 2 or 1; selecting higher values for earlier cells because smaller ones must be greater than more constrained larger later cells.\n\n3. Apply (2,3) < (2,4):\n- Given 4 in the first row, columns 3 and 4 need to be assigned smallest available which doesn't conflict with other conditions; let's try with (2,3) as 1, so (2,4) can be 3.\n\n4. Since (2,2) must be greater than (3,2) and it can't be 1 or 2 (already in row), and 4 is used above, (2,2) must be 4. Hence, (3,2) can be set to 2 considering (3,1) as 3.\n\n5. To finalize and review for any missed mistakes:\n- Row 1 (4, 3, 2, 1) satisfies all conditions for that row.\n- Row 2 is now (2, 4, 1, 3).\n- Row 3 has (3, [2 or 1], X, X) needing 4 in either third or fourth place; putting 4 in fourth place.\n- Row 4 then adjusts based on options left fitting into remaining spots without violations.\n\n### Step 4: Final Grid Solution\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 2 4 1\n1 1 3 2\n```\nHowever, we find (4,2) = 1 conflicts. Correct placements by updating:\n- (3,2) = 1, and (3,3) = 2; satisfies all inequalities.\n- For Row 4: (4,2) = 2, (4,3) = 3 allows using 4 without conflict.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n```\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 4 2\n1 2 3 4\n```\nOutput: [[4 3 2 1,2 4 1 3,3 1 4 2,1 2 3 4]]",

Start with columns and rows with minimum tents.
