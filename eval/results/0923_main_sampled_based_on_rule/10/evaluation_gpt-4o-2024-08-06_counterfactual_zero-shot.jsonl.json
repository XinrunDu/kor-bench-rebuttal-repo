It improves strength and stamina naturally without harmful effects.\n\nB. **Stimulants** - These can provide short-term benefits but often come with side effects or potential harm, making them unsuitable for safe resistance enhancement.\n\nC. **Gravity body** - While it provides combat advantages, it is described as a rare combat resource and exoskeleton mecha.
