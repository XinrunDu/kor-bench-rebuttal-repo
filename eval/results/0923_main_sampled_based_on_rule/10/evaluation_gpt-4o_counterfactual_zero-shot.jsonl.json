It is associated with combat rather than general health, and it's not clear if it would enhance body resistance per se. Additionally, using such advanced technology may not be sustainable for overall health.\n\n4. **Becoming a devouring beast** (Option D): Transforming into a beast, as described, seems to be detrimental to one's humanity and potentially harmful.
