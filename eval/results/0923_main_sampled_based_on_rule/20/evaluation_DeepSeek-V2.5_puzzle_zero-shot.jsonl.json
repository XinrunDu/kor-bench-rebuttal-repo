Let's start by trying different combinations.\n\n4. **Test Combinations**:\n   - Start with a simple division: `4/2 = 2`\n   - Then add three numbers to make the total 17: `2 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 17`\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute the values: `4/2 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 17`\n   - This satisfies the equation.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe feasible solution is:\n\n[[4/2+5+6+4=17]]",

Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Grid Setup**: We have a 4x4 grid. Each cell in the grid must contain a number from 1 to 4, and each number must appear only once in each row and column.\n\n2. **Regions and Operations**:\n   - (1,1)(2,1):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (1,1) and (2,1) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (3,3)(3,4):2÷ → This means the numbers in cells (3,3) and (3,4) when divided, should equal 2.\n   - (1,2)(1,3):1- → This means the numbers in cells (1,2) and (1,3) when subtracted, should equal 1.\n   - (1,4)(2,4):8* → This means the numbers in cells (1,4) and (2,4) when multiplied, should equal 8.\n   - (2,2)(2,3):3* → This means the numbers in cells (2,2) and (2,3) when multiplied, should equal 3.\n   - (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ → This means the sum of the numbers in cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2) should equal 13.\n   - (4,3)(4,4):2- → This means the numbers in cells (4,3) and (4,4) when subtracted, should equal 2.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Start with the simplest constraints and fill in possible values, ensuring no number is repeated in rows or columns.\n   - Use trial and error or logical deduction to fill in the grid while satisfying all constraints.\n\n### Detailed Filling:\n- **(1,1)(2,1):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (1,1), then 4 must be in (2,1).\n- **(3,3)(3,4):2÷**: Possible pairs (1,2) and (2,4). If we place 2 in (3,3), then 4 must be in (3,4).\n- **(1,2)(1,3):1-**: Possible pairs (3,2) and (4,3). If we place 3 in (1,2), then 4 must be in (1,3).\n- **(1,4)(2,4):8***: Possible pairs (2,4) and (1,8). If we place 2 in (1,4), then 4 must be in (2,4).\n- **(2,2)(2,3):3***: Possible pairs (1,3) and (3,1). If we place 3 in (2,2), then 1 must be in (2,3).\n- **(3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+**: Possible combinations that sum to 13. Place 1, 3, 4, 5 in these cells (ensure no duplicates).\n- **(4,3)(4,4):2-**: Possible pairs (3,1) and (4,2). If we place 3 in (4,3), then 1 must be in (4,4).\n\nAfter filling in the grid based on these constraints, we get the following grid:\n\n```\n2 3 4 1\n4 1 3 2\n1 4 2 3\n3 2 1 4\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[2 3 4 1,4 1 3 2,1 4 2 3,3 2 1 4]]",

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**:\n   - The grid is 5x5.\n   - Skyscrapers have heights from 1 to 5.\n   - Each row and column must have unique heights from 1 to 5.\n   - The numbers on the sides indicate how many skyscrapers can be seen from that direction.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - From the top and bottom constraints, we can infer some placements immediately.\n   - For example, in the first column, the top constraint is 2, meaning there must be a 5 (the tallest) second from the top. The bottom constraint is 2, so the tallest must be second from the bottom. This leaves us with the middle cell in the first column being 5.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**:\n   - Using similar logic, we can place the remaining skyscrapers by ensuring each row and column has unique heights and meets the visibility constraints.\n\n4. **Final Grid**:\n   - After filling in all the heights, the grid should look like this:\n\n```plaintext\n  2   2   3   2   1\n2  4   5   2   1   3   1\n4  1   2   4   5   3   2\n2  5   4   3   2   1   2\n1  2   3   1   4   5   5\n2  3   1   5   3   2   3\n  2   3   1   2   3\n```\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.\n\n### Answer:\n`[[4 5 2 1 3, 1 2 4 5 3, 5 4 3 2 1, 2 3 1 4 5, 3 1 5 3 2]]`",
