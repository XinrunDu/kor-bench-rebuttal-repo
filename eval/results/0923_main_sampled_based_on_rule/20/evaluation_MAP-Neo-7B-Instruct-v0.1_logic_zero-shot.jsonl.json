Second Person (`!p & !q & r`): This statement is accurate in terms of denying Professor Wang's origin from both Suzhou (p) and Shanghai (q) but falsely claims he is from Hangzhou (r).

The specific number of iterations required to reach this conclusion depends on the complexity of the original CNF and the resolution steps applied. However, given the complexity of the initial CNF, it's likely that the algorithm would iterate through the steps outlined (initializing, certain steps of resolution, checking S2, and final output) once or twice at most to conclude that there's a plausibly satisfying assignment. The exact number in iterations can be more context-dependent on the specific clauses involved and how the resolution rules are applied.\n\nFinal output:\n- \"Plausible\"\n- The number of cycles needed to confirm a satisfiable assignment would be once or twice, assuming the initial transformations and operations are followed correctly through the resolution steps. \n\nPlease note, for more complex or specific inputs, the algorithm's expected iterations could vary.

From this, it logically follows that there exists an object S for which ¬P is true.\n\n### Figure and Mood Analysis:\n\n1. **Figure I (Universal Affirmative):**\n   - Given the logical statement ∀P⇒¬M, it corresponds to the mood AAA, as it involves a universal affirmative (All P implies Not M).\n   - However, the second part ∃S⇒M does not fit with Figure I, as it involves the existential affirmative (There exists an S such that M), which corresponds to the mood AEE.\n   - Since the first part suits AAA and the second part AEE, there's a conflict in matching these directly with Figure I.\n\n2. **Figure II (Universal Negative):**\n   - The logical statement ∀P⇒¬M corresponds to the mood AII, as it involves a universal negative (All P is not M).\n   - The second part ∃S⇒M aligns with the mood EIO, as it involves an existential positive (There exists an S such that M), further contradicting the direct applicability of Figure II.\n\n3. **Figure III (Particular Affirmative):**\n   - The logical statement ∃S⇒M ⇒ ∃S⇒¬P suits the mood IAI, as it involves a particular affirmative (Some S implies M) and a particular negative (Some S implies ¬P), leading to a conclusion that contradicts the initial premise directly, as it implies both M and ¬M for some S.\n   - This contradiction to the initial premise aligns more closely with a logical conflict rather than precisely fitting.\n\n4. **Figure IV (Particular Negative):**\n   - The logical statement ∀P⇒¬M and ∃S⇒M lead to contradictions in attempting to align with any specific mood in Figure IV due to the direct implications mentioned.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical statements ∀P⇒¬M and ∃S⇒M ⇒ ∃S⇒¬P, the closest match would be Figure III and Mood IAI, but due to the contradictions involved with other parts of the argument, it's more correct to conclude that the argument does not align with any of the figures and moods provided.

While this scenario does not directly fit this criteria, as there's a clear cause-and-effect relationship (removing salivary glands leading to faster wound healing), the method's principle of comparing groups under different conditions can be seen in the experimental setup where the two groups (with and without salivary glands) were created.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** focuses on the direct observation of cause-and-effect relationships, where changes in one variable correspond to changes in another.

Object B, in contrast, has fewer attributes: it lacks the attributes a, b, and c.\n3. From the given preconditions (Object A is a book written or edited by Professor Van Emelen and is a gift sent to you), it is logically concluded that Object B, being a book (attribute a), is also a gift from Professor Van Emelen.\n\nTherefore, since Object B is a book (attribute a), it also possesses the other attributes a, b, and c pertaining to Object A. Hence, based on the Ψ Method of reasoning, it is reasonable to conclude that all gifts that Professor Van Emelen sends you might indeed be books that he has written or edited.\n\nThe ⌘ Method, on the other hand, would not be applicable in this scenario because it deals with a situation where Object A has all the desired attributes (a, b, c, d) and Object B lacks these attributes (a, b, c). The ⌘ Method essentially serves to exclude attributes in Object B that are present in Object A, leading to the conclusion that Object B cannot have attribute d, which is contrary to the scenario outlined.\n\nThus, the correct application of the analogical reasoning method in this context is the Ψ Method, and the answer is [[A]].",

This similarity can be expressed as:\n\n- `Pr(S, P1) ≈ Pr(S, P2)`, or in more detail:\n\n    - `Pr(S | Region A, n1) = k1/n1 ≈ Pr(S | Region B, n2) = k2/n2`\n    \nTo denote this symbolically in full:\n\nGiven that `k1 = 90` and `n1 = 100` for Region A, and `k2 = 75` and `n2 = 150` for Region B:\n\n- `Pr(S, k1, n1) ≈ Pr(S, k2, n2)`, or symbolically:\n\n    - `P(S, 90, 100) ≈ P(S, 75, 150)`\n\nThis means that the probability of a person in Region A exercising daily is approximately equal to or similar to the probability of a person in Region B exercising daily, given the sample proportions of individuals who exercise daily.

Here's how:\n\n- A asks if B has tickets, but B provides information about how they acquired the tickets, suggesting that the act of obtaining the tickets was more challenging than B initially stated.
