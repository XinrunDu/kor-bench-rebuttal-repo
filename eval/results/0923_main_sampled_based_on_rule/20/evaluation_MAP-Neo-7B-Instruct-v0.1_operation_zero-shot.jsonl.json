The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.\n   - But, if X = 5, then 3#X = 3#5 is calculated as (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7.\n   - However, based on the rule and the provided value of 4, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation.

We know that a#b includes all even numbers between a and b, and its calculation is to find the average of these numbers.\n2. The question provides X#5 = 3, where X is the lower limit and 5 is the range to include even numbers up to 5.\n3. The equation suggests that the average (arithmetic mean) of all even numbers from X to 5 is 3.\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n\n- The even numbers between X and 5 (inclusive) are X, X+2, X+4, and 5.\n- The mean (average) of these four numbers is (X + (X+2) + (X+4) + 5) / 4 = (3X + 11) / 4.\n- According to the equation X#5 = 3, (3X + 11) / 4 = 3, simplifying this equation, we get 3X + 11 = 12, which leads to 3X = 1 and X = 1/3.\n\nHowever, 1/3 is not a practical or valid integer value for X if we are interpreting the rule as describing a real-number average of even numbers. If we strictly apply this rule between whole numbers, it's more likely the question intended for X to be an integer that falls within the guidelines of the rule (between X and 5 being even numbers and their sum divided by the count of numbers giving an average of 3).\n\nThe closest integers to satisfy the operation rule when considering that the average of these even numbers should be 3:\n\n- For an integer X, when X is between 3 and 5, the even numbers are 4 and 6. Their average is (4 + 6) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5, which isn't the given average of 3.\n- The next set, when X is between 6 and 8, the even numbers are 6 and 8. Their average is (6 + 8) / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7, which also doesn't match the given average of 3.\n\nThe closest integer that satisfies X#5=3 under the given operations and assuming the average of even numbers is to be divided by 4, not 3, is when X = 4, and the numbers are 4, 6, and 8. Thus, the average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6, which is the closest to the target of an average of 3 given the operation rule's extension.\n\nTherefore, based on the adjustment for the average rather than strictly following the \"as given\" formulation, the answer is 4. If strictly adhering to the original rule and adjusting for the average goal of 3, the closest integer answer would involve an average of 3 given the set of numbers from X to 5, and from the calculation, it leads to X = 4 as the closest match under the adjustment.\n\n[[4]] or [[6]], depending on the interpretation (which might be a misunderstanding of the original rule or an attempt to fit the average to the operation's constraints). However, if strictly applying the operation rule without adjustment, the answer is 4. If the average of the even numbers' sum to be achieved is 3, then X would typically be 4 based on the operation rule provided.

This means that we need to calculate \\(0★b\\) according to the rule defined.\n\n   \\[0★b = \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx\\]\n\n   To find this integral, we use the power rule:\n\n   \\[ \\int 2x \\, dx = x^2 \\]\n\n   Applying the limits of integration, we get:\n\n   \\[ \\int_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx = [x^2]_{0}^{b} = b^2 - 0^2 = b^2 \\]\n\n   According to the rule, \\(0★b = b^2\\).
