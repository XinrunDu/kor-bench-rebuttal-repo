Below are the rules for a tricky cipher.\n\n### Preparation:\n\n- On a 6 by 6 matrix, use the first 36 letters of the English alphabet in order to fill in each square, as shown below. The first 30 letters of the alphabet is used in this way. Where do the letters go and why?  What is your line of reasoning?\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n-  In each row and each column, exactly one square should contain a letter. \n    - Start with the first letter of the alphabet, and then find, in some order, one empty square from the first row, one empty square from the second row, and so on. Place the next letter of the alphabet in this square. This way, the next letter to placed must fit into every row, but in only one of six possible columns. \n    - Repeat until the matrix is completely filled. If for some reason the last letter cannot be placed. It's because of an error in the original design. Problem: If we want the matrix to behave like a Latin square, is there a way to fix the error?\n- Write your complete matrix here, including the six letters that go in the empty squares:\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n- Write the six unused letters of the English alphabet, in ascending order, and explain your reasoning:\n    - \n- For now focus on the 30 used letters of the English alphabet. Assigning a number to each row and column is a common method in ciphers. Select the most often use number system? Write a short justification for your reasoning?\n    - \n- Referring to this matrix, look through this question. Where can we make a strategic substitution without changing the meaning? If a particular substitution has no effect on the present situation, can we infer that the given sentence provides no corroboration for the presence of the character in question?\n- Can you construct a complete translation so that this question could be asked of a human assistant? What level of education would this employee have had?\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        - 4 Signpost\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character ** or one or three other characters in its group** in the 6x6 matrix. \n        - Define Latin square.\n        - **Attempt a simple substitution, randomly swapping two other groups and/or two characters other in the same group**\n        - If the resulting message is visually appealing, please submit as message and specify the swap. Otherwise develop a key to further simple substitution, such as the position of the digit at the end of the number\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is **flagged as 0-6.** \n        \n            - Example: if each character is represented by a superscript, 046253185 is the correct key.\n        \n        - Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary. \n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix",
