Read and understand the given question. \n2. Break down complex fractions if necessary (such as breaking down a fraction into its simplest form). \n3. Solve for unknown variables using algebraic equations if necessary (such as solving for an unknown variable in a fraction). Priority should always be given to simplifying complex expressions before solving for any unknowns. \n4. Simplify the final answer to its simplest form and wrap it in square brackets, as shown below. [[Your Answer]]. If no additional explanations are required for your answers, then simply provide the simplified value inside the brackets. For instance, if the question is \"Solve for x in 3x/7 = 9,\" the correct answer would be [[3]] . However, if the question requires more detailed explanations regarding how you arrived at the correct answer, then please include those details within the brackets. For example, if the same question was phrased differently, such as \"Explain how to solve for x in 3x/7 = 9,\" the correct answer may look like this instead: [[3. Inside the bracket, explain each step of the process used to arrive at the final result, along with any relevant calculations]]. \n5. Check your work carefully and ensure that the final answer is accurate and clearly expressed. \n6. Once you are confident about your solution, hit submit.",
