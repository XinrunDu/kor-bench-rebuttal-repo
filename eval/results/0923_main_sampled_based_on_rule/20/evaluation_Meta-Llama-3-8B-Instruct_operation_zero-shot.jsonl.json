The integral ∫(0)^(1) 2x dx is equal to 1, and the integral ∫(1)^(b) 2x dx is equal to b^2 - 1. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n0 = b(1) + (b^2 - 1)\n0 = b + b^2 - 1\n0 = b^2 + b - 1\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using various methods. One method is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nb = [-(-1) ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1))] / 2(1)\n= [1 ± √(1 + 4)]/2\n= [1 ± √5]/2\n\nb1 = [1 + √5]/2\nb2 = [1 - √5]/2\n\nSo, the answers are:\n\n[[[(1+√5)/2] or [(1-√5)/2]]]\n\nNote that there are two possible values for b, which are the two solutions to the quadratic equation.",
