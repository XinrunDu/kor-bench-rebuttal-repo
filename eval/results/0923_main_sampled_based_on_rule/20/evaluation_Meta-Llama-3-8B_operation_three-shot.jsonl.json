Once you have entered the coordinates you'll type in a 5 letter code (Opposite, Adjacent, <<HALF>>, or .√ <<ROOT>>). The code that you entered is interpreted as a transformation matrix that is applied to all the coordinates that you typed in. The transformation is made only once before the matrices are printed out.\n\n### Note:\n\n• Since there is only one question for this exercise, there is no answer selection button at the end of the question.

Enter the coordinates of the three-dimensional (3D) vector C:\nPlease type in numerical numbers, rounding them to 2 decimal places if necessary. Please use the minus sign for negative entries. The answer should be entered in the form [[your answer]].\n\n### Step 2. Enter the coordinates of the two-dimensional (2D) vector D:\nPlease type in numerical numbers, rounding them to 2 decimal places if necessary. Please use the minus sign for negative entries.

Students receive a free slice of pizza if they sign up for a certain on-campus activity. If a student signs up for n activities, she(he) will receive n slices of pizza for free. Additionally, the school cafeteria has a very special way of pricing the pizzas. For each hundreds of the i-th(s) time the activity is signed up for, the thousandths digit is \"i\" + \"1\" = (i + 1). The ten-thousandths digit stays constant and is equal to 0. Just as an example, if Jenny signs up for that certain on-campus activity for the fifteenth time, then she will receive 15 slices of pizza for free, and the price of the pizza will be \\$15.16. Your friend Zoe has been storing all the activities she participates in an array in the form of {numberOfSlices: 0, price: 0}. As Zoe signs up for an additional activity, she will remove the elements of the old activity and add to the array a new element {numberOfSlices: (numberOfSlices + 1), price: (price + (uint(i) * 0.01)}  How will Zoe implement her algorithm to make sure that the array {numberOfSlices: 1, price: 1.00} is a valid element array and 1.0 >= zoeAssociation[numberOfSlices] >= 0.0  Implement your code snippet. The following code attempts to use a localStorage data object for a sample because the array is not built with ngimal. Be careful while using the localStorage data object. This will change the overall look and feel of your application. However, it can help you maintain scalability. var elemnet = {}; if(typeof(zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices) === \"undefined\") {  element.numberOfSlices = 0;  element.price = 1.00  } else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer - 1)' + i;  } localStorage.setItem(\"element1\", JSON.stringify(defaultPull));  Finally, in the ng-click event in your main controller, add the following code, which will execute the necessary functions. 1 modifyController($rootScope, $index, $scope, $translate, ngAlert, $myModal, $http, $window, $location, $sce, $parse, $loc, $anchorScroll) {  $scope.zoeFuture = function(zoeAssociation) {  var elemnet = {};  var array = [5,5,6,0];  var zoeAssociation = '2';  if(array) {  if(typeof(zoeAssociation.zoeFuture) === \"undefined\") {  }  else {  element.numberOfSlices = zoeAssociation.numberOfSlices + 1;  var digitsAfterDecimal = zoeAssociation.price * 100;  var hundredsDigit = (digitsAfterDecimal / 100);  var i = parseInt(hundredsDigit)+1;  element.price = (zbearer",

We created this example to allow you to practice formulating and determining the answer to the question using the rule in a realistic setting.\nBecause the operation rules in this exercise weren't initially easy for machines to learn, we trained machine learning systems with millions of data points and thousands of hours of compute time to improve their accuracy in evaluating this question.\nHow relevant is this code?\nOur client asked for a machine that could accurately evaluate an example involving the @ operation for the operation rule.\nWhile the rule isn't prevalent in financial software today, our client runs thousands of questions every day in their live financial software to track the effectiveness and development of their skilled employees and to better understand how professional programmers think about the material.\n\nThe neural network behind the code is the learner of the Mat index. It was trained to predict the prices of S&P 500 stocks over years, given past and current economic indicators. However, it focuses on learning the core for this question, and not the prediction of the S&P 500 prices. For this reason, the neural network is 'tuned to the example'.\n",
