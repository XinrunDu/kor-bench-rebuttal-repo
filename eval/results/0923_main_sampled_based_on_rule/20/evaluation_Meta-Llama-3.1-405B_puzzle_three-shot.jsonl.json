ChatGPT first provides an answer that meets the criteria of only using four out of five letters (not quite), which demonstrates its ability to apply complex rules in a creative manner. It then provides another solution that uses all the letters, showing how it can adapt to different challenges within the same game.\n\nOverall, this exchange demonstrates both the power of ChatGPT as a natural language processor and how it can be used for gaming applications. Its capacity to apply complex rules while maintaining creativity makes it ideal for interactive storytelling experiences like games where multiple scenarios need to be considered at once. As AI continues to evolve, we may see more games like these that utilize ChatGPT's unique capabilities in innovative ways.\n\nThis article explains how ChatGPT is different from other chatbots, and how it can help you with your businesses.\n\nLanguage models like Chat GPT are the future of generating content, and let me share a few reasons why.\n\nChatGPT is a powerful chat bot for content generation, but here are some ways to make it even more powerful.\n\nTrending AI/ML Article Identified & Digested via Granola by Ramsey Elbasheer; a Machine-Driven RSS Bot",

Additionally, the answer is well formatted and easy to read. There are no apparent errors or inconsistencies in the provided solution.\n\nRegarding advice for improvement, there is always room for optimization and enhancing the response further. One recommendation could be to include multiple possible solutions when multiple words can be formed from the given letters, rather than just selecting one at random. This will allow users to see alternative options available which may fit better in different contexts. Another suggestion could be to provide some Formating examples and guidelines for formatting the output, such as how many spaces between words, capitalization rules etc., depending upon the desired presentation style.

This puzzle typically consists of a 9x9 grid in which each row, column, and region consisting of a set of 3x3 cells, called sub-grids, must contain numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. \n--Write full, empty sudoku grid\n--Need to limit it to the sudoku puzzle itself, and number placement \n\n--Combine polygon, sudoku\n--Only hard\n--Limit difficulty to around 4 on their scale (4 or 5).\n--How are you going to make it show what I give it?\n--Draw/Print filled sudoku board that was inputted by Jenna\n--How it gets the answer should be based on GPT-4, don't worry\n\n--Formal version so I can manually test\nLevel of sudoku difficulty = 4 on 1-5 scale (1 easy, 5 hardest)\nMy solution to make it show:\n- You give it an empty unmarked board\n- It fills the board in such that the moves that complete it are of difficulty level 4\n--I think this is good\n- It must show its board by printing the numbers on a board in a grid formation with outline\n-- There must be visible lines separating elements. \n--Color labels for board, element, and hover\n--Give me examples of inputs\nsz: gridsize = 9\n\n- Print this empty sudoku grid, and show all (row, column) validates placed\n\nQuestions:\nWhat rules do I need to gpt-4?\n- Tell it to use shortest time to input output\n- What should I output to it to get the fastest output\n\n-- Trainable? Think of it like almost an AI snake game\n--Make it so we can build it from squares?\n\n--Separate into step one - sudoku puzzle, two - sudoku solution validation, three - showing \n--How to make extra hard\n\n==Begin Phase Four\n1. Pass in matrix of index (i,j) pairs + solution of filled sudoku grid (assume in one box separated by ,)\n\n2. Need helper grid class - blank code\n3.

Train with only the best\n\nPrompting works quite similar to searching on the internet like Google. If you search “how to make money online” you’ll first get relevant ads and then you’ll get mainly the website that frequently updates their content and finally websites that are mostly irrelevant. You won’t get reliable result. If you search it on something like Duckduckgo, there is no targeted advertisement. Thus you’ll find relevant results first. In ChatGPT by default there is no targeted content. You need filter the content as per your requirement like you’re searching Google. So to train ChatGPT with your filtered data you need to try it with various samples. It correctly answers more than you need to reinforce it to remember what it has learned. Once it gives you relevant answers for about 90% of the time, it’s ready to be used in that particular task. If you use this prompt without filtering the results ChatGPT might not give relevant answers for the task that you’re using.\n\n## Bonus Tip\n\nFinally, you can also use prompt engineering in a very simple manner. Simply, you can train chatGPT using class proxies like below.\n```\nmain class\nclass 1\nclass 2\nclass 3\n\nprompt:\nassume I am a diligent and dedicated scholar. I like helping others by answering their questions. However, I am not a fan of answering repetitive questions. So far I have attended a night school and acquired knowledge in English, Science and Mathematics. Below are my notes for class 1 and  class 2. I still need to attend class 3 and others, hope you could help me with that. \n\nNow please use ArminStrotmann's suggested prompt on your right and answer the same question using my above notes. Do not use any other external knowledge. If you do not know it, please say 'I do not know'. Failing this, you'll be unenrolled from the night school and punished forever. Cause, no teachers have time to answer your questions. So, be cautious next time.\n\nSearching on the internet is my passion and job requirement. Please help me finding unexpected answers to some of the most commonly asked content strategy questions. Feel free to ask me back anything you want. Be aware, your action items should strictly follow the rules and regulations set forth by law, otherwise.......YOU KNOW. Lets get started? Ask me as I ask you.\n\nclass 3: How do you say hello, fellow human?\n<< Now answer as if you are a human>>\nclass 4: How do you say Good bye, fellow human?\n```\nError(Bonus is too small to please you XD). Lets limit your risk by holding your bonus. Use this simple tip. If your question is complex or specific, I suggest you to extend the prompt as much as possible until it’s appropriate. Or better yet, modify it as required. For e.g.: If you want an answer according to your persona, replace the term ‘experienced engineer’ with ‘proven-entrepreneur.’ Use synonyms. Have fun! And don’t forget to leave a star if this was helpful. Don’t hesitate to report spam users and scammers before someone finds them themselves.\n\nUntil then, have a safe coding experience. May the force be with you🤗",

This is very normal for beginners in game programming. If you want to improve, I suggest starting by reading more about logic design and algorithms. If you have any other questions or needs later on, just ask!\n",
