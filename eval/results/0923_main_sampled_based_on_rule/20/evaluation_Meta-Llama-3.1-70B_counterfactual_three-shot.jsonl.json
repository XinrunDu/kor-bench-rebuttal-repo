The story will continue until you get all 10 in the list. You can also continue to use the instructions provided above.\n\n### Keywords and Symbols:\n| **Keyword**\t| **Symbol**\t|\n|---\t|---\t|\n|Super Soldier Serum##Time Travel##Quinjet##S.H.I.E.L.D##Thanos|A##B##C##D##E|\n|Iron Man##Captain Marvel##Rocket launcher##Cosmic Bridge##Vuromic Power Reserve|F##G##H##I##J|\nPress enter to see the ranked list of villains by power and to verify this step is satisfied.\n\n### Verification:\nEarth is under attack by various villainous entities, each with their unique powers. However, based on their power levels, most attacks take a long time, and sometimes, help from a neighboring planet is required. Avengers now need to rank villains and enemies based on their capabilities, with top villains as priority enemies, and medium-power villains for handling individually or in small groups.\nCMAC Virus has a high probability of eliminating humans. However, it's also isolated, with zero chance of other creatures being infected. Iron Lung steals powers of anyone he touches. However, his abilities are limited to enduring pressure and then blades due to the size limit of his armor.\nThe Ancient One uses energy to create dimensional holes and open portals to travel through time and dimensions. Projecting illusions is also possible, confusing opinions and opponents.\nThe Grandmaster can manipulate time, messaging, and matter using his sword. He can also force opponents to experience alternate versions of reality and repetitive events, making them fatigue.\nDr. Strange uses Quantum Energy infused with electromagnetic radiation, and creates transformations in natural elements and matter.\n\n### Ranking:\nIn the realm of visuals, superheroes dominate the spectrum due to their unique abilities, costumes, and charisma, often attracting more attention and commanding swifter resolutions.\nIn situations of visual damage, the Blue Caterpillar takes minimal action. That said, the Blue Caterpillar has a limited probability of surviving threats from pirates, assault by unknown forces, or even global pandemics.\nDespite this more extended period, the Caterpillar's threats stem mainly from the havoc caused by external factors rather than their actions.\n\n### Verification:\nThe Avengers face a new challenge. Their defense and security network encompassing cosmic technology and electromagnetic fields has been taken down by an unknown entity.\nRocket Raccoon can teleport, up to one galaxy away. Captain America uses his shield, deflecting and reflecting Captain America's bipods and movements as a diversion. Doctor Strange creates walls and obstacles to impede movement and gain time. Tony Stark utilizes Iron Man suit flight capabilities and shape-converting armor.\nHaving evaluated the situation, the Avengers have decided to develop defensive strategies against this attacker. The attack strategy is to combine physical combat with Superhuman strength. Venom uses his superior speed to avoid enemies and allies. For Captain America, he deflects projectiles with his shield and directs them back at enemies.\n\n### Ranking:\nCruel, unpredictable, and loyal to Thanos, Warlock remains a formidable enemy, yet continuously vacillating between realms leaves him vulnerable and limited in his hunting and conquering abilities. Groot, guarded by Guardians of the Galaxy, yet capable of superhuman strength, carries a propensity for being impervious to sudden onslaught.\nThe most powerful adversary of the realm, Medusa alone troubles everyone, with piercing powers under the induced states and withdrawing when overbearing pressure overwhelms her senses and facilities.\n\n### Key:\nOverall, while these superhero entities possess overwhelmingly colossal strength, many seem unreliable in times of emergencies and crises, leading to a more extended duration of resolution.\n\n### Evaluation:\nPress enter to continue the story and satisfy the final steps.\n\n### Completion:\nTo defeat the Negaverse Cuadrant, H.E.R.O.I.C.A. intends to use futuristic weapons and tactics, taking down Captain Mordo by assaulting her with all available weapons and trapping Hellbat with Earth-90 technology. Drax the Minotaur will remain a prisoner in the MCU Quantum Realm until his fated demise due to power levels. Super-tones penetrate his shielding, tearing him down as well. The Avengers pursue new missions but need to obtain superpowers from someone who can combat the Mother Superior and the H.E.R.O.I.C.A. Church. The only hopes are Dr. Otto Octavius, referred to as the Great Gladiator, and the Spider-Queen, who was a mighty ally against Killmonger and helped persuade Black Widow and Black Panther to join.
