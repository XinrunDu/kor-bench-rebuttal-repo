To calculate 7♀3, we add 7+3=10 and then divide it by 2, resulting in 7♀3=5.\n\n### In the new rule, what does 3♀8 equal?\nUsing the rule for a♀b=(a+b)/2, we compute 3♀8 as follows:\n3♀8 = (3+8)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5, rounded to one decimal place.\n\n### How can I apply the custom operations accurately?\nJust follow each rule and calculate according to the given symbols. For example, if the question asks to calculate 5△9, and the rule is a△b=(a+b)/2, replace a by 5 and b by 9, and follow the rule by doing (5+9)/2.\n\n### What is the rule for the custom operation a♂b in the new rule when given that a▲b=(3×b)+10?\nThe rule for a♂b in the new rule is a×4+b. To calculate 5♂11, we multiply 5×4=20 and then add 11, resulting in 5♂11=31.\n\n### For a custom operation a△b where a△b=(a+b)/2, if (X△4)○6=34, what is X?\nStart by solving what X△4 equals:(X+4)/2=...$x + 4/2 = \\dots olab x+4=2\\dots lab x=\\doubut \\dots-4 lab x=...-4 lab x=12 labBased on this, X♂12 can then be solved using the operation rule (a×4+b), which should give you the final answer.Answer validation:20\n\n## FAQ (continued)\n\n### What are the rules for a△b (in the new rule) and a○b (in the new rule)?\nThe rule for a△b in the new rule is (a+b)/2. The rule for a○b in the new rule is a×4+b. For example, if a=5 and b=20, a♂b=(a+b)/2, which is (5+20)/2, giving 12.5.\n\n### How do I compute 7△6 when given that a△b=(a+b)/2?\nRefer to the rule to compute 7△6:\n7△6 = (7+6)/2 = 13/2 = 6.5.\n\n### What are some examples of operations with these custom rules after ignoring the previous rule?\nFor a△b=(a+b)/2, some examples could be: 3♂1=(3+1)/2=2, 8♀6=(8+6)/2=7.\n\n### What are the steps to calculate 5△(3♀8) according to the rule a△b=(a+b)/2?\nFirst, evaluate the operations within parantheses, following the given rules. There are no operations within parantheses. Next, apply the operation a△b=(a+b)/2 to the result. Therefore, 5△(3♀8)=(8/2)+(3♀8)=4+(3♀8)=4+7=11.\n\n### How do I correctly apply the operations for a♀b and a△b?\nYou should follow the given rules and do the math accordingly. For instance, if we have to calculate 3△(8♀6), we first start by doing 8♀6=14/2=7. Then, we take that result and put it into 3△7, giving us (3+7)/2=5.\n",

It is a method of finding functions whose derivatives are given. The integral of a function f(x) over an interval [a,b] is defined as the area under the curve f(x) on that interval. Integration has many practical applications in mathematics, physics, engineering etc.\n\n---\n\nCan you give few practical applications examples of Integration?\n\n### Answer:\n\nSure! Few practical examples of integration are:\n\n1. Calculating the area under a curve\n2. Finding the Volume of Solids\n3. Evaluating Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs)\n4. Solving Differential Equations\n5. Calculating Electrostatic Fields\n6. Computing Newtonian Mechanics Problems\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.\n\n---\n\nCan you explain to me how to evaluate triple integral?\n\n### Answer:\n\nTriple integrals calculate volume within a three-dimensional region. The general form of a triple integral is:\n\n∫∫∫fdV where f(x,y,z) is the function being integrated over the volume V.\n\nTo evaluate a triple integral, we usually need to change variables to simplify the integration process. To change variables, we use different coordinate systems such as spherical, cylindrical or Cartesian coordinates.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/JkGdhM8/image.jpg)\n\nFor instance, converting from Cartesian to spherical coordinates requires:\n\nr = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\ntheta = atan2(y, x)\nphi = asin(z/sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2))\n\nOnce the change of variables has been applied, the following relationships hold between each system:\n\ndx = dV/dr\ndy = dV/dtheta\ndz = dV/dphi\n\n\nThis means that after applying the change of variables, the triple integral becomes:\n\n∫∫∫r^2 sin(theta)fdV Where f is still a function of r,theta and phi.\n\n\nNow we just have to calculate the limits of integration based off of our new coordinates. In order to fully define the space over which to integrate, we will assume spherical symmetry. This implies that the space we wish to integrate over takes the shape of a sphere. Therefore our limits of integration will look something like this:\n\n1/r max < r < r max\n0 < theta < 2pi\n0 < phi < pi\n\n\nWhere rmax is simply the radius of our sphere.\n\nUsing these limits, we can now attempt to evaluate the integral. Note however that depending on the specific nature of the problem, additional computations may be necessary. If",
