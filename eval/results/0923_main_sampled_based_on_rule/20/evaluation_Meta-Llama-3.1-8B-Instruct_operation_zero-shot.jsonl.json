        "response": "To solve the expression 19※28※4※(104※13), we need to follow the defined operation rule step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute 104※13\n\nBoth 104 and 13 are integers. We first check if one is a multiple of the other. Since 104 is a multiple of 13 (104 = 8*13), we use the first part of the rule:\na/b + 2\nn/a = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, 104※13 = 10\n\nStep 2: Now, the expression becomes 19※28※4※10\n\nStep 3: Compute 19※28\n\nBoth 19 and 28 are integers. We first check if one is a multiple of the other. Since 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19, we use the third part of the rule:\n24\n\nSo, 19※28 = 24\n\nStep 4: The expression now is 24※4※10\n\nStep 5: Compute 24※4\n\nBoth 24 and 4 are integers. We first check if one is a multiple of the other. Since 24 is a multiple of 4 (24 = 6*4), we use the first part of the rule:\na/b + 2\nn/a = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 24※4 = 8\n\nStep 6: The expression now is 8※10\n\nStep 7: Compute 8※10\n\nBoth 8 and 10 are integers. We first check if one is a multiple of the other. Since 8 is not a multiple of 10 and 10 is not a multiple of 8, we use the third part of the rule:\n24\n\nSo, 8※10 = 24\n\nTherefore, the result of 19※28※4※(104※13) is 24\n\nThe final answer is: [[24]]",

Only when X and 10 is in the § operation it's always the larger of the X and 10. However, we do not know if X > 10 as it might not be a larger of X and 10. As such using operation § here works fine but  X must be greater than or equal to 10 (as it has to be in operation § from the problem constraints X § 10 hence X must be largest number i.e, 10), ideally, it should be ≥ to give X $10 as well.\nNow let's simplify X must be >= 10 when X is operated with § from the equation X  § 10 equals 10.\n\n\n\nThe final inequality for the value of X would be  [ [X ≥ 10] ].\n \nHope this solution is correct and clearly explained.",
