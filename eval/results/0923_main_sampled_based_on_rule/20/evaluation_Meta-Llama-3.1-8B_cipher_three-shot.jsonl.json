Which of the following statements apply to the initial sequence of cards in part one?\n\n- Keystream values are fixed for each letter.\n- the-bottom card determines the difference between the values of the current and next keystream values.\n- the top card determines the difference between the values of the current and next keystream values.\n- the next card determines the difference between the values of the current and next keystream values.\n- the first card in the sequence of cards will have 0 value.\n- the second card in the sequence of cards will have 0 value.\n- the second card in the sequence of cards will have 1 value.\n- For a given letter all letters in the cipher text will have the same properties.\n\n### Answer:\n1,2,4,5.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following statements relate to the decryption process of this cipher?\n\n- The sequence of cards always stays constant.\n- There is always a bijection between a plaintext and a cipher text (and vice versa) according to the Letter-answer table.\n- For each letter in the plaintext there is always one unique letter in the cipher text (and vice versa).\n- The sequence of cards must correspond for encryption and decryption.\n- The order of operations is the same for encryption and decryption.\n- The Letter-answer correspondence must change for encryption and decryption, respectively.\n\n### Answer:\n1,2,3,4\n",

Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule\n### Encryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n   - M Z S D P\n   - K N F L Q\n   - G A O X U\n   - W R Y V C\n   - B T E H I\n\t - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n\t - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n  - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n    - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n    - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n    - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n  - Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n\n### Decryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n    - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n    - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n    - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n    - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n  - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n\n\n## Question\nPlaintext: \"CU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
