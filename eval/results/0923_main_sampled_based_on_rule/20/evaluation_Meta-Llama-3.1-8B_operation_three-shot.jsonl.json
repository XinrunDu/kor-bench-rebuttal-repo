What do you think ? B & A (or B' . A' )\n\n-- Chet ( 2020-09-06 16:49:36 -0400 )edit\nThis is a new set of questions. The answers should all be calculated by applying the operation rule in the instructions. . Could you be more specific about what you mean ? What exactly is the relationship of the question numbers in the instructions and answers ? -48 to -65, for example.\n-- myname ( 2020-09-07 02:56:03 -0400 )edit\n\nThat's true, but it will allow you to simplify further operations to a single matrix.\n\nTo simplify , it is not necessary to start with the results of B & A and apply B' . A' arguments. In fact, this only / complicate .\n\nThe simplifications would be: 1) receive the results of A & B + A & B; 2) perform a division by two operations: a A & B. So, yes, you have a square shrink, but let's see if that is required to solve the proposed question . In my opinion, it's something that this is not a pre-determined rule to solve specific questions . My opinion: 3) If we name the calculated A & B: Y= A & B. If we want to calculate Y + Y: then Y = 2 & Y = A & B).\n\nMy opinion is that the calculations are more personal and likely to adapt what works best, without following a set of rules as a mathematical component 3 and so on. So I criticize the proposed questions.\n\n-- Chet ( 2020-09-07 14:58:35 -0400 )edit\n\nIt’s good to simplify operations for efficiency, but here the problem is not about efficiency but about testing understanding regarding the specific new rules of operation. The problem is not an exercise in finding efficient ways to perform the operations. The problems are not limited to those that can be efficiently solved in the best way ie using least computational resources. They are designed to test your understanding of the new method of calculating custom operations. \n-- myname (2020-09-13 11:47:06 -0400)\n\n",

Let's consider a list of numbers Li = {ar^b}.\nAssume all the numbers in list Li have enough digit s(n) in total and the lists Hi = {a,z^b} satisfy Li = [Zi/Z1]Hi,[Zi = 10^(s/2), Z2,Z3 do not change].\nYou need to find Z2*s(Z1/Z2) where '*' is the last operation of Hi. s is the length of the integer Z2 and Z1* is the integer part of Z1.\n\n### Hint\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n[[Z2*s(Z1/Z2)]].\n\n### Example:\nLi={12^1,4^1,9^1}.\n\n### Example2:\nLi={6^3,2^2,3^4}.\n\n### Example3:\nLi = {6^8, 2^12, 3^2}\n\n### Answer:\n[[111]]\n\n### Question:\nThere are two kinds of numbers, we called them base-n numbers (0<n<10) and natural numbers.\nBase-n numbers just have n digits, and the first digit cant be zero. For example, 130 is a base-3 number.\nThe goal is to divide natural numbers into two groups - those which prove the formula A(n) smaller than B(n) are proven by examples only, and those which prove the formula but are proven by neither examples only nor formulas.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Example:\nLet m and n be bases of numbers, m, n<=5.\nWe say n<n is True when (m, n)=TRUE. n<n is get from the following rule. Lets say the sum and product of two numbers are a sum number, S(m)(a) and p(m)(a) respectively, and sum and product of two sum numbers are then S(m)(S(a)(b), p(m)(ab)) and P(m)(S(a)(b), p(m)(ab)).\nn are:\n\n|number | 1   | 12  | 123| 1235| 12345|  \n|------|-----|------|-----|------|------|  \n|S(m)(a)| 3   |45   |867        |131695215         |87728615372163714385440       |    \n|p(m)(a)| 4   |24  |578        |-402603715599       |-1464623360928527362         |    \n\nThen (5<1). *** is getting from next rule. As (5<1) is True, then the formula is only gotten by examples.]\n\n### DATA\ncategory_list:\n- category: {key:ids(ib042), value:{main:成功學習，一部必看， title:成功學習，一部必看， desc:成功學習，一部必看， info:戈登史塔克，很奼元遇此文煩の注册加分 आकर्षक且特喳控煙.〈評〉當國也得抽那來挖掘奼元遇此文煩扏i適眞e.值得經此文煩講估量}}\n- category: {key:ids(ib043), value:{main:成功學習，一部必看， title:成功學習，一部必看， desc:成功學習，一部必看， info:戈登史塔克，很奼元遇此文煩の注册加分}}\n- category: {key:ids(ib044), value:{main:Akinori, title:习,''提示%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80个火箭发射精密日期网络游戏. info:讯都洋，达斯维达练手盅底地名：FET4 是否胜利进入地指传播?!☁ 可能你才叙述.
