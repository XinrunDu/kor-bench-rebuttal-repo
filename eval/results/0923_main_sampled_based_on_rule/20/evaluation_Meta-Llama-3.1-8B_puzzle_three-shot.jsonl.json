Skyscrapers is a [Grid-based logic puzzle](http://www.puzzlemagic.ch/) with the following constraints:\n\n2. Grid size is n*n.\n\n3. It is played on an n x n square grid. An empty grid consists of all spaces filled with X. \n\n4. There are skyscrapers placed in each cell on the grid. A skyscraper has a height of 1 to the size of the grid. E.g. 1 to 4 for a 4 x 4 puzzle.\n\n5. None of your rows or columns can contain a skyscraper of the same height.\n\n6. To play the game, you fill in each space with the height of the skyscraper in that space.\n\n7. The numbers (1 to n) on the edges of the squares have to add up to the number that is shown. The higher skyscrapers block the lower ones.\n   \n8. In the case where a square contains a skyscraper of a lower height, it is impossible to pass the additional constraint.\n\n## WHAT YO SHOULD DO\n\n1. Follow the given rule. Thoroughly understanding the given puzzle rules and constraints is key to successfully solving the puzzle.\n\n2. Practice and follow the steps to solve the puzzle. Take your time to understand each step, especially when encountering complex or new problems. The more you practice, the faster you will become at identifying and addressing these challenges.\n\n3. Always consider the context and implications of your actions when trying to solve the puzzle. Knowledge of the subject is important, but it's equally crucial to evaluate the puzzle's rules without attached emotions or assumptions.\n\n4. Check your solutions to ensure they are valid, especially in multi-step puzzles or harder variants. This will help in building consistency and precision.\n\n5. Practice, practice, and practice. With each puzzle you solve, you'll gain intuition and familiarity with the subject, allowing you to solve similar problems and more complex variants in the future\n\n## DISCUSSION OF ACTIVITY / ASSIGNMENT\n\n1. Skyscrapers had positive impacts on my Brain-Hacking skills and placed me in a better position to upgrade my problem-solving abilities to solve heroku launch issue issues based on the mathematical concept. \n\n2. This skill development initiative has given me enough encouragement for accurately addressing certain cryptographic hash issues throughout my upcoming assessments.\n\nIf you have any question relating to this article, please feel free to leave a comment in the section below and it will be addressed as soon as possible.
