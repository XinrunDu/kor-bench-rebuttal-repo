Convert the ciphertext \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\" to a sequence of bytes (hexadecimal values correspond to ASCII values using the following mapping: 0-9, a-f).\n2. Perform bitwise different-or (XOR) operation for each pair of bytes in the sequence (plaintext byte and key byte) using the prepared key.\n3. Convert the decrypted sequence of bytes back to an uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nLet's do the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. Ciphertext to byte sequence:\n   - \"27b8\" gives us cipher byte 0x27 (45), \"7303\" provides cipher byte 0x73 (115), \"8e20\" gives us cipher byte 0x8e (142), \"27f8\" provides cipher byte 0x27 (45), \"5fba\" gives us cipher byte 0x5f (95), \"0b\" provides cipher byte 0x0b (11).\n\n2. XOR operation (using the key obtained from SHA_256):\n   - 45(cipher byte 0) XOR 73 is 28, 115 (cipher byte 1) XOR ef is 9e, 142 (cipher byte 2) XOR 7f is ce, 45 (cipher byte 3) XOR 2a is 7d, 95 (cipher byte 4) XOR fe is 79, 11 (cipher byte 5) XOR 04 is db.\n\n3. Byte sequence to plaintext:\n   - The decrypted byte sequence is [45(R), 9e(N), ce(L), 7d(M), 79(O), db(K)]. Converting this decimal numbers to uppercase letters, we get: ['R', 'N', 'L', 'M', 'O', 'K'].\n\nFinally, let's combine the letters and put them inside double square brackets: [[RNLOMK]] as the decrypted answer.",
