Using the priority of logical connectives, we first unpack the innermost negations: p1 and p2 or not p3. Since p3 is a single proposition, it is a Level A formula. The compound proposition (p1 and p2) is a Level B formula. The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and ✓|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false). All other combinations result in false assignments.\n\n2. ((~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)) has the following structure: (not p2 or p3) and (if p1 then p2). Both p2||p3 and p1=::>p2 are Level B formulas, making the whole formula a Level C formula. Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the only satisfying assignments are ✓|✓|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are true, resulting in the whole formula being true. All other combinations result in false assignments.\n\n3. ((p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)) has the following structure: (if p1 then p2) and ((not (p1 and p3)) or p1). Both p1=::>p2 and ~(p1&p3)||p1 are Level B formulas, making the whole formula a Level C formula. Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the only satisfying assignments are ✓|x when p1 is true and p2 is false (making p1=::>p2 false), and p3 is false (making ~(p1&p3) when p1 is true true).

Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p ∨ q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p ∨ ¬q): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q ∨ ¬r): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}.\n\n2. Initialize S0 and S2 as empty sets:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S2 = ∅\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S0 (empty) and (p ∨ q) from S1: dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = p (since we have p from both (p ∨ q) clauses).

Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = p, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = 0.
