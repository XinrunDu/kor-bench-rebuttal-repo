Neither 19 nor 28 is a multiple of the other.\n2. Next, let's calculate 19※28 based on the given rule: Since 19 is not a multiple of 28, we have 19 apartments (a) and 28 buildings (b). According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n3. Now, let's combine 19 apparently 28 with the next operation 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 28 (or 19), their operation results in 24. These results can be written as (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp = 24.\n\n4. Then, let's perform the stamped operation with 104 and 13. Because 104 is a multiple of 13, we have 104 houses (a) and 13 apartments complexes (b). According to the rule, achts (104 houses) apt (13 apartments complexes) = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 apartments complexes.\n\n5. Finally, let's perform the last stamp operation with the new result (10 apartments complexes) and 4. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, their operation results in 24. We can write this as (10 apartments complexes) estamp (4 units) = 24.\n\n6. Combining all the results from the stamp operations gives us the final answer: (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp (4 units)  stamp (104 houses  apartments complexes) = 24 × 24 = [[576]].\n\nThe answer is [[576]].",

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]].",

Therefore, we simply evaluate x^2 at b and compare it with the integrand evaluated at zero (which is zero because the intergral starts at 0).\n\n0 = b^2 - 0^2\nb^2 = 0\nb = 0\n\nHowever, as it is a meaningless solution, check if there are any other values for b that satisfy the equation:\n\nLet's assume that there exists a b such that 0★b = b. Then,\n\n0 = b - \\int_0^b 2x \\, dx\n\nLet's solve for b:\n\n0 = b - [x^2] evaluated from 0 to b\n0 = b - (b^2 - 0)\nb^2 = b\nb^2 - b = 0\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nSo, there are two possible solutions for b: b = 0 or b = 1.\nAs b = 0 does not satisfy the condition of the question, the only solution that works is b = 1.\n\nSo, the answer is [[1]].",
