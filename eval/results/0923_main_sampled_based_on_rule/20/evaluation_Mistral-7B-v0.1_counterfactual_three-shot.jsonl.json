The civil war that happened between Autobots led by Optimus Prime and Decepticons led by Megatron involved civilian vehicles and military vehicles respectively. Therefore, we need to choose [[A]] as the answer here.\nQ2:  The correct answer is option 'B'. The second-in-command or subordinate to the leader in the Autobots is the Commander. However, keep in mind that other terminology can refer to this role as well such as first-in-command in theory, second-in-command in practice, and many others. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ3: The correct answer is option 'C'. The only concrete way to give life back is, for example, the Allspark, which is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ4: The correct answer is option 'B'. The Matrix of Leadership, commonly referred to as the Allspark or the Transformers, is the heart and soul of all Transformers. They are known as \"T-Coils\" in the Transformers universe and are attached to each Autobot. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ5: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. The Transformers universe concept includes an alien planet called Cybertron, a group of Autobots, larger-than-life Transformers, and vehicles capable of transforming. It does not include improving life outcomes as an option. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ6: The correct answer is option 'C'. Beat Box is the leader of the Attack Squad. Beat Box: Autobot, seated, leader of the society Autobot Attack Squad, animated series. He is a goon with a cricket bat who lives in a cabin in the woods. His species was a criminal. Beat Box: Autobot, sounded, leader of the society Autobot Attack Squad, animated series. He is a cricket bat-wielding goon who lives in a cabin in the woods.  His species was criminal. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ7: The correct answer is option 'C'. Energon, which is represented as orange planet with a reason space in the middle, is the type of energy that all Transformers depend on to live fully. This energy is also known as \"T-Cog.\" The red symbols on most Transformer bodies, the purpose of which is not yet clearly understood, may serve as a \"plug-in\" or \"battery\" used to rejuvenate \"T-Cog\" when discharged and drained. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\n\nThe question asked for what is NOT part of the Transformers universe concept.\nThe correct four options are as follows:\nOption 1: The correct option is option 'A'. An alien planet called Cybertron as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 2: The correct option is option 'B'. A group of Autobots as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 3: The correct option is option 'C'. Larger-than-life Transformers as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 4: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. Vehicles capable of transforming as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.",
