Formula (9) corresponds directly, as it shows the implication from an action in the past period (Ap) to the same action at a past point (Hp). Formula (10) indicates the negative form but can also be seen as relevant in inferring the same past relationship.\n\nThus, the total number of formulae that correspond to the given statement is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]",
