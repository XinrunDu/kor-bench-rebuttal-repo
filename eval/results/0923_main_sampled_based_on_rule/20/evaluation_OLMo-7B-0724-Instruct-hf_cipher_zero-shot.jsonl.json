In this rule, punctuation and spaces are not considered, so the alphabet characters are the only inputs.\n\n2. For \"KP\", there are two characters - \"K\" and \"P\". No punctuation and no J. We remove them. The resulting plaintext is \"K\" and \"P\".\n\n3. In the 5x5 grid, the coordinates of \"K\" are (4,1) and the coordinates of \"P\" are (2,4). Although there are 5 characters in the grid, we are told that there's no J, so we only use the remaining characters A-Z without J.\n\n4. The coordinates are arranged in the order: 286\n\n5. First, we find the row coordinates and read them in order: 26\n\n6. Next, we find the column coordinates and separate them into two halves: 2,4\n\n7. Next, read each half of the column coordinates, find the corresponding character in the grid using their row and column positions.\n\n8. For today, let's focus on the second half, the column coordinates: 2,4. Starting with the first element (4): we find the corresponding character, \"Z\". So, the second half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"Z\".\n\n9. Next, focus on the first half, the row coordinates: 2,6. The first element (2) corresponds to \"E\". So, the first half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"E\".\n\n10. The decrypted answer in plaintext is [[\"E\",\"Z\"]] or simply \"ZE\". Notice that the order of the characters in the plaintext is the opposite of the original order in the ciphertext.\n\nFollowing the decryption property, the final result in plaintext is \"ZE\". So, the answer to the given problem is [[\"ZE\"]] (double-square brackets encapsulating the decrypted answer).",

Identify the row and column coordinates in the grid: (3,5), (2,4), (4,0), (3,2), (1,4), (4,2), (4,1), (3,3).\n5. Since there are eight letters in the ciphertext, we now divide the row and column coordinates into two halves. First half: (4,0), (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,2), (1,4). Second half: (3,5), (2,4), (4,0), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1).\n6. Arrange the half coordinates according to (row, column) pairs, ignoring spaces: \"4042451339324204134\".\n7. Read the first half of the coordinate pairs as row coordinates and the second half as column coordinates. \"40425134443\".\n8. Now, we convert the remaining portion without punctuation and spaces to a sequence of row and column coordinates: \"0184422534130\".\n9. Find the letter corresponding to each row and column index in the 5x5 grid, obtaining A, D, N, G, R, M, W, C.

The padded plaintext is divided into 8-byte blocks (or bytes). Here, \"G\\x00\" forms one block.\n3. Block encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: The block \"G\\x00\" is encoded using ASCII to get the byte sequence \"47 00\"\n   - XOR with Key: \"47 00\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" (the uppercase versions of the hexadecimal characters)\n   - Substitute: Using the S_BOX, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, the byte sequence becomes \"BD 7B 7B 7B\"\n   - Permute: In this case, we rotate each byte by 1 bit.
