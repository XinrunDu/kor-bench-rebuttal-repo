The digits in 'APPLE' are 5, 1, 3, and 6. Their sum is 18 (1 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 18).\n\nAs we have 'EAT+THAT='APPLE', and 'APPLE' is made up of 4-digit numbers. We know that the first digit cannot be 0, so the 4 digits should add up to 18 (0 + 4 + 8 + ..., which doesn't exist). This constraint helps us eliminate possible 4-digit numbers with 4 at the beginning and forces us to look for other combinations of digits whose sum doesn't involve 4 at the beginning.\n\nNow, the possible options for a 3-digit number supplied by the sum of digits are: 14, 32, 46, 56, 68, 76.

Find the correct number(s) from numbers 0 through 9 to make the equation equal to 12.\n3. Follow the normal order of operations: parenthesis, exponents, order, and then associative and commutative properties.\n\nFirst, let's look for the role of the / symbol. The result should be in whole numbers, meaning no fractional results are possible. Therefore, the first rational number (/) requires both numerator and denominator to be the same; let's refer to it as 'n'. Therefore, the equation will look like this: n/n + c + d = 12, which is equal to n + c + d = 10. So, we have one unknown (c + d) to find.\n\nNow we can search for only one number to satisfy this equation, so let's focus on that first. The number 6 (6 + c + 6 = 12, which is only possible when c is 0). So, now we can quickly find the value of 'd':\n\n6 + 0 + 6 = 12, which is equal to 12.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is: 6 + 6 + d = 12, with d = 6.\n\nFinally, we have the equation: 6 + 6 + 6 = 12. When we evaluate it, we get: 22, neither of which is a whole number. Therefore, this rules out one potential solution (6 + 6 + 6 = 12);, and we are left with:\n\n6 + c + 6 = 12, where c is any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, the feasible solutions are:\n\n6 + 4 = 12, which is 10.\n\n6 + 5 = 12, which simplifies to: 6 + 5 + 1 = 12, which is true when d is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[6+4=12]], [[6+5+1=12]], and none from 6+6+6 = 12.\n\nSo, the solutions found are between 6 + 4 = 10 and 6 + 5 + 1 = 11.

We can see that there are four addition signs indicating that we have four numbers that need to be added.\n\nLet's first examine the given number, 17. Our task is to find the correct numbers from 0 to 9 that, when added, equal 17. The only possible combination of digits that adds up to 17 is 6 and 1.\n\nNow, we look at the equation: [[??? + ???? + ???? + ?? = 17]]\n\nSince we know that 6 and 1 add up to 17, we can replace the unknowns with their corresponding values: [[6 + 1 + ? + ? = 17]]\n\nFollowing the order of operations, let's reduce the equation by multiplying and then adding numbers. Multiplying 6 and 1, we get:\n\n6 * 1 = 6\n\nNow we can rewrite the equation as: [[6 + 1 + ? + ? = 17]]\n\n[[6 + 1 + 6 + ? = 17]]\n\nAdding 6 + 6, we get:\n\n6 * (1 + 1 + 1) = 6 * 3 = 18\n\nNow it is time to search again for the two-digit number (either 10 or 11) whose sum is 18. There is only one combination satisfying this requirement, which is 11.\n\nSo, the final equation is: [[6 + 1 + 11 + ? = 17]]\n\nWe can simplify this further by noticing that 6 and 11 added together make 17 already:\n\n6 + 11 = 17\n\nFinally, we can fill in the missing number: [[6 + 1 + 11 + 7 = 17]]\n\nIt turns out that there is no two-digit number that leaves a remainder when divided by 4 (7). Therefore, the only possible solution for this problem is the combination 6, 1, and 16, making the equation [[6 + 1 + 16 + ? = 17]]:\n\n[[6 + 1 + 16 + 9 = 17]]\n\nAdding 9 and 16, we get:\n\n9 + 16 = 25\n\nHence, there is no solution that ensures all the given values are two-digit numbers, and therefore we have found all feasible solutions.

Let's first analyze the given numbers:\n\n1. Row sums: 16, 12, 16, 15, 18, 10\n2. Col sums: 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 6, 13, 19, 14, 11\n\nWhen we look at the row sums, we can notice some patterns: 16 -> 16 -> 15 -> 18 = 4 (+2) (+2). This suggests that we should fill an odd number of black cells with odd weights (say 3 and 5) in each row, such that the sum of weights of the black cells in odd rows is 4 (+2) (+2), and the sum of weights of the black cells in even rows is 2 (+4).\n\nNow we analyze the column sums: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 1 -> 6, with a step of 2. We can apply the same pattern of odd numbers of black cells with odd weights in each column, by filling one cell in the first column (column 1) and doing the same step for each column, as follows:\n\n* Column 1: 3\n* Column 2: 1, 5\n* Column 3: 3, 5\n* Column 4: 5, 7\n* Column 5: 7, 9\n* Column 6: 9\n* Column 7: 13, 11\n\nBack to the grid, we can now apply the same pattern in each row. Let's apply the pattern for row 1:\n\n1. When we replace X with numbers, we get a 3 and a 7 in row 1, which gives us sufficient cells such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in row 1 is equal to 16.\n\nNow we apply the pattern for row 2:\n\n1. We get a 1 and a 5 in row 2, once again satisfying the condition that the sum of the weights of the black cells in row 2 is equal to 12.\n\nNext, we apply the pattern for row 3:\n\n1. We get a 3 and a 5 in row 3, and we get a 5 after replacing X in the first cell in column 6. This already answers for the cell in row 3, column 6, as we knew we needed an odd number of black cells with odd weights; thus, a 5.

        "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the X's such that the given rules are satisfied, and all numbers from 1 to 81 appear exactly once in the grid. Let's first understand the constrained space of the puzzle:\n\n* The grid has dimensions n x n (assumed for this explanation to be 9 x 9, but we can iterate through different n to find a solution).\n* Numbers 1-9 are arranged horizontally and vertically for a total of 18 positions for each number.\n* The remaining 19 positions are X's, which will be filled with the remaining numbers.\n\nThe key idea here is to maintain the order of numbers from 1 to 81. To do this, we can follow the rule that numbers must be arranged in order, one row or column at a time, with the next number in line determined by the previous number. We can iterate through possible rows and columns, checking each case to see if it satisfies the rules. We can also algorithmically construct grids by concatenating characters making up each consecutive number, and then use backtracking to explore different possible arrangements. We'll now work through this algorithm.\n\nHere is the working 9x9 grid with the nine numbers arranged from 1 to 9:\n```\n1 X X X X X X X X X   \nX  2 X X X X X X X X   \nX  X  3 X X X X X X X   \nX  X  X  4 X X X X X X   \nX  X  X  X  5 X X X X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  6 X X X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  7 X X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  8 X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  9 X\n```\n\nLet's consider the first row with numbers 1-9 arranged strictly in order. We now try filling in the remaining X's starting with the first column. In this case, we can make the first X in the first column be a 5, and the second X a 4. This leaves us with the following grid:\n```\n5 X X X X X X X X X   \nX  2 X X X X X X X X   \nX  X  3 X X 4 X X X X   \nX  X  X  X X 5 X X X   \nX  X  X  X  X 6 X X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X 7 X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X 8 X X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  9 X   \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  9\n```\nWe now continue filling the remaining X's in the second row according to the order, and we can see that the remaining X's in every row are uniquely determined. We can then complete the columns of the grid alphabetically and sequentially, and thus find the full grid:\n```\n5 19 1 18 14 11 2  7  6  3  4 16 13 10 9  8 12  5  12 17 15  1 16 15 14 13 11  7 10 9 13 12  6  5  8 17 16\n7 19 6 18 12 11 2  8  1 10 14 15  5  4  9  3 13 17 10  2 13 16 11  6  5 12 17 15 14  8 12  6  7\n6 17  3 16 18 13  5  9 12 14  1  8 12 15 13 11  6  5  4  9 10  4 13 14 11  2  1 12  6 15 16 17 8\n7 16 10 13 15 17  2  6 19 13 15 18 12  6  7  1 14 10 12  6 13 14 15  5  4\n9 15 16  2 13 14  6  7 17 13 11 13 10  8 14  1  6  9 11 17 12  7 16 15 18 18 15 19 8 11 9\n10 17  5 15 13 11  7  2  8 15 12  1 15 18 17 18 15 14  8 17  1 13 11 14 12 6 10  5  6\n5 19 12 10  1 15 16 18 17  6  5 13 14 15 10  6  7 11 12  2  6 17 16 14 13 19 18 15 9 8\n13 15  1 16 11  2 10 12 17 14 18 15  6  5  4 15 14 11 10 12 10  8 12  7  6 19 18 17 8\n9 13 17 13 12 10 15  5  6 8 16 12  1 18 10 15 16 14  5 15 17 18 19 11 12  6 10 9\n```\n\nThe final output with arranged numbers follows:\n\n```[[1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [2, 8, 7, 5, 10, 9, 12, 11, 6, 4, 13, 14, 1, 16, 15, 18, 17], [1, 9, 12, 14, 6, 7, 15, 5, 10, 13, 8, 16, 11, 17, 2, 19, 4, 13, 18, 15, 12, 6], [19, 3, 15, 18, 14, 5, 10, 13, 17, 2, 6, 12, 16, 11, 4, 1, 7, 14, 9, 15, 13, 20], [7, 16, 4, 9, 5, 13, 14, 11, 2, 6, 12, 17, 18, 1, 10, 8, 15, 19, 6, 18, 5, 17, 9], [11, 17, 10, 8, 15, 5, 6, 6, 4, 18, 13, 7, 18, 16, 9, 2, 19, 12, 11, 8, 14, 15, 17, 1, 5], [10, 15, 5, 8, 11, 7, 2, 19, 18, 12, 9, 1, 16, 11, 18, 14, 4, 13, 15, 6, 6, 5], [5, 8, 7, 16, 10, 1, 13, 14, 18, 18, 5, 13, 15, 17, 4, 15, 6, 8, 19, 12, 9, 10, 9, 11, 7], [19, 12, 4, 18, 10, 1, 16, 8, 7, 17, 11, 6, 5, 9, 13, 3, 15, 14, 11, 5, 6, 19, 17, 20]]```",

Let's draw the walls using `A` characters:\n\n```\n A X X A A 3 A X A\n A 1 X A A X A   A 2 A\n A A A A A A A A A\n A A 4 A A A A   A A\n A A A A A A   A A\n A A A A A A A X A\n A A A A A X A A\n A A A A A X   A A\n```\n\n6. Finally, we represent the final answer as follows (wrapped in double square brackets):\n\n```\n[[A X X A, A 1 X, A A X, A A 3, A X X A, A 2 A],\n [A X, A A X, A A, A A, A, A A, A X, A A],\n [A A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A]]\n```\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n```\n[[A X X A, A 1 X, A A X, A A 3, A X X A, A 2 A],\n [A X, A A X, A A, A A, A, A A, A X, A A],\n [A A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A]]\n```\n\nI hope this helps you understand the answer, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!",

(1,1)(2,1):2÷: We need to find two numbers (say x and y) in the first row that can be divided by 2 and have their sum equal to 2. The only possible solutions for N=4 are (x=2, y=1).\n2. (3,3)(3,4):2÷: At the top right corner, find two numbers (say x and y) such that their sum is divisible by 2 and is equal to 6. The only solution is (x=4, y=2). Note that there is no other solution for N=4.\n3. (1,2)(1,3):1-: In the first row, find the first two elements such that their sum (x + y) is not divisible by 2. Here, it is x=1 and y=3.\n4. (1,4)(2,4):8* : In the last two cells at the fourth row, observe that their product should be 8. The only options are (x=4, y=0) and (x=0, y=8). Both of these do not satisfy the unique solution needed for the given constraints, hence there is no solution for this region.\n5. (2,2)(2,3):3* : In the second and third columns of the second row, find two numbers (x and y) whose product is 3. The only two such numbers for N=4 are x=2 and y=1.\n6. (3,1)(3,2)(4,1)(4,2):13+ : In the third and fourth rows, as well as the first and second columns, find a way to place distinct numbers from 1 to 4 such that their sum in each 2 x 2 sub-region is equal to 13. This can be done by placing the numbers in the order: (3,1)(3,2) = 13-5-3 = (1,1)(1,2) = 13-8-5 = (4,1)(4,2) = 13-3-10 = 2\n\nNow, apply the numbers to the grid:\n\n1 2\n3 1\n4 0\n0 7\n5 6\n0 1\n7 8\n8 0\n\nFinally, stack the rows horizontally (separated by commas):\n\n[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]\n\nConcatenate the two rows vertically (separated by square brackets): \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]\n\nThus, the final output for the given puzzle problem rules is: \n\n[[1 2 3, 5 6, 0 1, 7 8, 8 0, 4 0, 0 7], [3 1, 3 2, 1 2, 4 1, 4 2, 2, 0 7]]",

        "response": "To solve this puzzle, we will first analyze the rule provided and then apply it to the given input matrix. Guaranteeing a solution that meets all the puzzle rules is challenging since the number of possible arrows combinations is vast. However, we can use trial and error while following the rules.\n\nAfter analyzing the puzzle rules, here is how we can apply them to find a solution for the given input:\n\n1. The matrix consists of `(5*5)` blank squares.\n2. For a `5*5` matrix, we need `25` arrows.\n3. So, every row and column must contain one numbered square and one arrow that leads away from it.\n4. Since we have only `25` arrows, we must use each arrow at least once.\n5. Arrows cannot pass through or cross other arrows.\n6. Furthermore, every blank square must be covered by at least one arrow.\n7. So, we must create a solution where each numbered square emits an arrow, as required by rule 3.\n\nNow let's apply these rules to the input, step by step:\n\nGoing left to right, let's examine the first row:\n\n1. The first cell has a numbered square (5). It emits an arrow (up) because no arrow points up, according to the rules.\n   Output: [5 →]\n2. The second cell is a blank square that should be covered by an arrow. Since there is already an arrow pointing up in the previous row, the next arrow must point down.\n   Output: [5 →, → ↓]\n3. The third cell is also a blank square but must emit an arrow pointing to the right since the arrow above points down.\n   Output: [5 →, → ↓, → →]\n4. The fourth cell is a blank square but must emit an arrow pointing towards left since the arrow above points right and there's no arrow pointing left in the previous row.\n   Output: [5 →, → ↓, → →, → ←]\n\nSimilarly, we can move from bottom to top:\n\n1. The first cell is a numbered square (9).The arrow is pointing up as required by the rules.\n   Output: [9 ↑]\n2. The second cell is a numbered square (1) that must have an arrow pointing upwards.\n   Output: [9 ↑, 1 →]\n3. The third cell is a numbered square (3) that must have an arrow pointing downwards.\n   Output: [9 ↑, 1 →, 3 ↓]\n4. The fourth cell is a numbered square (4) that must have an arrow pointing downwards.\n   Output: [9 ↑, 1 →, 3 ↓, 4 ↓]\n\nExamining the remaining cells ensures we have no missing arrows or arrows that violate the rules. We conclude that this solution:\n\n[[5 →, → ↓, → →, → ←],\n[9 ↑, 1 →],\n[3 ↓, 4 ↓],\n[-> ↓, -> ↓]]\nis a valid and correct solution for the given input matrices. Therefore, the final output is:\n\n[[5 →, → ↓, → →, → ←],\n[9 ↑, 1 →],\n[3 ↓, 4 ↓],\n[-> ↓, -> ↓]]\n.",

We have an n*n grid, and we know that some squares show a number indicating the number of mines around them (8 squares including the diagonal). In this case, we have a 5*5 grid, and some squares are: (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (2,2) (2,4) (3,1) (3,4) (4,1) (4,3) (4,4) (5,1) (5,3) (5,4). The numbers of mines around these squares are 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, and X for the rest of the squares.\n\n2. Let's say the current estimation for mine-squares in the first row is: [X X X, A 2 2, 2 3 A].\n\n3. Look at the number of mines lying in the same column as the first row, these are: (1,1) (3,1)\n\nRight now, we observe that at least one mine is lying between (2,2) and (3,3) because the total number of mines in the first column is 2 and the number of mines in the first row is 1. Consequently, between (2,2) and (3,3), there should be a mine in the (3,3)-cell, replacing the X in [X X X, A 2 2, 2 3 A]. Make sure that the (1,1) - (3,3) diagonal belongs to the most occurring mines' path and place 1 mine at (1,2) and the remaining mine at (3,3). So, the updated estimation is: [X X X, A 2 2, 2 A 3].\n\n4. If we now check the number of mines in the same row as the first row, these are: (1 3) (4 1) (5 1) (5 3). Since the total number of mines in the first row is 1, the mine only remains in the (5,1)-cell, which replaces the X in [X X X, A 2 2, 2 A 3].

So the answer for this position should be [A, 2, 2, A].\n\nLet's assume that the remaining unlisted positions are empty (Xs). Then, the puzzle grid would look like:\n\n[X,\t2,\tX,\t2,\t1,\tX,\tX\nX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\t2\n1,\tX,\t3,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX]\n\nNow, let's work from the bottom row and rightmost column and work our way up and to the left.\n\nFor the bottom right corner (2, n), we know that there is one mine around it (within the 8 squares, including diagonals). At this point, the grid would look like:\n\n[X,\t2,\tX,\t2,\t1,\tX,\tX\nX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\t2\n1,\tX,\t3,\t1,\t2,\tX,\tX]\n\nKeep moving down to the next row and the second to the rightmost column (n-1, n-1). In this case, there are two mines surrounding the square. For the grid to remain consistent, we should have one number above, one to the left, and one diagonal (top left to bottom right). This leads to a unique solution, which is:\n\n[X,\t2,\tX,\t2,\t1,\tX,\t1\nX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\t2\n1,\tX,\t3,\t1,\t2,\tX,\tX]\n\nMoving further down to the next row and the second to the rightmost column (n-1, n-2). Now it's a combination of the N-1 and the N-2 row and column. In this case, there might be two or more mines around this square, but it only has four neighbors (3 on the diagonal). This implies there are either 1, 2, or 3 mines combined with other empty squares. Let's assume there are three mines. This leads to:\n\n[X,\t2,\tX,\t2,\t1,\tX,\t1\nX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\t2\n1,\tX,\t3,\tX,\t2,\tX,\t1]\n\nWe now move to the row just above (n-1, n-1) and the column directly to the left of it (n-2, n-1). If there are two mines around this square, it implies that one mine is above, while one is at the left corner. This leads to an answer:\n\n[X,\t2,\tX,\t2,\t1,\tX,\tX\nX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\tX,\t2\n1,\tX,\t3,\t1,\t2,\tX,\t1]\n\nLastly, let's work on the top left corner (n-2, n-2). If there is one mine around the square, it would imply that one mine is directly above, and the other is at any of the eight surrounding positions. But, if we have one mine around the square, then there have to be either one or three mines around the square in the surrounding positions. However, having only one mine implies that it could be surrounded by one mine at any of the positions, which results in having four options (see the six possible solutions below).\n\n1.

From these six options, go through each row and column and apply the rule to each absence of the number to find the mine positions. The following combinations remain as possible solutions:\n\n**Solutions for n = 3:**\n\n[[X X X, A 2 A, 1 A X], [X X A, A 2 A, 1 A 2], [X X A, A A 3, 1 A 2]]\n\n**Solutions for n = 4:**\n\n[[X X X X, A 2 A 2, 1 A X X], [X X X A, A 2 A, 1 A X X], [X X A X, A 2 A, 2 X 1], ...]\n\nAnd, for a larger n, you will get even more possible combinations. The true solution sets have to be explored to get the actual positions of the mines based on their surrounding elements.\n\nRemember, as per the rule, all possible scenarios need to be explored before settling on the final answer.",

The maze grid consists of arrows pointing in various directions, indicating possible paths for the player to follow.\n2. The start and end points are well-defined, and the player must start at the starting point (first cell in the grid depicted).\n3. The player moves to the next grid cell based on the arrow direction.\n4. The player must strictly follow the arrow directions and cannot choose another path.\n5. The goal is to reach the end point successfully from the starting point.\n\nNow, let's follow the rule steps to solve for each line (top to bottom, left to right), with the initial line being [].\n\nFor the first line, there is an arrow pointing right (→) with a circular dot (○) in the next cell. According to the rule, the player moves right and follows the arrow. Therefore, the first line should be [1].\n\nFor the second line, the arrow pointing down (↓) means the player moves down. There are no circular dots in the next cells, so we don't need to move any further in this direction. The second line will be [0].\n\nThe third line, with the arrow pointing right (→), has circular dots in both the next cells (next to each other). For both cells, the player moves right and reaches the next row. The third line will be [2, 4].\n\nThe fourth line follows the same pattern as the third line, with arrows pointing right (→) in both the next cells. The player moves to the new row in both cases. So, the fourth line is [0, 5].\n\nFor the fifth line, there is an arrow pointing left (↘) for the first cell, but there is no circular dot. The player stays at the same cell. Evidently, it doesn't change the row, so the fifth line is unchanged: [0, 5].\n\nFinally, for the sixth row, there are arrows pointing right (→) in both the next cells containing circular dots (○). In this case, the player moves right in both cases. The sixth line is [3].\n\nPlugging all the answers into a single list and wrapping the result inside double square brackets results in the answer: [[1 0 2 4 0 5 3 0 6]]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [[1 0 2 4 0 5 3 0 6]].",
