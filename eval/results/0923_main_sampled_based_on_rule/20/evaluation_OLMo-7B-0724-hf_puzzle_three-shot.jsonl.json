The majority of experts (the combined total of our youth) here in Puzzle Studio, has master level knowledge that they will attempt to disclose throughout our community. The social environment is just that. A place where youngsters make new friends, celebrate others talents and successes. They discover their talents within others and in turn tune-up their own. They learn from the challenges/openings presented on questions and develop helpers who discover great solutions. It is time to step back and let the youth shine as brilliant leaders and innovators in the context of your everyday business activities and operations. Thus, we have introduced the Yunggsters! A group of committed youngsters who's focus is on providing renewed quality content for enterprises that are in the 24/7 marketplace ,especially in the education field, where fast and fluid puzzle evolution is crucial. Already we have reached Fortarolla (Eastern California) and Cornicopia (Northern Italy) to establish coordinates of Pointy Mycusi for our team, who are in the process of drawing numbers for our marathon run this weekend. In house, an internal test of 13 is being conducted to fit out the possible solutions to the puzzle created, see a PM from Paul55 and in support to begin preparation of the Northern Europe air route, see the Cartes Janus. Please take note that a provide Live chess and See gauge which is still a day before our live game. We look forward to your response and enjoy! ## The Problem We have two sets of numbers, one denoted A and the other B. We perform the following operation to each of the A set numbers. For each number $i$ in $A, j$ in $B$: $n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))$ where $a_i$ and $a_i$ represent the elements of sets A and B, respectively. We obtain two sets of numbers, C and D. For each element $k_j$ in set C, i.e. the elements $k_1, k_2, k_3, .., k_n$ to form the set C, we multiply element the $k_i$ to set A, see the stator B.[2424] for the step. The output of the problem was poorly received/underappreciated by the peer reviewers, see the revisiting for further discussion. The assumption of this problem is that [2424][2424]. The fact that you have to use the coordinate function (arctan), which results in a few possible answers. The problem contains some increased complexity on the boundary case and built-in performance beratings. For example I wasn't quite able to generalize your first part, see the following for further info. You'll want to stop at the prompter every occurrence of $a_i$ as that's the step which your prompt makes. As a matter of completeness we'll use your internal notation, $k_i$ and $k_j$, because otherwise you'll need to remove it when encountering the functions with current family member parameter. I understand where the confusion comes from, it looks like we have this very complicated problem. However, before I deleted some of it, and posted it there in full, I didn't find what any of it came from. We have a few answers to this, and we'll just examine them line for line in sequence, the first question of them is: what is the final output of your code? Your functions have two cases for which they produce output, an output case and an \"output\" case, correct? and the two cases work in the reverse order. Doing that in the reverse order should probably constitute partial lines, but it's negligible at best, and almost irrelevant because they never directly refer to the provided inputs within their respective body. Nevertheless, they're currently used in this way (you provide a function, then it's executed in sequence from bottom to top): The \"output\" case The \"output\" case _--this is where your the program executes your_pick_formulas (your method for showing what should be printed as output). The Case Color is simply a simple test of whether it returned a single character or not. If it did, it was a single case and you should run your check upon that. I would very much like to know how you know whether or not you should run it in the order listed. However, if you are unable to give me a good example of when some operation would return a single character and another would return two letters in a particular order, then we'll just write the following check for you to help: and _don't skip any paragraphs_ ## Input/Output Formats [NOTE: These values are deliberately missing some outputs to avoid issue for day-to-day standard use when reading these notes and retrieving answers!

In the examples below, assume the definition for a is a = 1.\n\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [13,52,1], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered to be prime when two consecutive numbers on the sequence intersect the circumference, True or False.\"\n\n### Answer:\n\"False\"\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [52,38,15,9,21,4,7,11,29,22,26,32], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered prime is two consecutive numbers on the sequence meet the circumference, True or False\".\n\n### Answer:\n\"True\"\n\n### Question:\n\"The number sequence = [129,150,229,604,829,1295,1382,1638,1815,2382,28,3830,7580,9813,10139,10603,11378,11381,11617,11719,13476,17057,19889,20045,20240,21541,22190,23652,24138,24841,25768,26329,40725,40623,41997,43527,44121,72449,81497,92767,102297,116163,122000], is around a unit circle of radius one, x is considered prime is two consecutive numbers on the sequence meet the circumference, True or False\".\n\n### Answer:\n\"False\"\n\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with the solution of a word replacement (words stay the same length) by the group = {gi : (a-1) : <define>}, to solve the initial word by the expression in the text =[word, define].\n2.Please go through examples at the end to understand this puzzle.\n\n### Question:\n\"2 like 4, the suggested rule intersection = someone one solve([sarkey, somestone one]) for modulator, the result = monolith or extramundane\".\n\n### Answer:\nmonolith\n\n### Question:\n\"49 Like 69, the suggestion the rule intersection = lead solid or vertically thaler only modulate, the result solve([speller, both]) for front, the result = n/a\".\n\n### Answer:\nn/a\n\n### Question:\n\"62 Likethor 64, the suggestion the rule intersection = name tone or tutelage only limit, the result solve([steven, adjective]) for lat, the result = deliver\".\n\n### Answer:\ndeliver\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with a solution and try to guess the corresponding Puzzle Rule.\n2.This is one example of the Puzzle Rule.\n\n### Question:\n\"4 like 6, if a number is compromised by a number's only internal factors only then the composite number is related to the suggested rule inner meaning which = [interwoven leverage city origin]\".\n\n### Answer:\nintersection\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.Your are given with the words and ordered in a line = [word1 word2 ...] and a Part Of Speech of each word.\n2.Your killer's list of adjective input = [[word, partofspeec], ...].\n3.Your killer's list of noun input = [[word, partofspeec], ...].\n4.Your output list should be like so: [[Adjective][Word] | [Name]]. Each output is seperated by a comma and it is inside double square brackets.\n5.You need to output matching words and verb, and make sure to enclose your answers in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Question:\n\"Killer's list of adjective input = [[john, pronoun] | [final]]. Killer's list of noun input = [[a woman who...] | [he]]. Your output list should be like so: [[adjective],[word]]\", Please provide your answer in the following format: [[word1 word2 ...]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[Who's man?] | [He]} .[[She's woman] | [She]} .[[She's boyfriend] | [He]} .[[It's John] | [He]}\n\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.You can find a letter in a word and shift that letter by a non-zero-value toward the end of the word. So if you wanted to shift e by 2 letters forward, you would put b (the 3rd letter) in its place. If you can move a letter forward by precisely 1 spot to the end, then you do so and it becomes your new first letter. So if you could shift s 3 times to the end (adji) the output would be jails, or, if you could shift zz 2 times to the end, you would gain mill brain g (srbin goird)\n2.So if you had the number of occurs for each letter shifted to the end, it gives you a meaning. this is also what we call the name of the game, this puzzle can also be used by using other meanings much like pitchivre [purest one]\n2.Your name is generated from an input of a single word. Your output should be the letters in your name (this is an example manually inputted: \"norvaldraft\"). There is another puzzle question where the input is your own name.\n\n### Question:\nYour output should be your generated name itself. Your input should be human, submitted by someone else (ie. \"derpder\"); the output of this puzzle should then be their name. In this case, you need to guess which word they provided (assuming you do not have access to this before the solver is run, for example). Also, their input is sent to you in a distance, rather than a change of distance from the bible (permanency) (example: \"isirit\" is more like \"wirkit\"). Also, if you took this puzzle, it should be dark (ie. gormicrast), which is why we call it \"abcii\" (abbr. for \"adjective.noun:verb\"). Otherwise it would just be pointless (ie. \"4k9ic2\", whose output is \"c\", which is treated as an unnameable object)\n\n### Answer:\n derp45 derp2 derp7 derpword derp derp2 derp4derp derp2derp derp abcic gormicrast moclick\n\n### Answer:\nfbofifdjr integed ndofsr rror sgnnetnn fiiurivelt umartstrtio sabil ikig0 seroc3\n\n### Answer:\nerorursfdfiurf irisferfre\n\n### Answer:\nrb4k8d\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.In counterclockwise order, output the letters in that order, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets like this:[custom_example] or [[custom_example_1 custom_example]] for multiple answers.\n2.Now sequence=can be found from second meter, the list of sequence.\n\n### Question:\n\"3, true three man demeter\".\n\n### Answer:\n[c, h, l, s, r]\n\n### Question:\n\"4, national yes mobile god\".\n\n### Answer:\n[f, l, v, u]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.For the first letter of the word, there is most commonly an index at a counterclockwise point, so 1 is in the clockwise direction (measured clockwise) from the index on the axis.

Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters. Example: “athena,” “dima,” “amma” = “DMA ATHENA” constitutes all of the puzzle words apart from the first letter of the longest possible word unconnected for 6 letters consisting mostly of “5” when separated by words!\n\nExample 5: The same letter repeating in a word will reveal when it has a similar meaning to the original. Example ↗️ = turn ↘️ = the same letter repeated (in this case, U) signifying that the customs",

Each Rope is connected to a Knob such that no two Knobs are connected to the same Resource. A Knob can be rotated clockwise and anticlockwise. The clock shown in the picture is used to indicate which Resources are next to each other. The business cycle works like this: at the start of a cycle, the first thing to do is spin a Knob $2/3$ of a full clockwise revolution. If a resource is facing towards the screen, the clock is spinning on the negative side of this resource, otherwise the clock is spinning on the positive side.\nAfter spinning the inital Knob, spin all other Knobs in order anticlockwise starting with the knob right next to the Clock resource. For each knob that is spun, rotate it exactly one full clockwise revolution.\n\n#### Question:\n\nWhat is the minumum rotation time? The answer must either:\n\n1.

But before we practice more tests, we might as well prepare a testing environment.\n\n## An error handler for testsNo, after all, someone is still false.\nAs we said, one thing that encapsulates the essence of a good test is the assertion that \"a good test can identify a wrong solution quickly and concisely\". But before we practice more tests, let's discuss another practice we might have.\n\nWe usually code our test case program in Java. Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst",

We're reversing them. E.g. if we're told the row's sum is 3, then we add 3 to each element of that row. The same is done for columns.\n\nThere are three top-left blank grid cells. These can only be occupied with a single number (think of this as a summation of all the numbers around them, e.g. 8 in the middle figure). This is revealed through the directives, not the minigame by itself.\n\n1. Final answer will be presented by filling the non-occluded cells with numbers 1-16. The grid is tiled, so don't worry about filling it to the last one.\n2. The final answer itself will be a rectangular grid of numbers (of clounterparts, i.e. 1 and 2 and 3, etc.).\n3. A single number per grid cell. Such an important rule was left out of the puzzle, so the player has to override it by simulating the puzzle in a custom program. See Text Editor / Sandbox for directions.\n4. Answer will be separated by \\n. The minimum amount of \\n is two. This implies that the answer you give is of the form 0*[ n \\n  \\n ] *n+2 lines , where n is the number of numbers in the solution.\n\n### Puzzle Example:\nThe weight of empty cells is 0.\n>>>> 4     5\n>>      6\n<<      ?\n>>      8   9\n******\nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \"<>\".

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n• Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n• Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n• Use the space below to break the rule down into smaller chunks or examples to clarify and separate the puzzle. Enter your part of the puzzle by clearly marking it with a comment beginning with the symbol ## , such as: ## Loop overreach begins here to be complete (expected output for this puzzle is: ## ). Solve the puzzle from left to right such that each row includes one row element.\n• Don't forget to hitch your wagon twice, forward and once to jump through the window.\n• Solve the inclusive equals array puzzle by creating a joint array that contains the elements of start through finish, including any inclusive equals element.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nThe puzzle will have a top, left, and right character column utilized within the equation. Depending on the puzzle, each column will hold an arrow or an inclusive equals. If the column has an arrow, the alternative row containing that arrow will divide the row pairs in half. The equation can be created by lining up the king with his target. The equation is made when the queen places her piece on the board, and the letter in the side arrow is mirrored and moved off of the chessboard.\n\nAfter all moves in the correct order are completed, all promoting of pieces needs to be adapted to the correct alignment for endgame final outcomes. All moves that the rook moves are of special concern throughout figuring out the endgame. Looking at the third variation gives an example for both a side of the least squares equation where the queen is promoted to the side with a rabbe and a side of the least squares equation where the queen promotes to the side with a rook.\n\nWhen trying to puzzle out a sum, the overall leader",

Find the witchway.\n\n### Puzzle Rules:\n1.The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2.The maze has a well-defined start and end point.\n3.The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid.\n4.The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path.\n5.The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n\nThe specific outlined rule:\nimplementation of the map land\nIn introducing the strategy of playing the maze, it is necessary to introduce some rules and the art of changing arrows. The general rule is that\n1. When the player moves in the map with a path, the arrow will change. But when the arrow changes, one or two things are needed to pay attention to.\n2. When the player moves in the map without a path, the order in which the arrow changes is the following:1) From up, down, left, right, up, down, right, left,.\n3. The player can always only change the arrow used in the current move, and the arrow corresponding to the previous move has been invalidated.\n4. Before and after subsequent moves, it is necessary to convert the arrows in the empty area of the array in the grid. This part is to restore the maze position, and when the player appears, the path is not lost. The following four cases are needed to consider when converting the arrows.\na. path. If the current path is top or bottom, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, and they are opposite, then on the contrary. If they are both green, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, add a $(u,l)$ arrow, that is, change the red arrow to blue. If they are both purple, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=0, change the blue arrow to white. b. The left or right path is taken. If the current path is left or right, that is, $u_i$=1 or $u_j$=1, and it is down, there is an upper blue arrow. If it is blue, there is a yellow arrow, so make the red arrow white. If it is white, that is, $u_i$=0, $u_j$=1, change the yellow arrow to blue.\nc. if the opposite is taken No matter which kind of path, the path has changed, Above one of the sides is white, that is, $v_i$=, or the color is yellow. And it wiggles above the path.\nd. No path is taken. If there is no path, the upper boundary is purple. If there is a purple on the left side of the path boundary, change the blue arrow to white, otherwise change the red arrow to yellow. That is, the boundary is no longer lost.\n\n### Question:\n\nPut the “To Change Direction” puzzle:Hui Jian: Click the vertices in the order of 4-8-13-1-12-17, do not click the vertices in the direction of turning.\n\n### Answer:\n17,19,7,28,5,11,13,16,12,18,1,2,3,4,15,8,14,10,6,9,0,1024,2048,387,10\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Briefly introduce the strategy or techniques that you have used in ACT and YUXA.\n2. Briefly introduce the design ideas and examples of goroutine and channel\n3. Why do you say Programming Land suffers from the \"128 Problem\"? What did you use solution to solve this problem?\n4. A is a positive integer with $A=128+1024\\bigl(104854\\bigr)$,Yuxi found A this to A, so she knows $A \\in \\{232, 235, 670, 1009, 1096\\}$,But she didn't give the specific value $t$ of $A$,Tell me what the question answer is.\n5. Author and educator Joan Linga has a reputation for being an expert puzzler and teacher. Huang Zhiya became interested in this and followed in his footsteps out of love. However, he noticed that Linga often introduces and tests the crowd through \"Distance Puzzle\". Linga himself is an architect, and he has designed several famous puzzles in life. For example,\n【Puzzle＆answer：\n\nInput: A matrix of size n * m\n\nMinimize infection: find a minimum number of steps to infect all points with infection, nodes can be infected infinitely many times, failure will be infected an extra time.\n\nOutput: A minimal step number. Denote at the i-th step, the target point i has been infected.\n\n### Implication:\n\nAssign a single color node in use as a set. The infection path of each node is different, and the path is unique to each node.\n\n### Questions:\n\n1. what mathematical problems are emphasized?\n2. Does divide and conquer recognition? Why or why not?\n3.Find the shortest path from Simon to the end, by constructing a matrix containing a path from its current position to each remaining position, and then preparing the path of the domains",
