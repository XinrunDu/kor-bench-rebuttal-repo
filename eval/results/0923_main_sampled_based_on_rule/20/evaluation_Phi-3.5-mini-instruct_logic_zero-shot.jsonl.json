Thus, the entire expression cannot be true. We can represent this as:\n[[B1&C2&D3::=::0]]\n\n(2) B1&C3&D2: (!p&q) & (!p&q) & (q&!r)\nB1 and C3 both assert that Professor Wang is not from Suzhou and from Shanghai. D2 asserts that the other attendee is from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou. The first two parts of this expression are consistent (B1&C3), but D2 introduces a contradiction as both q and !r are required, which cannot be true at the same time. So, this expression simplifies to a contradiction:\n[[B1&C3&D2::=::0]]\n\n(3) B2&C1&D3: (p&!q) & (p&!q) & (!q&!r)\nB2 states that Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. C1 asserts that the other attendee is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai, which is consistent with B2. D3 also aligns with B2&C1. Thus, the expression simplifies to Q, as none of these contradictions exist:\n[[B2&C1&D3::=::1]]\n\n(4) B2&C3&D1: (p&!q) & (p&q) & !p\nB2 and C3 are inconsistent because B2 asserts p (from Suzhou) and not q (from Shanghai), while C3 asserts p and q, making it impossible for both p and !p to be true. This results in a contradiction:\n[[B2&C3&D1::=::0]]\n\n(5) B3&C1&D2: (p&q) & (p&!q) & (q&!r)\nB3 states that Professor Wang is from Suzhou and Shanghai, which contradicts C1's assertion that the other attendee is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai.

The genus concept is \"legal activity\" or \"applying for trademark registration,\" and the species concept is the specific procedure and process involving review, approval, recording, issuing of a certificate, and public announcement. The definition outlines these steps as the differentiating features of trademark registration, thus fitting within the genus-species framework of intensional definitions.\n\n[[A]]",

Here's how it fits within the given format:\n\n- Premise 1: Not p (A)\n- Premise 2: Not q (B)\n- Conclusion: Therefore, Not (Not p) (C), leading to p (D)\n\nThe core of the Elimin- Method lies in establishing the truth of a proposition by eliminating other contradictory options. In other words, by initially assuming Not p and then recognizing Not q, we indirectly confirm p.

This error in inference is due to shifting or misinterpreting the relationship between the two categories, which fits the description of the LetClauseShift Method.
