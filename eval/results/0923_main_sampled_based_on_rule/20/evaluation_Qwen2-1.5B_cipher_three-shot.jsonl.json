For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[L]]\n\nThe process of encryption and decryption in cryptographic systems involves constructing a system for transforming messages and encryption keys to be used for sending and receiving encrypted information. Here is a comprehensive explanation of each step involved in both encryption and decryption using a specific cipher.\n\n## Encryption: Creating a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n\nThe rule specifies that the plaintext is in uppercase and free of punctuation and spaces, while the keyword is not provided. These define the context for the encryption activity.\n\n2. Follow the specified encryption steps precisely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n### Encryption Steps\n\n1. Initially select the Reel1.\n2. For each character p in the plaintext:\n    - Find character p on the Reel and replace it with the next character on the Reel to get the ciphertext character.\n    - If the current character is at the end of the Reel, go around to the beginning of the Reel.\n    - Move to the next Reel to get the next character. When you reach the last Reel, circle back to the first Reel and continue the encryption process.\n\n### Encryption Result\n\nTo encrypt a plaintext, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the keyword and Reel1 with the values given in the rule.\n2. Start the encryption process on the first printable character in the plaintext.\n3. Look up the next character in the Reel1 using the keyword.\n4. Replace the current character in the plaintext with the next character in the Reel if the current character is a part of the keyword. Otherwise, skip to the next character in the plaintext.\n5. If the keyword has finished looping through, repeat steps 3 and 4 on the next Reel.\n\n## Decription and Usage of a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n**Explanation:**\nDefinition and sentence or visual description of the steps needed to create and use a cipher.\n\n### Usage:\n\nUse this sentence to introduce and explain the rules.\n\nSome examples of ciphers and their usage include:\n- The Caesar Cipher, utilising a simple substitution key for encrypted messages.\n- The Vigenère Cipher, stabilising the implementation of a Caesar Cipher for enhanced security.",

In the Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The keystream generated by the cipher is used to transform the plaintext into the ciphertext, and the decryption of the ciphertext is the reverse of the process. The grid described in Cipher Rule 1 contains four lists of five letters, each representing a group of five letters. The encryption and decryption steps outlined in the Cipher Rule involve iterating through each group of five letters, finding the correct location in the corresponding grid, and combining the two letters to form the corresponding ciphertext letter.",

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows. \n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.",

These rules further specify the operations to be used in the encryption and decryption process.\n\nFirstly, we note that the plain text consists of uppercase letters without punctuation or spaces. In our case, the key or keyword is \"N\".\n\nNext, we've a specific number 12 which is the value of k_q_x. This number is the value used in multiplication to calculate the decimal values of the input letters. \n\nThe encryption is represented in two phases: preparation and actual operation.\n\nPreparation: The preparation phase is performed for every letter in the plain text. It involves converting each letter to its decimal value using ASCII code and then applying a mathematical operation (multiplication) to convert these decimal values into numeric values and that is stored in the variable k_q_x. \n\nAs for the actual operation: A mathematical table is defined for each letter to convert the decimal value to its numeric value representing the letter for encrypted text. The ciphertext is then created by concatenating all these new numeric values that correspond to each letter in the plaintext and separating them with commas.\n\nDecryption: \nThe only difference from the other assignment is that instead of generating a number for converting each letter to its corresponding output letter, instead a number `c` is required, and then the value is subtracted from `k_q_x` to get the ASCII code of the corresponding letter. Using a dictionary, the conversion of the numeric value back to an actual letter is performed.\n\nRemember that ciphering is performed using mathematical computations, which can be difficult for humans to understand or remember.",

Encrypted answer formatted in double square brackets and decrypted answer formatted in double square brackets.\n\nBefore providing the encrypted and decrypted answers, please understand that the encryption rules assume that the plaintext is in uppercase and does not contain any punctuation or spaces. Additionally, the decryption rules require that the decrypted answer must be in uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces. Keep these assumptions in mind when generating your encrypted and decrypted answers. Please generate your answer immediately.\n\n### Answer:\nSorry for the confusion earlier.
