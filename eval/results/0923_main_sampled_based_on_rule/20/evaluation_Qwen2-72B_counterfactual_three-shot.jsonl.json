A sound that wasn't easy to recognize came from his six year old mouth. From the father's large digital drive, he had already checked the personnel files of entire Empire. There were all kinds of things in it including the detailed process of promotion, marvelously explicit daily schedule, daily worknotes which pushed the recruiting on the edge ofUTH throat. Imperial guards could just imagine the difficulty in the promotion process.\n\nValentian thought when he saw all those records. After seeing those vital messages, he sent a request for approval to the recruitment terminal in the Empire personnel department, and waited.\n\nLooking at the serious face of his son sitting by the side, Soya woman looked anxious. A lot of times the woman crammed some French fries and little dumplings into the child's mouth while he was making the mess on the table. The fact Valentian seemed to be doing this for his own vendetta was hard to disguise though. Soya watched as the six-year-old child slummed his shoulder fighting his sleepiness.\n\n\"But why what you are seeking all time this has been saved in their brain? Like this doesn't mean Albert only has to derive out?\"she asked.\n\nA bridge was shifted on one side, quick back and forth judging according to the information. Valentian answered:\"Albert will bring me back the data that he can access, but with this I can access different levels of data.
