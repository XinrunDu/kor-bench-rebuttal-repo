This means Professor Wang is from Shanghai but not Suzhou.\n- Second person: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, and he is from Suzhou. This means Professor Wang is from Suzhou but not Shanghai.\n- Third person: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou. This directly negates the proposition that Professor Wang is from Shanghai or Hangzhou.\n\nSo, the logical expressions for each statement become:\n\n1. First person: (!p & q)\n2. Second person: (p & !q)\n3. Third person: (!q & !r)\n\nThe representation in the required format is: `[!p & q];[p & !q];[!q & !r]`.",
