Suppose you are given the rule \"p1 if and only if p2 is false,\" the proposition can be represented as p1=::>~p2. This is because if p1 is true, then p2 has to be false for the entire statement to be true, which is represented by the '=>' operation. On the other hand, if p1 is false, this can happen regardless of p2’s assignment. Hence, ~p2.\n2. For levels, since \"p1 if and only if p2 is false\" is a basic proposition without any logical operations, it can only be at level A. Therefore, the answer is [A]. For type, since the proposition is a basic proposition, it is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula. Hence, the answer is [C].\n3. The falsity values of the formula p1 => ~p2 are the cases where p1 => ~p2 is false. \n   - If p1 is true and p2 is true, the formula is false, so the falsity value is true when p1 is true and p2 is true (✓|✓). \n   - If p1 is true and p2 is false, the formula is true, so the falsity value is false when p1 is true and p2 is false (x|x).\n   - If p1 is false, then the formula is true regardless of p2’s assignment, so the falsity value is false when p1 is false (x|x|x).\n   - If p1 is true and p2 is true, the formula is false, so the falsity value is true when p1 is true and p2 is false (x|x,x|✓).\n   - If p1 is true and p2 is false, the formula is true, so the falsity value is false when p1 is false (x|x,x|x).\n   - If p1 is false, then the formula is true regardless of p2’s assignment, so the falsity value is false when p1 is false (x|x,x|x).\n   Therefore, the answer is [[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓|✓]].\n4. According to the equivalence operation, two formulas can be interchanged if they are equivalent. The formula is an equivalence one, hence we can rearrange the formulas. \n   - The first formula can be rearranged to ~p3 || ~p1 & ~p2. Since the order of ~p1 & ~p2 doesn't affect the truth value of the formula, we can rearrange it to ~(~p1 & ~p2) || ~p3.\n   - The second formula can be rearranged to (p2 || p1) & (p1 => p2). Since the order of p1 => p2 doesn't affect the truth value of the formula, we can rearrange it to (p1 & p2) || (p2 || p1).\n   - The third formula can be rearranged to (p1 => p2) & ~(p1 & p3).\n   - The 3rd formula can be further simplified to (p1 => p2) & (~p1 || ~p3)\n   - Now we equate the rearranged third formula with the rearranged second, second with the rearranged first, hence they are equivalent.",

Mathematical logic (but not calculus) is the main prerequisite for this.\n\n1. The initial problem is presented.\n2. The student then makes initial efforts at solving the problem. The rules are:\n   - When an invalid answer is given, instead of correcting immediately the student will guess the formula that solves the problem, in the form of [[input]], which will be accepted only if it is indeed a solution\n   - Once the valid [[input]] has been found, it will be used as a hint for the next solution step\n   - An intermediate output (even with semantic errors) will receive a (partially correct) score different from 0 or 1\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple circuit diagram, logical operators \"negation\", \"conjunction\", and \"disjunction\" function similarly.\nWhen there is one input it is recorded as \"I\", when there is more than 1 all inputs are represented in order as \"I1, I2, ......\".\nIf powered, represented as \"+\"; if not powered, represented as \"-\".\nThe output of the circuit diagram is represented as \"O\".

Using the guidelines provided:\n\n[[input, output]; [output when circuit is powered, output when circuit is not powered]; ...] \n\nFor a NOT gate, there will be only one input. If the input is powered (+), the output will be \"I\" or \"+\" when the input is negated.\n\nSo the solution will be:\n\n[[I1,O];[+,+],[-,+]]\n\nProvide the answers for the remaining questions in the same format, following the instructions and the logic rule.\n\n# End",
