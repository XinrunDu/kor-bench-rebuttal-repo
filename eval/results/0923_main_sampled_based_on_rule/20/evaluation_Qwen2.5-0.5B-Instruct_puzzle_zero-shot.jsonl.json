Here is a step-by-step approach to find the values of A, B, C, and D:\n\n1. **Identify Variables**: There are four variables (A, B, C, D). We need to find their values (0-9) based on the product `[EE]` and the numbers given to _each digit_ of `EE`.\n\n2. **Simplify the Product [EE]:** Notice that `EE` can be reduced to `[]` because the formula only gives letters and involves no numerical values.\n\n3. We can start with guesses based on the constraints.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n- From the first equation:\n  ```\n  (EE) + (THAT) = APPLE\n  ```\n\n- Let's start by guessing some values for A. Since the first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0, we will try single-letter values for A and see how it fits logically.\n\n    - A = 1:\n        - Trying A = 1, we get:\n          ```\n          1EE + 2THAT = apple\n          ```  \n        - This gives:\n          ```\n          one + two = altar\n          ```\n\n- Now, let's try to fill in the rest.\n\n    - B and C need to fit according to the constraints without repetition:\n      ```\n      if A is 1, what can B and C be?\n      let's try B = 4 and C = 6 or B = 4 and C = 6:\n      (EE)(28) = (apple)\n      ```\n      \n    - Checking for A=1 and C=3, we get:\n      ```\n      [[EE], 32]\n      ```\n\nIf there's a mistake in me, please let me know and I'll adjust my approach.\n\nWith multiple possibilities tested to find a unique solution, and the context of a specific formula (EAT+THAT=APPLE), I've provided an answer based very intuitively where each letter could theoretically add up to a unique number via IIFE calls and values based on constraints. Thus, the value of A = 1, B = 4, C = 6, D = 2, without further constraint conflict, this would now allow 'EE' to hold a different value needed to coincide perfectly with 'THAT' systematically ensuring the constraints.",

The rule states to follow the normal order of operations, which includes multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.\n2. We need to find a single-digit number to sum up to 12 with the operation symbols remaining unchanged.\n\nThe given equation is: ?/?+?+?=12. Our goal is to make the equation equal to 12 by considering the operations provided. The only single-digit numbers that can be used are 0 through 9. Therefore, the operation symbols must also be either 0 through 9.\n\nTo solve for the equation using only single-digit numbers:\n\n- If we can't form any meaningful equation with the combination of digits from 0 to 9, the solution must use multiple operations since 12 is not a single-digit sum result.\n\nLet's make a start with trial: We need to check all combinations of digits to see if they solve to 12. \n\nOne approach is to try placing numbers between operations to see if we can create 12. Let's test with trial numbers:\n\n- 5 + 2 = 7 (this is not 12)\n- 3 + ? = 12 (this is not possible since the answer is not a complete operation sum)\n\n- 1 + ?? = 7 (trial above ran out) [2, 3, 1 = ][6]\n\nThe correct trial to form 12 is to use the largest number correctly placed.

Here is a step-by-step approach to place the dominoes:\n\n1. Identify the shaded cells.\n2. Determine the grid layout and columns where unique shadings must be placed.\n3. Use the given matrix to place the dominoes.\n\nLet's map out the shaded cells based on the grid's layout and place the dominoes accordingly:\n\n1. Start by identifying unique shaded cells.\n2. Consider the matrix's columns and rows to place dominos:\n   - For column 1: B, B, B, A, A, B\n   - For column 2: C, D, D, D, D\n   - For column 3: A, A, E, E, F, H\n   - For column 4: B, E, G\n   - For column 5: A, F, F, G\n   - For column 6: B, B, G, G, G\n   - Input constraints indicate that 12 dominoes need to be placed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Shaded Cells:**\n   - Row 1 shaded cells: A, B, B, E, E, B\n   - Row 2 shaded cells: C, D, D, D, D\n   - Row 3 shaded cells: A, A, E, E, F, H\n   - Row 4 shaded cells: B, E, G (So far: B, B, E, E, G)\n   - Row 5 shaded cells: A, F, F, G (So far: A, B, F, G, G)\n   - Row 6 shaded cells: B, B, G, G\n\n2. **Determine Domino Placement:**\n   - Use the shaded row values 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3 (from column 1).\n   - Cover rows 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with 2, 3.\n\n3. **Apply the Remaining Shading:**\n   - Consider column 2:\n     - B(row 1): Cover columns 3 and 6: B, B, G\n     - E(row 2): Cover columns 4, 5, 6: E, G, G\n\n   - Consider column 3:\n     - A(row 3): Cover columns 4, 5, 6: A, A\n     - D(row 4): Cover columns 3, 4, 5: D, D, D\n\n4. **Final Domino Placement:**\n   - Append the specific domino placements from the identified row areas:\n     B2 -> (row 1) column 3\n     B3 -> (row 1) column 3\n     B4 -> (row 4) column 6\n     E2 -> (row 2) column 4\n     D3 -> (row 2) column 4\n     G3 -> (row 2) column 6\n     G6 -> (row 3) column 6\n     B5 -> (row 3) column 6\n     E3 -> (row 2) column 5\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of all dominoes placed are:\n\n[ [ (2, 3)(3, 3), (4, 6), (6, 6), (6, 3) ] ]\n\nEnclosed in double square brackets:\n\n[[(2,3)(3,3),(4,6),(6,6),(6,3)]]\n\n(Sequence within brackets is calculated by considering rows and columns and filling them with specific domino placements based on the shaded cells and grid layout constraints.)",
