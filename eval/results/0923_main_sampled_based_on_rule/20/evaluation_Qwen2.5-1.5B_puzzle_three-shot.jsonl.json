This common character or sequence is essentially a \"end marker\" or \"suffix\" common to all words.\n\n### Step-by-Step Application:\n\n1. **Forty Grape React Rouge**:\n   - Commonality: All share the letter \"e\" at the end.\n   - New words: All remaining words will end in \"e.\"\n     - \"Cascade\" (react_e riche\", \"Seize\" (react_e re), \"Pease\" (seize_e s).\n     - Answer: [[cascade seize pease]]\n\n2. **Abalone Overweight Canine Often**:\n   - Commonality: All words end in \"e\" or \"t\".\n   - New words: All words end in \"e\" or replace \"t\" with \"e\".\n     - \"Abalone\" (overweight_Olien\", \"Olive\" (overweight_Olien_t), \"Cean\" (overweight_Can Algourem), \"Ark\" (overweight_Ow\" + e).\n     - Answer: [[abalone olive ceane ark]]\n\n3. **Fare Tire Sofa Mire**:\n   - Commonality: All words contain a consonant followed by a vowel followed by a consonant.\n   - New words: All words with the same consonant-vowel-consonant pattern.\n     - \"Fearless\" (tirel furing), \"Bear\" (faire bankrupt), \"Cater\" (farsi scatter), \"Stear\" (mire_t heat).\n     - Answer: [[fa tire cater steer]]\n\n4. **Sunflower Pineapple Butterfly Newspaper Catfish**:\n   - Commonality: All words end in a number (1 through 9).\n   - New words: All words will end in the same number.\n     - \"Sunflower\" (8), \"Pineappie\" (9), \"Butteaur\" (11), \"Newspapar\" (12), \"Catfu'!\" (3).\n     - Answer: [[6 9 11 12 3]]\n\nTherefore, applying the rule to each question:\n- **Forty Grape React Rouge**: [[cascade seize pease]]\n- **Abalone Overweight Canine Often**: [[abalone olive ceane ark]]\n- **Fare Tire Sofa Mire**: [[fa tire cater steer]]\n- **Sunflower Pineapple Butterfly Newspaper Catfish**: [[6 9 11 12 3]]",

You need to leave these tiles blank. Occasionally, during a game, you will hit upon the right move, and those blank tiles happen to disappear.\nThe best way to approach this wily game is to obtain an edge-to-edge chain of blank tiles. There is a beautiful mathematical strategy for obtaining an edge-to-edge chain of blank tiles: Always leave blank the first stone that is in a direct line (two adjacent cells) to a mine. If you are able to leave those two cells, then you will have eliminated a chain that matters in the game. A simple-minded student may yield an incomplete edge-to-edge chain of blank tiles by ignoring the fact that the edges of the game are lines as opposed to points.\nIt may take some forethought to know where the next strike will be, but, when you understand the forest rather than the trees, you will become an expert at game progression.\n1.

To make the problem simple i may even try to use different language. There are many times when people talking or writing could be direction or unclear or incorrect statements a lot of the time. Therefore i will try to rewrite things as much as i can in a simpler way or could make some spelling errors or mistakes that were obvious to be made then rewrite the grammar or language they are used to using usng my language or using grammar correct \" the rules of the language or \" my accepted language policies of the moment as an example i would use the \" english \"igg rules.",
