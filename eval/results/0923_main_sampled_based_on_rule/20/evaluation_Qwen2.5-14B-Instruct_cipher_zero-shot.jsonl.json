Use the key, which is a SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\".\n3. Perform XOR between the bytes of the ciphertext and the key.\n4. Convert the resulting bytes back to a plaintext string.\n\nLet's go through the specific process:\n\n### Step 1: Hexadecimal to Byte Conversion for Ciphertext\nThe ciphertext \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\" will be converted into a sequence of bytes. This sequence is:\n\\[ 34, 184, 115, 3, 142, 32, 39, 248, 95, 186, 11, 10 ]\n\n### Step 2: Obtain Key\nThe key is the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\", which is:\n\\[ '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3' \\]\nThis hash converts to bytes as follows:\n\\[ 115, 238, 42, 77, 125, 125, 127, 159, 7, 253, 95, 111, 250, 153, 103, 77, 192, 19, 85, 2, 95, 215, 76, 34, 153, 34, 15, 193, 88, 73, 233, 152, 155, 179 \\]\n\n### Step 3: XOR Operation\nPerform XOR operation byte-by-byte on the ciphertext and key:\nSince the key is longer than the ciphertext, we will use only the required portion of the key:\n\\[ 115, 238, 42, 77, 125, 125, 127, 159, 7, 253, 95, 111 \\]\n\n#### XOR Calculation:\n- \\(34 \\oplus 115 = 107\\)\n- \\(184 \\oplus 238 = 30\\)\n- \\(115 \\oplus 42 = 155\\)\n- \\(3 \\oplus 77 = 80\\)\n- \\(142 \\oplus 125 = 135\\)\n- \\(32 \\oplus 125 = 157\\)\n- \\(39 \\oplus 127 = 188\\)\n- \\(248 \\oplus 159 = 95\\)\n- \\(95 \\oplus 7 = 102\\)\n- \\(186 \\oplus 253 = 77\\)\n- \\(11 \\oplus 95 = 102\\)\n- \\(10 \\oplus 111 = 105\\)\n\nThe resulting bytes are:\n\\[ 107, 30, 155, 80, 135, 157, 188, 95, 102, 77, 102, 105 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Byte Sequence to Plaintext\nConvert the resulting byte sequence to an ASCII string:\n\\[ 107, 30, 155, 80, 135, 157, 188, 95, 102, 77, 102, 105 \\]\n\\[ \"k`uP{r`_fmfi\" \\]\n\nBut since only uppercase letters are expected, we ignore non-uppercase letters:\n\\[ \"KUMFMI\" \\]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted plaintext is:\n\\[ [[KUMFMI]] \\]",
