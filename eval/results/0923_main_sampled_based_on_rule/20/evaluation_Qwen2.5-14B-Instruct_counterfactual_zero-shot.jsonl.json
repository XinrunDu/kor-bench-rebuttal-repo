While important, gym workouts are a general approach and may lack the focus on specific martial arts techniques.\n\nB.

This is directly stated in the story when it mentions that \"The 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\" Therefore, the appropriate choice is [[D]].",

The story clearly mentions the summer of 2044, where the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. Further, it is stated that the Olympics were officially held at the end of 2044 following the ignition of the first engine on the Moon. Since the story also indicates that another Olympics followed soon after \"The Wandering Earth\" plan began, prior to the Earth leaving its orbit and entering the asteroid belt, it strongly implies that the 2044 Olympics were a significant event amidst the plan's commencement and might be the last Olympics considered according to the context of the story.\n\nTherefore, [[D]].",

However, based on the information provided and trying to match it to the options:\n\n1. \"With large yellow or golden tubes.\" - This option isn't directly mentioned or implied in the story details.\n2. \"With a rectangular shape.\" - The story mentions SpongeBob SquarePants is a sea sponge with a rectangular shape, not the yellow tube sponge.\n3. \"It is a type of plant.\" - Sponges are not plants but animals. This is not correct.\n4. \"Can drive a boatmobile.\" - There is no mention of the yellow tube sponge's capability to drive a boatmobile.\n\nSince the story does not directly describe the yellow tube sponge, none of these options are explicitly correct. However, considering the closest context provided in the given rules, the question seems somewhat disconnected from the specific details. If we must choose, the characteristic that may loosely apply by process of elimination is option B, assuming it means any sea sponge due to SpongeBob's shape description, but this is a stretch and not an accurate representation of the story's content.
