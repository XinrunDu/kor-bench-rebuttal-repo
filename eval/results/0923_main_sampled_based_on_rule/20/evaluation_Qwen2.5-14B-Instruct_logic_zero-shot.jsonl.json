However, only when p1 is ✓, p2 is x, and p3 can be anything (but ideally, checking with p3=x to minimize redundancy since ~p2||p3 can be false):\nF: ✓|x|x\n\n### Formula (3): (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n- Breaking it down:\n  - The first part (p1=::>p2) is false if p1 is ✓ and p2 is x.\n  - The second part (~(p1&p3)||p1):\n    - ~(p1&p3) is false if (p1&p3) is true, so both p1 and p3 are ✓.\n    - p1 being ✓ makes the whole (~p1&p3) true if p3 is ✓ and negated effectively false.\n    - With (p1 & p3) being true, the second part would be true when p1 & p3 are simultaneously true.\n  \nThe overall formula (3) is false when p1 is ✓, p2 is x, and p3 is ✓:\nF: ✓|x|✓\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe falsity values for the given formulas in the specified format are:\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:✓|x|x];[F:✓|x|✓]].",

Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true. Hence, a fuller consideration of the third statement in the context of one of them being true will convert to `p | r`, thus `p` stands for the correct place if `q` and `r` are false. Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1.
