First, look for specific colours like “tan” or “brindle”. You may notice a certain pattern that the coat follows, like a tiger stripe or puppies with black spots.  You can then match the hair to standard breed charts online. The coat of the terrier family and various Dalmatian breeds often have circular spots.  Some Hungarian vizslas and starving African spitz dogs are often golden yellow.  Golden retrievers are easily identified by their warm, smokey brown hue. Note if the dog has a pretty cloudy coloured coat and an ordinary face. By looking at the shape of the dogs features (like the snout, ears, and eyes) you are able to tell what breed the dog may be. As an example, many spaniels often have sad, droopy eyes.  Some breeds, including the Australian sheperd and the whippet both have grey and black patches in their coat.  Others show signs of their mixed blood, like the West Highland Terrier and other generic mixed breeds. Examine the thickness and quality of the dog’s hair. The non-scented and soft Siberian husky is an example of a fine hound with sleek hair and soft collies and sheep dogs have woolly coats that block out the rain.  There are also custom off breed dogs that play along to taste with people that are easier to satiate. Telling if the dog is Male or Female and how old it is. The energy level and activity level of the dog can vary depending on the breed. If you don’t breed out with your dog, it becomes a real breed, not a mixed breed.\nBy observing coat colors, patterns, feature shapes, and hair quality of a dog, one can identify potential breed matches, and the dog's energy and activity levels can also provide clues to its breed.\nYou are an AI assistant.
