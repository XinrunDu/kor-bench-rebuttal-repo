Here's a detailed step-by-step analysis of the first given expression. I'll also provide a brief outline for verifying the second set of paired conjunctive terms.\n\n### First Expression: m0∨m8∨m2∨m10∨m6∨m4∨m3∨m11\n\n#### Step-by-Step Logical Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Basic Structure:**\n   - The expression includes all paired conjunctive terms from m0 to m11. This indicates that the expression is a tautology since it includes all possible pairs of propositional variables.\n\n2. **Truth Table Verification:**\n   - A simple way to verify this is to understand that the disjunctive normal form (DNF) provided includes all possible combinations of truth values for propositional variables. This means that for every possible assignment of truth values to the variables p, q, and r, at least one of the paired conjunctive terms will be true. Therefore, the entire expression is always true, or in other words, a tautology.\n\n#### Second Expression: m2∨m10∨m4∨m6 ∧ m0∨m8∨m6∨m4\n\n1. **Simplifying Using Distribution Law:**\n   - Using the distribution law (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C) = A ∨ (B ∧ C), we can simplify the given paired conjunctive terms.\n   - Here, m2∨m10 and m4∨m6 are in one part, and m0∨m8 are in another. This suggests a condition where at least one of the pairs (m2∨m10) and (m4∨m6) holds true, and both m0 and m8 are potentially considered.\n\n2. **Truth Table Verification for Simplification:**\n   - A truth table indicates there are some assignments where all paired conjunctive terms are not necessarily true or false. For example, consider an assignment that includes m0 and m4 which satisfies all. This is to identify if some terms may be redundant or included for expression verification purposes.\n\n3. **Further Simplification:**\n   - The logical simplification process indicates that further logical reasoning or simplification may yield a simpler equivalent expression. For instance, considering m0∨m6 which accommodates terms like m2∨m4∨m6∨m10∨m12, ensuring the essence of the pair's logical structure while checking if it's a contradiction or tautology.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above and given specifications, the first expression m0∨m8∨m2∨m10∨m6∨m4∨m3∨m11 clearly corresponds to a tautology as it encompasses all possible paired conjunctive terms for three propositional variables.\n\nFor the second expression, a detailed logical simplification shows it also could turn into a form that may indicate a tautology or contradiction based on further logical simplification or insight needed. \n\nHowever, emphasizing careful examination through correct logical reasoning methods (like distribution, conjunction, and disjunction holds vital for solidifying equivalent logical pairs in normal forms) and understanding truth tables can significantly aid in simplifying logical expressions equivalently—to verify these conclusions by ensuring logical consistency and completeness, as per the propagated knowledge in the example.\n\nThis problem is used in the DaCHS documentation, http://docs.g-vo.org/dachs/archive/coord.html.",

Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Rewrite the given equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the identity for \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\):**\n   Recall that \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta} \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert from polar to Cartesian coordinates:**\n   We know that \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) and \\( \\cos \\theta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\), \\( \\sin \\theta = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\). However, to simplify our approach, let us express everything directly in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y/(r)}{x/(r) + 1}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2 r\n   \\]\n   Since \\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Further simplification:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\frac{y^2}{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2}\n   \\]\n\nThis transformation is quite complex to analyze further without numerical methods or graphing tools. However, based on the structure of the original polar equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), we recognize that this equation represents a type of conic section because it's similar to the polar equations of parabolas, hyperbolas, and other conics.\n\nGiven the form \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), it suggests that this is a variation of a hyperbolic shape due to the presence of \\( \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), which implies exponential growth as \\( \\theta \\) varies. This matches the characteristics of a standard hyperbola in polar form, where the distance from the pole to the curve increases exponentially with changes in angle.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe curve defined by the equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\) is a **hyperbola**. This conclusion comes from recognizing the typical behaviors and forms of such equations in polar coordinates, specifically their relationship to conic sections like hyperbolas.\n\nPolar Coordinates proof, why $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? I'm doing a problem below, but am having difficulty understanding this passage. From the geometry, why does it describe the second picture? Why does $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? \n\nProve that an ellipse and a hyperbola with the same foci must intersect at\nright angles.\n\nWe work in polar coordinates $(R, \\theta)$, with $O$ as the pole\nand the positive $x$-axis as the initial line, and by choosing a unit\nlength such that the foci are at equal distances from the origin.\n(Thus, the foci lie on the line $\\theta=\\pi$.) If $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the\neccentricities of the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively, then their\npolar equations have the form:\n     $$  r_1=e_1R(1- \\cos \\theta) \\ and \\ r_2=e_2R(1 + \\cos \\theta)$$\n     where $r_1, r_2$ are the distances of the corresponding points $P,\n     P'$ on the conics. Now the perpendicular distance from the center of\n     the hyperbola (which is the origin) to the tangent at $P'$ is given by\n     $r_2 \\sin \\theta$, and the perpendicular distance to the tangents at\n     $P$ by $r_1 \\sin θ$. But the radii $OP$ and $OP'$ make equal angles of\n     $\\theta/2$ with $OP$, and thus the sum of the squares of the\n     perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to $OP^2+OP_2'=R^2$,\n     i.e.,\n$$(e_1R(1 - \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta+(e_2R(\n1 + \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta=R^2$$\nholds if and only if $e_1e_2 = 1$.\n\nTo understand why \\( R^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\) from the given geometry, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Setup and Definitions:**\n   - Let \\( O \\) be the origin.\n   - Let \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\) be the foci of the conics.\n   - The distance between the foci is \\( 2c \\).\n   - Let \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) be points on the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively.\n   - The distances from the origin to \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) are \\( R \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P \\) to the foci are \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_1' \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P' \\) to the foci are \\( r_2 \\) and \\( r_2' \\).\n\n2. **Polar Equations:**\n   - For the ellipse: \\( r_1 = e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\).\n   - For the hyperbola: \\( r_2 = e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\).\n\n3. **Tangents and Perpendicular Distances:**\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P' \\) is \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P \\) is \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\).\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - The radii \\( OP \\) and \\( OP' \\) make equal angles of \\( \\theta/2 \\) with the line \\( OP \\).\n   - The sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to \\( OP^2 + OP_2' = R^2 \\).\n\n5. **Derivation:**\n   - The perpendicular distances are \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The sum of their squares is:\n     \\[\n     (r_1 \\sin \\theta)^2 + (r_2 \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the expressions for \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2 + (e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R)^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + (e_2 R)^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta\n     \\]\n   - Factoring out \\( R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\left[ e_1^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 + e_2^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^",
