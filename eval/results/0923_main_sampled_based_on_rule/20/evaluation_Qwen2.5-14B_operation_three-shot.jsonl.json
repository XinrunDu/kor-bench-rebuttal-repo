Please provide the correct definitions of the operations \"★\" and \"◇\".\n\nResult of (4*2)◇5.\n\nWell, here’s how you would do it if “*” was actually “①” from the given rule and “◇” was actually “②” from the given rule:\n\nFirst, calculate 4①2:\n\n4①2 = √4 + 2² = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nThen calculate 6②5:\n\n6②5 = √6 × 5\n\nTo get a numerical answer for the last part, we would need the exact value of √6, but at this point, the result is just an irrational number. So carrying out this question just using assumption that you meant what the given rule says, we have:\n\nResult = √6 × 5. Which is approximately: 12.247. \n\nBut if asterisks are meant to be asterisks, then square root of 4 is 2 and square of 2 is 4 then result is 6 which when input in second function you get 12.247.\n\nI apologize for previous statements, it seems I assumed the symbols for the actual operations without proper context. My apologies for any confusion caused. According to your latest instructions, here's what I can calculate:\n\nIf 4*2 is supposed to be (4①2), then (4①2) = sqrt(4) + 2^2 = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nSimilarly, if 5 is supposed to represent the second term in a new operation that follows the pattern set by 'a②b', then we follow the rule for 'a②b' which is sqrt(a) * b.\n\nTaking the result of (4①2) = 6, we now compute 6②5.\n\n6②5 = sqrt(6) * 5 => (sqrt meaning square root) => sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449, thus 2.449 * 5 ≈ 12.247.\n\nFormally presenting the result: \n\n(4*2)②5 is approximately equal to 12.247. \n\nIt's crucial to understand that sqrt(6) can't be simplified further into whole numbers, that's why it's an irrational number.

If a<=0, 36-2a²=27, gives a²=27. Therefore, a=-3 or 3. [[3or-3]]\nIf 0★b=b, this means (b²-0)/2=b, solving this gives b=2.

[[21]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven 0★b=b, find b.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe integral of 0 from a to b should always be 0 since 0 is a constant, and therefore cannot equal any non-zero value without violating the fundamental theorem of calculus. Hence, there is no real value of b for which (b^2 - 0)/2 = b. That means the equation is always false for all nonzero values of b. Therefore, no answer can exist as the question set is fundamentally incorrect or incomplete.

Since a^2 cannot be negative for any real number a, there are no real solutions to the equation. Therefore, the question doesn't have an answer in any real field.

[[8]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven (-2)★b=3, find b.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or'.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe integral of 2x from -2 to b is (b^2 - (-2)^2)/2=3, which gives b^2-4=6, hence b^2=10. So the solutions are b=√10 and b=-√10. [[√10 or -√10]].\n\nAn air conditioner running for eight hours consumes 6 kilowatts. If the energy consumption varies sinusoidally with time, reaching its maximum at 6 kilowatts and minimum at 3 kilowatts, find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner.\n\nTo find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, we first need to understand the formula for the average of a sinusoidal function. The function is given as f(t) = Asin(ωt), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. However, the function provided is not directly in the form of a sine wave. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the extreme values of the function, which are 6 kW and 3 kW. Hence, the amplitude A of the sinusoidal function can be:\n\nA = (max - min) / 2\nA = (6 - 3) / 2\nA = 3 / 2\n\nTherefore, the function becomes:\n\nf(t) = 3/2 * sin(ωt)\n\nNow, let us determine the average energy consumption of this sinusoidal function over the eight-hour period. The average value of a function f(t) over an interval [a, b] can be determined by integrating the function over this interval and then dividing by the length of the interval.\n\nThe total energy consumed in eight hours is 6 kW, which translates to:\n\nE = ∫0^8 kf(t) dt = 6 kWh\n\nIn order to find the average energy consumption, we will calculate the integral of the function f(t) over the interval [0, 8] and divide by the interval's length, which is 8 hours.\n\nHowever, finding the integral of a sinusoidal function can be tricky without specific information about the time period of the function. If the sinusoidal function's time period is unknown, we can consider the most basic scenario where the function completes one cycle over the interval [0, 8]. In this case, the average energy consumption will be the average of the function's maximum and minimum values, which is:\n\naverage = (max + min) / 2\naverage = (6 + 3) / 2\naverage = 9 / 2\naverage = 4.5 kW\n\nTherefore, the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, considering it will be 4.5 kW if the function's time period is equal to the interval [0, 8].\n\nThe ball's height in feet above the ground is given by the expression y=-2x2+4x+18, where x is the horizontal distance in feet from where it was thrown. When the ball touches the ground, the horizontal measurement from where it was thrown is [[the_answer]].\n\nThe parabola is only touching the ground at the vertex x=-b/2a, which is x=-4/2(-2)=1.\nThe answer is: 1",
