First, let's identify which numbers between 1 and 4 inclusive satisfy the condition 2x - 1 is a prime number.\n\n1. For x = 1, 2x - 1 = 2(1) - 1 = 1, which is not a prime number.\n2. For x = 2, 2x - 1 = 2(2) - 1 = 3, which is a prime number.\n3. For x = 3, 2x - 1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5, which is a prime number.\n4.
