Include step-by-step instructions, which should result in output readable by the ChatGPT object that I am asking questions of.\n\n### CryptoSquare加密步骤：\n1. 首先，将明文中的所有空格、标点和字母J 转换为大写，并将其他字母转换为大写。\n2. 然后，将明文组合成长度为2的字符组(如果最后一个字符组的字母个数不足两个，则可以加一个填充字母X)。\n3. 将这些字符组依次填入一个五乘五的矩阵中从左到右一行一行的顺序。\n4. 从顶行第一个、第2行第二个到第5行第五个的方式，从上到下依次将字符组排列在五乘五的数字矩阵中行低位排列好后，然后再转置此矩阵来得到一个五乘五的网格。\n5. 最后，将得到的加密字符串输出。\n\n### CryptoSquare解密步骤：\n1. 首先，将加密字符串分割为以2个字母为一组的列表。\n2. 然后，检查列表中每个组的字符数，不完整的一组加一额外字母X。\n3. 将2组字符并成一个更大的字符串，并在2组后加入额外的字母X(如果需要的话)。\n4. 将该字符串组合成长度为5个ASCII字符的字符串，然后从上到下填充到五乘五的数字矩阵中。\n5. 改变矩阵列的排列，使得每个字符填充到正确的行和列中，并返回一个5乘5的网格。\n6. 将该网格从上到下，从左到右转换为一个加密串。\n7. 最后，该加密串匹配明文字符串，将所有字母转换为小写，并移除额外的字母X。\n\n### 主要代码：\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef encryption(text):\n    # 转换为大写并移除短横线\n    text = text.replace('-', '').upper()\n    \n    # 填充间隔并从获取长度\n    length_text = 2 * int(np.ceil(len(text) / 2))\n    text += 'x' * (length_text - len(text))\n\n    # 创建网格矩阵\n    grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=np.uint8)\n\n    # 填充网格矩阵\n    by2 = [text[i * 2:i * 2 + 2] for i in range(length_text // 2)]\n    grid.flat[[-1 if (i % 2) == 0 and i < len(grid) else 0 for i in range(len(by2))]] = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in\n                                                                                      by2]\n\n    # 转置\n    grid = grid.transpose()\n\n    # 弄成字符串\n    res = ''\n    for i in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not np.isnan(grid[i][j]):\n                res += chr(grid[i][j] + ord('A'))\n\n    return res\n\n\ndef decryption(text):\n    # 分割字符串\n    by2 = [text[i * 2:i * 2 + 2] for i in range(len(text) // 2)]\n\n    # 添加额外的X\n    if len(by2) != len(set(by2)):\n        while len(by2) != len(set(by2)):\n            by2.append('xz')\n\n    # 创建要填充的网格\n    grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=np.uint8)\n\n    # 按顺序填充网格\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            grid[i, j] = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in by2[i] if c.isalpha()][j]\n\n    # 网格转置\n    grid = grid.transpose()\n\n    # 转换为字符串\n    res = ''\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if not np.isnan(grid[i, j]):\n                res += chr(grid[i][j] + ord('A'))\n\n    # 返回移除了额外的X的大写字符串\n    return res.upper().replace('X', '').replace('Z', '')\n``` 为了解释在Python中实现秋冬运动服加密及解密方法，采用以下步骤：\n\n### Winter Sports加密步骤：\n1. 我们首先删除明文中所有的空格，并将所有字母转换为大写；将除字母 'J' 以外的所有字母转换为大写；如果汉字是两个字节，将它们分开。\n2. 然后，我们将明文按两个字母一组进行分类：如果其中一个字母是 'J' 可以用空间填充，否则可以用 'X' 进行填充。\n3. 接下来，将这些字符组依次填入一个五乘五的矩阵中，从左到右一行一行的顺序。\n4. 从顶行第一个、第2行第二个到第5行第五个的方式，从上到下依次将字符组排列在五乘五的数字矩阵中。对排列好的矩阵进行转置，以达到5乘5的板式。\n5. 最后，我们输出所得的加密字符串。\n\n### Winter Sports解密步骤：\n1. 首先我们从密文中以两个字母一组进行分类；如果每个组内字母个数不一，我们要求字母个数差为1，即在最后一组字母后填充 'X'(如果需要的话)。\n2. 然后，我们将这些字母有序的添加到一个更大的字符串中。有添加额外字符时，我们将其包括在加密字符串中。\n3. 我们将加密字符串转换为一个长度为5的ASCII数组，则5乘5且从上至下顺序填充加密字符串。\n4. 在从上向下依次填充的基础上，进行网格转置，以达到5乘5的板式，形成加密矩阵。\n5. 最后，我们使用转置后的网格，从上到下，从左到右将这些字符转换为明文字符串，移除额外的字母 'X'。\n\n### 主要代码：\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef encryption(text):\n    # 转换为大写并移除些字母\n    clean_text = text.replace(' ', '').replace('-', '').replace('J', '')\n    \n    # 填充间隔并从获取长度\n    length_text = 2 * int(np.ceil(len(clean_text) / 2))\n    if length_text % 2 != 0:\n        clean_text += 'X'\n\n    # 创建网格矩阵\n    grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=np.uint8)\n\n    # 填充网格矩阵\n    by2 = [clean_text[i * 2:i * 2 + 2] for i in range(length_text // 2)]\n    for i in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if i < len(by2) and j < len(by2[i]):\n                grid[i, j] = [ord(c) - ord('A') for c in by2[i] if c.isalpha()][j]\n\n    # 输出加密字符串\n    return ''.join([chr(c + ord('A')) for c in grid.T.flatten()])\n\n\ndef decryption(enc_text):\n    # 分割字符串\n    by2 = [enc_text[i * 2:i * 2 + 2] for i in range(len(enc_text) // 2)]\n\n    if len(by2) != len(set(by2)):\n        while len(by2) != len(set(by2)):\n           ",
