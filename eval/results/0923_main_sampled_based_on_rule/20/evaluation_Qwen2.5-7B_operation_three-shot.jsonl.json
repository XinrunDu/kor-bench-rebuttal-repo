You can also apply it to operations with three integral elements. Once you have finished, provide the new question or operation rule in a comment. ### New Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements a, b, and c arranged such that they add up to 10, find the values of X, Y, and Z. In this rule, X represents the sum of b and c, while Y represents the sum of a and c, and Z represents the sum of a and b.\n\n### First Question:\n\nCompute X, Y, and Z for the operation rule with a = 3, b = 4, and c = 4. \n\nX = [[7]], Y = [[7]], Z = [[6]]\n\nThat was a simple rule. Now, let's try a more challenging one. \n\n### Second Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements a, b, and c arranged as a < b < c, find the values of m, n, and o. Here, m represents the square root of b, n represents the product of a and c, and o represents the number of digits in c. \n\nNote: If a number has only one digit, consider it as zero. For example, the number 21 has two digits, so consider it as 021 and its number of digits is 3. \n\n### Third Question:\n\nCompute m, n, and o for the first operation rule with a = 5, b = 8, and c = 10.\n\nm = [[2]], n = [[50]], o = [[2]]\n\n### Fourth Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements A, B, and C arranged such that B = 2 * A and C = B + 2, find the values of p, q, and r. Here, p represents the sum of A and B, q represents the product of B and C, and r represents the number of zeros at the end of C. \n\nNote: Consider a number as having one zero at the end if it is a multiple of 10.\n\n### Fifth Question:\n\nCompute p, q, and r for the second operation rule with A = 6, B = 12, and C = 14.\n\np = [[18]], q = [[168]], r = [[0]]\n\n### Sixth Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements x, y, and z arranged such that x + y + z = 20, find the values of s, t, and u. Here, s represents the sum of x and y, t represents the product of y and z, and u represents the number of distinct numbers among x, y, and z.\n\nNote: A number is considered distinct only if it occurs once in the arrangement. So, if x = 5, y = 5, and z = 10, then the number of distinct numbers is 2 because 5 occurs twice and 10 occurs only once.\n\n### Seventh Question:\n\nCompute s, t, and u for the third operation rule with x = 7, y = 8, and z = 5.\n\ns = [[15]], t = [[40]], u = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 8:\nEvaluate m, n, and o for the fourth operation rule with A = 4, B = 8, and C = 10.\n\nm = [[4]], n = [[40]], r = [[1]]\n\n### QUESTION 9:\nDetermine p, q, and r for the fifth operation rule with a = 20, b = 60, and c = 80.\n\np = [[80]], q = [[4800]], r = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 10:\nCalculate s, t, and u for the sixth operation rule with x = 6, y = 9, and z = 5.\n\ns = [[15]], t = [[45]], u = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 11:\nGiven the elements X, Y, and Z arranged such that X < Y < Z, find the values of w, x, and y. Here, w represents the sum of X and Y, x represents the product of Y and Z, and y represents the number of negative digits in Z.\n\nNote: A digit in the number Z is considered negative if it is a negative sign. For a two-digit number, consider the second digit as a negative sign. If Z = -21, then its number of negative digits is 1 because only the second digit is a negative sign.\n\n### QUESTION 12:\n\nCompute w, x, and y for the sixth operation rule with X = -10, Y = 15, and Z = 20.\n\nw = [[5]], x = [[300]], y = [[0]]",
