It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k",

These rules cover a specific puzzle or a broader topic.\n\nAdvanced rules, which you should implement, cover consecutive steps in a sequence of modifications, as well as circumstances following processing or special handling that occurs before or after each step. These rules aim to apply a series of structural changes or transformations on a dataset.\n\nFor regular rules, apply a fixed set of changes consistently to a dataset during each transformation step. To create a regular rule, you need to propose a scenario and the elements that make up this rule, specify the part of the dataset you want to transform and perform the transformations.\n\nFor advanced rules, choose one or more elements, generate a rule whose goal is to process these elements, apply custom processing, and calculate results per element. If a step fails to generate a new word or transforms the dataset in an undesired or incorrect manner, identify the cause and reimplement the rules. In some cases where no solution is found, respond accordingly.\n\nIf you need to refer to specific rules, use the keywords 'normal rules', and 'advanced rules'.\n\nStart your responses with '{}'.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

Finally, every number stipulated in the list must be used precisely as outlined, in a manner that is non-repetitive.\n\"4 5 1 7\" does not match \"[[1+(7*4-5)]]\" \", write the correct answer.\nI do like this:\n4 5 1 7\n[[(7*4-5)+1]] (2>[E]): 2 is the first number in the answer\n\"\"\"\n\ncoder = \"\"\"\nYou are a sophisticated AI coding system that can code in any programming language. I will provide an problem and you will solve it. You'll use plain English so even someone who has never programmed before can understand it.You may divide the problem into two and three programs if you want. Not every programming question requires a three-program solution.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on an n*n grid, and the numbers 1 to n should appear only once in the grid.\n2. The numbers must be arranged in order, i.e. 1 next to 2, 2 next to 3, and so on, up to n.\n3. The numbers can be arranged horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n4. The problem is given in the form of a matrix, with blank squares filled with X's, and the player's squares replaced with numbers.\n\n### Question:\n17        11        X        X        X\nX        28        X        5        X\nX        X        18        X        24\nX        25        X        9        X\nX        X        20        21        16\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in. List the numbers in the order from left to right, and from top to bottom. Separate each number with a space, and separate different rows with a comma.\nWrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[17 12 16 32 31,11 28 29 5 30,18 13 14 15 24,25 26 27 9 23,20 21 19 22 16]]\n\n### Question:\n8  X  30  X  X  X  X  X\n7  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  29  X  X  X  X  X\n20  X  27  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in.

I know that to get those grids is computationally hard or just impossible. But it doesnt mean such grids don't exist.\n\nThe reason i asked is i am not able to obtain the grids he wants.\n\nTo justify myself: I get absolutely no money from solving OP puzzles even if now i get upvotes from everyone else. I had fun solving his first puzzles, but i started to hate it by this time.\n\nI don't intend to continue. Just needed to clarify.\n\nTo Jarvis: i wouldn't recommend sending any more grid problems. I want to offend anyone. I like to contribute, but not for these.\n\nI think my first time posting any of the puzzle was on June 19. And now it's already mid July, and there are already over 40 new puzzles pasted since then.\n\nYour math is correct. And if you count the reblogs per original post, that number increases even more. So, it's not just like someone is creating them and posting them, it's a pretty much a daily habit with OP.\n\nIf he would post the images, it would be way easier to just skip 'em. I've seen people mention to him in comments that most people don't know math that well, but he is still continuing.\n\nI think I already mentioned it couple times too that it would be better if he would post them as gif animations instead of text, it's easier for people without math knowledge to understand, and it would be way easier to scroll (I would have added a lot more of my solves, so they are easier to skip, but I think there is some character limit for gif).\n\nMight skip those from now on, until he decides to pick another grid (and if at all).\n\nThe point is that we need to clearly distinguish the puzzle from the answer. But OP's posts mix the two together so tightly that we cannot do that. Like you said, if OP format",

The solution does not depend on any mathematical properties of the problem.\nBut of course your IntelliJ AI does know about Python. IntelliJ is an IDE which among other things has a feature that they're coded as yellow light bulbs right beside symptoms of the problem, and clicking them should result in one of two dials being dragged into the Python editor.\nNow after an unspecified number of extremely confused-by-computer-science tries, where I somehow ended up creating 5 different orgs, SymPyCloud and SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS on GitHub but SymPyCloud stuck at using TensorFlow 2.8 while SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS can't work out how to check out SymPyCloud because it's already existing... sufficient said.\nI finally accomplished that purple item at the bottom was most easily delivered by:\n upgrading the Python to 3.10.6 [nice!] and then powering up Docker and Mamba (conda alternative for Docker) and (after applying some bugfixes to the requirements.txt) finally I got to the point where I can run examples of the DeepDiff, satisfies, and SimpleHistory modules \"out of the box\".\nFIXMiND can be courtesy of Spiria, the existing vendor used by the OODA Team who maintain IntelliApp. Not invented here but am grateful.\n",

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n",

Please make sure that your answer is a list with n sublists with each of them being of length n. And you should show your answer with all X, A and number interlaced.\nConsider using a three-level list to represent the matrix (first level: rows, second level: columns, third level: matrix elements). Ensure that the question and answer pairs are provided in chronological order, as their identification relies on their order.\nOne possible solution is:\n1. Initialize a 3-dimensional list with the dimensions of the problem (n x n x 4).\n2. Fill the list with a 2-dimensional list of the problem, replacing X with ['X', 0, 0, 0], A with ['A', 0, 0, 0] and 1, 2, 3 or 4 in the corresponding rows and columns. Ensure that the values are consistent to represent blank squares, mines, and numbers in the matrix.\n3. Update the 3-dimensional list based on the surrounding values.\n4. Ideally, all rows of the solution should be equal, as all columns should be equal based on the rules of this problem.\nIt is worth noting that some questions can have multiple solutions. It is important to select the most recent answer as the correct answer based on the order in which these pairs are provided.\nThe answer should be an n×n matrix similar to the question, consisting of X (for empty), A (for mines), and numbers.\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\n\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1 X X 1 4 X X 2,X 1 1 1 X X 2 X,2 X 2 X 2 X 1 2,X 2 X 3 1 1 4 1,1 1 X X X X 2 X,3 4 2 X 2 4 X 3,2 1 X 2 3 X X 1,1 X 3 2 2 X X 4]]\nVariables:\nFirst argument: n x n matrix representing the puzzle with X represents unknown squares, A represents mines, and numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 representing how many mines are in the surrounding (8 squares including the diagonal)\nSecond argument: n x n matrix representing the solution of the puzzle with X represents unknown squares, A represents mines, and numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4 representing how many mines are in the surrounding (8 squares including the diagonal)\nThird argument: list of tuples representing the positions of all question marks in the original puzzle\n**** You should return: \"True\", if the solution is solved with completely logically, but without guessing. Note the beginner mode for solving Minesweeper challenges allowing guessing which mode we're not interested in, here - we are solving logically. But even then, many puzzles are not solvable logically, unwillingly forcing us to guess the answer. So you should also return \"False\" if the solution is correct and fully logical.\n**** Do not cheat, return 0 if the solution is not logical or even wrong.\nCondition 1:\n-> For each question mark, there is a single mine or blank filled square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 2:\n-> Every number is a correct summary of filled squares with mines in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 3:\n-> For each A (for mines), there are not less than 1 non-understood square in its 8-neighborhood\nCondition 4",

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.
