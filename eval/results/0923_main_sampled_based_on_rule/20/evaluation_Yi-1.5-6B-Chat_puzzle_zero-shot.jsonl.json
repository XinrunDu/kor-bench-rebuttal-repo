Since 'O' is the first letter of a multi-digit number, it cannot represent 0. So, 'O' must represent a number greater than 0.\n2. Let's start by looking at the units place. The sum of 'E' + 'E' + 'O' ends in 'U'. In the numbers from 0-9, the only number that satisfies this condition for 'U' is 4 when 'O' = 2 (since 'E' cannot equal 0 or 'O', and 2 + 2 + 2 mod 10 = 4). So, 'E' ≠ 2, implying 'E' = 1 (1 + 1 + 'O' mod 10 = 4, which works for 'O' = 2).\n3. Now we have 'E' = 1 and 'O' = 2. This leaves us with 'N', 'W', 'N', and 'R' (as in FOUR). Since 'N' cannot be 0 or 'O' (which is 2), 'N' = 9. This also means 'W' and 'R' must be the same number since they are paired in the equation.

It can't be 0, so P must be 1 or greater.\n- E (from EAT and APPLE): E must be 5 since there's only one digit that can repeat across the equation and E is the only repeated letter (EAT + EAT would give ATEATEAT), but E is also the only single-digit letter in APPLE. This means E=5.\n- L (from APPLE): L must be 2 or greater. It can't be 5 or 8 because those are already taken by P and A. So, L=2 or L=3 or L=4.\n- T (from EAT and THAT): T must be 0 since it's the first letter of a two-digit number in THAT, and it can't be 0 (rule established, so T=0).\n- The remaining numbers (0-9) must be assigned to the remaining letters A and T: A=1, since T=0, and the only remaining digit for A is 1.\n\nNow, let's verify the solution with the equation:\n- A=1\n- E=5\n- L=2 (chosen from 3 or 4 as it fits after A and P)\n- P=6 (chosen from 1 or greater, not already assigned to another letter)\n- T=0\n- W=3 (chosen for the remaining number, ensuring no letter represents 0 or a number already assigned)\n\nThus, the solution is:\n[[A=1, E=5, L=2, P=6, T=0, W=3]]",

        "response": "To solve this custom puzzle, we need to find the correct operation symbols and numbers from 0 to 9 to create an equation that equals 17, following the normal order of operations.\n\nGiven the equation format:\n\n? / ? + ? + ? + ? = 17\n\nLet's start by identifying which numbers and operation symbols we can use from 0 to 9 without the division symbol being the first operation in the sequence. Division can't be the first operation because it would require the left operand to be non-zero, which isn't guaranteed with all sets of numbers. Therefore, division can only be applied as the second operation after the first operation has been performed on one of the numbers.\n\n**Feasible Solution:**\n\nLet's start with 9 (to cover the possibility of multiplication by 9, which is the highest single-digit number):\n\n9 / ? + ? * ? + ? + ? = 17\n\nSince the goal is to end up with 17, we know that after the initial operation is performed, we need to adjust the numbers to reach 17. Let's try to multiply or subtract from 9 first, as addition or subtraction won't change the fact that we're starting with 9.\n\nWe can try the following operations to reach a number close to 17:\n\n- Subtract 1 to get 8.\n- Subtract 2 to get 7.\n- Subtract 3 to get 4.\n- Add 2 to get 6.\n- Multiply by 2 to get 14.\n- Subtract 1 to get 13.\n- Multiply by 2 to get 26.\n- Subtract 9 to get 17.\n\nNow, we have a sequence that allows us to use the operations:\n\n9 - 1 * 2 + 3 + 2 = 17\n\nThis sequence shows that we subtract 1 from 9, then multiply the result by 2 (9 - 1 = 8, 8 * 2 = 16), and finally add 3 and 2 to reach 17. However, this sequence doesn't directly use the division operation as required by the rule. Let's rethink our strategy:\n\n**Revised Solution:**\n\nWe can approach this by trying to directly use the division operation within the sequence. Let's start by dividing 9 by 3, which gives us 3. We then need to add three numbers to get to 17.\n\n9 / 3 = 3\n\nNow we need to add three numbers to 3 to get to 17:\n\n3 + ? + ? + ? = 17\n\nWe can't use 9 or 8 directly because dividing by 9 or 8 would significantly change the outcome. Let's use smaller numbers for the addition to minimize the impact on the starting point of 3:\n\n3 + 4 + 2 + ? = 17\n\nNow we need to find the value of the last unknown that will sum with 4, 2, and 3 to give us 17. That value is 8 (17 - 3 - 4 - 2 = 8).\n\nSo the equation with all values filled in is:\n\n9 / 3 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 17\n\nThis meets all the criteria of the puzzle rule, using the division symbol as the second operation in the sequence. Enclosed in double brackets, the equation is:\n\n[[9/3 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 17 ]]",

One possible solution is:\n\n```\n[[5 × 7 - (7 ÷ 2)]]\n```\n\nFirst, we perform the division inside the parentheses: \\(7 ÷ 2 = 3.5\\).\nThen, we multiply 5 by the result of the division: \\(5 × 3.5 = 17.5\\).\nFinally, we subtract the result of the division from the product: \\(17.5 - 3.5 = 14\\).\n\nHowever, this does not lead to the correct solution of 24.

The last column and row have the sums of the numbers in their respective rows or columns. For example, the last row has a 40, indicating that the sum of the numbers in the fourth row must be 40.\n\n2. **Identifying the Target Sums**: We can see the target sums for each row and column except for the last cell in each row.

In the last column, for example, we can see the sum of the numbers in the last column must be 23. Given the blank spaces, we can place numbers to make this sum true. Apply a similar process for the last row summing to 40.\n\n4. **Filling in the Remaining Cells**: After filling in the simple sums, look for other clues. Sometimes, partially filled rows or columns may guide you to place numbers elsewhere. In this case, we might look for numbers that, when placed in a blank cell, reduce the remaining sum in a row or column to a number from the pre-filled grid.\n\n5. **Solving for Unknowns**: After filling in as many cells as possible using logic, we'll reach a point where some cells are blank but we know the sums for their respective rows or columns. These are the cells where we'll place our last unknown numbers. For each of these cells, you subtract the sum of the cells in the same row or column that is not blank from the target sum.

The player's goal is to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\nX  X  X  X  5\nX  X  X  X  7\nX  X  X  X  6\nX  X  X  X  5\n3   9   4   6\n```\n\nFrom the rule 2 (column weights), we know the weights for each column from 1 to 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\nFrom the rule 3 (row weights), we know the weights for each row from 1 to 5 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\n\nNow, let's use these weights to fill in the matrix:\n\n```\n1  2  3  4 + 5 = 5\n2  3  4  5 + 7\n3  4  5  6 + 6\n4  5  6  7 + 5\n5  6  7  8 + 6\n```\n\nWe need to place black cells in such a way that the sum (number of black cells in the row or column times the respective weight) equals the given number.\n\nAfter filling the weights in the matrix, we can see that the columns already respect the sum because:\n- Column 1: (1) * 1 = 1\n- Column 2: (2) * 2 = 4\n- Column 3: (3) * 3 = 9\n- Column 4: (4) * 4 = 16\n- Column 5: (5) * 5 = 25\n\nHowever, to satisfy the rule 4, we need to find where to place the black cells in the rows to make the sums match the given numbers.\n\nLet's start with the first row:\n```\n5 - 1 = 4\n```\nTo satisfy this, we need to blacken 4 cells in the first row. The only way to achieve this without overlapping with the existing Xs (since the weight of the first row is 1) is to blacken 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the first row.\n\nWe can continue this process for each row until we meet all the constraints. After solving all rows, we get:\n\n```\n1  2  3  4  5\nX  X  X  X  7\n2  3  4  5  6\nX  X  X  X  5\n3  4  5  6  X\n```\n\nThe final answer is to blacken the cells as follows:\n- Row 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- Row 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n- Row 3: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n- Row 4: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n- Row 5: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nWrapping the answer in double square brackets: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]].",

However, since we only have 7 columns, not all cells can be black. We place 4 black cells in the first column and 3 in the second column. The rest are X (empty).\n   - Repeat this process for each row and column, ensuring the sum of black cells equals the given number for that row or column.\n\n3. **Solve the Puzzle**:\n   - After applying the rule, the grid will look something like this:\n     ```\n     1  1  1  1  1  1  1\n     1  1  1  1  1  1  1\n     1  1  1  1  1  1  1\n     0  1  1  1  1  1  1\n     1  0  1  1  1  1  1\n     1  1  0  1  1  1  1\n     1  1  1  0  1  1  1\n     ```\n   - The numbers 0 and 1 represent whether a cell is black (1) or empty (0). \n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer in the requested format is: [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n\nNote: The explanation provided simplifies the process of solving the puzzle.

We'll use a process of elimination for each cell, trying out numbers based on the constraints until we find a valid placement.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step using these rules:\n\nGiven Puzzle:\nX X X X X X X 6 9\nX 3  X 5  X X X X 2\nX X 6  4  8  X 1  3  7\n9  X X 2  4  X X X 1\n X 6  2  X 5  X 7  X X\n X X X X 7  X X X X\n5  X 3  X X X X X X\n6  7  8  X 9  4  3  2  X\n X 9  4  3  X 5  8  X X\n\nNow, solving the puzzle:\n\n1. **Filling cells with numbers**:\n   - (1,1), (1,5), (2,2), (2,6), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (4,7), (5,4), (5,6), (6,6), (6,8), (7,1), (7,7), (7,8), (8,4), (8,7), (9,2), (9,5) are filled with numbers 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Filling remaining cells**:\n   - Continue filling in the cells using the Sudoku rules, which involve checking the current row, column, and subgrid to ensure no repetition.\n\n   - Example of solving process:\n     - Place a 9 in (2,8) since it's the only spot for a 9 in its column considering the current grid state.\n     - Place a 7 in (3,7) since it's the only spot for a 7 in its row.\n     - Continue this method, filling in cells one by one, remembering to maintain the Sudoku constraints.\n\nAfter filling in all legal numbers, ensuring there are no repetitions across rows, columns, and subgrids, we obtain the solved puzzle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[1 8 4 2 5 9 7 3 6],\n [7 3 2 5 6 1 8 4 9],\n [9 6 5 4 8 3 2 7 1],\n [9 5 7 2 4 6 1 8 3],\n [4 6 8 1 3 5 9 2 7],\n [3 2 1 7 9 8 5 6 4],\n [5 4 3 9 7 2 6 1 8],\n [6 7 8 3 1 4 5 9 2],\n [2 9 4 6 8 7 3 5 1]]\n\nThis format provides each element from left to right for each row, separated by commas, and each row is separated by a comma.

Each row and each column contains numbers from 1 to 6, without repetition.\n2. The regions indicated by the coordinates have specific operations applied to the sum of the numbers.\n\nGiven the coordinates and their requirements:\n\n- (1,1),(2,1): 6 *\n- (1,2),(2,2): 7 +\n- (1,3),(2,3): 12 *\n- (1,4),(1,5),(1,6): 20 *\n- (2,4),(2,5): 3 ÷\n- (5,5),(6,5): 3 ÷\n- (2,6),(3,6): 2 ÷\n- (5,1),(6,1): 2 ÷\n- (3,1),(3,2),(4,1): 11 +\n- (3,3),(4,2),(4,3): 2 *\n- (3,4),(4,4): 2 -\n- (5,2),(6,2): 2 -\n- (5,3),(5,4): 2 -\n- (3,5),(4,5): 3 -\n- (6,3),(6,4): 7 +\n- (4,6),(5,6),(6,6): 11 +\n\nWe can start by filling in the regions with the specified numbers:\n\n- The region (1,1),(2,1) is marked with a *, which means we need to find two numbers that multiply to 6. The numbers could be 1 and 6, so we place 6 at (1,1) and 1 at (2,1).\n- The region (1,2),(2,2) is marked with a +, so we place 7 at (1,2) and 6 (from (2,1)) at (2,2).\n- The region (1,3),(2,3) is marked with a *, so we need to find two numbers that multiply to 12. The numbers could be 2 and 6, so we place 6 at (1,3) and 2 at (2,3).\n- The region (1,4),(1,5),(1,6) is marked with a *, so we need to find three numbers that multiply to 20. The numbers could be 4, 5, and 1, so we place 4 at (1,4), 5 at (1,5), and 1 at (1,6).\n- The region (2,4),(2,5) is marked with 3 ÷, so the sum of the numbers in this region is 3. Since it's not a straight calculation, we need to find numbers that add up to 3 when the division operation is applied. The only way to achieve this is to have one of the numbers as 1 (since 1 is a factor of 3). So, we place 1 at (2,4) and another 2 at (2,5) (since 1 + 2 = 3 after division).\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the grid:\n\n- The region (5,5),(6,5) is marked with 3 ÷, so the sum of the numbers in this region is 3. This means one of the numbers must be 1. We already used 1 for the previous region, so we place 1 at (5,5) and another one at (6,5).\n- The region (2,6),(3,6) is marked with 2 ÷, so we need to find numbers such that their sum divided by 2 equals a whole number. One possible combination is 2 and 6 (since 2 ÷ 2 = 1), so we place 6 at (2,6) and 2 at (3,6).\n- The region (5,1),(6,1) is marked with 2 ÷. We need to find numbers such that their sum divided by 2 equals a whole number. This is tricky since we don't have a clear pair that can be divided by 2 to get a whole number. However, we notice that the sum of these numbers needs to result in a whole number when divided by 2. Given the constraints and the existing sum of 2 ÷-marked regions, we can place 2 at (5,1) and 1 at (6,1) to satisfy the requirement.\n\n- The region (3,1),(3,2),(4,1) is marked with 11 +. We need to find three numbers that add up to 11. The numbers could be 4, 3, and 4 (since 4 + 3 + 4 = 11), so we place 4 at (3,1), 3 at (3,2), and another 4 at (4,1).\n- The region (3,3),(4,2),(4,3) is marked with 2 *. We need to find numbers such that when one number is multiplied by 2, the sum of the numbers equals a whole number. One possible combination is 5 and 1 (since 5 * 2 = 10), so we place 5 at (3,3), 1 at (4,2), and another 1 (to make 2 * 1 = 2) at (4,3).\n- The region (3,4),(4,4) is marked with 2 -. This region should result in a whole number when the last number is subtracted from the sum of the other two numbers. One possible combination is 3 and 4 (since 3 - 4 = -1), so we place 3 at (3,4) and 4 at (4,4).\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining regions and try to find the numbers that fit the requirements:\n\n- The region (5,2),(6,2) is marked with 2 -. Since we already used the numbers 3 and 4 for the previous region, and the requirement is for a negative number, we place 4 at (5,2) and 3 at (6,2).\n- The region (5,3),(5,4),(5,6),(6,6) is marked with 2 -. We have already used 2 in the previous region, so we need to find numbers that add up to a number that, when 2 is subtracted, gives a positive result. One possible combination is 3 and 4, so we place 3 at (5,3), 4 at (5,4), 5 (to achieve 2 - 3 = -1) at (5,6), and 6 (to achieve 2 - 4 = -2) at (6,6).\n- The region (4,6),(5,6),(6,6) is marked with 11 +. We need to find three numbers that add up to 11. Given the constraints, we can place 1 at (4,6), 5 at (5,6), and 5 (since 5 + 5 - 1 = 9, and we need to add 2 more to reach 11) at (6,6).\n- The region (6,3),(6,4) is marked with 7 +. We need to find numbers that add up to 7. The numbers could be 3 and 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7), so we place 3 at (6,3) and 4 at (6,4).\n\nNow, let's fill in the rest of the grid with the numbers we've found:\n\n- We have already placed 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 at various positions. The rest of the numbers are filled in as follows: 6 at (4,2) to satisfy the 3 ÷-marked region, and 2 and 3 at (3,5) and (4,5) for the 3 --marked region.\n\nSo, the completed grid is:\n\n6 1 2 4 5 3\n5 3 4 2 1 6\n4 5 3 1 6 2\n\nThe puzzle is solved as [[6 1 2 4 5 3, 5 3 4 2 1 6, 4",

Since (1,4) must be less than (2,4), the number in cell (1,4) can only be 1 or 2. But it must be less than (2,4), meaning it can only be 1. So, cell (1,4) is filled with 1.\n\n2. The (2,2) cell must be less than (2,3), so it can only be 1 or 2. Since (1,4) is 1, and we've already placed 1s above it and to its left in the first row and column, (2,2) can only be 2.\n\n3. With (2,2) at 2, (2,3) can be either 1 or 3. However, if (2,3) were 3, it would conflict with (3,4) which must be greater than (2,3), making (3,4) 4. But this would make (3,1), which must be greater than (3,4), at least 5, which is not possible. So, (2,3) must be 1.\n\n4. With (2,2) and (2,3) filled with 2 and 1, respectively, (2,1) can only be at most 1. But it must also be greater than (2,4), which can only be a 1 from the first set of constraints. So, (2,1) must be 2.\n\n5. (2,4) is then 1, since it must be less than (3,4), which is the only remaining number for that cell.\n\n6. This leaves (3,2) as 3, since it must be greater than (4,2), which is already a 1.\n\n7. For (3,1) and (3,4), they must both be greater than 1 and less than 4. Since (3,2) is 3, (3,1) must be 4, and (3,4) must be 3, which is already filled by (2,4) earlier.\n\n8.

Letters (↑, ↓, →, ←) will represent the direction of the arrows.\n\nLet's solve this puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Cover the area with numbered square 3**: This area spans five squares (the one with the number and the four adjacent blank squares). We will draw arrows from the left, right, top, and top squares coming from the left. That covers 5 blank squares.\n\n2. **Cover the area with numbered square 7**: This area spans two squares and is already fully covered by the surrounding X regions. No additional arrows are needed.\n\n3. **Cover the area with numbered square 5**: This area spans three squares and is already fully covered by the surrounding X regions. No additional arrows are needed.\n\n4. **Cover the area with numbered square 9**: This area spans two squares (the one with the number and the adjacent blank square). We will draw arrows from the top, left, and right towards the numbered square. That covers 3 blank squares.\n\n5. **Cover the area with numbered square 3 again**: This area is the same as numbered square 3, so we apply the same arrow rules, covering 5 blank squares.\n\n6. **Cover the area with numbered square 4**: This area spans four squares. We will draw arrows from the top squares coming from the left and the top square coming from the right. That covers 4 blank squares.\n\nNow, we output the drawn matrix in the format specified:\n\n```\n3 ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←,\n↓ ↑ 5 ←, ↑ ↓ → ←\n5 ↑ ↓ → ←\n```\n\nHowever, we must adhere to the format specified in the question, which is:\n\n```\n[[5  ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ 5  ←, ↓ ↑ → ←],\n [↓ ↑ 5  ←, ↑ ↓ → ←, 5 ↓ → ←]]\n```\n\nSo, the correct answer in the specified format would be:\n\n```\n[[5  ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ 5  ←, ↓ ↑ → ←],\n [↓ ↑ 5  ←, ↑ ↓ → ←, 5 ↓ → ←]]\n```",

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the puzzle:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: The given grid represents the starting point of the puzzle. We need to place arrows (↑, ↓, →, ←) in a way that meets the conditions of the rule.\n\n2. **Visualize the Puzzle**: For clarity, visualize each numbered square emitting an arrow. Arrows can go in four directions (up, down, left, right) and they cannot overlap. The goal is to cover all blank squares with these arrows, and the number of arrows covering a blank square must equal the number on the numbered square they're pointing from.\n\n3. **Solve the Puzzle Step by Step**: Start by placing arrows from the numbered squares to the corresponding number of blank squares without overlapping any existing arrows. For instance, in the top left corner (X X X X 5), there are 5 blank squares, so place 5 arrows emanating from that square. Similarly, for the 2 in the middle and the 1 in the bottom left, place 2 and 1 arrow respectively.\n\n4. **Arrow Placement Rules**: Remember, arrows cannot cross or overlap with each other. This means you can only place arrows in the direction they are pointing without going through any existing arrows.\n\n5. **Cover All Blanks**: Each blank square must be covered by at least one arrow. Ensure that every blank space is targeted by an arrow.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final answer should be given in the specified format, with arrows listed from left to right, top to bottom, separated by spaces, and each row on a new line. If a square receives arrows from more than one direction, list all directions in order.\n\nLet's solve the puzzle:\n\n```\nX X X X 5  X 2  X X\n X 3  X X X 3  X X X\n9  X X X X X X X X\n X 1  X 1  X 4  X X X\n X X X X 1  X 2  X X\n X X 8  X X X X X X\n X X X X X X 3  X 4\n X X X X X 1  X 7  X\n X 2  X 8  X X X X X\n```\n\nGiven the complexity of the puzzle, a brute-force approach might be lengthy and prone to errors. Instead, focus on strategic placement guided by the rule that each numbered square emits arrows to cover the corresponding number of blank squares around it, without overlap.\n\nAfter carefully applying these rules and dedicating thought to arrow placement that respects all constraints, the final output is:\n\n```\n[[5  ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ 6  ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ 3  → ←, \n ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ ↓ → ←, ↓ 7  → ←, \n ↑ → ←, ↑ → ←, 8  → ←, 7  → ←, ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, \n ↓ ↑ ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←, ↑ → ←, ↓ ↑ → ←]]\n```\n\nEach numbered square's arrows are represented in the output, following the left-to-right, top-to-bottom order and respecting the puzzle's guidelines.",

Since the question specifies that there is only 1 star, we are looking for one star placement in each region.\n\n3. **Placement of Stars**: We must place a single star in each region without it being adjacent to any other stars.

No 'A' here.\n- **Square 2 (2nd row, 4th column):** 8 mines around it. This is a clue; mark all mines 'A' in squares around it. \n- Apply this method across the grid, marking 'A' in squares adjacent to each number where applicable.\n\nAfter marking all squares according to the number clues and rule, we get:\n\n[[A A A, A 2  2,2  3  A],\n[A A A,3  A  A,A  A  1],\n[A A A,A  A  A,A  3  1],\n[A A A,3  A  A,2  A  A],\n[A 2  3,A  A  A,A  A  1],\n[A A A,A  A  A,A  A  A],\n[A A A,2  A  A,A  A  A],\n[A A A,A  A  1,A  A  A]]\n\nThis solution follows the game's rule of identifying mines and replacing 'X' with 'A' in the squares indicated by the numbers. The final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n```\n[[A A A, A 2  2,2  3  A],\n[A A A,3  A  A,A  A  1],\n[A A A,A  A  A,A  3  1],\n[A A A,3  A  A,2  A  A],\n[A 2  3,A  A  A,A  A  1],\n[A A A,A  A  A,A  A  A],\n[A A A,2  A  A,A  A  A],\n[A A A,A  A  1,A  A  A]]\n```",

This is an invalid configuration, so there must be at least one mine hidden in the unknown square.\n- The square with a 2 on the top row must have at least one mine around it. So, we mark the unknown square to the left of it as having a mine.\n- The square with a 2 on the left column must have at least one mine around it. So, we mark the unknown square above it as having a mine.\n\nUpdating the grid with the marked mines:\n\n```\n1\t2\t*\t2\t1\t*\t *\n*\t *\t *\t *\t *\t *\t2\n1\t *\t3\t *\t *\t *\t *\n *\t1\t *\t *\t2\t *\t2\n1\t *\t *\t2\t3\t2\t2\n1\t2\t2\t *\t *\t *\t *\n *\t *\t *\t *\t *\t1\t *\n```\n\nThe marked mines indicate the positions of the mines in the grid.
