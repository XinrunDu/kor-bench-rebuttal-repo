Let's start by converting the given formula into its conjunctive normal form (CNF) and then apply the resolution algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Convert to CNF\nThe given formula is: \\(p ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ r)\\)\n\nSince all expressions are already in the form of disjunctions connected by conjunctions, we don't need to apply any distibution laws. The formula is already in CNF:\n\n\\[CNF: \\{p, p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q, q ∨ ¬r, q ∨ r\\}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Resolution Algorithm\nAccording to the Resolution Algorithm, we initialize \\(S0\\) and \\(S2\\) as empty sets, and \\(S1\\) as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the CNF.\n\n\\[S1 = \\{p, p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q, q ∨ ¬r, q ∨ r\\}\\]\n\n### Iteration 1: Resolve clauses in \\(S0\\) and \\(S1\\)\nSince \\(S0\\) is initially empty, we skip this step and move to resolving clauses in \\(S1\\).\n\n### Iteration 2: Resolve clauses in \\(S1\\)\nWe'll look for pairs of clauses where one contains a literal and the other contains its complement. Note that in the initial \\(S1\\), no such pair exists, as no literal and its negation are in the same set at this stage. Therefore, no clauses are resolved, and \\(S2\\) remains empty.\n\n### Check \\(S2\\)\nSince \\(S2\\) is empty, we output “Plausible” and terminate the calculation.\n\n### Output and Number of Cycles\nThe output of the resolution algorithm for the given formula is “Plausible”. Since we never needed to iterate through the process of adding \\(S1\\) to \\(S0\\) and setting \\(S1\\) to \\(S2\\) due to the nature of the initial formula (it resolved immediately), we only technically counted the initial state as one cycle for the purposes of counting iterations in the context of the algorithm's iterative steps, even though it didn't involve a resolution operation. Therefore, the number of cycles it iterates is 1.\n\n### Answer in the Format [[output];[number]]\n[[\"Plausible\"];[1]]\n\nThis answer reflects the direct application of the resolution algorithm to the given CNF formula, showcasing how the algorithm quickly identifies a satisfiable (\"Plausible\") outcome due to the existence of complementary literals that can be resolved upon initial inspection, without necessitating the full iterative sequence of the algorithm's steps as defined for cases where iterative resolution is required.",

In abbreviated form, it is: [A: All IS are NOT P: DID NOT PAY TAXES].\n- Inspector C: \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\" This is a Particular Affirmative (I) proposition, indicating that at least one member of the subject (individual businesses) possesses the predicate property (have paid taxes). In abbreviated form, it is: [I: Some IS are P: HAVE PAID TAXES].\n\nAccording to the relationships between declarative propositions, the relationship between A propositions and I propositions is \"%\". This is because if the universal proposition is true (A), the particular proposition (I) must also be true. Conversely, if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition must be false.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types is:\n\n[[%]]",

The conclusion ∃S⇒¬P suggests we are looking for a mood that leads to a conclusion involving the existential quantifier and the negation of P.\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, we can structure a syllogism as follows:\n\n1. P()M (This matches the structure of Figure II)\n2. M()S\n3. ∴S()¬P\n\nHowever, our conclusion is actually ∃S⇒¬P, which means we need a conclusion involving ¬P, not just P()¬M. The structure we've derived isn't directly matching our conclusion but is a step in identifying the correct figure. Let's correct our approach to directly match the moods with the given premises and conclusion.\n\nGiven the structure of the conclusion ∃S⇒¬P, we are looking for a mood that allows us to deduce an existential conclusion involving the negation of P from the given premises. \n\nThe premises:\n1. ∀P⇒¬M: For all P, there is no M (universal negative).\n2. ∃S⇒M: There exists S such that M holds (existential affirmative).\n\nThe conclusion:\n∃S⇒¬P: There exists S such that not P holds (existential negative).\n\nGiven these premises and the desired conclusion, we need to find a valid mood that starts with an existential affirmation (M()) and leads to an existential negation (S()¬P) in a way that aligns with the valid moods for each figure.\n\nThe closest form that aligns with our desired conclusion and starts with an existential statement (∃S⇒M) would be:\n\n- Figure II with the mood EAE, which fits because:\n  - The major term is M, which connects all S.\n  - The minor term is P, which leads to not having any S that matches the premise ∀P⇒¬M.\n  - The conclusion is existential (∃S⇒¬P), which aligns with our goal to show that there exists an S that negates P.\n\nThus, the argument corresponds to:\n[[II];[EAE]]\n\nThis is based on the understanding that we start with an existential affirmation of M for some S (∃S⇒M), then negate M universally for all P (∀P⇒¬M), which logically leads to the conclusion that for some S, not P (∃S⇒¬P), through the EAE mood in Figure II. This syllogism structure, with the given mood, allows us to deduce the conclusion from the premises according to the rules of the specified logic.",
