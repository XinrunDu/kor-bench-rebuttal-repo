Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nConditional Claim:\nA categorical claim that is structured in a unique way. \nIt asserts that a specific relationship exists among the subject, the predicate, and the term that serves as the contrapostulate. The relationship can be either affirmative or negative.\n\nConditional proposition of the affirmative relationship (AC): The knowledge that if all subjects possess a certain predicate, they must respectively possess a certain contrapostulate. Its abbreviation is ARBQ, also known as an affirmative conditional proposition or bi-thesis proposition.\n\nConditional proposition of the negative relationship (NC): The knowledge that if no subject possesses a certain predicate, then all subjects must respectively possess the opposite of the subject. Its abbreviation is ARB¯Q, also known as a negative conditional proposition or anti-disjunction proposition.\n\nUsing English for example:\n- If anything admits of quantity, it must be an accident.\n- If anything is a proper name, then there are plenty of words that do not occur in it at all.\n\nHere are some common exam questions:\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- The Kings of England. If there are kings in England, no one can depose or dethrone them.\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- Owlish faces. Beakers are tall, clear, and narrow. If a face is owlish then it is always beaker-shaped.\n- External relations: All coins are money. If anything is money, the constable can take it away.\n- External relations: According to traditional logic, all gnomes are machines. If there is a mechanical environment, then there are undoubtedly gnomes in it.\n\nCategorize them according to your ability in conjunction with the standardization.\n\n### Question:\nMy brother, for example, always loves to read.

The below input prompt challenge question is only one example of the challenges you may be asked to reason on. Below is a rule for mapping input prompts to challenges you may be asked to solve.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWhen formulating your answer, concentrate on the following considerations:\n\n1.) The structure of the above input statement maps to the rules in the logic_rules document.\n2.) Key features of the above input statement will be important when formulating the logic rules.\n3.) Ultimately, the logical elements of the above input statement need to be accurately mapped to the logic that is configured for a given type of logical reasoning challenge.\n\n### Logic Rules:\n\n1. Compositional Rule: Iterate over the sequences of the input string into sub-strings (sequences), which delimit the logic structure; Then transform each sub-string into a competing proposition; At last integrate every eligible sub-claim and reform it in the type of purpose inference claim.\n\n\"[(Input: Prop1 | Span: SA)] [*(……)] [PassiveAssumption: Span1 | Proposition: Prop2 | Supportor: Prop3]\"\na = Replace '*' with: (Spatial,\nTemporal,\nCausal,\nIntentional,\nEvaluative)\n\tb = Create a new formula (Form: Support,\n\ta\n\tb)\nc = Return the new formula\n\nImplementation method:\n\n1. Input statement sequencing: Input statement analysis, coarsely divide the input statement into binary, cumulative, tripartite and ternary propositions.\n\n2. Delimiting statement sub-structure: extract the premise, relationship and conclusion of sentence collocation.\n\n3. Seamless transformation: The relationship between the input and purpose inference state is atomic, component by component, from the subject, predicate, object, modal modifier, breaking Open the composition of the sentence, mining the fill, and then establishing a test, to achieve a seamless transition!\n\n4. Spatiotemporal claim merging: Examine the relationship between the mined claim propositions and the input, and net out the option that meets the conditions.\n\n5. Spatial claim translation: spatial claim -> temporal claim\n\n6. Go back and fill in the blanks: through various prompt strategies generate the semantic blanks with sentence filling or incomplete word prompts after the initial output is generated\n\na) Spatial / Event > Causal / Spatial > Intentional / Causal > Evaluative / Intentional (Understand causal scenarios such as events/circumstances 1 and 2, infer a certain conclusion from the scenarios and make a prediction based on the conclusion. Common ontological meta-perspective features among the causal scenarios and their corresponding (directed) conclusions)\n\nb) Spatial / Event > Evaluative (Factor analysis of changed event trends or spatial global changes, make a prediction implication)\n\nc) Spatiotemporal scene & & Ensure certain opinion conclusions appear at the same time or under the same conditions\n\nd) Intentional prediction generation: Determine actions or future events by inferring intentions from a state of affairs.\n\n7.

In mathematical terms, if two variables are inversely related, their product is a constant value.\n$x⋅y $f = constant\nAn inverse relationship also has the characteristic that the larger the absolute value of one variable, the smaller the absolute value of the other variable, and vice versa.
