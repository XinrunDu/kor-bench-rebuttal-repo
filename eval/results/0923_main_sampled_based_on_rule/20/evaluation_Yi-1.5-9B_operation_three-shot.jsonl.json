Given a number, n, m consecutive primes starting from 2 are used to create a product ;n ※ m, otherwise if 2,3,5,7 are not consecutive primes, but multiples of them, they could be used.

If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a mathematical formula with mathematical notation, excluding any explanation.\n3. Double-check your final formula to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nCombine the super custom operation called \"s※_n()\" with the standard function \"r()\".\nDefine s※_n(a) when n is greater than 0 and a is an integer such that s※_n(a)=x when s※_{n-1}(x)=a.\nDefine s※_0(a)=a.\nFind (s※_{n-2}+s※_{n-3}+…+s※_0)/(s※_1+s※_2+…+s※_{n-1}), find the final result of the specified time () s※ ().\n\n### Question:\nCalculate x in the path from 0 to 2 in the super custom operation \"s※_2()\".\nThe answer should be a formula without any explanation.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[x+1/1]]\n\n### Question:\nCalculate x in the path from 0 to 3 in the super custom operation \"s※_3()\".\nFind the final result of the () s※ () ietration.\nThe answer should be a formula with the given expression.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your formula]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[s※_{0}+1/(s※_{1}+1/(s※_{2}+...))]]\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a little change to the rule you have learned before: your inputs are now not just numbers, they are function bindings like \"sin()\", \"cos()\" or \"tan()\".\nKeep the same \"s※_2 * ()\" rule.
