These are parts of a person's name, such as a title, middle name, last name, or nickname.\n\nAs a warm-up exercise, let's practice with the names in the lesson:\n- Pei was once _no,_ Manager of Supersoft Company.\n\nUh oh, botched voice recognition again. We'll have to make a guess! Is the missing name a last name? A middle name? Something else? Answer without typechecking.\nIf the missing name is a last name, replaces it with the phrase 'last name'. If the missing name is a middle name, replace it with the phrase 'middle name'.\n Split the names into the parts - Firstname Namelast Middlegap Middle - and check if the answer is in any of them. You need to check them all!\n\"\"\"",

The puzzle is played on an n x n grid, filling in the numbers so that each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition.\n\n2. There are inequality signs (greater than \">\" or less than \"<\") between certain squares in the grid. These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n\n3. Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n\n4.

The numbers should start from 1 and increase by one incorrectly and be the same for each row.\n\nIn the first row, the 1's should be 1, 5, 9 and not start from 1\n\nThese rules are invalid and the formula is incorrect.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. Addition\n2. Exponentiation\n3. Multiplication\n4. Division\n5. Subtraction\n\n### Question:\n! What is the value of 24?\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe question does not include any inputs, so there is no value to calculate. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n[0]\n\n### Question:\n! Can you give me a whole number that is not a factor of 24?\nThe output should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma.\nEnsure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets, like this: [[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe question asks for a whole number that is not a factor of 24. A factor of 24 are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, so anything else other than these numbers will not be a factor of 24. Here are some whole numbers that are not factors of 24: -1, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 163, 165, 167, 169, 171, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 183, 185, 187, 189, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199, 201, 203, 205, 207, 209, 211, 213, 215, 217, 219, 221, 223, 225, 227, 229, 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 253, 255, 257, 259, 261, 263, 265, 267, 269, 271, 273, 275, 277, 279, 281, 283, 285, 287, 289, 291, 293, 295, 297, 299, 301, 303, 305, 307, 309, 311, 313, 315, 317, 319, 321, 323, 325, 327, 329, 331, 333, 335, 337, 339, 341, 343, 345, 347, 349, 351, 353, 355, 357, 359, 361, 363, 365, 367, 369, 371, 373, 375, 377, 379, 381, 383, 385, 387, 389, 391, 393, 395, 397, 399, 401, 403, 405, 407, 409, 411, 413, 415, 417, 419, 421, 423, 425, 427, 429, 431, 433, 435, 437, 439, 441, 443, 445, 447, 449, 451, 453, 455, 457, 459, 461, 463, 465, 467, 469, 471, 473, 475, 477, 479, 481, 483, 485, 487, 489, 491, 493, 495, 497, 499, 501, 503, 505, 507, 509, 511, 513, 515, 517, 519, 521, 523, 525, 527, 529, 531, 533, 535, 537, 539, 541, 543, 545, 547, 549, 5",

Upon clarification, we see that there are no arrows in the statement of the rule, either. This is likely an error of the user who created the format. The rule should give arrow direction as a variable quantity, like '8', or 'directionx'. This might be a kink in the system that must be sorted through with the person who created the format.>\nImagine if you like Ian, a detective, were sent to gather details from a murder scene.

This is possible, not because of the huge size of the grid, but because it directly contradicts a fundamental requirement of the Sudoku-like logic grid described in the rule. A Sudoku-like logic grid requires that the same domain cannot appear more than once in a range a 2x2 matrix. [Namely, a (i*i) cell do. The rules do not mind such a check and would hence allow a simple 2x2 matrix consisting of the domain values a and b to be valid, whereas a 5x5 matrix could contain twice such a 2x2 matrix which would validate where a 2x2 matrix for itself wouldn't be allowed.]\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided.
