C* Principle: This doesn't directly apply here as we're not dealing with stronger or weaker information statements.\n\n2. C% Principle: This principle is about minimalization and speaking as little as possible. C's response is actually longer and more elaborate than necessary, so this principle doesn't apply.\n\n3. C! Principle: This principle states that if a speaker uses a lengthy or marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression.\n\nIn this case, C uses \"managed to get\" instead of simply saying \"bought\" or \"got.\" This is a marked expression that implies additional meaning - specifically, that obtaining the tickets was not easy and required effort.\n\nTherefore, this situation conforms to the C! Principle. The speaker is using a marked expression to convey additional information beyond the basic fact of having tickets.\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\n[[C]]",

The pair <love, like> forms a hierarchy where \"love\" is stronger (s) and \"like\" is weaker (w).\n\n2. B responds with the weaker statement \"I like her\" instead of the stronger \"I love her.\"\n\n3. According to the C* Principle's Speaker's Criterion, B does not let their statement be weaker in information than what their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n\n4. Following the Hearer's Inference CQ1 of the C* Principle:\n   - B says A(w): \"I like her\"\n   - A(s) would be \"I love her\"\n   - A(s) entails A(w) (loving entails liking)\n   - Therefore, it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning B knows that the stronger information \"I love her\" cannot be established.\n\nBy using the weaker term \"like\" instead of \"love,\" B tactfully reveals that they do not love Xiao Hong while still expressing a positive sentiment towards her. This aligns perfectly with the C* Principle's mechanism for conveying information through the choice of weaker or stronger statements.",
