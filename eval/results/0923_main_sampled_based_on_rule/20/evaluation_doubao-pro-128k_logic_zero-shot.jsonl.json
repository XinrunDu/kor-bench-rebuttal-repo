The definition \"Nuclear energy, also known as atomic energy, refers to the energy released during nuclear reactions when the structure of atomic nuclei changes\" follows the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus\". Here, the genus is \"energy\" and the differentia is \"released during nuclear reactions when the structure of atomic nuclei changes\".
