This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the 'Wandering Earth' plan began, and **another Olympics was held** by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt.\"\n\nThis tells us there were Olympics after the 2044 games, making option D incorrect. It also confirms the 2044 Olympics were not held in Shanghai (ruling out option C) and that there were likely Summer Olympics before the 2044 games.\n\nWe don't have information about a 2022 Winter Olympics in Hangzhou, so option A is also unlikely to be correct.\n\n**Option B is the most plausible answer:** While the story doesn't explicitly mention the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it's the only option that doesn't contradict the provided information. \n",

Option D is the only statement aligned with real-world forestry practices. \n\nLet's break down why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **A:** Large-scale logging without proper planning and reforestation leads to deforestation, habitat loss, and other negative environmental impacts.\n* **B:**  Wood resources are renewable but not infinite. Uncontrolled logging depletes forests faster than they can regenerate.\n* **C:** Treeguards are fictional creatures from the game and not a real-world consequence of logging. \n",
