We need to analyze its properties based on the provided logic rules.\n\n2. **Convert to principal disjunctive normal form:** To apply the given rules, we need the principal disjunctive normal form (DNF).  We can obtain this by considering what makes the given CNF formula false:\n    - ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is false for truth assignments: (p=T, q=T, r=T), (p=T, q=T, r=F), (p=T, q=F, r=T), (p=T, q=F, r=F), (p=F, q=T, r=T), (p=F, q=T, r=F), (p=F, q=F, r=T). \n    - Therefore, the principal DNF is: (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨¬r) ∨ (¬p∨q∨r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨¬r) ∨ (p∨¬q∨r) ∨ (p∨q∨¬r)\n\n3. **Analyze the principal DNF:**\n    - This DNF includes the paired disjunctive term M7 (¬p∨¬q∨¬r) because its false assignment (p=T, q=T, r=T) corresponds to binary 111, which is hexadecimal 7.\n    -  Since the principal DNF contains only M7, the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is an **all-odd formula**.\n\n4. **Format the answer:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **[[E]]**. \n",
