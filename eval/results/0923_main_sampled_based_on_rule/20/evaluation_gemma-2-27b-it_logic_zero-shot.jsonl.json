Here's why:\n\n* **Positive Group:** Animals with normal salivary glands (S) exhibit faster wound healing (P) when bruised.\n* **Negative Group:** Animals without salivary glands (-S) show slower wound healing (-P) when bruised.  \n\nThe experiment isolates the presence/absence of salivary glands (S) as the key differentiating factor while keeping other conditions (bruising) consistent. This directly mirrors the structure of the ꙮ method. \n\n",
