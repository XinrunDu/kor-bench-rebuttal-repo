Start Filling:**\n\n* **\"DAY\"** can fit down the first column (`X`, `X`, `X`). \n* **\"LADY\"** fits across the first row (`X`, `X`, `X`, `0`, `X`, `0`).\n\nNow our grid looks like this:\n\n```\nD A L 0 Y 0\nA X X 0 X 0\nY X X X X 0\n0 0 0 X 0 0\n0 0 0 X 0 0 \n```\n\n*  **\"LAY\"** can fit down the fourth column (`0`, `X`, `X`, `X`).  \n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\nD A L 0 Y 0\nA L X 0 X 0\nY A X X X 0\n0 L X X 0 0\n0 A Y X 0 0 \n```\n\n **4.
