At the end of the twentieth century, algorithms that are efficient and produce the largest number of zeros when decrypted became popular and widely adopted. It's important to understand how these algorithms, the best known of which is the data encryption standard (DES), operate below the surface. These algorithms employ a long array of numbers called a KDF (key derivation function), which is a key-dependent function, to encrypt data blocks. To decrypt messages, you must be familiar with the original ciphertext generated by the encryption algorithm.\n\n<strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://aes.stackexchange.com/questions/58/data-encryption…\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question01.png)\n\n### Question 1:\n\nProvide explicit examples of Python statements to obtain the frequency of each character in the input string using class lists.\n\nPlease specify the functions including and the function signature\nwith explicit examples.

Our thoughts are used to make sense of the world around us. The patterns encoded into ciphers play a significant role in those thoughts. For further understanding, reference this:\n\n\n<strong>Reference Link below:</strong>\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/how-b-crypt-hash-algorithm-en…\n\nThe key and the operator is specified as \"aes-256-ctr\". Decryption requires the operator's key, and no algorithm can be applied to it.\n\nWhat should the code to do with this string be?\n\n<strong>Python Code:</strong>\n\n<code>[![image](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question04.png?raw=true)$[line=92,63]string = str(input())</code>\n\n<strong>Output:</strong>\n\n<strong>\"------------------------------\"</strong>\n\n#bytes  int  *  str - string - list\n\nThis test case is really a challenge! Please review test cases carefully, you will definitely identify what is its problem.\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question04_p1.png)\n\n### Question 5:\n\nPlease write a program in Python that converts data using this algorithm, including encryption and decryption.\n\nPlease see <strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/39651764/compressing-using…\n\nNote: Don’t forget the encryption function must be used along with decryption and vice versa.\n\n### Question 6:\n\nPlease modify the code to successfully complete the challenge.\n\n<strong>Reference Link:</strong>\nhttps://www.redsymbol.com",

The \"Unified Algorithms Operational Instructions for the National Unified Algorithm Library\" in the \"Encryption Algorithm Assessment Standard\"\n\nEncryption cipher (related parameter calculation algorithms):\n\n1. Ciphertext Calculation Method\n\nThere are many methods to calculate the ciphertext, generally from:\n\n(1) According to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext, encrypt and count according to the encryption table, then encrypt the result character by character.\n\n(2) Use the previously calculated key to encrypt the data, and then encrypt according to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext character by character.\n\nEncryption is encrypted according to the corresponding table, and each character is converted into a corresponding position according to the original data. To do this, it is necessary to find the position of each character in the cipher text.\n\n(1) When the cipher text is not arranged in order, the commonly used way is to find the longest ascending position of the character. The shortest descending character from the long to the short position;\n\n(2) Determine that there is no encryption key, please refer to the Standard algorithm in the Unified Algorithm Library for definition.\n\nThe ciphertext above uses some encryption rules based on columns.",
