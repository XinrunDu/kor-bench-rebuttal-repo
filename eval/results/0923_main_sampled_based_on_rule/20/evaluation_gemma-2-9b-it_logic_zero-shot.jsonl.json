This formula expresses a relationship where if point Gp is true, then point ¬G¬p must also be true. \n\nLooking at the Time Proposition Relationships defined in the rule:\n\n* **∗ Relation:** Pairs exhibit a state of exclusivity. Either one is true, or the other is false – they cannot both be true or both false. Formula 17 does not demonstrate this type of exclusivity.\n\n* **↦ Relation:** Pairs can be both false but not both true. Formula 17 implies a directional truth relationship where the truth of Gp guarantees the truth of ¬G¬p.\n\n* **⚭ Relation:** Pairs cannot be both false. However, they can both be true. Formula 17 doesn't express this type of restriction.\n\n* **⁂ Relation:** Pairs can both be true or both be false. Formula 17 implies a stronger relationship, where the truth of one point necessitates the truth of the other. \n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Reasoning Formula 17 best aligns with the  **∗ relation**.\n",
