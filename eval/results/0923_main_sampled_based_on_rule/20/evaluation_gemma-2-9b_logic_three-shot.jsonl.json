Proposition P2 indicates that it is morally forbidden for individuals to harm others within social connections.\n\nApplying reasoning formula 7, which relates moral duties and permissions, we can infer the correct conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is that there is a moral obligation for individuals to strive to maintain social relationships.\n\nRationale: Reasoning formula 7 implies that if an action is prohibited, then its opposite—the opposite action—is allowed. Since Proposition P2 prohibits harm to others in social relations, the opposite action of maintaining social relationships is implicitly allowed. This reasoning formula suggests that if an action is prohibited, its corresponding opposite action is allowed.",

To accommodate this observation, we should:\n\nA. Change r_3 to r'_3 = \"Apples usually contain vitamin C\"\nB. Change r_1 to r'_1 = \"Most apples are fruits\"\nC.

Now we have observations:\n\n- Observation 1: The plant is indeed 10 cm tall.\n- Observation 2: The plant is less than 15 cm tall.\n\nWhich of the following illustrates the logical consequence of r_1:\n\nA. It's not necessarily true the plant is taller than 10 cm.\nB. The plant is definitely taller than 10 cm.\nC. Both conclusions are possible.\n\n(Hint: Given the observations 1 and 2, one could argue that the height of the plant could be exactly 10 cm, making r_1 not completely contradictory. Hence, the plant's height of more than 10 cm is not necessarily true. This scenario does not conform to the BC paradox, where contradictory confirmations are used to support the hypothesis \"All things are either A or B\", and later contradictory cases are discovered, contradicting A and B. Here, the plant's height is less than or equal to 15 cm, and exceeding 15 cm can be inferred as false. Hence, the answer is not B. Choice B corresponds to the GB paradox, but that's not what you're looking for. A paradox represents a contradiction that's illogically confirmed and contradicts the original reasoning.

BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n- Solution: GB Paradox arises when contradictory observations contradict each other, leading to an unresolvable paradox. This scenario fits the definition of GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the type of logical paradox from the following statement:\n- All apples are yellow.\n- Most apples are sweet.\n- Most sweet things are bananas.\n- Therefore, most bananas are apples.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\na. BC Paradox\nSolution: BC Paradox arises when contradictory observations lead to contradictory confirmations, causing dilemmas. This scenario fits the definition of BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Provide the type of logical paradox based on the below statement:\n- All cats are fierce.\n- All mice are scared.\n- Most fierce creatures scare mice.\n- Therefore, some mice are scared of cats.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) The BC Paradox applies when contradictory observations contradict each other, causing dilemmas. The GB Paradox arises when contradictory observations contradict each other, causing a dilemma. In this case, the statement implies a contradiction since most fierce creatures don't scare mice. The logical conclusion is inconsistent, so it fits the definition of GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Determine the type of logical paradox from the observation and conclusion:\n- Observation: A scientist observed that in all cases, a given tree produces at least one orange.\n- Conclusion: The tree can only bear oranges and no other fruits.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) The GB Paradox arises from the paradoxical reasoning behind the observed phenomenon. Here, the conclusion incorrectly assumes that the sole outcome of the observer's actions is the production of oranges, without considering that there could be alternative results. Thus, the conclusion contradicts the assumption and suggests a GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Given the conditions below, identify the type of logical paradox that occurs:\n- Premise: It is known that:\n1. A premise p implies proposition R.\n2. Proposition R is true.\n- Conclusion: Therefore, p is true.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: The BC Paradox arises from the unexpected confirmation that contradicts the original reasoning. In this case, if R is true, it means that p is part of the contradiction, leading to an unexpected confirmation through inductive reasoning. Since there is a contradiction in the initial premise, an unexpected confirmation arises, suggesting a BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Evaluate the situation in terms of the type of logical paradox:\n- If sunlight reaches the plant, it will grow faster.\n- If it doesn't receive sunlight, it will continue to grow.\n- Observe the plant next to a bright light source.\n- If it overgrows, the sunlight does not reach it.\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: The BC Paradox arises from an unexpected confirmation that contradicts the original reasoning. When observing a plant under bright light, confirmation of the statement \"It does not receive sunlight and continues to grow\" contradicts the condition \"If it doesn't receive sunlight, it will grow.\" Such a contradiction suggests the BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the logical paradox in this scenario:\n- Given: All plants that receive nutrients will grow tall.\n- Observation: Some plants don't grow tall, even though they received nutrients.\n- Conclusion: Then all plants receive nutrients.\n\nA. ABC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) When inductive reasoning is used to establish a principle, it can be deduced backward. If the conclusion \"All plants receive nutrients\" is consistent with the observation of \"Some plants do not grow tall even with nutrients\", then there is a contradiction, which is associated with the GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Based on the information below, determine the type of logical paradox:\n- Premise: All human beings have hearts.\n- Observation: It has been observed that some animals also have hearts.\n- Conclusion: Then, all human beings have hearts and animals do not have hearts.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: The logical conclusion is that humans have hearts and animals do not, a contradiction. This paradox follows the GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the logical paradox from the following:\n- All plants grow tallest in a dark environment.\n- If all plants grow tallest in a dark environment, they don't have light.\n- Therefore, the only way plants maintain their height is to use darkness.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: GB Paradox arises from contradictory inferences and judgments. In this case, the conclusion \"Plants only maintain their height when using darkness\" contradicts the assumption \"All plants grow tallest in a dark environment.\n\n### Question: Determine the type of logical paradox from a reasonable and consistent situation:\n- Premise: All trains are large.\n- Observation: A train is tall. It has a size larger than 3 meters.\n- Conclusion: Then the tall train is large, or all trains are large.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: In this case, the paradox arises because the train's height is not consistent with the assumption that \"All trains are large.\n\n### Question: Deduce the logical paradox based on the given assumptions:\n- 5% of humans have a specific disease, and all infected people will die.\n- It has been found that only 9 out of 200 people were infected, and all of them are alive.\n- Conclusion: All people will not have this disease.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: BC Paradox arises from an observation that contradicts the assumptions, causing a contradiction. The conclusion \"All people will not have this disease\" contradicts the assumption \"All infected people will die\". In this way, it follows the BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Deduce the logical paradox based on the observations:\n- Observation: A scientist has observed two different conclusions just from two different perspectives:\n1. Everyone is a two-year-old person.\n2. Every person is a sixty-year-old.\n- Conclusion: Therefore, two-year-olds are their own ancestors.\n\nA. ABC Paradox\nB.
