This means:\n- Evaluating its true assignment in binary: ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is true when p = 0, q = 0, r = 0.\n- The binary representation for p = 0, q = 0, r = 0 is 000, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n\nTherefore, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r corresponds to m0.\n\n2. **Categorizing the Formula:**\n\nWe now have to check the categories one by one:\n- **A. Tautology:** A is a tautology if it includes all 2^3 = 8 paired conjunctive terms. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates only to m0, it does not include all 8 paired conjunctive terms.\n- **B. Contradiction:** A is a contradiction if it includes no paired conjunctive terms. ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **C. Basic formula:** A is a basic formula if it includes m0. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, it is a basic formula.\n- **D. All-even formula:** A is an all-even formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. In this case, the only term is m0, which is even. So, it is an all-even formula.\n- **E. All-odd formula:** A is an all-odd formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd.
