We need to carefully explore different combinations of the numbers and operations while ensuring we only use each number once.\n\nLet's start by experimenting with potential combinations:\n\nFirstly, an effective approach is to use multiplication and addition together since larger numbers can be achieved more quickly with these operations.\n\nWe start by testing:\n(5 × 2) + (7 - 7)\n\nHowever, (5 × 2) = 10 and (7 - 7) = 0, and 10 + 0 = 10, which is not 24.\n\nLet's try using the numbers in different configurations. Exploring multiplication:\n7 × (5 - (2 / 7))\n\nCalculating step by step:\n1. Parentheses first: 2 ÷ 7 = 0.2857 (approx.)\n2. Substract 5 by the result: 5 - 0.2857 = 4.7143 (approx.)\n3.
