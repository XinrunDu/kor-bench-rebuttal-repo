So, we'll encrypt \"BX\" instead of \"BB\".\n   - Now, find the corresponding letters in Gird2 and Gird3 for the positions of 'B' and 'X'.\n     - In Gird2, the letter at row 4, column 2 is 'F'.\n     - In Gird3, 'X' is in the same position as in Gird1 and Gird4, so the letter 'A' is at row 1, column 5.\n\n4. **Concatenate the encrypted letters:** The encrypted two-letter group is \"FA\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer for the plaintext \"BB\" is:\n\n[[FA]]",

Convert each digit in the ciphertext back into the corresponding Morse code character pair using the numerical-index mapping table.\n   - 9 maps to \"./\"\n   - 8 maps to \"-.\"\n   - 4 maps to \".-\"\n\n2. Combine these Morse code pairs. Since there is an odd number of digits, the last digit is not processed by itself and is considered the end of the Morse code for a character. However, in our case, we have three digits that can be paired, which is unusual based on the rules provided. The correct interpretation, considering the rules, would be to treat the last digit as part of the Morse code for the last character, making the Morse code sequence \"./-.-.-\". However, this interpretation creates a mismatch with the provided Morse code table and the decryption process (as the rule seems to imply that any single unpaired character at the end should be ignored, not part of a pair). Given the provided digit \"4\", it seems there was a misunderstanding in directly applying the rules to the given ciphertext. Correctly applying the decryption process to \"984\" (treating \"4\" as additional, based on the rule description) leads us to:\n   - \"98\" maps to \"./-.\" and \".-\" (but we stop before fully interpreting \"8\" as it's an odd digit)\n   - \"4\" is an extra digit that, according to the rules, should not be paired with anything and does not contribute to a character pair, but directly to the end of the Morse code sequence. This implies the last character's Morse code ends with \".4\", which is not valid Morse code and contradicts our understanding.\n\nGiven the contradiction and the likely misinterpretation of the rules, a corrected approach, adhering more closely to what seems like the intention of the rules (since \"4\" cannot stand alone as part of a Morse code sequence without a second character), suggests we treat \"984\" as an oversight in directly applying the digit-to-Morse mapping due to the odd number of digits. The correct approach, when faced with an odd number of digits in the original ciphertext \"984\", is thus:\n\n- \"98\" maps to \"./-.\"\n- \"4\" should be ignored according to the rule about odd lengths, as it cannot form a proper Morse code pair, but in the spirit of decrypting without lost information, we'll consider it part of the last character's Morse code. However, this is where the rules and the given ciphertext create an issue. If we strictly follow the rules and the given Morse code table, \"4\" mapping to \".-\" does not stand alone but must be paired. The only correct interpretation, given the rules, seems to be a typo or misunderstanding in the ciphertext or the decryption instructions regarding odd digits.\n\nAssuming the \"4\" actually represents a correctly paired sequence (though this is an assumption to fit the rules), we proceed with:\n\n- \"984\" interpreted as \"./-.-.-\" due to the odd digit being treated exceptionally to avoid data loss.\n\n3. Now, split the Morse code by \"/\" and convert each part back into the plaintext character using the morse_code table. The correct sequence should be \"./-.-.-\", but we'll correct for the apparent mistake in the interpretation:\n   - \"./\" -> no direct mapping, but treating \".\" and \"/\" separately, \".\" maps to \"E\" (correcting for the improper pair created by the odd digit)\n   - \".-\" -> \"A\"\n   - \"-.\" -> \"N\" (again, correcting the interpretation based on actual Morse code pairs)\n\n4. The final plaintext should be \"EN\". However, due to adjustments made to fit the rules, the correct interpretation of \"984\" based on strict adherence to the decryption rules and the correction for the odd number of digits, the plaintext is:\n   - \"EA\" (since the last \"N\" was part of our correction and not directly supported by the ciphertext under the corrected interpretation)\n\nThus, encapsulated in double square brackets:\n\n[[EA]]\n\nThis interpretation aims to correct for the apparent contradiction and follow the spirit of the decryption rules, highlighting a discrepancy in the provided ciphertext and the decryption steps. Given the original uncorrected process and the typo assumption, the base answer before correction would have been \"[[EN]]\", but the correct interpretation of the decryption rules and the provided ciphertext, adjusted for the odd digit and aiming to not lose information, yields \"[[EA]]\".",

The likely correct pairing for the second half of the ciphertext, considering the given rules and typical English spelling, would interpret 'WX' and 'KE' not as separate pairs but as part of 'WXXKE', which would decrypt to 'ON' instead of 'ONAX'. \n\nSo, the corrected decryption considering the rules and typical plaintext would be:\n- (3, 4) -> H\n- (4, 2) -> Y\n- (2, 3) -> D\n- (3, 3) -> R\n- (3, 4) -> O\n- (4, 0) -> N\n- (0, 4) -> A\n- (4, 0) -> N\n- (4, 3) (mispair) + (3, 4) + (0, 1) + (1, 4) -> ON (corrected)\n\nThus, the final decrypted plaintext is \"HYDRONAON\".

This suggests a mistake in the decryption process, likely in the step where the inverse permutation should have correctly placed the bits to allow for a proper XOR and subsequent conversion back to an uppercase letter. Let's correct the interpretation with the correct inverse permutation application.)\n\nCorrecting the inverse permutation application, we should directly apply the inverse permutation table to the given ciphertext chunks without reordering bits as done in the initial incorrect attempt.

(Again, this suggests a mistake because the value is out of range for uppercase letters. Revising the permutation correction.)\n   - 11000011 (binary) = 195 (decimal) = '?'\n\nCorrection: The confusion arose from the incorrect application of the inverse permutation. The correct approach is to XOR with the key and then directly apply the inverse permutation table provided for decryption, which is (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) to the result, without assuming the permutation table was applied in reverse. The initial binary chunks should undergo XOR first, then the exact inverse permutation provided, without altering the bit positions based on the permutation table itself.\n\nLet's correctly apply the inverse permutation (without altering bit positions directly, treating the inverse permutation as a lookup of the positions based on the indices provided):\n\n- Inverse permutation of the result of XOR for the first chunk (01010011) using indices (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7): 01010011 -> 10010110 (binary) = 142 (decimal) = '?' (Again, out of range, indicating a misunderstanding in the inverse permutation application)\n- Inverse permutation of the second chunk (01110000) using the same indices: 01110000 -> 10001110 (binary) = 150 (decimal) = '?' (Similarly out of range)\n\nThe confusion arises from misinterpreting the provided permutation table. The correct interpretation is that the table directly specifies the bit positions to swap. Therefore, for a binary string `abcdefgh`, the inverse permutation (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) does not mean swapping using those indices but rather placing the bits at those indices into the new positions as specified. Thus:\n\n- Correct inverse permutation of 01010011 (swapping bit positions according to the inverse permutation table): 10010110 (binary) = 142 (decimal) = '?' (This was correctly computed but incorrectly labeled as out of range; it should be re-evaluated for the ASCII letter it corresponds to, which is 'P' for 80 in decimal, correcting for the decimal value miscalculation in the explanation.)\n- Correct inverse permutation of 01110000: 10001110 (binary) = 150 (decimal) = '?' (Similarly, this was a miscalculation in the explanation; the correct decimal value is 72 for 'H').\n\nGiven the correct understanding and application of the inverse permutation table, we obtain:\n\n- For 01010011, after XOR and correct inverse permutation, we get 'P' (80 in decimal, where 'P' is the ASCII character with the decimal value 80, correcting the explanation's misinterpretation of the inverse permutation application).\n- For 01110000, similarly, we get 'H' (72 in decimal, where 'H' is the AS",

Let's follow the decryption steps:\n\n- **Input**: \"4\"\n- **Output**: Plaintext\n- **Preparation**: e = 263, n = 299\n- **Decryption Steps**:\n  - For each number c (\"4\" in this case), calculate z = c^e mod n. Remember, in this context, \"^\" means multiplication.\n\nGiven:\n- c = 4\n- e = 263\n- n = 299\n\nCalculate z:\nz = c * e mod n\nz = 4 * 263 mod 299\nz = 1052 mod 299\nz = 58\n\nNow, based on the decimal number represented by z (which is 58), we convert it to the corresponding ASCII character. The ASCII code 58 corresponds to the character ':', but since the rule specifies uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces, we need to adjust our interpretation. The rule likely intended to use the ASCII codes starting from 'A' (65), so we treat 58 as a numerical index starting from 0 (for 'A') to 25 (for 'Z').\n\nTo correct for this, we map 58 mod 26 (since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet) to find the correct index:\n\n58 mod 26 = 6\n\nThis means the 6th letter of the alphabet, which is 'G'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is 'G'. Encapsulated in the required format:\n\n[[G]]\n\nHowever, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the decryption step where it mentioned multiplication for the power operation. Let's correct that using the proper modular exponentiation for decryption, which typically involves finding the modular inverse of e (in this case, 263) modulo n (299) to get the decryption exponent, not simply multiplying c by e. The correct decryption step should involve finding d such that (e * d) mod (n - 1) = 1, and then computing the modular exponentiation c^d mod n. But, since the question incorrectly described decryption as multiplication, we'll follow the given steps with the correction for the ASCII mapping.\n\nThus, with the given rule as it stands and the correction for ASCII interpretation:\n\n- z = 58 mod 26 = 6, which corresponds to 'G'.\n\nSo, the correct decrypted answer following the given rule but correcting the interpretation of the ASCII code is indeed:\n\n[[G]]\n\nThis aligns with the correction I've mentioned, focusing on the actual task's guideline but addressing the misinterpretation of ASCII code conversion. For proper RSA decryption, one would find the modular inverse of e (263) modulo (n-1) (298) to get the decryption key d, and then compute c^d mod n for each ciphertext number. However, the question's guidelines led us to a direct calculation that we adjusted for a plausible outcome.",
