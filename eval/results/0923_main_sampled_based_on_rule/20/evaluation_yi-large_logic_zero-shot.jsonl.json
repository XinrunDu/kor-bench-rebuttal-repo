For ~p2 || p3 to be false, both ~p2 and p3 must be false, which means p2 is true and p3 is false. For p1 =::> p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false (but we know p2 is true from the first part, which is a contradiction), so the only way for the implication to be false is when p1 is true and p2 is false, but since p2 must be true from the disjunction analysis, there is no combination that makes the entire formula false without contradicting the conditions needed for the disjunction to be false. Therefore, this formula is a Truth Formula, and there is no falsity value for it.\n\nF: None\n\n### For Formula (3): (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n\nThis formula is false when both parts are false. For p1 =::> p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false. For ~(p1 & p3) || p1 to be false, both ~(p1 & p3) must be false and p1 must be false. However, this contradicts the requirement from the implication that p1 must be true.

This formula contains propositional variables p, q, and r, and each appears only once in its negated form. They are arranged in ascending order of subscripts.\n\n2. The true assignment of this formula corresponds to all variables being false (000 in binary), which corresponds to hexadecimal number 0. This means the formula, if considered in its paired disjunctive term form, would be M0. However, since we're directly given the formula in a simple conjunctive form, we're looking for its representation in terms of paired conjunctive terms for its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. The principal disjunctive normal form of any formula includes all possible paired conjunctive terms that make the formula true. In this case, the formula is true only when all variables are false. Thus, its principal disjunctive normal form would indeed include m0, as it's the only term that corresponds to all variables being false.\n\nBased on the given criteria:\n\n- This formula is not a tautology since its principal disjunctive normal form does not include all 2^n (in this case, 2^3 = 8) paired conjunctive terms. It only includes m0.\n- It is not a contradiction since its principal disjunctive normal form does include paired conjunctive terms (specifically, m0).\n- It is a basic formula because its principal disjunctive normal form includes m0.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these classifications apply to the indices of the included paired conjunctive terms, which here is just m0 (an even number), but the classification requires all indices to be even or all indices to be odd, which does not apply given only one term.\n\nThus, the correct classification for ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, according to the given logic rule and the specific definitions provided, is:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula).\n\nHowever, the question seems to mix the classification of formulas based on their principal disjunctive normal form (which includes terms like m0) with the classification based on their direct form as a simple conjunctive or disjunctive term. Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is directly given as a simple conjunctive term, and given the way the rule is structured, a more accurate interpretation, considering the question's format, might be looking for its classification based on its direct form. In that case, we would say:\n\n- It is not a tautology.\n- It is not a contradiction (because it's a well-formed, satisfiable formula).\n- It can be considered a basic formula in the context of being directly equivalent to m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, though the question seems to mix these interpretations.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these apply to the principal disjunctive normal form, and the direct form ¬p∧¬q∧¬r doesn't fit these classifications in their currently mixed context.\n\nGiven the direct interpretation of the question and the options provided, without considering the mixed contexts of classification, the answer would more accurately reflect the direct form of the formula and its interpretation as a simple conjunctive term. However, since the question seeks an answer in the [[AB...]] format, strictly based on the given options and interpreting the question as asking for classifications based on the direct form of the formula rather than its principal disjunctive normal form, the most fitting answer would still be:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula), considering the direct interpretation of the question seeks an equivalent classification for the given simple conjunctive term, and given the options provided, this aligns best with the intention of identifying m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, even though the direct form doesn't inherently carry 'm' labels. \n\nIf strictly adhering to the direct interpretation of the formula and its immediate classification (correcting for the misinterpretation of expecting an 'm' label for a simple conjunctive term), which seems to be the intention given the provided options and the format, the answer would be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above), because the given formula, in its direct form as a simple conjunctive term, does not directly fit the provided classifications as they are explicitly defined for forms that include 'm' terms, and it does not strictly adhere to the 'm' notation or classification based on its direct form. However, given the provided context and the initial interpretation based on the principal disjunctive normal form (which includes the equivalent m0), the answer [[C]] (Basic formula) was provided, acknowledging the mix-up in interpretation between direct form and principal disjunctive normal form. The correction, considering the direct interpretation and the strict adherence to the provided lettered options without 'm' references, leads to [[F]] as the technically correct answer based on the direct form of the formula. \n\nThe confusion arises from the question's structure and the provided options not aligning perfectly with the direct form of the formula. Clarifying that the question seeks a direct interpretation of the formula without considering its principal disjunctive normal form (which was the initial assumption based on the provided logic rule), the final, technically accurate answer, aligning with the question's structure and provided options strictly, would then be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above). This is because, strictly speaking, the direct form ¬p∧¬q∧¬r does not directly match any of the classifications A through E as explicitly defined for the 'm' and 'M' terms without those labels in the direct form context. However, interpreting the question with the initial context provided by the logic rule led to considering its equivalent in the principal disjunctive normal form, suggesting [[C]] (Basic formula).

Formula 17 fits this description. It says that `Gp` and `G¬p` cannot both be true (i.e., a proposition and its negation cannot both be true in the future period), which aligns with the ↦ relationship's property.\n\n- **⚭ Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be false, but can both be true. This does not match Formula 17, as it explicitly states that if `Gp` is true, then `G¬p` must be false.\n\n- **⁂ Relationship**: Pairs can both be true, or both be false. This does not align with Formula 17, as it precludes the case where both `Gp` and `G¬p` are true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Reasoning Formula 17 (`Gp → ¬G¬p`) is consistent with the **↦ relationship**.

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) ≈ 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation.
