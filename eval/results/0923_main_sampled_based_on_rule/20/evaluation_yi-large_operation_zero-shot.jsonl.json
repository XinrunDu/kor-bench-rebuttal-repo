The average of even numbers between 3 and \\(X\\) being 4 suggests that \\(X\\) cannot be less than 4, because the average would never be 4 if all the numbers were less than 4.\n\nNow, if \\(X\\) were 4, the only even number between 3 and \\(X\\) (inclusive) would be 4 itself, which doesn't give an average of 4 (since there's only one number, the average is the number itself, in this case, 4).\n\nIf \\(X\\) were 6, the even numbers between 3 and 6 (inclusive) would be 4 and 6, the average of which is indeed 5 (\\(= (4 + 6) / 2\\)).\n\nIncreasing \\(X\\) to 8 gives us three even numbers: 4, 6, and 8, between 3 and 8 (inclusive). The average of these numbers is \\((4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6\\), which exceeds the target average of 4.\n\nTherefore, for the average to be exactly 4, \\(X\\) must be such that only 4 is considered (since including any other even number increases the average). This means \\(X\\) must be an even number immediately after 4, ensuring that 4 is the only even number between 3 and \\(X\\) (inclusive), making the average 4. Thus, \\(X = 5\\).\n\nHowever, this interpretation would not typically align with the average operation because it suggests including only 4 for the calculation, which technically makes \\(X\\) itself not included in the operation since 5 is odd. The question seems to hint at a misunderstanding or a unique interpretation of the operation because, traditionally, to get an average of 4 from a set including 4, you wouldn't need any additional numbers. But, given the operation's unique definition and aiming to strictly follow its instructions, the intention seems to find a scenario where the only even number is 4, and the next number, odd or even, doesn't contribute to the average calculation. \n\nThus, under the peculiar interpretation of the operation rule, ensuring that 4 is the only even number considered due to how \\(a \\# b\\) works (by excluding \\(b\\) if it's odd and treating it as the upper bound rather than an included value for even numbers), \\(X = 5\\), following the logic that 5 is an upper bound that ensures the operation \\(3 \\# 5\\) considers only the even number 4, giving an \"average\" of 4, as per the unique definition of the operation.\n\nSo, after careful consideration and following the unique rule provided:\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n(Note: This answer deviates from standard mathematical operations' typical interpretations to strictly adhere to the custom operation's peculiar definition provided in the question.)",
