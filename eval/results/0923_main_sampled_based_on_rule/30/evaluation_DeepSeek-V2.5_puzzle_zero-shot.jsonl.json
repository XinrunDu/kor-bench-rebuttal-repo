Let's break down the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Clue 1:** The client who ordered the dragon roll ordered the teriyaki roll.\n   - This implies that the dragon roll and the teriyaki roll are ordered by the same person.\n\n2. **Clue 2:** Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - This implies that either the tiger roll or the futomaki roll costs $11.50.\n\n3. **Clue 3:** Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - This implies that either Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n\n4. **Clue 4:** Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.\n   - This implies that Virginia ordered either the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\n5. **Clue 5:** The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n   - This implies that the person who ordered the dragon roll is neither Virginia nor Ramona.\n\n6. **Clue 6:** Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.\n   - This implies that Hector ordered something other than the teriyaki roll.\n\n7. **Clue 7:** The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - This implies that the firecracker roll costs $9.50.\n\nNow, let's combine this information to create a table:\n\n- **Dragon Roll and Teriyaki Roll** are ordered by the same person (let's call this person **D**).\n- **Hector** did not order the teriyaki roll, so Hector ordered either the tiger roll or the futomaki roll.\n- **Virginia** ordered either the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n- **Ramona** is the only remaining person, so she must have ordered the remaining rolls.\n\nGiven these deductions, we can now match the rolls to the customers and their prices:\n\n1. **$9.50**: The firecracker roll.\n2. **$11.50**: Either the tiger roll or the futomaki roll.\n3. **$15.50**: Either the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\nLet's assign the rolls and customers:\n\n- **Hector** ordered the tiger roll (since he didn't order the teriyaki roll).\n- **Ramona** ordered the futomaki roll and paid $11.50.\n- **Virginia** ordered the rainbow roll and paid $15.50.\n- **D** (the person who ordered the dragon roll and teriyaki roll) must be the one who paid $13.50, as neither Virginia nor Ramona can be this person.\n\nFinally, we arrange the entries in order of prices:\n\n- $9.50: Firecracker Roll, Empty, Empty, Hector\n- $11.50: Tiger Roll, Futomaki Roll, Empty, Ramona\n- $13.50: Dragon Roll, Teriyaki Roll, Empty, D\n- $15.50: Rainbow Roll, Empty, Empty, Virginia\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n[[9.50 firecracker empty empty Hector, 11.50 tiger futomaki empty Ramona, 13.50 dragon teriyaki empty D, 15.50 rainbow empty empty Virginia]]",

The sums of the rows are 26, 33, and 19. The sums of the columns are 31, 7, 25, and 15. The numbers we can use are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 34.\n\nLet's start by identifying the numbers we need to use:\n- The first column sum is 31. Since the last row already has 31, no additional numbers are needed for the first column.\n- The second column sum is 7, and the last row already has 7, so no additional numbers are needed for the second column.\n- The third column sum is 25, and the last row already has 25, so no additional numbers are needed for the third column.\n- The fourth column sum is 15, and the last row already has 15, so no additional numbers are needed for the fourth column.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the first three rows to meet the given row sums:\n- For the first row (26), we can use 1, 10, 11, and 4 (1 + 10 + 11 + 4 = 26).\n- For the second row (33), we can use 2, 9, 16, and 6 (2 + 9 + 16 + 6 = 33).\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 12, and 4 (3 + 12 + 4 = 19).\n\nThe filled grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3  12   4   0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each number from the set is used exactly once. Let's correct the third row sum to 19 by using different numbers:\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 5, and 11 (3 + 5 + 11 = 19).\n\nThe corrected grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3   5  11  0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nNow, we need to ensure each number is used exactly once and the sums match the given totals.
