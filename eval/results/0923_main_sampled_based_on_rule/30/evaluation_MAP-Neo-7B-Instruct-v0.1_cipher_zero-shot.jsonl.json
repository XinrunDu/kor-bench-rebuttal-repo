The second number \"2\" corresponds to rows and columns (2 rows, 2 columns) for \"B\" in the Polybius square. However, since the ciphertext \"22\" was mentioned early, the interpretation changes slightly.

Use the LETTERS list to find the corresponding letter at position 8:\n    - The letter for position 8 is \"Q\".\n3.

The keystream value \"17\" determines a new position in the LETTERS list, which corresponds to the ciphertext character \"X\". Thus, the decrypted value is:\n    - The letter at position 17 in the LETTERS list is \"V\".\n\n**Decryption: For the ciphertext character \"X\"**\n\n1.

Both B and C are decrypted to their original letters \"V\". Note that in the decryption process, since the initial sequence of cards and the keystream algorithm's rules ensure that the plaintext is formed by following the numerical positions in the alphabet from \"A\", it's clear that the entire ciphertext \"X\" translates to \"BC\" in the plaintext when decrypted.

First, we prepare the outer and inner disks as outlined. The outer_disk is \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\", and the inner_disk is \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\".\n\n2. Next, we process each character in the plaintext:\n   - 'E' is 'E' in the outer_disk, so we replace it with 'N' in the inner_disk.\n   - 'F' is 'F' in the outer_disk, so we replace it with 'A' in the inner_disk.\n   - 'B' is 'C' in the outer_disk, so we replace it with 'K' in the inner_disk.\n   - And so on, until we reach 'T' in the plaintext, which is 'U' in the outer_disk and 'D' in the inner_disk.\n   \n3. After each \"period\" of 2 characters (since there are 6 characters processed, it's the first cycle), rotate the inner_disk 4 characters to the right.\n\nGiven the plaintext \"EFBCRGLXTUS\", here's how each character transforms:\n\n- 'E' -> 'N'\n- 'F' -> 'A'\n- 'B' -> 'K'\n- 'C' -> 'L'\n- 'R' -> 'X'\n- 'G' -> 'T'\n- 'L' -> 'U'\n- 'X' -> 'D'\n- 'T' -> 'S'\n\nSo, the first cycle's characters in the inner_disk after encryption are:\nN -> J, A -> Z, K -> M, L -> N, X -> H, T -> E, and S -> T.\n\nNow, for the encryption steps:\n\n- After each 2 characters:\n    - 'N' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'J' (1st base inner rotation), resulting in 'JFAKLMNHTET'.\n    - 'A' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'Z' (2nd base inner rotation), resulting in 'ZJKMNLHTEJ'.\n    - 'K' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'M' (3rd base inner rotation), resulting in 'MJNLHTElM'.\n    - 'L' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'N' (4th base inner rotation), resulting in 'NJNHETMlN'.\n    - 'X' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'H' (1st base inner rotation), resulting in 'HJNHETMHN'.\n    - 'T' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'E' (2nd base inner rotation), resulting in 'EJNHETMEE'.\n    - 'S' is found in the inner_disk and replaced with 'T' (3rd base inner rotation), resulting in 'EJNHTMETT'.\n\n4. Now, we apply the rotation rule after each 2 characters:\n    - Rotate 'NJMNHETMHN' by 4 (from the 5th character, so 1 encoding cycle results) to get 'TDMHNJMETN'.\n    - Rotate 'EJNHTMETT' by 4 to get 'TSMHETJDNT'.\n\nThus, the encrypted answer is: [[TDMHNJMETN, TSMHETJDNT]].\n\nPlease note that this explanation is guided by the encryption algorithm and does not include decryption as it follows the exact opposite steps. To decrypt this, follow the decryption rules with the same \"period\" and \"increment\" but in reverse order. Starting from 'TDMHNJMETN', rotate 4 characters to the left (from the 5th character, so 1 decryption cycle results) to get 'ETHMNJDSM'. Then, reverse the positions in the ciphertext to get 'EFBCRGLXTUS'. This demonstrates the decryption process, but remember the encryption rules are used here for the encryption task.\n\nIf you have a specific ciphertext and wish to verify the encryption process or perform further tasks, please provide more details or clarify requirements.",

Here's the step-by-step encryption process:\n\n1. **Plaintext**: \"G\"\n\n2. **Padding**: Since \"G\" is a single character, it already meets the requirement of having a length that is a multiple of 8 bytes, so no padding is necessary.\n\n3. **Block Splitting**: Here, we won't technically \"split\" a single-character block, as \"G\" is already a single block.\n\n4. **Block Encryption**:\n    - **Convert to Bytes**: \"G\" -> [72] for ASCII representation.\n    - **XOR with Key**: We'll use the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`, so `XOR` with `72` gives us `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3` in hexadecimal.\n    - **Substitute**: Using the S_BOX, we would replace the high 4 bits with their corresponding key in the S_BOX and the low 4 bits as well. However, since we're dealing with a single character and `G` maps to `0x07` in the S_BOX, we won't fully substitute.\n    - **Permute**: This step simply involves rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The result, with all but the last byte, is `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3`.\n    - **XOR with Key**: `24B2FDC9CDA04EA3` XOR `1234567890ABCDEF` gives us `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Hexadecimal Encoding**: The final encrypted hexadecimal string is `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23`.\n\n**Decryption of \"F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23\" is performed by reversing the process:\n\n1. **Block Splitting**: As before, we have a single block, so we proceed without splitting it further.\n\n2. **Block Decryption**:\n    - **Convert Hex to Bytes**: `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` -> [250,137,155,169,98,172,174,140]\n    - **XOR with Key**: `1234567890ABCDEF` XOR `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` gives us `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23` again (due to the XOR operation cancelling out the key).\n    - **Inverse Permute**: This step, due to having a single block, doesn't change the bytes.\n    - **Substitute**: Using the inverse of the S_BOX, we substitute the high 4 bits with their equivalent in the original byte. `F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23 -> 72`, which is the original plaintext \"G\".\n    - **XOR with Key**: XOR by `1234567890ABCDEF` brings us back to `72`, matching our initial plaintext.\n\n**By following these steps, we arrive at the decrypted plaintext: \"G\"**.\n\nThus, the encrypted representation of \"G\", following the given rules, is `[[F8B5FCA9D2AE8F23]]`. However, it's important to note that encryption and decryption operations are reversible, and often, the result is encrypted back to its original value due to the XOR operation used during the encryption process. This demonstrates the properties and correctness of the encryption and decryption rules provided.\n\nIn practical applications, padding and block splitting would be used, making the process more robust and applicable to larger inputs.
