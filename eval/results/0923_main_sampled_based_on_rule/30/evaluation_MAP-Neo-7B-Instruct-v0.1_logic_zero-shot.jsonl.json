This equation holds because logical implication is transitive.

However, the order in PDNF is always in ascending subscript order due to the initial distribution and simplification.\n\n4. **Evaluating Conformity with PDNF/PCNF:**\n   - Since the formula is decomposed into distinct paired disjunctive (or conjunctive) terms without any repetitions (as mandated by the rule in ascending subscript order), it conforms to the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF).\n\n**Formatted Answer:**\n\n- Since the formula (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r) can be transformed and represented in its disjunctive normal form (DNF) following the logic rule defined, the answer can be represented as [[A; (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨y)∧(¬p∨¬r)]] and noted to conform to the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF).\n\n- To denote this specific PCNF, the formula written in PCNF form is:\n  p ∨ r ∧ (¬q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ y ∨ ¬r). Here, \"y\" is the intermediate conjunct defined earlier and represents \"q ∨ r\". This is the stated PCNF for the given formula. The \"y\" term can be considered a part of the conjunct \"¬p ∨ y ∨ ¬r\", indicating an intermediate step in the pairing process.\n\nThis analysis concludes that the formula can indeed be denoted in its principal conjunctive normal form, as explained. The PCNF is represented as: p ∨ r ∧ (¬q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ y ∨ ¬r). This representation aligns with the description of PCNF according to the rules set.",

If SIP is false, it implies no S are P, making SOP true by the \"*\" relationship.\n  - SOP is a universal negative proposition, meaning it asserts that no S are P. If SOP is false, it implies at least one S is P, making SIP true according to the same \"*\" relationship.\n  - SAP is a universal affirmative proposition, directly asserting that all S are P. If SAP is true, it means every S is P, making SEP impossible because it contradicts the universal claim of SAP (I.e., some S are not P, which contradicts SAP). Thus, SEP is false given SAP is true.\n  - Conversely, if SEP is true (meaning some S are not P), it directly negates SAP (since all S should be P in a true SAP proposition), making SAP false.\n\nTherefore, the respective truth values based on the specified relationships are:\n\n- SIP false: SOP true\n- SOP false: SIP true\n- SAP true: SEP false\n- SEP true: SAP false\n\nFormatted:\n\n- SIP false: SOP True\n- SOP false: SIP True\n- SAP True: SEP False\n- SEP True: SAP False\n\nNote: These conclusions adhere strictly to the principles of logic as described, and the relationships between the propositions are interpreted according to the rule set.

The scenario given is a perfect fit for this method. Here, we are observing how higher water temperatures (increasing temperature) result in increased survival times in water (P), while lower water temperatures (decreasing temperature) result in decreased survival times. This mirrors the positive and negative group setup.\n\nIn Method ꙮ:\n- The positive group (S and P occurring together) is evident in all the temperature scenarios where survival time increases, for example, 0°C, 2.5°C, 5°C, 10°C, and 25°C.\n- The negative group (S absent, P absent, and other conditions differ) mirrors the scenarios where decreasing temperatures are observed, and these significantly impact survival time, for instance, at 0°C (the lowest recorded survival time), suggesting a direct relationship between lower temperatures and decreased survival times in water.\n\nThis approach using positive and negative groups establishes a strong causal link between changes in water temperature and the length of time people can survive in water, aligning precisely with Method ꙮ.

Here's the step-by-step justification:\n\n1. **Method ⸮** is about observing co-occurrence across multiple instances with differing conditions. The given scenario does not directly meet this criteria since it's about the effect of a specific intervention (removal of salivary glands) rather than multiple independent observations.\n\n2. **Method ؆** is about observing the effect of the presence or absence of a variable on another variable. This scenario directly aligns with this method since removing salivary glands results in faster wound healing, showing a clear effect of the intervention (the absence of salivary glands) on the outcome (wound healing speed).\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** involves comparing groups under different conditions and identifying a causal relationship. While this scenario does not directly fit this criteria, as there's a clear cause-and-effect relationship (removing salivary glands leading to faster wound healing), the method's principle of comparing groups under different conditions can be seen in the experimental setup where the two groups (with and without salivary glands) were created.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** focuses on the direct observation of cause-and-effect relationships, where changes in one variable correspond to changes in another. This scenario exemplifies this method perfectly, as the experiment directly shows a correlation between the presence of salivary glands and the healing speed of the wound: without salivary glands, the wound heals much faster, suggesting a direct causal relationship between salivary glands and wound healing.\n\n5. **Method ⚘** involves using known causal relationships to infer a new causal relationship. While this scenario does not directly fit this criteria, its underlying principle of using existing knowledge to make new connections aligns with the scientific approach of potentially using known causal relationships to infer new causal relationships. However, the specific scenario provided already offers a clear cause-and-effect relationship that was directly observed in the experiment.\n\nTherefore, the best match for the given scenario is **Method ⵣ (Direct Method)**, as it directly observes the cause-and-effect relationship.

This method involves demonstrating the truth of the original proposition (p) by indirectly negating the possibilities that could render it false, based on the given assumptions and conditions.\n\nHere's the step-by-step application of the Elim- Method:\n\n1. **The Premise**: The original proposition (p) or its negation (not p) is being considered.\n2. **Assumptions**: There exists a logical framework where it's either p or q or r that can be assumed.\n3. **Logical Inference**: By negating the opposite condition to the original proposition, assuming that neither q (not q) nor r (not r) is true, we employ the Elim- Method.\n4. **Application**: Given that not q and not r are true, the truth of p is deemed necessary and sufficient because any possibility of q or r contradicting p automatically falls apart.\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the premises and the logical operations applied, it's stated that p must be true.\n\nTherefore, the method used here is the Elim- Method, which aligns with the instructions provided for the custom argumentation methods. The correct answer is [[F]].\n\nThis method leverages the principle of elimination to deduce the truth of the original proposition by showing that alternative propositions or conditions that could negate it are false under the given circumstances.

In the given scenario, the statement \"If Li Gua murdered his boss, then he is an evil person\" is assumed, and subsequently, when it is proven that Li Gua did not murder his boss, he is not deemed an evil person. This logical error arises because the conclusion (Li Gua is not an evil person) is reached despite the insufficient basis provided in the premises (the act of murder), and the assumption that any act, including those not committed, would classify Li Gua as an evil person is fallacious. This reasoning pattern is a clear example of the Incorrect Negation fallacy.
