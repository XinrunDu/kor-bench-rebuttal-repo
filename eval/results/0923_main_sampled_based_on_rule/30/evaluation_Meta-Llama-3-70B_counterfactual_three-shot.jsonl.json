Whenever two objects change each other's motion, they apply force to each other (they always apply oppositely). Plants do work on water and CO2 because the glomeruli get closer to each other. People think, incorrectly, that plants that change the state of water make such changes using light, but they don't, it's not just physically impossible. (1B) instead, water absorbs energy from the sun, causing the water molecules to escape from the bonds near the plants, and carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst in the water. When the water molecules escape from the small clefts, the sun's energy is released stealing the molecules from the plants. Plants use this energy to break down ATP pumps in the form of water flow and break down water molecules to expel the oxygen. The ATP is then hydrolyzed back to ADP + Pi to provide energy for glucose uproutine6 phosphate production.\n##-B.Yes, because formation of bonds over conformation is endothermic. One gives up 27.31 kJ of energy for every 1 mole of c-c bond in a reaction that forces to be very sharp. Complementary reactions (decreased bond strength) release a quantity of energy similar to that required to form bonds).\nAnswer with a list of uppercase letters from A to B representing each option.

Statement B is incorrect because there is a waterproof computer, Karen Plankton. Statement C is incorrect because the International Protection code is used to test the strength of glasses frames. Statement D is incorrect because watches such as those made by Baby-G and Q&Q are deliberately designed to be waterproof.\nRegarding Atlantis, statement B is correct. The Atlanteans did not kill almost all living bubbles, as indicated in this line from the story: \"the Atlanteans recreate their sky city and began to take great advances in wealth, science, art, and things people took for granted in Bikini Bottom.\" The Atlanteans did take all of their weapons with them to the sky city so that there was peace on Earth. The earliest recorded description of Atlantis does not come from Plato, but from Hesiod, a Greek poet. The Atlanteans live in a floating city supported by flying whales.\nRegarding the description of cloning technology, statement A is correct. The Proto-Generator 2000 is an invention of Sandy's, as described in the text. The clone machine does not have just one button, but rather many buttons to control how many clones are produced. Polymerase Chain Reaction is used for copying or amplifying DNA fragments and primers in order to create more DNA. Restriction enzymes are involved with cloning DNA, where they cut and ligate the DNA.\nRegarding the yellow tube sponge, statement A is correct because, as stated in the text, it has \"large yellow or golden tubes.\" The yellow tube sponge is a plant, not an animal, making it correct as well. It doesn't have a rectangular shape or the ability to drive a vehicle.\n\nRegarding the characters in the story, statement B is correct. Squidward can have two extra arms or tentacles, but they do not make him a squid. Gary does not have a golden coat or brown patches, but a blue or white and pink coat. Sandy is not shown to be related to SpongeBob in any way, though they are friends.\nThe seawater soaking Krabby Patty changes the taste of the patty because it contains different sodium chloride than the salt in the patty, which changes the taste on the tongue of the consumer. Human saliva doesn't filter out salt, and the seawater is not very salty. Human body enzymes do not react with acid in the seawater.\n\nKing Neptune's accessory is a golden trident, and King Neptune and his wife rule over the sea. This makes statement A correct. Statement B, Cashina is a blue-colored stack of money, placed between two small fish eyes which moved on loose strings, is also correct. Statement C is correct according to the story: \"Mr. Krabs is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab restaurant.\". But statement D is incorrect. The correct answer to this question is D.\n\nStatement B is the correct answer because Spongebob can squeeze himself to escape from a large anchor. When SpongeBob jumps repeatedly on a bed soaked in denture-lock paste, it jiggles the teeth, not helping them stay on. He creates bubbles by washing himself, not by turning the windmill on his roof to get soapy water from the house. He does not have a dial on his back that goes up to 11, but that allows him to breathe faster or deeper.\n\nSince Spongebob clone doesn't have a mouth, statement B is the right answer. Spongebob clone's shapes of left foot, eye and body are the same as the template. Spongebob clone is copied from a running Spongebob, so the right foot is changed relatively but not left foot. After operation, Spongebob clone can talks like the template, although the sound is deep. The right mouth looks like ugly, but it is the real mouth for clone.\n\nmoney #cashina #currency #tender #coinage #cash #dough #moola. money #love #passion #smitten #crush #lust #eros. money #insects #world #complete #kingdom #species.\n\nmoney is the wrong answer. money is metal plates in the shape of a circle. cashina is the wife of plankton. money is made from shells. money can fall in love with crabs. money is animated holometabolous insects.",

He is thinking about making some decisions. And just next to him is a morning room, very bright. Strangely, through the rear exit inside the morning room, an open place appears. Inside the room, there is a girl quietly reading, and in the corner of the room, there is her old hat shop. How can Howl find a way out of where he is and reunite with the girl that he loves?\nOptions:\nIf Howl can turn into a bird, he can turn into a bird and fly to the sky.

If you poured a little bit of this potion on the old woman, her appearance would begin to change, starting from her feet and calves until she finally resembled a beautiful young princess. If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again. If someone really wants to steal this beautiful appearance repeatedly, it's very difficult to stop them. ##B. Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while. So someone with a truly ugly personality cannot take away this beautiful appearance. However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state. This beautiful appearance is more eternal than the original owner, who will always be impatient and wish to steal it away. ##D. The bottle's magic is limited, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will not be able to return to the original owner. The beauty that comes out of the bottle is more eternal than the ugly appearance.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhen friends visiting the palace fall in love with the flames in the fireplace and ask the fire demon what fuel is being burned, but do not get an answer, what should the fire demon do?\nOptions: A.

The theming song of the door is \"Expecting a New World.\" If the visitors are not familiar with the world, which of the following guides is more intuitive and vivid to help these visitors understand this time and space?\nOptions:\nIn this world where magic and science coexist, the sorcerer Howl has a lot of monsters and monsters around him that help him build his moving house, which moves forward like a monster with four legs, and can move freely without defining a static position. The rotating door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie helps him fly. ##B. When Howl turns into a bird, there is a devil in his chest preventing him from taking off his mask. The Georgian house is not as dark as it is described, and there is a real sacrifice in it. The throat of the devil is attached to his heart. After he breathed his last breath, the devil opened its doors widely to reveal over half of the class who had suffered. But when the devil speaks. \" Howl, you've loved me for all of tonight\". ##C. Sophie is the eldest daughter in a hat shop, endowed with both grace and courage. I am impressed with her dignity, optimism, and confidence. In my eyes, she is beautiful.

Now I finally have the courage to take off my mask, turn toward your sweet smile, and both describe and hear two things: \"I am Howl,\" and \"everlasting love.\" The chest is sorely painful. But the feeling is so wonderful. There is no mask or fire that cannot be suppressed. The sorrow in my chest is unceasing. If time can be reversed, I would have listened to your heartbeat and entrusted eternity to you. ##D. In this world where magic and science coexist, it is the magicians who play a decisive role in the start and end of the war. They are both virtuous and the makers of their own destinies.
