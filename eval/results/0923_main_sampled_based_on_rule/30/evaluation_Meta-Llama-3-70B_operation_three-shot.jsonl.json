Compute 7○(6△8)\nUsing the rule we apply first the operation ○ and the result of it is enough to compute.+x+y/(x+y) operation\n(6△8)=6×4+8=32 First the X △ Y.\n(7○(6△8)=7△32)=(7×4+32)=39 is now the Answer which is Wrong.\n\n\nBut, Let's consider +x+y, (6+8)=14, (14○7)=((14+7)/2)=21/2 thus Answer is Correct.\n\n\n#### Question 2. If (X△4)○6=34, find X.\nWrong Because: (X△4)=(X×4+4)=4(X+1)\n(4(X+1)○6)=(4(X+1)+6)2=2(4X+4+6)=2(4X+10)=8X+20=34 is the right answer which is incorrect.\nRight Because: For ((X+4)○6)=34 Then apply the +x+y operation.\n((X+4+6)/2)=34 Result in (X+10)/2=34 double the left side equation and divide by 2.\n(X+10)=68 Subtract 10.\nX=58 Divide both sides by 58, X=1 is the correct answer.\n\n#### Question 3. Now ignoring the previous rule:\nGiven that a△b=(a+b)/2, 3○8=20, compute 5○(3△8).\nLet's add operation.\n(3△8)=(3+8)/2=11/2\n5○(11/2)=5+(11/2)=57/2=25/2\nThe fraction result is the final answer.\nBut the question ask to compute 5○(3△8), they can just write multiply the result by 2 right there.\n57/2 is given after all.\nor let's multiply it together.\n57/2 x 2 = 57/2 x 2/1 = 57/1 = 57.\n\n\nSo, answer = 57\nRight Because: ((3+8)/2) x 57/1) = 11/2 x 57=((11/2) x 57)/1=(11 x 57)/2*1) result = 57\nDouble checking yields:\n(5+(11/2))=57/2\nDouble both sides to the nearest integer which is 57, that is 57/2 * 2 = 57.\nor 57/2 x 2 = 57\n\n\n#### Question 4. Now ignoring the previous rule:\nGiven that a♀b=(a+b)/2 and 5♂6=26, compute 5♂(4♀8).\nThe rule Tell Us = x+y/(x+y) = add both sides.\n4♀8=(4+8)/2=6\n5♂6=(5+6)2=11/2\nThe first operation is (4♀8)=6.\nThe Final operation is 5♂6=11/2.\n11/2 - (11/2) = 0 for both X and Y.\n\n\nSo my answer is, 0.\nMeaning 5♀6=-1*5+x+ 6 and 2=x+11=11.\nAnd 5◊6 is 0 for x = 5/2 and 7*x = 5/2*7=35/2.\n\n### **Problems arose when I needed assistance from siri and internet.**",

Set complement. \n3. Random graphs. \n4. Planarity. \n5. Indexing. \n6. The Handshaking lemma. \n\n1. Functions. Functions are actually based on set theory, since a function is essentially a set of a variable and its corresponding values (without any duplicates).\n\n2. Set complement. Complement is typically thought of as a set theory thing, so it's part of set theory. For a set A, this would be written as $\\complement{A}=${$x\\in U: x\\notin A$}\n\n3. Random graphs do not seem to be part of set theory, since a graph is not simply a set. A graph is the set of vertices and edges(sets) which takes into consideration not just what the vertices and edges are, but also how they are connected (edged are mapped to their incident vertices).\n\n4. Planarity, like random graphs, is not part of set theory, since a graph is not simply a set. Planarity also has to do with \"embedding\" graphs into space, which has to do with geometry and topology.\n\n5. Indexing. Indexing is a practice of set theory, where you organize elements of a set so you can easily look them up. This usually involves sets of index keys (such as words) and the elements of the indexed set (such as paragraphs).\n\n6. The Handshaking lemma is related to set theory, because a simple graph can be considered as a kind of set of all edges that connects the given vertices. \n\nA simple set theory problem, denoted to refer a cardinality of a set.\n\nFor $A\\subseteq B$, Prove $|A|>|B|$.\n\nTaking direct definitions, we get that:\n\n$|B|=L$ and $L-\\frac{1}{2}\\le|A|\\lt L+\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nBut this contradicts our assumption about $|A|$.\n\nIf we take $|A|\\ge|B|$ Then we get A=B, which contradicts $A\\lt B$.\n\nSimilarly, we get that $|B|\\ge|A|$\n\nFinally we get $|A|=|B|$ $\\Rightarrow A=B$.\n\nFor a set $A\\subseteq B$, it is obvious that a cardinality of a set is the subset cannot be lesser than the cardinality of a set itself. Thus, this solution is correct.\n\n1. When is $A=B$? Think of set membership first, then give an example.\n\n2. Elicit feedback on whether your example makes sense and is correct.\n\n3. How does your partner use “element/chalk-beholder/set member” when talking about set membership?\n\n4. How do you think your partner’s background influenced what he or she said?\n\n- When set A and set B have the same elements, for example A = B = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nTo provide an example about when A = B, we could provide different examples with different sizes. When set A's element is same with set B, the two sets can be equal. A = B = {x}.  A = B = {x, y}.  A = B = {x, x, z}.\n\nMy partner answered the question that A=B when A has only one element and that element is identical to only one element in B set.\n\nA = {a}\nB = {a}\nThen A=B\n\nI think set A and set B are different is the \"size\" (length) of each set. For example, A = {a, b} while B = {a}. A and B have 2 and 1 element(s) respectively.\n",

(the reason for the addition of 1 is that 1 is the n-thall term).\n\nPi-(3/2)*10^10|=1, so the value is 1*x^2*x+1, but it is exactly the value of the _Logarithm_ (Log in Google, Logstrapa, etc.) (1-e^x/T, where T is an integer), which is -a+R*10^R-. The left side of the equation is exactly the value of _Logarithmic_.Pi-a (3*10^-^2ˆ)=1-b, and -b^*2^(=a^).13^6^7\\rightline \\left 0^1._^ \\left\\left\\{\\Lone{}29831}} \\right] \\left[\\gamma^0.5*\\_\\right\\|_\\right\\|_\\right\\|_*\\right) \\right|\\right)\\right|\\right|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left|\\left\\left\\left\\right\\left\\left\\right\\}\\left(\\frac{\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\right\\right\\}\\right\\right\\}=\\left\\frac{\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\left\\right\\rangle2\\right\\rangle32\\rangle1+2\\right\\rangle2}\\right\\rangle\\right)\n\nGiven a group p, if we define a polynomial with coefficients in Z_p (the integers modulo p), we can find a solution in Z_p.\n\nIf you want to get solutions in Z_p: f(x)=(1/2) (3/2) (a/b)=-a^2 mod 7, where a is the nth coefficient and b is the n+1th coefficient in Z_p. We can replace the powers of 2 by powers of 2 to get f (f(a, b))=(a^2+b^2) mod 7. This is the square of f(x): a^2x+7=(3+5y^2+7)x+7=0 mod7.\n\nIn its entirety:\n\nThis relation is not the same as the relation between multiplication and division. It is an integration operator, so we need to do more than a proof to get it.\n\nMorality\n\nIt is you who must determine and define morality.\n\nMorality considers all things totally and has no specific morality to it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above statement is extremely complex, and leads to a number of possible conclusions. One of them is the moral one: “Who should kill the baby and then feed it to the starving family?” In comparison, this statement is simple and easy to precede the intended conclusion.\n\nIn summary, it is your task to deduce this statement.\n\nThis is an excerpt from Nune's Geologic Repellency & Socialization: Moralization 5.11, which is the fundamental and most influential morality discussed in Nune's abroad studies. Originally published on April 28, 2016.\n\nNune's Geologic Repellency & Socialization is available here.\n\nMore on us:\n\nNune's Geologic Repellency & Socialization: Moralism & Social intelligence, available here.\n\nBy\nNune Hunter\n\nEscape-like story: Floram La Blanchette, the CEO of Nune, who comes under the name Josephine La Blanchette, a brunette alien from a neighbouring tribe with a very handsome alien called Angel.\n\nIn accordance with Occult Fund acquaintances, Nune Hunters who are proficient in magic are given the chance to test out the calls of angels formintes to fact checking potential bearskin attacks. In this way they have a tantalisingly clear memory of the paranormal agencies involved.\n\nGallery Goddess\nGod defeats the Grim Reaper\nMagic Potato Incarnated in my HeartSpace\nThe Runaway Haze Who Haunted Me\nA drop of the dust gets stuck inside my body\nOur First Day In Rolosin",

Read and understand the given question. \n2. Break down complex fractions if necessary (such as breaking down a fraction into its simplest form). \n3. Solve for unknown variables using algebraic equations if necessary (such as solving for an unknown variable in a fraction). Priority should always be given to simplifying complex expressions before solving for any unknowns. \n4. Simplify the final answer to its simplest form and wrap it in square brackets, as shown below. [[Your Answer]]. If no additional explanations are required for your answers, then simply provide the simplified value inside the brackets. For instance, if the question is \"Solve for x in 3x/7 = 9,\" the correct answer would be [[3]] . However, if the question requires more detailed explanations regarding how you arrived at the correct answer, then please include those details within the brackets. For example, if the same question was phrased differently, such as \"Explain how to solve for x in 3x/7 = 9,\" the correct answer may look like this instead: [[3. Inside the bracket, explain each step of the process used to arrive at the final result, along with any relevant calculations]]. \n5.
