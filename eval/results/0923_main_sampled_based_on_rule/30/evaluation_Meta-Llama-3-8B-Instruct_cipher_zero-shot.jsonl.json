Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\nThere is no padding character at the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\nThe final decrypted plaintext is: \"XIUnPn6P7Za\"\n\nHere is the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets:\n[[XIUnPn6P7Za]]",
