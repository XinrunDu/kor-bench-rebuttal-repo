I often push myself way too hard, constantly striving for perfection instead of just doing my best. It may be part of what makes me successful, but obviously, if I don't balance my workload properly, I will burn out and not be able to retain any information at all. So, if you can provide me with helpful insights about balancing work and studying, I would be very grateful for the tips.\n\nYour suggestion to start each day with enjoyable but productive activities like stretches, yoga, or light meditation, ideally followed by a brief walk outside sounds fantastic! It allows me time to clear my head and then refocus once I get to my morning tasks. It also means that I get both my physical health and studying on track very early, which helps immensely for both concentration and motivation levels during the day.\n\n### Answer:\nThanks! I get your situation now. I'm glad my suggestions were helpful! Do you think you'll give them a try?\n",

Decryption is simply using the uknown plaintext and the key to obtain the letter list of the unknown plaintext again.\n\n### Explanation:\n- Plaintext: XNARZKEM\n- Key: KULLLU\n- Ciphertext: UNIXO\n\nExplanation of reverse transformation (related to \"-\"    \" \")\n\nIf the text is translated, and after each reverse translation, it is a letter (case doesn’t matter here), then the basic grammar of the code changes to it. The question is, distinguish between special characters and normal characters, you need to have a list of special characters.\n\nRefer overall here\n\nKULLLU\n\nThe original code here is KULLLU, there are 7 letters and 1 space in it, so take the first character of the first word and write the whole leter code here. Then use the reverse icono to translate it into U, K, L, L, N, Add a space to the end.\n\nEncoded plaintext here is: U K L − L, they are encrypted in small letters in the ciphertext of the question, to be deciphered. (Refer follows for the entire cryptogram)\n\nWrite the others in the same way:\n\nEncoded Plaintext here is: X N A − R Z − K E − M\n\nthe entire program\n\nU K L N U N I X O N K U F E S O R L U Z X E N F A R E Z L I Y T H E C O D I G\n\nThe kulllu remains the same. Because there is only one space, it will also not be encrypted to the reverse of the word\n\n",
