But Earl went back to snooping at them from his notebook and realized that he can improve on it, since anyone can make a simple rebreather, right?\nSo he decided to improve on their design so he'd be able to breathe under water for hours!!!\nHe decided he'd use an array to store data of locations of O2 and the input will be a character\no, which means earl moves his position, and a negative sign, which means he creates an O2 generator for 'n' unit of oxygen (n=negative sign)\nAs he's breathing out CO2 (primitive plus adding on to their design) he needs a mechanism to the system in order to alert him when the oxygen runs low.\nThe note on the sheet suggests \"A scatter is something use to generate a gas leaks on a system\" and he came up with an idea where the Gas spread out as well as leaving trace around the General area the earl is currently.\nEarl wants to make sure this mechanism helps him locate his position and know exactly what's surrounding him as well as more careful around his area at a given time.\nWrite a code which can search through an array as well as assigning characters to different locations\nSay the maximum range is 4 units of distance\nIf earl were at (0,2,2) that means\nBetween 3\nTrace back up range say at (1,2,2) it will leave one trace\nPlus one variety lets say you were at (0,2,2) and an earl moved between 4 so it will be in the same index but a different character it will go 5 of the same dictionary\nNote that if there's no character of either ones around the \"Earl\" than it becomes null.\nAlso, move arround and make sure your code fucntions for edge cases\nIf he's surrounding by a loop where there is infinite oxygen around the earl!!! that's an important aspect and you'll need to check it in your test!!!\n\n### Constraints\nEarl lives on a positive x,y plateu\nEarl must be at a nonzero position\n\n### Sample Input 0\nInput 0: Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\n### Sample Output 0\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 1\nInput 1: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 1\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 2\nInput 2: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 2\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 3\nInput 3: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 3\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 4\nInput 4: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 4\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\nYou have\n: your name\nlevel: your assigned earl level (1-5)\nAssigned earl location: Assigned earl position of (x, y, z) mentally, but (y, z, x) or (x comma, y comma) or just followed the chart of your assignment. Or just a chart with the fixing charts like one of those fields of connections! (sorry I am panicking a lot because I am so bad at this)\nrun(x): the count of earl's moves with x as y or anywhere on the outer field. When completed, this must be written in the earl's system output.\n\n### Output\nOxygen is created everywhere around the Earl\nIf available Earl states the position of things like an exponential decay type of vector thing, but it creates scattered oxygen (that's just a word).\n1B means o2 gas generator that generates 1 for every 1 time earl move and it becomes 0 after 3 times it was activated.\n2 at the end means earl wanted to know the location, so the position of the surface (0,0,0) and the oxygen' pool if there are loops around earl so he asks immediately after each exhale.\nScattered is a word that's just an example.\nIf there are contradictions for contract and contract, please refer to the sense of \"contracting\" but a negative number could be positive but it doesn't matter which way how though its an array of the same array as an input, that it is converted to an integer into a string, and the changes are stored as \"You should be able to traverse the array in a certain way depending on space\" to explain which one gives him the new position. (x,y) In the orientation of the swarm.\n\n### Explanation:    \nsmall description from earl, just to have some knowledge of the given rules to understand\n\n### Approach\nEarl states that the position of the oxygen generators are to be reported from the position of the input value.\nHe states: The scattered oxygen each will be created when the hearl gets\nInput: any 3D vector x,y,z (Just a string of chars)\nEarl stated that the input should include at least 2 strings, or 6 numbers.\nEarl is able to make use of movement commands to change his position, If only one rare element exists it can be hard to find,\nand the earl is never going to change his position.\nEarl is able to move around the place with the earl's measurements, using the oxygen releases and earl's reactions to oxygen gas (gas generator drops)\nor oxygen gas (scattered gas increased)\nOxygen gas (oxygen gas release drops) or oxygen gas (scattered gas decreases)\noxygen gas (scattered) or a number\nEarl verify if he gets the location (position) that it should be possible to do that without navigation mechanisms\nOxygen scattered earl says that earl has the following 2 locations, and hearl means \"Earl's until…\" the oxygen the useful thing to do\nto be able to do is in the kitbag, if hearl\nhas a previous true true value.\n\n### Sample Input\nInput 1 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 2 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 3 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 4 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 5 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 1 :\nThe input is 1 and the output is earl's position, but earl will get located inside of the earl with the \"earl's location\" \nwhere earl is located with location of the input (x,y,z). (it's not in 2D though, so there's a lot of theoretical possibilities like if earl moves in 3D)\n\n\nSample Output 2 : \n\nOutput Explanation:\n",

But it's much more complex than classic exam LET&CAL183 : Calculators come in various programming languages. Some of them are formal and written down, but most will probably assume some background knowledge from you. Your task is to write a Python program that can preprocess the unencrypted exam screenplay you get, so that you can decrypt it on an exam terminal. All exam terminals are designed to be quite fast, so decryption must be speedy. To get the specs of your terminal, use the function test_terminal(). To submit a terminal as your answer to seeds, use github: calc_exam or use the page form here. Click on \"Submit Exam Answer\", instead of the other red one.\n\n# Coding\n\nExercise 1 No Pain, No Gain\n\nYou have a knitting machine that can produce a square piece of woolen fabric at the rate of one row per second. On day one, you knit a fabric with a side length of one centimeter. Every day, you cheerfully enlarge the fabric by 50% of its side length. The 50% enlargement then becomes the new side length on day 2. After 20 days, the woolen fabric measures 255 cm, or you could say, 42 inches.\n\nCalculate the number of hours required to create this fabric.\n\nFull Title:    No Pain, No Gain\n\nOne-word answer:\n\nExtra points:    Emphatically true (Words to Ponder).   Extra points:    Emphatically false (Words to Ponder).\n\nExtra points:    True (Choose a title)\n\nExtra points:    False (Choose a title)\n\nExercise 2 Jump over the fence\n\nA man has built a fence around his house. Because he was kind of drunk when he did so, he placed the poles exactly a meter apart. Using 16 poles, he managed to cover the square two-dimensional part of the house. Before the sun rises, his son James has passed the night as a road worker and has constructed a wall. However, it turns out his wall can't meet the requirements of the laws about road maintenance, since the fences on the adjacent roads collide. The result of James's hard work has now become a third of a square meter.\n\n### Question:\n\nIn the morning, before the sun rises, we need to understand how the fence made by James will look like.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nStudy the problem described. Break down the task into subtasks. Use the appropriate tools and resources to solve the issue.\n\nIf needed, conduct research on any unknown concepts or terminology.\n\nUse awareness of the bigger picture to direct your approach in solving the issue.\n\nProvide a comprehensive solution in code. Testing and debugging may be required.\n\nDescription of the solution, including advanced considerations or trade-offs (if necessary).\n\n### Code:\n\nThe above code is run using the command \"g++ -w jump.cpp -o jump;\" followed by \"./jump\".\n\n### Answer:\n\ncode for the above task The output will be this image\n\nExercise 3 Minimum path\n\n# Game Theories\n\nGame Theory is the form of mathematics and the science that deals with strategic decision making. The focus is on optimal strategies to maximize the expected rewards in competitive circumstances or cooperative schemes.\n\nGame theory can make a prediction on what one will do in accordance with the anticipated output of the opponents. We identify these participants as players in the game in which the rewards or payoffs are attached to the strategy they follow. Knowledge about the expected goals of the other players and access to information about the strategy they are following is paramount when playing a game.\n\nGame Theory is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It is useful in numerous applications, such as in businesses and economics, sports, and the social sciences. It can also be used to analyze wars, politics, and other interplay activities. While there are many types of games, in game theory, they are classified into three categories  based on their payoff structure– Cooperative, Non-cooperative, and Dynamic.\n\n• Exercises Test\n• Logic Gates\n• Programming\n• Simplifying Boolean Expression\n• Grinder",
