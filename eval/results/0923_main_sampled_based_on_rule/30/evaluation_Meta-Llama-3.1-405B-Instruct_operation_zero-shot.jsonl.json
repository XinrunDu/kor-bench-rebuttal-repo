We are given two equations based on this rule: 7 ○ 2 = 208 and 2 ○ 3 = 77.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Rule to the First Equation\nFor the first equation, 7 ○ 2 = 208, we substitute A = 7 and B = 2 into the rule to get (7 + 3*2) × (x*7 + y*2) = 208. This simplifies to (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208, which further simplifies to 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the First Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 13 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 7x + 2y = 208 / 13, which simplifies to 7x + 2y = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Second Equation\nFor the second equation, 2 ○ 3 = 77, we substitute A = 2 and B = 3 into the rule to get (2 + 3*3) × (x*2 + y*3) = 77. This simplifies to (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77, which further simplifies to 11 × (2x + 3y) = 77.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the Second Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 11 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 2x + 3y = 77 / 11, which simplifies to 2x + 3y = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the System of Equations\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) 7x + 2y = 16\n2) 2x + 3y = 7\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the second equation by 2 and the first equation by 3, we can eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal but opposite in sign.\n\n## Step 7: Eliminate y\nMultiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 4x + 6y = 14. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us 21x + 6y = 48. Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives us (21x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 48 - 14, which simplifies to 17x = 34.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of 17x = 34 by 17 gives us x = 2.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for y\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Using 2x + 3y = 7 and substituting x = 2 gives us 2*2 + 3y = 7, which simplifies to 4 + 3y = 7. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3y = 3.

However, we also consider the scenario where X could be any number larger than 4 but the operation § will always result in 8 being selected if the other number is 4. This misunderstanding needs correction as it does not align with the original analysis of how § operates. \n\nCorrectly, if X were less than 8 but greater than 4, (X § 4) would still equal X because X is larger than 4 in that range, but it wouldn't satisfy (X § 4) = 8 unless X is exactly 8 or more, in which case it would indeed be 8 or more that's selected, fulfilling the requirement of the operation.\n\nHowever, given the operation's definition and the requirement for (X § 4) to equal 8, it actually indicates X must be exactly 8 or more because the operation selects the larger number, and we have established that the larger number is 8. If X were less than 8, even if greater than 4, it wouldn't fulfill the given equation correctly as per the defined operation § unless it is exactly 8. Therefore, X must be greater than or equal to 8 to ensure that the larger number selected by § is indeed 8, aligning with the equation's requirement.\n\nThe correct interpretation should be that X must be greater than or equal to 8 because only then does the operation § yield 8 as required by the equation.\n\nThus, the answer should be correctly framed as:\n[[X ≥ 8]]",

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4. Multiplying the entire equation by 4y to clear the denominator gives us 4 + 4y^2 = 17y.\n\n## Step 7: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation to a quadratic equation form gives us 4y^2 - 17y + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 4, b = -17, and c = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Plug in the values into the quadratic formula\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us y = [17 ± sqrt((-17)^2 - 4*4*4)] / (2*4).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression under the square root\nCalculating the expression under the square root gives us y = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 8, which simplifies to y = [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 8.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the square root\nCalculating the square root gives us y = [17 ± 15] / 8.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for y\nSolving for y gives us two possible values: y = [17 + 15] / 8 or y = [17 - 15] / 8, which simplifies to y = 32/8 or y = 2/8. Simplifying these fractions gives us y = 4 or y = 1/4.\n\n## Step 13: Recall that y = log base 3 of X\nGiven that y = log base 3 of X, we have log base 3 of X = 4 or log base 3 of X = 1/4.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for X\nSolving for X in both equations gives us X = 3^4 or X = 3^(1/4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the value of X\nCalculating the value of X gives us X = 81 or X = 3^(1/4).
