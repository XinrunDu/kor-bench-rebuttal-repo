However, considering the original intent of being the opposite of the encryption steps and that step (3) in encryption replaces a letter with one from substitution_alphabet, in the decryption we should replace \"K\" from the result of step (2) with its position in the standard_alphabet that corresponds to \"K\" in the reversed_alphabet. Instead, find the position of \"K\" in reversed_alphabet and get its position from the reversed_alphabet in \"standard_alphabet\", it should be \"T\" that maps to \"K\" in reversed order but \"K\" will always map to \"T\". So:\n  Find the 11th position in standard_alphabet, which is indeed \"K\", but in reverse mapping from the reversed alphabet (with this specific step needing correction to properly align with inverse processes) for this type of encryption algorithm it should be mapped as (since nothing changes) it follows L to K mapping inversion back to \"K\", however this seems more steps due to reversed order steps concern confusion with reversing.\n\nIn order to maintain consistency in responses to this process using an inverted reversal simply implements (A to Z) and generate L for \"K\".\n\nConsidering these factors here on maintaining inverted procedures on final result presumed [[L]].",

Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: \"BU\" is already a two-letter group.\n\n4. For the double-letter group \"BU\" of the plaintext:\n    - In Gird1, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird4, find the position of 'B' (2nd row, 2nd column) and 'U' (2nd row, 5th column).\n    - In Gird2, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird1, which is 'D' (1st row, 2nd column) and 'U' has no position in the row with 'B' so we proceed with next rows, we find 'U' at (2nd row, last column) but there is a different letter at the intersection of 2 columns, hence intersect the 2nd column and the column of 'U', find the letter corresponding to this position which is 'F'. Next find the letter at the row of 'B' from Gird1 and column of 'U' from Gird1 to get the result, we find 'B' at (1st row, last column - D comes before B, so the row cannot be the one where 'D' and 'G' are) the row must be the one where 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N' are, because if we go further, 'U' cannot be there, we find 'M'.\n    - In Gird3, find the letter corresponding to the position of 'B' in Gird4, which is 'K' (3rd row, 1st column is V and B comes after A so that cannot be, if we go to the next row A comes before B and so the one row below that one should have B) and find the letter corresponding to 'U' which has no position in the row with 'B', so find 'U' in other rows (at 1st row last column). Now find 'M' from previous result, form columns and find other letters around M from other Grid - K comes above.\n    In such case as an intersecting columns approach didn't provide us with values we would use two rows - of M from Grid1 and other letter would normally appear one row below or above.\n    Hence combining this logic for bu the final values for an encrypted result out of two grid for bu in a first grids turns C M.    \n    Therefore, the encrypted answer is [[CM]].",

        "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"KN\", we first need to follow the encryption rules:\n\n- Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plaintext and convert them to capital letters. The plaintext is already in uppercase letters and has no spaces or punctuation, so we have \"KN\".\n- Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`. Since \"KN\" has only 2 characters, we need to fill it with 4 `#` to make a group of 6 characters: \"KN####\".\n- Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups: \"KN\", \"##\", \"##\".\n\nFor the binary group \"(K,N)\" do the following:\n\n- Determine the row and column numbers  of \"K\" in Grid 1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`. We find that \"K\" is in the 1st row and 10th column (0-based index), but since the grid only has 9 columns, we need to consider it as the last column (8th) of the second row. Thus, (1,8).\n- However, following the exact grid, K is at position (1,8).\n- Determine the row and column numbers of \"N\" in Grid 2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`. We find that \"N\" is in the 8th row and 2nd column, (7,2).\n- Find the corresponding number `num3` in Grid 3 from `l1_row` (1) and `l2_col` (2). 1 and 2 in Grid 3 correspond to the number 3 (0-based index).\n- Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers: `(8, 3, 7)`.\n\nFor the binary group \"(#,#)\" do the following:\n\n- Determine the row and column numbers  of \"#\" in Grid 1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`. We find that \"#\" is in the 2nd row and 8th column, (2,8).\n- Determine the row and column numbers of \"#\" in Grid 2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`. We find that \"#\" is in the 8th row and 2nd column, (8,2).\n- Find the corresponding number `num3` in Grid 3 from `l1_row` (2) and `l2_col` (2). 2 and 2 in Grid 3 correspond to the number 6 (0-based index).\n- Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers: `(8, 6, 8)`.\n\nThe final encrypted message is: \"8 3 7 8 6 8\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[837868]].",

For each binary group:\n    - (B,K):\n        - Row and column numbers of B in Grid 1: (2,1)\n        - Row and column numbers of K in Grid 2: (5,2)\n        - Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid 3 from l1_row and l2_col: num3 = 8 (from 2,2 in Grid 3, so we use 2 as column and row is the one. Here  in that column we see 8 in row where 2 is present in column)\n        - Output the triple: (1, 8, 5)\n    - (#,#), (#,#):\n        - These groups will be filled with the correct values from the grids as follows:\n            - Row and column numbers of # in Grid 1: (2,8)  \n            - Row and column numbers of # in Grid 2: (8,2)\n            - Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid 3 from l1_row and l2_col: num3 = 9 (from 2,2 in Grid 3)\n            - Output the triple: (8, 9, 8) for the first binary group.\n            - Same process will provide same triple for second binary group. Hence (8,9,8) will be output for second also\n5. After performing the previous step multiple times, read the triples to form a string of numbers: 185889889\n\nEncrypted answer: [[185889889]]",

The column count is determined by the column count in the ciphertext (i.e., at each \"#\", switch to the next column). Since the ciphertext has a total of 6 \"#\", we need 6 columns. And, to make the set column and row consistent we count them based on #.\n\nO - F - W\nC - M - T\nF - H - (no character)\nU - U - (no character)\n\n\n- After this, we read the lines according to the specified rules: odd number rows from left to right and even number rows from right to left.

        "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"XV\", we follow the decryption steps:\n\n- Divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"X\" and \"V\"\n\nSince \"XV\" has only two characters, we treat it as a direct mapping to row and column.\n\n- The position of X in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 (Y C G X 7 L) and the position of V in the encrypted character set is flagged as 3 ( J V O E M).\n- However, X is in a different row. X's position in the matrix should be looked up for accurate row number - X is at row 3. V's position in the encrypted character set tells us the column should be column corresponding to the third letter in the encrypted character set. We look up V, and it's in row 5. So the column in our 6x6 matrix isn't 3 with X and V, instead it's row and column numbers of where they stand and with 0 representing \"A\". Given just \"XV\", finding row and column from the positions in \"ADFGVX\" back to 0-5, we note:\n  - X is in \"Y C G X 7 L\". But X appear at 3 in encrypted character set 'ADFGVX'. However, when looking at 4th row (3 in 0-5 notation), X's row is \"Y C G X 7 L\" or 3, converting this row to the proper row using \"ADFGVX\", we note X = 'X' is indeed at the correct row. The row of 'X' in \"ADFGVX\" is 3. From there X is 4 in 'ADFGVX', it indeed holds true. The value of X in ADFGVX thus gives us the column, not row. The value of V in ADFGVX gives us column and V sits at row 5, 0 represents A in 'ADFGVX'. So, from step to step say V is value, say third value has it be column, our A is 0, last value column is 5.\n    Decrypted column (V's value in ADFGVX - 0) = 5 \n    Our current paragraph row decrypted (current row from X's value - 0) = 3 \n    Input encrypted string value represented X into columns to represent alphabet. And value is from position 5 as per the current column number corresponding value encrypted in that place.\n\n\nPlaintext is at: [[Y]]",
