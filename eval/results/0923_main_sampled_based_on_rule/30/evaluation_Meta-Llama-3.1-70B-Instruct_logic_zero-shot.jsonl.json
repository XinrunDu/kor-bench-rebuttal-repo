(~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) is a Level C formula, as it contains one logical connective (&) and the connected formulas are Level C and Level B formulas, respectively. However, since it contains a nested structure of a Level C formula inside, we need to consider this higher level.\n\nGiven that the initial classification inside the parentheses already contained a Level C formula, the entire formula can be considered at least Level C. However, we must then classify the nested structure more precisely, leading to the understanding that it is one step beyond Level C due to the nesting of a level C formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct level is Z+1, since we move beyond the standard alphabet classification due to higher-level nesting.\n\nHowever, for consistency and adherence to conventional notation used here, classification beyond Z is typically kept to the letter hierarchy before resorting to Z+n, implying we didn't here explicitly use Z category starting point (A to Z definition vs Zplus): \nBased on further careful examination the statement in question actually is an exemplar of a Level D formula.\n\nThe answer is [[D]].",
