This can be done using the expression: (p3||p4)&~(p3&p4)\nExpression: (p3||p4)&~(p3&p4)\n\n### Answer: [[ p1&p2 ];[ (p3||p4)&~(p3&p4) ];[ (p3||p4) ]],",

        "response": "## Step 1: Determine the structure of the given formula\nThe given formula is (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1). To determine its level, we need to identify the logical connectives and their compositions.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the formula into Level B formulas\nThe given formula can be broken down into two main components:\n1. (~(p1=::>~p2))\n2. ((p3||p4)=~p1)\n\nBoth of these components are Level C formulas, as they contain nested logical connectives. However, we can further simplify them by identifying their Level B subformulas.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the Level B subformulas\nWithin the first component, ~(p1=::>~p2) can be viewed as a single Level B formula with a \"not\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p1=::>~p2. \n\nWithin the second component, (p3||p4)=~p1 can also be viewed as a single Level B formula with an \"if and only if\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p3||p4 and ~p1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the composition of the Level C formula\nThe original formula combines these two Level C formulas with an \"and\" connective. Here, both components come from simplifying the composition of logical connectives on their respective subformulas.\n\n## Step 5: Classify the formula based on its structure\nSince the original formula contains more than one logical connective and at least one multi-level subformula (especially considering p1=::>~p2 which already contains several logical levels), it is clear that the formula's structure does not belong to a basic Level A or solitary Level B formula. Counting the fact that we actually have nested components whose structure exceeds a simple 2-level structure. \n\n## Step 6: Classify the level according to the number of nested logical connectives\nBased on this analysis, the level of the given formula can be calculated. Level A has 0, Level B has 1, Level C has at least 2.\n\nLevel C has been identified as the least level matching our criteria, we describe the formula, which has even a more complex structure: \nboth formula are connected by \"&\" to a larger formula.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final classification of the formula\nWhen we analyze the structure of the formula, we realize that its true complexity surpasses the initial calculation due to multiple nested connectives so that the simplified criterion applied here predicts the minimal Level matching the number of nesting inside such Level B structures inside full-powered Level C subformula.\n\nThe final answer is: [[Z]]",

To determine the type of the given formulas (1) and (2), we need to understand their subformulas and logical structures in relation to the components of the Truth Formula.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the type of formula (1) p1=::>(p1||p2)\nFormulas (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) forms a level C formula, because it is a formula with nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula, which is (p1||p2).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the type of formula (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1\nSimilarly, formula (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 also forms a level C formula for the same reason as in step 2. It has a nested logical connective (=::>) containing two Level A formulas, p1 and p2.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new given information\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are components of a Truth Formula, this must mean both (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) must be truth formulas themselves. \n\n## Step 5: Determine the answer type for each given formula.\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are both truth formulas, and they correspond to formulas (1) and (2), it also means that both (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) and (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 are truth formulas.\n\nThe final answer is [[B];[B]].",

Apply the absorption and distributive laws:\n(p∨r)∧(¬q∨r) \n (p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ (r∧r)\n(p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ r  (since r∧r = r)\n \n2.

In this scenario, S is animals that have been injured and P is them hiding in quiet places and repeatedly licking their mouths with their heads. The conditions A, B, etc., are related to the animals being injured and having salivary glands that have been removed manually. However, since the removal of salivary glands is not the only condition that differs, Method ⸮ is not the best fit.\n\nMethod ؆:\nThis method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. In our scenario, when animals are injured (S) they exhibit both hiding in quiet places and licking their mouths (P). However, we do not have a case where animals are not injured (S' in the notation for method ؆) and P does not occur. Therefore, Method ؆ is also not a good fit.\n\nMethod ꙮ:\nThis method requires us to identify both positive and negative groups. Positive group: animals that have been injured and exhibit the conditions P, and negative group: where animals are not injured, but exhibit no condition P. In our experiment, animals with normal salivary glands exhibit the conditions P (hiding and licking), while animals with their salivary glands removed do not show the conditions P (P is absent). There is a group of animals with removed salivary glands where P is missing. However, it seems we are focusing on animals with intact versus absent glands. This is not conducive to explicit negative distinction and separation, which is required for the logic of method ꙮ. \n\nWe now analyze the Provided information in conjunction with all Positive and Negative from experiments which would highlight that only method ⵣ could potentially explain the relation of cause and effect in this discourse. \n\nMethod ⵣ:\nThis method involves observing when changes in S correspond to changes in P. In this scenario, S is the presence or absence of salivary glands, and P is the healing time of a wound. The presence or absence of salivary glands (S) directly corresponds to a change in healing time (P). When salivary glands are present, wounds heal faster (P1), but when salivary glands are removed (S2), wounds take longer to heal (P2). This direct correspondence between changes in S and P makes Method ⵣ the most suitable fit for the given discourse.\n\nThe answer is:  [[D]]",
