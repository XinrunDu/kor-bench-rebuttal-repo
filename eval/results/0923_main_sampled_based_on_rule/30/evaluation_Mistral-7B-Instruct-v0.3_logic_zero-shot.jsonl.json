Here's the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p ∨ q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p ∨ ¬q): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q ∨ ¬r): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}.\n\n2. Initialize S0 and S2 as empty sets:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S2 = ∅\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S0 (empty) and (p ∨ q) from S1: dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = p (since we have p from both (p ∨ q) clauses). Add p to S2: S2 = {p}.\n   - Since S0 and S1 have no other simple disjunctive clauses to resolve, move to the next step.\n\n4. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S1 with (p ∨ ¬q) (note that this resolution technique creates two cases for L and L’, which should be considered):\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = ¬q, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = q. Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = p, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = 0. Since dispel(C1, C2) = 0 outputs “Implausible”, terminate the calculation.\n   - Since there's no other pair of clauses to resolve in S1, move to the next step.\n\n5. Check S2:\n   - Since S2 contains two elements ({p, q}), there is no satisfying assignment, so the given conjunctive normal form is implausible. Thus, S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm are as follows:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}\n   - S2 = {p, q}",

In our case, it is given as ()AP, MI(), ∴SIP.\n\nTo obtain the parentheses, we have to express M()P and S()M in terms of the given rule's representation.\n\nFor the first part M(), MI() represents ∃p1, so we should find a proposition that is such that (p1 → M) holds. Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents ∃p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that ∃p1 ∧ p2 → p3. Suppose p2 is p1, then the second part becomes ∃p1, p1 → p3, which holds for all p3 when it's true that p3 follows from p1.\n\n- For EIO: M() should be either E or I. E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 → p3. For I, S() should be O. However, ∃p1 ∧ ∃p1 → ¬p3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 → p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that ∃p1, ¬p1 → p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes ∃p1, ¬p1 ∧ p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[¬p3]; [p1]]. In other words, the parentheses can be filled in as (¬p3)AP, M(p1), ∴SIP.",
