If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\n\nGiven the equation 25※X※14 = 4, we can start by deducing the relationship between 25, X, and 14.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 could be on the inside of the repeated operation, and we'd have 25 modifications (one per occurrence of the repeated operation). However, this would result in a multiplication of 25 raised to an undefined power, which is impossible. So, X must not be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, 25 also cannot be a multiple of X or 14, as it would violate the given equation.\n\nNow, it's time to see if X is a multiple of 14. If it were, then the repeated operation would result in 14 being on the inside, and again, there would be 14 modifications (one for each occurrence of the repeated operation). This would lead to 14 * (14/X + 2) = 4.\n\nSolving for X would give us X = 14 / (1 - 4/14). Calculate this to find that X = 3.\n\nHowever, since we cannot exclude the possibility that 25 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 14, then we must consider the last case of the rule, a※b = 24. This means that 25※X∗14 = 24 * X * 14 because neither 25, X, nor 14 are multiples of each other. Simplifying the equation gives us: 25 * X * 14 = 24 * 196. Solving for X gives us multiple solutions:\n\n* X = 196 / (25 * 14) = 8/11\n* X = 4*196 / (25 * 14) = 16/11\n* X = 9*196 / (25 * 14) = 72/11\n* X = 24*196 / (25 * 14) = 316/11\n\nSince X must be an integer but we only have fractional values as possibilities, those options are not valid and our initial solution (X=3) remains the only viable answer.\n\nTherefore, [[X=3]].",
