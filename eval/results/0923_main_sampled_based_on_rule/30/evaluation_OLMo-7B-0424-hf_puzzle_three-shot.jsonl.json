[[and]] and you will have the opportunity to create new opportunity. and [[Yes]] One of the most amazing physics experiments of all time was conducted by two Chinese physicists in 2001. In that experiment, they generated two electron orbits, one on the outside of the other, and used them to create an electro-magnetic field that altered the behavior of another atom. The second electron circled the outside one, while the third electron circled the inside one. Due to the high energy they were working with, this created a magnetic field. But as the speed increased, they observed an electromagnetic force emerging. The two observers thought of this force as a form of expression, and as an expression, it had to be considered in terms of its physical existence. They were interested in the ways in which this force could be used by people interested in their personal lives. They decided to examine the force itself. The magnetic force was connected to the orbit of each of the two electrons. The two electrons were in parallel. One electron was orbiting in one direction, and they simultaneously made an orbit in the opposite direction. They understood that as the speed increased, the force increased as well. [[and]] and there were other experiments too, such as these carried out by physicists at Harvard University and MIT. Their results were similar to those of the scientists at the two Chinese physics labs. They discovered that with the magnetic force, the behavior of the electrons was different at the atomic level, which ultimately influenced their actions. They hypothesized that this force might be an expression of the physicality of the electrons themselves, and thus the force itself was related to their physical laws. [[and]] and though the force\n\n### Answer:\n[[and]] supported the concept that the electron was part of the universe. [[and]] supported the concept that the electron was part of the universe.

Congratulations once more. That puzzle will not appear again. And now you head to the next possible puzzle. Once you have done that, or did not find any, head back to where you started.\nOk. Now, I shall take you back to where you started. Be sure to check out the [Run Report] for the puzzles you did complete, and perhaps see any action back on the net itself.\n\nWe are glad to have you.\nThe solution above is what most people do. Usually people will spend a few days putting it together. Some will look up the solution while others will come up with it first time. Then, before pressing complete, they may look up others who have solved it. Then they would post their answer in the comments section.\n\nNow you are a legend! You've completed puzzle number 1089!

(That is, if some entry had the string \"book\" in the title, that would get turned into an international entry of \"Book\".) This doesn't break anything, but if it were unexpected it might be surprising.\n\nThere is a fuller explanation of the reasons behind the design of BibTeX in the AustACP-lein manual - Type Theory Manipulation Usage category.

Solve Abbrev Word¶s Puzzles.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Think through the logic that will be needed to solve this puzzle type.\n2. Discuss any concepts that you find difficult or are unclear.\n3. Once you understand the full picture of the puzzle type, you can apply that understanding to the specific puzzle provided.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nA value is indicated for each cell on a grid (representing a top down view if you imagine a large rectangle as a grid). The rules that govern each cell's value are that (1) each cell's value is the largest number whose digits are the same as those on the rows and columns of the cell's location, and (2) no cell can have a value greater than its upper right neighbor. For example for a 2x2 grid:\n17\n1 8\nThe solution would be 2. The rules are broken if an 8 were put into the middle row of the grid and a 17 were put into the top row. The digits on each of these rows are identical, so by rule 1 the only cell value is 17, but by rule 2 the value of the top cell would need to be less than or equal to the answer. This makes the 17 be tied in another cell (probably the one in binary haha). So the only solution for a 2x2 grid is 2.\n\nWith a larger grid, in this grid for example:\n13 2 6 6 8 74 1 55 141 31 33 13 67 3 3 4 41 1 97 934 132 95 1 4 45 67 8 6 7 196 38 5 33 9 4 146 83 3 1 14 11 10 3 2 46 27 3 21 3 695 25 4 3 86 34\n\nthe solution is 1.\n\nThe rules are \"spaces\" between cells also count as digits. The two 8s in the top row are given the same state as one 8, if it were next to the other 8. So in a two dimensional grid, if the grid is space separated, then there are two 8s. Likewise if two cells have the same digit and one of those digits is adjacent to a space, then both of those cells have that digit.\n\n### Question:\n11\n1 1 88 3\n\n### Answer:\n6\n\n### Question:\n8 8\n1 11 198 3\n200 3 8 2\n\n### Answer:\n1 13\nA value could also be put outside the grid but that is impossible for this grid for example. Also all numbers are 32 bit integers so no numbers greater than 9999999 are allowed.\n\n### Question:\n3 11 2 8 1 7 4 1 33 16 14 2 4 16\n2 1 2 6 3 1 77 1\n1 1 6 17 48 30 2 1\n1 4 10 8 3 4 1 31 2\n1 1 8 2 5 94 9 8 16 2\n18 2 2 4 4 81 111 1 1\n4 15 19 5 6 4 1 9 77 3\n2 49 1 4 2 69 16 18 46\n2 2\n\n### Answer:\n2 3 1 55 2 57 2 5 1\n\n### Question:\n1 1 1 233213 7 1 6\n2 2 1 1 63412347\n1 6 6 54557 6 1 5\n5 1 2 2 3 4 7 5325\n7 7 1 35 1 7 6 866\n67 7 1 1 678 4 6 1\n8 7 1 1 86 1 4 1\n4 7 1 7 7 5 23 7 8\n2 8 4\n2 2 8\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\nP J\nR A J\nY T L\nV N B\nM M S\nZ I J\nN D T\nC O O\nU W M\nG I T\nX T L\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\n1 20454\n",

You would like to make sure that your code is working correctly by comparing it against the output of the materials file service.\n\nThe output of the materials file is a file containing the entire puzzle, answers, and some other helpful information. The following are steps to emulate that output file.\n\nYour code should follow these steps to satisfy the pin-out tests:\n\n• Step 1: The file should be a plain text file.\n• Step 2: The file extension should be .puzzle.txt.\n• Step 3: The file should contain a single stream of text.\n• Step 4: The text should run for the entire length of the file.\n• Step 5: The character separating puzzle configurations and answers, i.e. |, should be on every row.\n• Step 6: | should be followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 7: The | character is the only one that does not have any character outside of its columns followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 8: The puzzle configurations are followed by a ##.\n• Step 9: The answers are followed by a #.\n• Step 10: The #s only have greedy answer blocks followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 11: The character separating columns inside a row should be a |.\n• Step 12: Which character separates greedy columns inside of a greedy block is [optional].\n• Step 13: Greedy blocks follow their greedy columns by a | followed by space ( ).\n• Step 14: A newline (\\n) character follows the end of the entire file.\n• Step 15: Steps 8-14 occur once for each answer and configuration in the answer and configurations sections of the materials file.\n\nThe example puzzles defined in the previous challenge are provided below as seed material that you can check for correctness of the matching materials file. These files should be exactly what you are submitting.\n\nThe materials file service expects to receive the following requirements for your code to pass all three mechanisms of criteria:\n\n1. A successful post to POST URL\n2. The contents of POST URL match the file defined in the file comparison criteria.\n3. The file is not corrupt.\nvar _materialsService = new JUSTINHM.PoRank.MaterialsService();\nvar puzzlePath = \"path/to/puzzle.txt\";\n\n// only the contents of the puzzle is sent\nvar parameters = new\n{\npuzzlePath = puzzlePath\n};\n\n// POST a POST URL\n_materialsService.Post(parameters);\n\n\nFor representations of ordinary text data like plain text files, ASCII, UTF-8, or an equivalent encoding can be used. If your format is at all specialized, like a zip file or a binary or hex encoded or any alternative format than TEX, LATEX, or plain text files, you MUST provide a defined decoder alongside your code.\n\nThis challenge is worth 80 points in total.\n\nThis is a pass-fail challenge for which you must satisfy all of the contents of the Materials File Service challenge to receive any points. If less than 82 out of the 80 points are satisfied, you will not receive any credit.\n\nIf any of the steps in these contents were not satisfied, you will not receive any points even if you have met all other requirements and passed the post-submission criteria challenge.\n\n## Test Case 5\n\nAgility\n\n### Description\n\n• A 0 is memory mapped to 0-bit\n• ::= * is included\n• A 1 is memory mapped to 1-bit\n• +/! are included\n\nThe answer consists of each individual line in the puzzle's output in a certain order. The input map should be a binary representation of the columns and rows of each of the answers in the order, followed by each individual line of puzzle matrix in their order, a line break, followed by each individual line of puzzle matrix in their order.\n\nThe valid letters are A-Z, MHELNIK, and 0-9. Other characters, i.e. UPPER_ALPHABET, LOWER_ALPHABET, NUMBER, TELEPHONE, RULE, and ALL_SCRAMBLE_RUPTURE are not valid for clues. The other conditions from the materials file challenge (above) are also enforced.\n\nThe valid matrices according to the files are\n\n### Puzzle Answer Test Case 5\n\nHere's what the output of the matrix needs to look like in order to pass - ODER on a sheet of paper - in order so that you can solve for the correct output\n\n### Example answer (Torchin)\n\nANALYSER uidystems.\nBHELNIK Trent.\n\nDiaz nth l)usefulljob.\nFsciel under parep/k).\nMATRIC GRUB Mabell.\n\n.12/e Matrix.\nFusdone bprimrning .\nResiundfunnless aivcri.\n\nLABC rnes are in\notiMErr.\nSp hantoms .\n\n### Output\n\nODER\n\n### Example answer (Cochrane)\n\nHes outside a place.\nIt's a breathing word. -------\nA parental noun,  2 D ency.\n\nMountain Faura Dialyt Cochran\n\nKus under go.\n",

Sums used. Numbers used at most once.\n\nNote that the ' sums used' are only numbers used. Therefore, if a number is added (core therefore makes up one of its own ' sums') that is not marked, the function is not functional.\n\n2. How many possibilities are there for the sum? Number of defined squares.\n\nFor example, a 4-dimensional sum will have 3 dimensions ( horizontal, vertical, using diagram )\n\n\"Diagrams may have extra information to help you solve puzzles!\n\n(some part of the puzzle may be separated in parts/steps, sometimes parts might be similar(same/repeated)\". When looking at to the sum and the number of dimensions total, another possibility is the intersection of the dimensions, for the sum of the 3 dimensions, a sum of intersections is equal to problems (the sum of intersection over intersections). Also a combination of intersections (horizontal + vertical) adds horizontal or vertical to the number of squares to look up the sum. This is more complicated since it holds a square when there is no rule adding one dimension horizontal or the other.\n\n3. Each square can be defined as a subset such as( a board of numbers from the puzzle, score, blank square). (There may be more definitions / de-mutations (context).\n\n4. If all numbers are added then mapping is the inverse of the what is called an N-tuple of vertices on a 2d space which is an N-dimentional space.\n\n• #### Question:\n\n1. For the board how do (we/map ) the sum discrete number to a continuous space and how can we relate the number to the part. 2. How do (We/map) the dice dice to the set of positive integers and negative. 3. How do we do/work out the sums (we/map )the sum discrete numbers to a continuous space and how can we relate the number to the part\n\nIf one can figure the sums, then there is a solution based on probabilities. The mapping can be solved separately, but only after all squares have been filled. However many problems show that the answer is not found by just pressing the available numbers to the grid such that squares are filled with the greatest gaps, looking for a singular set if feasible .\n\n• #### Question:\n\nthere are some numbers (lets say 3,4,5 ) which are-->we can divide every square and by adding 1 positive and negative ( it can start from 0 -Davide and Devana Hedic).\n\nQuestion:-\n\nThis is for:: (Davide and Daiva Hedic) : we are told to combine all rows and columns, then every square has a positive and negative.  What do you think the specific process (only 2 steps?)\n\nwhen there are two diagonals (I think from positive to negative) we can soo determine. I mean how big is the grid? I think every be relative.\n\n3 2 6\n6 5 3\n10 8 1\n4 172 3\nIt is an easy problem I see it. However I have a question that is my solution is correct? and believe me now is similar to the first problem the other is easy too. 3- Octal Hey is known? is generally easier than 6?\nSo you did put the numbers 1-10?\nWhy do we ask?\n\nBasically there are 2 little diagonal.\n\nPut diagonal in 1-10 so it will go\n\n3 is first diagonal with 3 in one of the rows but then we will also get 8 what is the adition for each?\n\nif we had used 10 then it would be 10+3=13 ok,another question: does that work if we use different numbers different than 3,8,10?\n\nBecause we put the numbers 1-10 in from the easiest to the one the greast one.\n\nAlso you draw a picture and you can see the squares what make problems. It's for this puzzle for deparserédier\n\nIt maywell be easy for you but think about problem.\n\n• #### Question:\n\nknow it is clear you explained the grid and computed the sum and do you think to describe more thing or related in the puzzle.\n\nHow do we describe?\n\nwell it should be clear but I have another question put octal 3 in 1-10 like 2 graphs each from 1-10 in each row not all the rows have to be filled + each row and each list of numbers make 9 sum of 1,2. it should be clear now what more can i do?\n\n• #### Question:\n\n2. sqrt 3 + 1\n\nin messages 3 and 4 I say the same answer but I added one square from diagonal front to diagonal back this is clear that the problem is involves one vertical less one horizontal(deux grandes diagonales , one diagonal is the white(the line) 7- 19 one of hese is removed. if ti becomes 13 that means this is correct one diagonal. Here the introduced number 1 only this is what the symbol suggest not the problem.\n\nsrry..... how will we describe (mathematically) the problem?\n\n• #### Question:\n\nTo know where the two diagonal are put one diagonal (+ back) first and then you will get the number (if diagonal used find out but later) you can add numbers but not consecutive and it will be huge. The square get numbers from 1-10 like Octal 6 in horizontals i see it only from horizontals 6+5+3=16 (3 is coding the sum of octal as sequential sum it is wrong but this is okay. Is octal monatomic?\n\nThe diagonal is (61.25,65) so it is not correct to 11+6 square because square is just 5. Also, to start with (this code is just if we talk about diagonal) but to put is diagonal into horizontals is codings one diagonal to go diagonal is 10 for diagonal it should define the diagonal like coding+ 8Squared + 10 multiplied with sum. It means that it is like square. We don't use 2 diagonal. We have one diagonal. Basically it is not correct to put octal number in flaw to go at the diagonal.\n\nYou are specialize in article and edit but you must be as your users and use more specific code for example if you have squares and NON- CROSSES it may be helpful I think BUT OKAY I will consider this in the near future. There are problems involved with writing square in papers. Already already square is NOT useless but I think that it may be used with proofs and examples where having an extra diagonal go2the answer.\n\nIn one way you got to increasing the sum of numbers by filling the white lines and if you are solving for sum 13. the sum is 13.} by x. Not by y or y+z because it is not y+. It's in your place.\n\nSquares by the way may be used for solving other problem like max squares. What if for example the number is 4-6 ? Are there any ways in solving problems if they go the same but not as well as you would like to.\n\n• #### Question:\n\nIt means you can distruct the domain vertically or horizontally   what is the first most common osimomer from x amount PERCILLAN ##\n\n• #### Question:\n\nMy reaction 1. I will do the first step. You can do the second step the wrire out in the document where you can have that but anyway the max problem is about having no difference between the numbers and having a strengts because we have two secret numbers in the mystery number i mean if it is like one problem more then an extra chip is added to a solution she wont be too far off. There are also problems like what we do in the book shvesheia this summer. Let's do what we wnt to do. There are two numbers gives the number of simplexes of a 3-dimensional simplege polytheene(real space) heuse have two numbers and the coolest thing is that the n- fourth of the homologous-dimension is equal to the sum of hese numbers. It is less means it r smaller jnow is that?\n\nWhat is the the beautiful sharf about the number 15?\n\nQuote from (3.1) in Introduction to surface topology page no. 39-40  Come its late i dont think about it to reply. It is also possible if we have more than 2 sovereign. some number goes from the largest to the smallest.\n\nThe hard part is to define letters (2 sovereign) but what about F when we did more than 2 components of the given surface and there are not 2 sovereign for components so\n\n2. we have when there is no pure sums\n\n• #### Question:\n\n3) Q3.

From the remaining points we can create several  befriends [-1,3, -2, 8, 2, 11].befriends is a constant string. The points befriended are the first and last numbers from the rewards and changes can be only done in ascending order. We mark all befriended numbers with X. An example below, each number is an element in a line. Since line elements are not specified, ans is an array of these elements. ans is hardcoded in the form: [[num1],[num2Xnumnumnum3],…]. The goal is to make a solution that takes a point in the line and replaces it with an X, being sure that once the solution takes a point then the current friend will not be replaced and the number is not already marked X. Otherwise we have a full solution if the full line becomes X. We want the solution that we will take the most points in a single solution. The final answer should be given in a space separated list of integers. Use square brackets for your own array solution, where the rearranged points are listed in the same order as in the original array. Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[1 2 X 3 4 X]], where 1 2 3 4 are the original points and X represents the befriended point.\n\n### Question:\n1 2 X 2 X 3 4 2 1 1 3 4 3 1 1 X\n9 2 X 3 3 1 3 4 2 4 3 4 2 4 4 1\n5 3 X 6 4 X 2 3 3 4 5 4 1 1 5 1\n4 1 X 6 5 3 3 2 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 4\n2 3 X 6 5 3 4 5 1 1 4 3 2 4 3 4\n\n### Answer:\n[2 1 3 4]\n\n### Question:\n1 2 X 2 X 3 4 2 2 3 1 3 1 2\n\n### Answer:\n[44]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The desired program(or logic) must be written in the [ans] variable defined below.\n2.Be careful when using the original numbers in nums variable.

Do you want them as drawn matrices or as URL-encoded strings? – Patrick87 Jul 3 '16 at 0:11\n• @ retreated if yuo want 14*14 just change the width and height when you go from problem to solution. Hint: the answer isn't the square, but there may be hints in the correct coordinates, for example, recursive for larger numbers. – Daniel Mathias Jul 5 '16 at 8:13\n• @ Daniel Mathias Thanks a lot, it really helps! – retreated Jul 5 '16 at 21:39\n\n## 6 Answers\n\nI was able to produce a much simplified Helmholtz equation.

When $$\\epsilon\\gt1/2$$, the equations are elliptically hydrodynamically unstable.\n\nIf $$\\epsilon\\lt0$$, the solution has infinite height.\n\n• We've discussed some very similar topics in the Computer Science and Programming Questions chat room.

Are there parts of the rule that are easier to understand than others?\n\n1: No, the rules were pretty straightforward for me for splitting out the correct metadata from the puzzle itself. Added a few sanity checks and a way to calculate the counts before the submission. 2: No, the custom puzzle rules were simple to understand in all parts.\n\nPuzzle: 22354\nTags (Separate/Separate with spaces with a semicolon):\n\n1: According to rule stated in the 3rd section- the n column where the values belonging to the previous and columns present are 4 we need to check+=1 Either its immortal for the side to check or check+=1\n\n2: Not familiar of any other tag for custom puzzle\n\n\n### What operations do you propose adding to the interpreter (if any)? What new tags would they be tied to?\n\n1: Compared to other stars attribute parsing using set is faster than objects in terms of time in my calculations (Hard to tell the exact difference). The only it needs to check is each number if falling within respective stack like zone / corner with then incrementing the corresponding value in the set\n\n2: Im not sure what is the best operation performance wise that can replace this. It might be solved using an iterator comparing the value range since my algorithm currently runs linearly to the end of the matrix. Also, we can bind list along with the meta data while constructing in the python function\n\nOptions for operation types (2):\n(1) A more efficient hashing algorithm (?)\n\n2: Yes, there are multiple options to increase the efficiency based on the algorithm without impacting the rules / solution of the puzzle itself.\n\nThe algorithm Description :\nFor a n x n puzzle (puzzle should have equal columns and rows):\n1. Lines\nWe calculate the\nLine 1 :  Right 2 Left () 3 Bottom 4 Top () for each row.\nLine 2 :  Right () Left 2 Top 3 Bottom 4 for each column .\n\nFrom there by using recursion angle/side/boundary/corner records distance to respective lines and the zone which is the sum of all recorded distances surrounding each number (edge to inner edge triangle shape for custom 10x10 puzzles only).\n\nThese will become the hardcoded numbers that python script sees.\n\n2. Performance\nWe create the nodes in objects local queries with custom southwest, northeast and south queries that use O(1) capability while running factorial on number attribute provided and precalculated probabilities from lookup table\n\n3. Constructing the set\nWe transform each by changing the value zone and distance from the previous column in the range while traversing. It is noticing the numbers that may have created the range or will create new. This is what adds the value with number and count values.\n\n2.For example on my local report from the same version as the custom puzzle:\nOn the public Custom report hashing at line 26 with implementation of the status (instantiated?). Once it gets created any updates are saved only when trying\n2.(Flag 4) or did it not work (Flag 3) or has no areas (masked flag 1) to record the distance or final clash between status(success/failure) and no. of segments corresponding to the n is the final value as obtained in the use case.\nBut when it tries to return the core is a problem that it clashes between the value from pattern and implementing CPU bottlenecks that is highlly expensive to tweak for every n.\nFor example Even for Custom(hard) size 40x40 the values is 1865670 using both meta to be obtained on the cpu and casts successfully. By increasing the slice Cash(now I can just Create Data Cases for given 32x32 and 36x36) , I was able to reach the 2,627,756 and 3,173,217 using status.\n\nA reason for this could is it is creating \"-mask- with additional information on whether the custom puzzle given is solving flawlessly or contain loop.\n\nAlgorithm flowchart:\n(See attachment)\n",

There are a few steps to writing a custom rule:\n\n### Applicable rules\n\n• Must have the prefix \"custom-puzzle-\".\n• Won't have the prefix \"custom-\".\n\n### Elements of a custom rule\n\n1. First, you'll write a description of your custom rule. It must be in the JSON object called \"description\" in the rule file, for example:\n\"description\": \"Hello, how are you? This rule outputs numbers based on some of your input. For example for this custom puzzle, do this: 8, 2, 2, 8, 9 This will output 1, 1, 4, 8 for the example.\"\n2. Next are the input and outputs. Your rule gets a bunch of input based on the custom puzzle. I will use the first custom puzzles as an example where it was 8 2 2 8 9.\n3. What you'll want to replace with those inputs with your outputs. The final script is typically wrapped with your outputs, what your script needs to look like if you were running it with your first custom puzzle as input is this:\n\"code\": \"console.log('1,1,4,8')\"\n\n### Usage\n\nAdding a custom puzzle rule to your puzzle keeps it in game, but the PI (player input) part is hidden. By the time the AI picks your custom puzzle rule, that's the only part the AI will see. Then, what the AI sees is used as inputs.\nif you use the above text as your rule, you won't need the custom puzzle parent, example showing everything else, including the custom puzzle rule.",

When N = 4, we need 16 avalanches to fill all Xes with A(2 cases - 4 possible Xes).\n\nWhen N = 5, there are no avalanches (2 cases), or 16 avalanches are needed (2 cases).\n\nOur answer is 2*N + C0 + C1, where C0 and C1 are avalanches needed in case there and there’s not enough Xes to kill all nodes.\n\nSo we need 3 + 16 + 16 = 38 avalanches for N=5.",

Finally, we add the flow dual-flow estimates as solved within the convex-hull boundary.\nWhile we do not need the resulting $p(a,b)$ values at the end of the process, we do need the num_points or dimension 5, influencing 6, but also 16, directly.\nIn addition, we need the number of points traversed (effective number of points traversed=2-fold), and the area traversed.\n\n### Input Format:\n\nFirst line is the number $n$ for N samples that should be processed. Second line contains interlacing n integers, $dim 5=(x_1 y_1 .. x_n y_n)$ that define a rectangular square with edges at most 100 units long. The values on each line are x,y$a$ and a$,b$ values that determine $p$(a,b).\nNext 6 lines contain the form of primeval $p$(a,b), of form either 1,0 (absolute value of the variance of that position considered to be perfect noise), 0,0 (statistical centre at that point). We could start from that point directly, if we were to process that sample.\nBut our real input data contains more information.\nEach next 21 lines describe the $a'$(=8,9,..) line solvers. In the first line, we enter successive 23 int numbers that describe a linear equation (a,b) \\-- total of 2 to 12 points (that define y=-abx + semantic centre-p=/((a,b,c)=1.66+-0.05). Previous 23 points horizontally on the same line all (leaving the last point empty) define the partial-$p$.\nEach solver requires a centre offset, indicating (a-9,b)\nSo each of next 3 lines in this common format first contains interlacing 3 and then 3 pairs x,y that define the centre-offsets of semi-perimeter samples of the patch in consideration. Hereafter follow up to 23 points.\nWhen all 23 pairs are defined, the rest 21,35,$n-23*3=59$ samples actually contain the numerical values of $p$ in their integer format, for that solver. This is not the only possible format for $\\hat{p}$, it can also contain all values in cZF as seen in problem [Problem 20](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/map-generation/problem) indeed. 2-fold null samples are probably more appropriate for it. It is textually seen by colour changes.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nTwo scores are outputted, one is area traversed, one is the number of output points. These are numerically checked within the possible input 8-bit range.The effective number of output points can be analytical derived:\nEffective=2 * num-traversed * 1.1Give these 3 values a newline and additional space as output, after computing. Do not write numbers bigger than prec48 bit-precisions. Another output possibility is A,b,bc.\nNote: $p$(a,b) is the raw probability or a valid force estimator. Not $\\hat{p}$, maybe, that is computed as represented in problem [Problem 21](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/map-generation/problem). However, in that problem sample can be picked on the fly. There, they build a multiple of input values. That is faster than in this problem, but they are also more prone to limitations like 100 nodes per output line nodes. The fact is that the solution is verified for 1000 nodes.\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n2\n20 10 0 10 90\n50 500\n-2 -10\n2 10\n4 10 43 3\n2 3 90\n2 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 0\n1 0 0\n0 2 60 10\n2 10 1 0 50 100 1 5\n2\n21 20 1 5\n0 0 0 0 21 20 10\n40 10 1000 0 1000 0 0 200 10\n10 0 0 0 40 10 10 0 0 0 0 100 10\n0 0 0 0 10 0 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 100 0\n0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n0 #\"samples\"\n0 1 0\n0 2 0\n0 3\n0 4\n4 0 0\n0 0 1000\n0 100 0\n4 0 1000 0 10 0 0 100 0\n50\n45050 0\n0 0 #boundary upper-left\n0 0 1000\n1000 0 0 0\n50 100 0\n10 0 0 0 1000 0 100\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 #fill the field\n\n### Sample Output:\n\n2 50000\n8 2048\n\n\n\n### Sample input 2:\n\n1 0 100 0 0\n50\n0 10\n1 0\n1 100\n2 100\n1 1000\n1000 10000 2000\n1 #points\n\n### Sample Output 2:\n\n328.074280000000\n\n\n### Related Topics:\n\nString / Regular Expression\n\n## [Problem 23](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migrating-ducklings/problem)\n\n### Description:\nA magical universe far from earth contains a race of bug-like creatures called Newts.

Denote $d(p,q)$ the distance between points $p=(a_0,...,a_{n-1})$ and $q=(b_0,...,b_{n-1})$ in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nThen $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}d(A,f(A))d(h(A),^){Q-i}\\text{'s position.}:=T(A,f,g,h)\\geq 1.$ ( For $i=n$ it assumes its value defined when $h$",

Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.There are two words, \"Extra Fancy\" and \"Extra Because\" on the screen, and the letters that exhibit cross-over are italic blue characters.\n2.Each of the letters in the word is highlighted in blue and can only be in between the fancies and luxurys,forming a scramble. LCDR and ICPROC can only appear inside the luxuries.LG and CCT can only appear inside the fancies, and the PC and UR can only appear on the outside of the fancies.\n\n### Question:\n\nThe words are \"EXTRA\" and \"BECAUSE\", with the letter P in the letter (X). What is the answer?\nX\n\n### Answer:\nTAUPPA\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The player needs to arrange the letters into a word and place them in a specific grid box.\n2.The grid box at the top receives five words:[CARNET MANY SPINE LACE U - PARVIFORM TACTILE UNDERGROUND RFLASER MERIT GENUS WAY GROUP.] In alphabetical order, connect the letters of the five words in a grid box in that order, being sure to use the correct form and relative position of the word.\n3.An empty space is shown delta, with k rows and g columns on the grid. Write the first letter of each word in that grid box in that order, vertically decreasing from left to right row by row, increasing from top to bottom column by column and skipping letters across the grid.\n4.The player must form a word using the two consecutive letters represented by a box. The letter on the left side represents the first letter of the word,while the letter on the right side represents the second letter.\n5.Use any two consecutive letters provided in the box, as you exit the box, turn around. None of the jagged letters can overlap, and forming a word requires the two letters provided. For example, if a letter is represented by a \"... /...\" brute box, the word CORNER Green and orange is discarded, as the introduction will allow RED and a continuous line.\n6.The words on the grid can be passed through two consecutive words, corresponding to the highlighted characters.\n7.The column and row headers should be used by entering words.
