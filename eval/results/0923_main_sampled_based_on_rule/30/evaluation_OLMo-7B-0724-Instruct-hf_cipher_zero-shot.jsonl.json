To do this, we will use the 6x6 matrix provided, and we will use the same encryption operation as in the encryption rules.\n\nFor the first half, we have \"AXVXG\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 | 2 | V | (2,0) |\n| 0 | 1 | X | (0,1) |\n| 1 | 2 | A | (1,2) |\n| 1 | 0 | X | (1,0) |\n| 2 | 0 | X | (2,0) |\n| 2 | 2 | G | (2,2) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"AXVXG\" is (2,0)(0,1)(1,2)(1,0)(2,0)(2,2).\n\nTo get the characters after the \"G\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary.

The given ciphertext \"3B8D80958C3C353837873D86938C9784\" is decimated and converted to lowercase for further processing.\n2. Split blocks: Ciphertext is divided into four 8-byte blocks.\n3. Block encryption: Each block is XORed with the keyword (in this case a fixed byte array), followed by applying S-BOX substitution, permutation, and another XOR operation with the keyword.\n4. Hexadecimal encoding: Convert the encrypted blocks back to hex format.\n5. Concatenate: Combine the IV, ciphertext, and additional empty hex in the specified order.\n\nFor decryption, the initial steps involve splitting ciphertext into 32 characters (4 blocks of 8 characters). The main process starts with converting the hexadecimal hex characters to byte array, XORing with the keyword, doing an inverse permutation, applying inverse S-BOX substitution, XOR with keyword, and finally, back to ASCII text.\n\nThe responses need to be listed in double square brackets to keep the required format as per your question.",

As per the given encryption rules, we have to calculate the decimal value x for each character in the plaintext, by multiplying it with the ascii code of that character.\n3. For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11.
