Now, we symbolize p > r as !p | r using rule (10).\n\n5. After this transformation, our expression becomes !(!p | q) | (!p | r).\n\n6. Finally, we evaluate the equivalence of the two expressions. Applying equivalence rule (11), we require that !(!p | q) & (!p | r) is true if and only if !p | q is equivalent to !p | r.\n\nBy examining the individual parts:\n\n- !(!p | q) means \"it's not the case that p or q is true,\" which simplifies to p & !q.\n- (!p | r) means \"it's either not p or r is true.\"\n\nGiven that these parts are indeed equivalent (both can be true when p is false and q is false, and true when only r is true regardless of the truth of p and q), and without further specific information that contradicts this equivalence in general, we can preliminarily judge them as equivalent under this symbolic representation.\n\nHowever, since \"equivalent\" in a propositional logic context, unless specific truth values for p, q, and r are given, can be seen as true for all possible truth combinations, but we cannot assure this universality through symbolism alone.

        "response": " J. LetClauseShift Method\n\nThe reasoning described shifts the structure of the statement from a proposition about Lu Xun's real-world relationship to an incorrect inference about Xiao Qiang's knowledge. There is a misrepresentation as it wrongly assumes that because Xiao Qiang knows facts about Lu Xun, he must also know facts about other individuals related to Lu Xun. This erroneous adjustment of the logical relationship within the statement leads to an invalid inference, which falls under the LetClauseShift Method.\n\n[[J]]",
