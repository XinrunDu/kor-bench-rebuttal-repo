After 4 rotations, the grid will be filled with all 16 characters (plus filler characters if necessary), and we read it row by row.\n\nGiven plaintext (\"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"), let's perform the encryption.

Obtain the key by performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in the hash value '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.

Decrypt each byte by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding byte from the key. When the key sequence is exhausted, repeat it.\n\n4. Since the key is much longer than the ciphertext, we will only use the initial bytes of the key to match the length of the ciphertext. For the first byte of the ciphertext (0x27), take the corresponding byte from the key (0x73), and for the second byte of the ciphertext (0xad), take the next byte from the key (0xef).\n\n5. Decrypt the first byte:\n   - ciphertext byte: 0x27 (39 decimal)\n   - key byte: 0x73 (115 decimal)\n   - XOR result: 0x9c (156 decimal)\n\n6. Decrypt the second byte:\n   - ciphertext byte: 0xad (173 decimal)\n   - key byte: 0xef (239 decimal)\n   - XOR result: 0xd0 (208 decimal)\n\n7. The decrypted byte sequence is now 0x9c, 0xd0.\n\n8. Finally, convert the decrypted byte sequence back to its ASCII representation, which results in the string \"\\x9c\\xd0\". However, this does not directly map to printable characters, and in this cipher, the output is supposed to be uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces.\n\nGiven the specific notation and symbols in the rules, the decryption may did not produce a clear text result that matches the output format's expectations. Thus, we need to directly represent the decrypted byte sequence as per the allowed output format.\n\n**Answer:**\n```\n[[9c d0]]\n```",
