However, these literals are not present together in one pair of clauses C1 and C2.\n\nSince resolving requires a literal and its complement to be available in two clauses and C1 does not contain ¬r, and C2 does not contain r, we cannot resolve directly based on this rule.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a literal and its negation to resolve C1 and C2. In the definition given, resolution can be applied if there are simple disjunctive clauses of the form C1 = C3 ∨ L and C2 = C4 ∨ L’. In this context, it seems there’s confusion or an oversight. C1 and C2 do not directly contain a literal and its complement in the specified form for each other. But closely examining, we have:\n\nC1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r (implying L = ¬q in this context)\nC2 = ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t (implying L’ = q in this context, though q is not part of C2, it can be inferred that L’ = ¬¬q = q)\n\nHowever, due to the definition constraints, literal L from C1 must have a complement L’ in C2, which is not the case here since C2 does not contain q (complement of ¬q from C1).

Replace predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ(x, y) denoting x = y.\n\nThe provided formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, a), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing a with \\(a'\\) = 0, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing g with its implementation \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\), the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F((x * 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 gives 0 and because the implementation of predicate F(x, y) denotes \\(x = y\\), it becomes necessary to consider the semantics implied by these expressions. The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x — \\(F_J(0, x)\\) — only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x — this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]",
