On the planet of Tatooine, Qui-Gon and his apprentice met a young boy named Anakin Skywalker - also known as Ani. Through a series of tests, it was discovered that Ani possessed a greater midi-chlorian count than any Jedi before him.

Despite receiving Obi-Wan's approval for the endeavor, Anakin was opposed to having a Padawan at all. He stated that Ahsoka appeared too young and brash to be a Jedi in the making, and that the times were not right - after all, the galaxy was in the midst of war. However, having no say in the decision, Anakin begrudgingly agreed to train his assigned Padawan.\n\nWhat event occurred just prior to Ahsoka's acceptance as a Padawan?\n      \n      \nOptions: A.

But the emperor had private troops loyal to him alone. So, the secret brigade, combined of Jedi Knights, highly-trained Mandalorian warriors, and anonymous rebel forces, came together. Their military precision would be the perfect match for the emperor's squad.\n\nWas the brigade removed from a different planet, and how much credit should go to the particular part of the group responsible for this result? \n\nOptions: A. The Galactic Senate has 2 thirds of the effect# B. Rebel forces had 3 thirds of the impact# C. Jedi Knights has 2 thirds of the impact# D. The group was not brought from a separate planet\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n[[D]]\nThe text suggests that the brigade was not removed from a different planet, as it was a secret formation composed of various individuals and groups, such as Jedi Knights, Mandalorian warriors, and rebel forces. Therefore, the correct option is \"[D]\" - the group was not brought from a separate planet. While the impact of specific elements within the group could potentially be discussed, the passage does not provide enough details to accurately assess the individual effectiveness of each group.

Thus, you are expected to carefully analyze the details and rules in each scene and determine the most accurate response. Follow the prompts below to help you answer the questions with precision. You can choose an answer only in the corresponding options for each question. As you answer the questions in order, some of your answers might depend on the choices you make in previous questions, for example, your choice could eliminate the possibilities in other questions. That's why it's important to directly answer the question each time and leave out other questions not in hand. Once asked to compute a new paragraph or offering a new direction, you should go back to debate the next question. \n\n## Design of task\n\n### Set of scenes:\n\nIn a hockey game with many people watching, the skillful teams A and B are playing for the second time this night. In this sport, players in different positions need to work together to shoot the puck on the goal and beat the goalie to get a point. Here are some information about the figures who play the roles in this scene:\n\n1. Ryan: #10 as right winger, typically tries to set up the goaltender for a shot.\n2. Mark: #23 as winger, usually good at skating and driving down around the net to score the goal.\n3. Jake: #14 as center, commonly stands with feet shoulder-width apart, and often does most of the face-offs.\n4. Jordan: #80 as goaltender, generally leans into the puck and deflates himself.\n5. Anders: #57 as goaltender, often stands between the goalie’s legs while doing his job.\n\n### Set of transitions indicating temporal order of events:\n\n1. Anders turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring.\n2. Jordan stops pucks with his hands wrapped in up wrist guards.\n3. Ryan flashes his head and shoots a puck.\n4. Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot.\n5. Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal.\n6. Jake performs a backhand to prolong the game.\n7. Ryan kicks the puck to the other side of the court.\n8. Martin keeps multiple shots.\n9. Mark is sitting next to Jake.\n\n### Set of constraints indicating the semantic relations between pairs of events:\n\n1. (Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot, Jordan stops pucks with his hands wrapped in up wrist guards)\n2. (Mark is sitting next to Jake, (Ryan kicks the puck to the other side of the court)\n3. (Anders turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring, Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal)\n4. (Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Mark is sitting next to Jake)\n5. (Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Jake performs a backhand to prolong the game)\n6. (Ryan flashes his head and shoots a puck, Jordan puts his leg across to ward off a shot)\n\n### Three example questions with answers, illustrating the level of difficulty:\n\n#### Example question 1:\n\nWho is holding wrist guards near his leg? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan\nA: Jordan\n\n#### Example question 2:\n\nWho is close to the face when he shoots a puck towards the goal? (A) Mark##(B) Anders##(C) Jordan##(D) Jake\nA: Mark\n\n#### Example question 3:\n\nWho is standing in front of Anders and gets a shot? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan \nA: Jordan\n\n## Story worlds\n\nBased on the scene(s) and the temporal relations between events defined in the transitions, you should resolve the unknowns in the story (e.g., the unidentified figures). Take advantage of the constraints between events and the constraints on figures to resolve such unknowns. Based on the semantic links in the constraints, you should relate the figures and the events in the story. You should not double guess! Infer the unknowns from figures, events, and constraints.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Who is a hockey team A member? (A) Mark##(B) Jake##(C) Ryan##(D) Jordan\n2. Who is trying to score the goal when many people are around? (A) Ryan##(B) Mark##(C) Jake##(D) Jordan\n3. Who is standing in the face of Anders and gets a shot?

Who is a hockey team A member? \nWe can assume that Ryan, Mark, Jake, and Jordan could all be members of hockey team A because they are engaged in a game and are fulfilling different roles within the game setting.\n\n2. Who is trying to score the goal when many people are around? \nLooking at the given information, we can determine that Mark is the one attempting to score the goal by driving down around the net, as specified in the transition, \"Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal.\"\n\n3. Who is standing in the face of Anders and gets a shot? \nFrom the transition Andersen turns around and puts his leg in front to receive a ring, and following the constraint that says \"(Mark drives in the face for Jake to score the goal, Mark is sitting next to Jake),\" we can determine that Ryan is the one who gets a shot in front of Anders.",
