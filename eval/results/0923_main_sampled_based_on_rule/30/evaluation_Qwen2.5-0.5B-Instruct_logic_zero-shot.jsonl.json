        "response": "To figure out which category of speech act this sentence belongs to, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identifying Pattern**: The sentence \"I →✊ will complete the task tomorrow\" follows the required form for Commissives. It sounds like this follows the format *→ Gospel, where Gospel is a Commissive expressing commitment.\n\n2. **Commissives**: Commissives express the mental state or will of the speaker to do something in the future. In this case, the future action is \"to complete the task tomorrow,\" so it is a Commissive to complete the task.\n\n3. **Category A. Assertives**: Assertives commit a person's truth. The purpose of an Assertive is to state the truth of the expression. In this case, the speaker is almost saying \"I will complete the task,\" which is committing something to the truth. Therefore, Assertives fit this pattern.\n\n4. **Category B. Directives**: Directives consist of a change in reality through speech. This sentence is interchanging * with Gospel, indicating past or future necessity.\n\n5. **Category C. Commissives**: Commissives express the mental state of the speaker to do something, including commitments. The speaker is commanding to complete the task, which is a form of commitment.\n\n6. **Category D. Expressives**: Expressives express mental states or mental states, which includes expressing the mental state of the speaker. The speaker is telling someone to do something, which is an expression.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe sentence \"I → Gospel will complete the task tomorrow\" fits the category of Expressives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[D]].\n\nThis sentence embodies the渴慕 or desire to complete the task by expressing into the world with the verb \"will, \" reflecting the motivational or motivating nature of Expressives.",
