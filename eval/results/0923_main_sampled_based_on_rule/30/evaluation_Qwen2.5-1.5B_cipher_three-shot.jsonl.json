        "response": "[[C]\n\nIn the cipher described above, the alphabets are switch places at each step. For instance, when encrypting 'C' in 'G', 'C' will be dealt with under the 'G' at the first step and 'I' at the second step; but when decrypting 'G' in 'O' under the 'G' at the second step, 'G' will be decrypted under the 'O' at the first step.\n\nPlease confirm that these encryptions and decrypts comply with the specific cipher rules and provide any specific details that might be helpful for understanding the process better. Your assistance in ensuring these comply perfectly with the rules is highly appreciated.\n\nYes, I understand the cipher rules and techniques. These guidelines specify a specific Cipher with an additional set of cipher alphabets (`AB`, `CD`, etc.) derived from the original English alphabet (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`) and store both original and modified alphabets in a `Cipher Alphabets` data structure.\n\nThe two encryption and decryption processes described in the rules are equivalent and implemented by internal processes of the cryptographic standard library `IdentifierUtil`. However, the descriptions provided describe the PEP output, which can sometimes be verbose and not conform to library internal operations' standards.\n\nIn steps of encryption, the first `[(A B) C D]` forward conversion happens because the first letter `A` in the plaintext (`G`) is replaced by `B` and then the second letter `B` is replaced by `C`. The `[(C D) E F]` forward conversion happens because the first letter `F` is replaced by `C` and the second letter `E` is replaced by `D`.\n\nIn steps of decryption, the last `[(A B) C D]` backward conversion happens because the final letter `D` is decrypted back to `C` (pre-Ciphertext `G`). The `[(F G) H I]` backward conversion happens because the second to last letter `H` is decrypted back to `G` with the last to be decrypted being `I` and earlier being removed and the last (already decrypted last) being applied first, thus, flipping the order of decryption and encryption (C→G).\n\nFor the cipher's use-case of always using the adult chat, there probably exist preferred key combinations for different purposes. For instance, often useful might be the `AB`, `CD` and `EF` sets of two-letter alphabets for convenience.\n\nAlso, this cipher potentially makes some assumption of character cipher to be converted to that being be additive with itself up to 127:\n\n\n    (A B) + (B C) = (A C)\n    (A C) + (B D) = (A D)\n    AB + BB = (A B) + (B B) = (A B)\n\nHowever, as the coding covers the addition of two integers modulo 26 (`Shift(6+A) = Shift(A) % 26`), this can be validly applied, assuming it does not transform from repeated multiplication into acceleration for multiplicative (expansion) cipher. \n\nFor the cipher usage, if a message `S` ends as `XY`, where `X`, `Y` are two letters within the cipher, then half the mass of encrypted characters (`XY` hashes down to like `X` or `Y`). When applied directly, plain letter `X` can bring the overall length of string `X` found within the cipher and compared vice-versa `Y` to full (lengthen or shorten) the original string `XY`.\n\nIf there's a specific purpose, we can determine a better set of key, excluding the mathematical use (which is correct and inherently cryptographically meaningful). Given the formal conditions, `AB`, `CD`, etc become non-inclusive criteria for proper isolation and may not force a given length of the intercepted string. \n\n\nFor any usage, this simple cipher can be understood contextually. In the typical chatroom packets with `sendMsg` and `receiveMsg` messages/tests, it's possible to build custom hash values that duplicate first and second messages and respond to `receiveMsg` messages applying the cipher (see [`IdentifierUtil`](https://github.com/asciimoo/IdentifierUtil)). \n\n\nAs for `[(A B) C D][(C D) E F][(F G) H I][(A B) C D]` used as two stages for decryption, each having its own loss, debt, spaces, or region in chatroom chat conversations, a better understanding of the specific requirements and use-case of the cipher could be instrumental in selecting effective key. For example, a specific group might've an outgoing-grid of *OB, CD, ED* and an incoming-grid with the same set intended to decompose incoming packet into message & message alias communication link `BOZ` addressing `old-message` and `ciphertext` with *MILDING* thus assuming reciprocality without a shared key; a decryption loop being in passing existence for other used states (on a different grid) as required.\n\nSorry, due to the complexity and utility of this matter, a more readable and concise representation, and with standard cipher terms in point, would be appreciated.

It works by first putting all the elements in a binary min heap, and then repeatedly extracting the minimum element and placing it at the end of the sorted array. \n\nThe basis of Heap sort is a complete binary tree with a specific bottom-up structure that ensures the min heap property is maintained throughout the sorting process. Understanding the structure and the process of building a min heap is key to understanding how Heap sort works.\n\nBuilding a Min Heap:\n\nTo build a min heap, we repeatedly split the non-leaf nodes in half until we have a complete binary tree where every level has a 2-length sub-tree, except possibly the last row which contains only 1.\n\nHere are the main steps involved in building a Min Heap:\n1. Start at the last parent node, which is the second-last level of the tree.\n2. Compare the parent node to its children and move the larger of the two children up, ensuring the min heap property is maintained.\n3. Repeat this process for each parent node until the root of the tree becomes the minimum node.\n4. Once all parent nodes have been processed, the tree is now a min heap.\n\nOnce the tree is a complete binary tree, the additional stability property of Heap sort is achieved. Even though the tree is in a random order, rearranging the elements by repeatedly moving down the min heap ensures that the smallest element is always found at the root (minimum element).\n\nHeap Sort Algorithm\nHeap Sort is typically implemented with two stable algorithms: Heapify and Heapsort. Both algorithms achieve O(n log n) run-time complexity but differ in the way they operate.\n\n**Heapsort**\n1. Build a min heap from the given array, in-place.\n2. Remove the root (minimum) element (it is initially the minimum of the array), place it at the end of the array, and ensure the min heap property is maintained for the remaining elements. This step is called \"sifting down\".\n3. Repeat the above two steps until the smallest element is in the correct position.\n\nThe time complexity of Heap Sort is O(n log n), with the worst-case and best-case being O(n log n) respectively. The efficient use of comparison and heap data structure, coupled with the above-mentioned operations, makes Heap Sort commonly an appealing choice of sorting algorithm, especially for situations where performance is a concern.",
