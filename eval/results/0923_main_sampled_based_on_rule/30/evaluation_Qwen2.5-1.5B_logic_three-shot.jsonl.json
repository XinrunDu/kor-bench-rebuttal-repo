Start with [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)].\n2. Using Q over any formula, connect sets. So we get [p(x)\\land(4-x\\neq3)(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)(p(x)\\land 4-x\\neq3)].\n3. Since [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)] is symmetric, apply T to get [Q p(x)\\land(p(x)\\land 4-x=3)].\n4. Applying equivalent forms of A, get Q [p(x)\\land 4-x=3].\n5. Expanding assign [Q (\\neg(\\neg 2-x = 3)(2-x\\neq3))].\n6. Combine A, get Q p(x).\n7. Applying T and Q over or, so we get [Q p(x)\\land p(x)].\n\nThus, the final answer can be written as Q p(x) Q p(x).\n\n### Question:\nGiven:\np(x): All furry animals are mammals.\nq(x): x enjoys being petted by humans.\nr(x): x is a cat\n\nFind the truth values for the following formula:\n\\left.{\\begin{matrix}p(r(x)) \\\\ q(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\land(-q(x))+\\left.{\\begin{matrix}r(x)\\end{matrix}}\\right\\vert\\vdots-\n\nPlease list your solutions.\nFormat should be [[T or F]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[T], [F]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is equal to 2\"\np2: \"2 is prime\"\np3: \"All even numbers larger than 2 are prime\"\np4: \"4, 6, 8, and 10 are all even numbers\"\n\nSymbolize:\n- p1 Q [p2 (p3 P Q p4)] \nReason: Given that p1 is true, we can conclude p2,3,4 must be true as each statement describes a condition that must hold for all values of x to keep p1 as true.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=(2②⑩2)],[x|x|p1=2],[x|x|p1=(2⑦⑦12)]].\n\n### Question:\nGiven the following propositions and connectives:\np1: \"x is an even number.\"\np2: \"x is an odd number.\"\np3: \"x is a positive integer.\"\np4: \"x ≤ u is true.\"\n\nDetermine:\n\na.

What is the red color of the center circle if the area of the red square is six times as large as the area of the smallest circle?\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the dimensions**: Let’s say each smaller square has side length \\(x\\). Then, the area of each smaller square is \\(x^2\\).\n2. **Area relationships**: Since three of the smaller squares are blue and their combined area is equal to the area of one red square, we have:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 = \\text{Area of the red square}\n   \\]\n3. **Given condition**: The area of the red square is six times the area of the smallest circle. Let’s denote the area of the smallest circle as \\(A_{\\text{smallest}}\\).\n   \\[\n   3x^2 = 6A_{\\text{smallest}}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, solving for \\(A_{\\text{smallest}}\\):\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{smallest}} = \\frac{3x^2}{6} = \\frac{x^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\nNext, let’s think about the geometry:\n\n4. **Centroid consideration**: In any regular quadrilateral (which includes squares and rectangles), the center coordinates \\((x\\_c, y\\_c)\\) satisfy:\n   \\[\n   x\\_c = -\\frac{q}{2}, \\quad y\\_c = \\frac{r}{2}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(q, r > 0\\) are the dimensions of the rectangular quadrilateral obtained by extending one side adjacent to the smallest square.\n\n5. **Coordination transformation**: Changing to the resolution method \n\nLet’s translate this back into English:\n\nThe center circle must be located such that:\n   - The outer boundaries of the three blue squares align perfectly with the horizontal and vertical middle lines of the overall configuration.\n   \nWe see here \"Red circle\":\n   - Centered precisely below where one diagonal of a small square intersects the diagonal of its neighbour squares further down:\n   \n   When these conditions meet, the calculation reveals:\n   \n   \\[\n   x\\_c = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot q}{2}, \\quad y\\_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot p\n   \\]\n\nFinally, here applying direct math relations:\n   \\[\n   x\\_c = \\pm (\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} -\\frac{q}{2})\n   \\]",

Without proof, knowledge becomes unknowing, misleading, or unreliable. Proof logically clarifies understanding, enhances understanding capability, reduces the probability of error, and allows for the replication of experiences rather than relying on a single person's interpretation. It helps avoid skepticism by providing a clear and unambiguous basis for judgments. Therefore, proof is essential in the acquisition of knowledge.",

The P-Generalization Rule states that if `k` people in a sample have attribute A, we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the population has attribute A.\n   Symbolization: If P(A, k, n), then Pr(A) ≈ k/n.\n\n3. The C-Reasoning Rule suggests that if two samples exhibit similar attribute proportions, these two samples may come from populations with similar attribute proportions.\n   Symbolization: If C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2), then Pr(A, P1) ≈ Pr(A, P2).\n\n### Question:\nIf the U-Generalization Rule is applied to the given problem, with a sample of 15 people out of which all had completed their annual training, what is the estimated proportion of a company of 200 employees that would have completed their annual training?\n\n### Answers:\n\n1. According to the U-Generalization Rule, if all 15 people had completed their annual training in a sample, then if we assume that the entire population of companies also follows the same pattern, we can estimate that all 200 employees may complete their annual training, denoted as P(A, 200).\n2.

Then, according to the calculations made in the previous problem, the actual percentage of people in the second group who deviate in a day's eat can be determined.\n\nAssuming: \n   - First group's percentage: x\n   - Second group's percentage: \\sqrt{3} times of first group's percentage + 28, which is \\sqrt{3} * x + 28\n\nActual percentage of second group who deviate in a day's eat = percentage of third group - (percentage of second group - percentage of first group)\n\n### Question:\nFor the given problem, determine the actual percentage of people in the third group who deviate the same duration as people in the second group.\n   \n### Answer:\nUsing the information in the first problem, we know the percentage deviations for the second group. The actual percentage of third group, where the percentage deviations are \\sqrt{3} times that of second group and 28 less, can be found using the rule given.\n\nActual percentage of third group who deviate = percentage deviated in second group - (deviation of third group - the third group's deviation)\n\n### Question:\nIn the third group's findings contradict the second group's findings, if there is a discrepancy of 120 people between the two groups' findings, how many treatments for arthritis are present in the matrix M?\n\n### Answer:\nGiven in the problem, number of treatments for arthritis can be calculated following the problems listed.

Find the result.\n\n### Answer:\nFactorial of n is computed iteratively. The program drives from 1 to n by computing the product of all integers in that range. Subtracting 13 does not affect the down computation.\n\n### Question:\nUsing Python, write a piece of code to calculate the factorial of 64 and then to subtract 13 to determine the result, without altering the down computation.\n\nNote that handling factors of 2 in subtraction or computing factorial's values in Python can lead to stack overflow, so the examples rely on using appropriate functions or direct calculations.\n\n### Example Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\nfinal_result = factorial(64) - 13\nprint(\"The result is:\", final_result)\n```\n\n```output\nThe result is: 5340781430929978991246897114607064891339532",
