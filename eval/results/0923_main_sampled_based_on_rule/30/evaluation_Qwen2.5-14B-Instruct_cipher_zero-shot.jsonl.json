For each binary group:\n   - For (K, N):\n     - K is at (1, 0) in Grid 1, so l1_row = 1, l1_col = 0.\n     - N is at (2, 8) in Grid 2, so l2_row = 2, l2_col = 8.\n     - In Grid 3, the row 1 column 8 gives the number 9.\n     - Therefore, the triple (l1_col, num3, l2_row) is (0, 9, 2).\n   - For (#, #):\n     - The character `#` does not exist in Grid 1 and Grid 2, and is used as padding. We treat both as positions that do not contribute effective mapping, so the triple can be treated as (0, 0, 0).\n6. Combine all the triples:\n   - (0, 9, 2) for (K, N)\n   - (0, 0, 0) for (#, #)\n   - (0, 0, 0) for (#, #)\n\nThe final encrypted message, combining all triples into a numeric string, is:\n\n[[092000000]]\n\nPlease note that the output format strictly adheres to the described encryption rule and the padding introduced to align with the rule's requirement for processing.",
