The duration of sleep depends on the target and the effect is broken when it is attacked.\" \n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the main purpose of reading Sleepytime Stories is to cause creatures (or Mobs) within a 30m radius to fall asleep, which can be helpful in various scenarios. However, in the context of the question which is seeking the usual purpose for people (implying the reader character perspective) the closest matches are not directly listed as purpose for the reader but rather an effect on something else. \n\nFrom the options provided, the best match can be inferred as it would indirectly help the reader in promoting sleep or tranquility by putting threats to sleep. But directly according to what the question asks (purpose for readers), \"helping relax the mind and promote sleep of readers\" isn't the direct result from the rule given.\n\nBut since the best fitting according to the context of all is making things around calm and sleep, the most reasonable answer among the options given is:\n[[C]]",
