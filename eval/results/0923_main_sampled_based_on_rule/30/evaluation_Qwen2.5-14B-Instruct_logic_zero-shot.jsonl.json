If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4.

The inference \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be symbolized as $!q → !p, but more closely aligns with being a direct transformation of the necessity to a specific form of impossibility, which directly corresponds to formula (5) #p → !#!p once we correctly map the logical flow and understand that the negation and modal transformations align with turning necessity into a form that denies the possibility of the negation directly resulting. However, according to the specific inference asked from the given statement to the conclusion, the exact formula being matched directly in the modal logic inference formulas provided is #p → $p, which is formula (9). The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked.",

Therefore, Not (Not p) (Since the assumption of \"not p\" leads to a contradiction (Not q when we assumed If Not p, then q), we conclude that the assumption \"not p\" cannot be true.)\n6.
