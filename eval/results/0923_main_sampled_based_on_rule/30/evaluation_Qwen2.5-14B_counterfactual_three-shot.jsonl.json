First, look for specific colours like “tan” or “brindle”. You may notice a certain pattern that the coat follows, like a tiger stripe or puppies with black spots.  You can then match the hair to standard breed charts online. The coat of the terrier family and various Dalmatian breeds often have circular spots.  Some Hungarian vizslas and starving African spitz dogs are often golden yellow.  Golden retrievers are easily identified by their warm, smokey brown hue. Note if the dog has a pretty cloudy coloured coat and an ordinary face. By looking at the shape of the dogs features (like the snout, ears, and eyes) you are able to tell what breed the dog may be. As an example, many spaniels often have sad, droopy eyes.  Some breeds, including the Australian sheperd and the whippet both have grey and black patches in their coat.  Others show signs of their mixed blood, like the West Highland Terrier and other generic mixed breeds. Examine the thickness and quality of the dog’s hair.

Let's try:\n\n### Question:\nMenci from the Taoist school was a famous Taoist practitioner who imparted his Taoist practices to Zuiming. One day, when Zuoming was on his way to deliver a condolence basket to a family, he suddenly found himself in a dangerous situation. He quickly recalled what Menci had taught him. Bei Bu explained to Menci that the \"Expiration of the Yang, Activation of the Yin\" is a breathing method, which requires the practitioner to recite words arranged in a specific order without missing or increasing the number of times each word is recited. For example:\n• Calm (yang) - Exhale, releasing any negative energy or emotion and commencing the \"Activation of the Yin\" process, simultaneously activating the Yin strategy.\nA. Fall: (yin) - Gasp, exemplifying shock or disappointment.\nB. Invisible: (yin) - gasp, implying a sense of the invisible or hidden.\nC. Far: (yang) - Exhale, symbolizing the retreat of the yang strategy to a safe distance.\nD. Knot (yin) - Gasp, suggesting the unraveling of complicated or entangled situations.\nE. Exotic (yin) - Exhale, denoting deflection or deviation.\nBased on the Master's guidance, when facing the \"Calming of the Yang, Activating the Yin\" method, Bei Bu ordered Zuoming to follow the breathing rules stipulated by the Taoist School and primed the technique, along with a strategy known as the \"Hiding Detailed Art.\" Zuoming promptly recounted the technique to Bei Bu, who then uncovered the truth about Lao Lang's whereabouts. Bei Bu promptly mobilized troops to retrieve Lao Lang, lived a fulfilling life, and achieved a thousand-year-old time cycle. As Bei Shi suggested, the \"Hiding Detailed Art\" of the Taoist School incorporates elements of \"blink,\" \"swish,\" and \"blurry.\" Among these, \"blurry\" is a fluctuating move and must be executed before the enemy while they are observing it. Otherwise, it would be ineffective. Bei Bu quickly responded to Zuoming's movements regarding the \"blurring\" with his marvelous physique. Return to the problem, when facing a perilous situation, Zuoming executed the Taoist breathing method \"Calming of the Yang, Activating the Yin.\" According to the instructions, which sequence should he have followed to correctly recite the words in order during exhalations and inhalations?\nOptions:\nA.
