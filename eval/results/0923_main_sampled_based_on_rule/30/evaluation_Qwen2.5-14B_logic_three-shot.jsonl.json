Here's a summary and some additional explanations for clarity:\n\n### Question 1:\n**\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis answer correctly represents the given proposition using the `=` operator to denote \"if and only if\" and the `~` operator to denote \"not\". Thus, `p1` is true if and only if `p2` is false.\n\n### Question 2:\n**Determine the level, type of \\( p1 \\).**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[A];[C]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Level:** \\( p1 \\) is a Level A formula because it is a single proposition without any logical connectives or nested structures.\n- **Type:** \\( p1 \\) is neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula, as its truth value depends on the assignment of \\( p1 \\). Therefore, it is a C (neither).\n\n### Question 3:\n**Determining the truth value of the formula \\( p1 =::> ~p2 \\).**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Truth Values:** The formula \\( p1 =::> ~p2 \\) is true in four cases: when \\( p1 \\) is false (✓|x) or \\( p2 \\) is true (x|x,x|✓).\n- **False Values:** The formula is false in only one case: when \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p2 \\) is true (✓|✓).\n\n### Question 4:\n**Symbolizing the propositions:**\n\n1. **Blue and yellow are both common colors.**\n2. **Either \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) or 5 is irrational.**\n3. **Exactly one of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and 5 is irrational.**\n\n**Answer:**\n[[p1&p2];[p3||p4];[(p3||p4)&&~(p3&p4)]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Proposition 1:** Uses `&` to denote \"and\" between \\( p1 \\) and \\( p2 \\).\n- **Proposition 2:** Uses `||` to denote \"or\" between \\( p3 \\) and \\( p4 \\).\n- **Proposition 3:** Uses `&&` and `~` to denote \"exactly one\" by combining `||` and `~` operators.\n\n### Question 5:\n**Determine the level, type, and truth value of the formula under the given assignment:**\n\nFormula: \\((p1||~p2)&(p2=::>p3)\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n[[A];[A];[False]]\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Level:** This formula is a Level B formula because it contains one logical connective (`&`) and the connected two propositions (`p1||~p2` and `p2=::>p3`) are both formulas of lower-levels (Level A).\n- **Type:** It is a truth formula.\n- **Truth Value:** Under the assignment \\(\\{p1→T, p2→T, p3→F\\}\\), the formula evaluates to false because `\\((T || ~T) & (T =::> F)\\)` results in `\\((T) & (F)\\)`, which is false.",

The complements of the literals in \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are:\n- Complement of \\( \\neg p \\) is \\( p \\), but this does not appear in \\( C_2 \\).\n- Complement of \\( \\neg q \\) is \\( q \\), which appears in \\( C_2 \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\) are complements, they can be resolved. Therefore, the answer is:\n**[[A]]**\n\n### Question 2:\nGiven \\( C_1 = p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r \\) and \\( C_2 = \\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r \\), what is \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) \\)?\n\nWe look for any pair of complementary literals between \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\):\n- \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\)\n- \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\)\n- \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\)\n\nSince \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\) are complements, we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nIf we resolve on \\( p \\) and \\( \\neg p \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\\[ = (\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nSimilarly, if we resolve on \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( q \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee r \\vee \\neg p \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nAnd if we resolve on \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg p \\vee q) \\]\n\nSo the possible resolutions are:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\neg q \\vee r \\vee q \\vee \\neg r];[p \\vee r \\vee \\neg p \\vee \\neg r];[p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg p \\vee q]} \\]\n\n### Question 3:\nFor \\( :p \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge q \\), what is the output of the resolution algorithm, and how many cycles will it iterate?\n\nThis expression is in conjunctive normal form. We start by identifying the simple disjunctive clauses:\n- \\( C_1 = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\)\n- \\( C_2 = q \\)\n- \\( C_3 = p \\)\n\nWe initialize \\( S_1 \\) with these clauses and try to resolve them:\n- Resolving \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q, q) = \\neg p \\vee \\neg r \\vee q \\vee \\neg q = \\neg p \\vee \\neg r \\)\n- Resolving \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_3 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_3) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q, p) = \\text{dispel}(\\neg p \\vee p) = \\neg q \\)\n- Resolving \\( C_2 \\) and \\( C_3 \\): \\( \\text{dispel}(C_2, C_3) = \\text{dispel}(q, p) = q \\vee p \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg q \\vee q = 1 \\), this indicates that the formula is unsatisfiable, so the output is \"Implausible\".\n\nIt takes one cycle to see that the clauses can be resolved to an empty set, indicating no solution. Thus, the number of cycles is 1.\n\n### Question 4:\nIf \\( C_1 = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r \\) and \\( C_2 = \\neg q \\vee \\neg r \\vee s \\vee \\neg t \\), what is \\( \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) \\)?\n\nWe need to find complementary literals between \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\):\n- \\( \\neg p \\) has no complement in \\( C_2 \\).\n- \\( \\neg q \\) and \\( \\neg q \\) are the same, not different.\n- \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\) are complements.\n\nResolving on \\( r \\) and \\( \\neg r \\), we get:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{dispel}(C_1, C_2) = \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t \\]\n\nSo the final result is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee s \\vee \\neg t]} \\]",

Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Rewrite the given equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the identity for \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\):**\n   Recall that \\( \\tan \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta} \\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1 + \\cos \\theta}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert from polar to Cartesian coordinates:**\n   We know that \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\) and \\( \\cos \\theta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\), \\( \\sin \\theta = \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \\). However, to simplify our approach, let us express everything directly in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y/(r)}{x/(r) + 1}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   r = 1 + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + r}\\right)^2 r\n   \\]\n   Since \\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\left(\\frac{y}{x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\\right)^2 \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Further simplification:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = r + \\frac{y^2}{(x + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2}\n   \\]\n\nThis transformation is quite complex to analyze further without numerical methods or graphing tools. However, based on the structure of the original polar equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), we recognize that this equation represents a type of conic section because it's similar to the polar equations of parabolas, hyperbolas, and other conics.\n\nGiven the form \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), it suggests that this is a variation of a hyperbolic shape due to the presence of \\( \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\), which implies exponential growth as \\( \\theta \\) varies. This matches the characteristics of a standard hyperbola in polar form, where the distance from the pole to the curve increases exponentially with changes in angle.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe curve defined by the equation \\( r = 1 + \\tan^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\) is a **hyperbola**. This conclusion comes from recognizing the typical behaviors and forms of such equations in polar coordinates, specifically their relationship to conic sections like hyperbolas.\n\nPolar Coordinates proof, why $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? I'm doing a problem below, but am having difficulty understanding this passage. From the geometry, why does it describe the second picture? Why does $R^2=r_1^2+r_2^2$? \n\nProve that an ellipse and a hyperbola with the same foci must intersect at\nright angles.\n\nWe work in polar coordinates $(R, \\theta)$, with $O$ as the pole\nand the positive $x$-axis as the initial line, and by choosing a unit\nlength such that the foci are at equal distances from the origin.\n(Thus, the foci lie on the line $\\theta=\\pi$.) If $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the\neccentricities of the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively, then their\npolar equations have the form:\n     $$  r_1=e_1R(1- \\cos \\theta) \\ and \\ r_2=e_2R(1 + \\cos \\theta)$$\n     where $r_1, r_2$ are the distances of the corresponding points $P,\n     P'$ on the conics. Now the perpendicular distance from the center of\n     the hyperbola (which is the origin) to the tangent at $P'$ is given by\n     $r_2 \\sin \\theta$, and the perpendicular distance to the tangents at\n     $P$ by $r_1 \\sin θ$. But the radii $OP$ and $OP'$ make equal angles of\n     $\\theta/2$ with $OP$, and thus the sum of the squares of the\n     perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to $OP^2+OP_2'=R^2$,\n     i.e.,\n$$(e_1R(1 - \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta+(e_2R(\n1 + \\cos \\theta))^2 \\sin^2 \\theta=R^2$$\nholds if and only if $e_1e_2 = 1$.\n\nTo understand why \\( R^2 = r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\) from the given geometry, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Setup and Definitions:**\n   - Let \\( O \\) be the origin.\n   - Let \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\) be the foci of the conics.\n   - The distance between the foci is \\( 2c \\).\n   - Let \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) be points on the ellipse and hyperbola, respectively.\n   - The distances from the origin to \\( P \\) and \\( P' \\) are \\( R \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P \\) to the foci are \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_1' \\).\n   - The distances from \\( P' \\) to the foci are \\( r_2 \\) and \\( r_2' \\).\n\n2. **Polar Equations:**\n   - For the ellipse: \\( r_1 = e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\).\n   - For the hyperbola: \\( r_2 = e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\).\n\n3. **Tangents and Perpendicular Distances:**\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P' \\) is \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The perpendicular distance from the origin to the tangent at \\( P \\) is \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\).\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - The radii \\( OP \\) and \\( OP' \\) make equal angles of \\( \\theta/2 \\) with the line \\( OP \\).\n   - The sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances to the tangents is equal to \\( OP^2 + OP_2' = R^2 \\).\n\n5. **Derivation:**\n   - The perpendicular distances are \\( r_1 \\sin \\theta \\) and \\( r_2 \\sin \\theta \\).\n   - The sum of their squares is:\n     \\[\n     (r_1 \\sin \\theta)^2 + (r_2 \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the expressions for \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2 + (e_2 R (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta)^2\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     (e_1 R)^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + (e_2 R)^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^2 \\sin^2 \\theta\n     \\]\n   - Factoring out \\( R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     R^2 \\sin^2 \\theta \\left[ e_1^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta)^2 + e_2^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta)^",

To find a common characteristic or theme, we can consider the following:\n\n1. **Action Direction**: Both terms involve a specific directional movement. \"Auger\" often refers to a drilling action that turns in a continuous clockwise or counterclockwise direction, while \"inhale\" is the action of drawing air into the lungs, which can be seen as a form of intake but in a different context.\n\n2. **Process Involvement**: Both actions are part of a process. In the case of an auger, it is part of the process of drilling or excavating. For inhale, it is part of the process of breathing, which sustains life in living organisms.\n\n3. **Functionality in Systems**: Augers are used in various systems for digging or mixing materials, while inhaling is a function of biological systems, primarily involved in respiration. Both actions serve essential functions within their respective systems.\n\n4. **Energy Transformation**: Both actions can be seen as involving energy transformation. The physical action of the auger requires energy input to rotate, whereas inhaling involves the mechanical action of lung expansion and contraction, drawing in air.\n\n5. **Pattern of Movement**: Both actions follow a repetitive pattern. The rotation of an auger is continuous until stopped, and inhaling is part of a cyclical breathing pattern.\n\nCommonality: **Directional Action and Process Involvement**\n\nIn summary, both auger and inhale share commonality in their directional actions and involvement in processes within their respective systems.",

However, since this symbol is not listed among the provided options, none of them fit the context directly. If we were to choose one from the given options, it would be more fitting to choose `B` (→) which indicates a conditional relationship, but it's not the best fit as `c1` is not merely a condition but a necessary prerequisite for `c2`.

Therefore, the statement \"I -> ✤(go away) by leaving the room\" implies a directive speech act.\n\nHowever, given the verb \"TITLE\", which is not listed as a verb for any other speech act, it's unclear which category it belongs to. But in the absence of specific rules for \"TITLE\" or a more accurate translation of \"TITLE\" in the context provided, the most appropriate classification seems to be directed, as \"TITLE\" could be understood as a command or request in certain contexts.\n\n### Question:\n\"I → ✤(arrange) our meeting for next Tuesday.\"\n\nWhich category of speech act does this sentence belong to, Assuming you have a list of verbs only for \"Directives\" and \"Expressives\"?\n\nA.

However, since \"TITLE\" is not listed as a directive verb, the most fitting category would be Expressives, conveying an expressive state or feeling. But based on the typical interpretation of \"arrange\" in English as a directive rather than an expressive verb, \"Directives\" is likely the intended category.",
