Now, \"KN####\" is grouped into \"KN##\" (though the group length is 6, here, we only list it as 4 due to padding for the sake of simplicity since the group is filled to the required length).\n4. Split the group into binary groups: (K, N), (#, #), (#, #).\n5. For each binary group, determine the row and column positions in the provided grids and use those to find the corresponding numbers in Grid3 to form the ternary.\n\nLet's start with step 5 and execute it for the binary groups of \"KN####\":\n- For (K, N) in Grid1 and Grid2:\n    - In Grid1, K = (0, 9)\n    - In Grid2, N = (8, 0)\n    - Combine row from Grid1 (0) and column from Grid2 (0), to get the number 1 from Grid3.\n    - Ternary = (9, 1, 8)\n- For (#, #) in Grid1 and Grid2:\n    - In Grid1, # = (0, 9)\n    - In Grid2, # = (8, 2)\n    - Combine row from Grid1 (0) and column from Grid2 (2), to get the number 3 from Grid3.\n    - Ternary = (9, 3, 8)\n- For another (#, #), it will follow the same steps as above.\n  \nAfter applying these steps, the ternary results will form the encrypted string: 918938938.\n\nTherefore, the encryption of \"KN\" (after padding to \"KN####\") produces [[918938938]].",

Since the plaintext is \"BK\", it is already in uppercase letters and contains no spaces or punctuation.\n2. We need to pad this plaintext to a length that's a multiple of 6 characters. Thus, \"BK\" becomes \"BK#####\" (a total of 7 characters).\n3. Now, we split the padded plaintext into groups of 6. There is one group here: \"BK####\".\n4. Each group of 6 is then divided into binary groups: (B,K), (#,#), (#,#).\n5. For each binary group, we determine the row and column coordinates from Grid 1 (`l1_row`, `l1_col`) and Grid 2 (`l2_row`, `l2_col`) and convert them into a ternary as described:\n\n    - For (B,K):\n        - B is in Grid 1 at position (0, 2). So, `l1_row` = 0, `l1_col` = 2.\n        - K is in Grid 2 at position (4, 2). So, `l2_row` = 4, `l2_col` = 2.\n        - From Grid 3, with `l1_row` = 0 and `l2_col` = 2, `num3` = 3.\n        - The resulting ternary is (2, 3, 4).\n    - For each of the `(#,#)` pairs, the process is similar:\n\n        - `#` in Grid 1 is at (2, 9). So, `l1_row` = 2, `l1_col` = 9.\n        - `#` in Grid 2 is also at (8, 2). So, `l2_row` = 8, `l2_col` = 2.\n        - From Grid 3, `num3` is 9 (since 2,9 results in column 0 in Grid 3 and row 3 for `l2_row` = 8).\n        - The two resulting ternaries for both pairs are (9, 9, 8).\n    - Combining all ternaries: (2, 3, 4) (9, 9, 8) (9, 9, 8).\n6. The numerical string is formed by reading the ternaries in order: 234998998.\n\nThus, the encrypted message for \"BK\" - padded to \"BK#####\" - is:\n\n[[234998998]]",
