Using De Morgan's law (rule 6), \\(!(!p | q)\\) becomes \\(!(!p) & !q\\).\n2. Since \\(!(!p) ::=:: p\\) by rule (1), we get \\(p & !q\\).\n3. Therefore, \\((p > q) > r\\) becomes \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\nNext, let's convert \\(p > (q > r)\\):\n\n1. \\(q > r\\) can be rewritten as \\(!q | r\\) using rule (10).\n2. \\(p > (q > r)\\) can be rewritten as \\(p > (!q | r)\\) using the same rule.\n3.

However, let's compare them directly:\n\n- \\((p & !q) | r\\) is true if either \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false, or \\(r\\) is true.\n- \\(!p | (!q | r)\\) is true if \\(p\\) is false, or \\(q\\) is false, or \\(r\\) is true.\n\nThese two expressions are not the same in all cases. For example:\n- If \\(p\\) is true, \\(q\\) is true, and \\(r\\) is false, then:\n  - \\((p & !q) | r\\) is false because \\(p & !q\\) is false and \\(r\\) is false.\n  - \\(!p | (!q | r)\\) is true because \\(!q\\) is false, but \\(r\\) is false, and \\(!p\\) is false.\n\nSince the expressions do not evaluate to the same truth value in all cases, they are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]].",
