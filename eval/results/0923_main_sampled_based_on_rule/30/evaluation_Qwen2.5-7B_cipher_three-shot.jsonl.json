For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[TWX$$T$$V]]\n\n### Reference Input Data:\n\n### Task:\nSelect the most appropriate encryption or decryption method based on the specific question.\n\nFor example, use the following input data as the base:\n\n### TR1 Encryption:\n\n1. In the test string, there is no $ symbol, so the conditional judgment is false.\n2. The transposed sequence list [3, 5, 0, 4, 1, 2] has 6 columns of data, so m is 6.\n3. Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 6 per line. When there are less than 6, the last line is filled with $. The written grid can be obtained: U$SKE#E.\n4. In the grid U$SKE#E, based on [3, 5, 0, 4, 1, 2], adjust the order of the columns. The order of the columns is now [the original column 3, the original column 5, the original column 0, the original column 4, the original column 1, the original column 2]. You get the adjusted column.\n5. After arranging it by columns, you get U#$KSEES.\n6. Read the adjusted columns row by row and connect them to get the final encryption value:$KSEESEU.\n\n### TR1 Decryption:\n\n1. The ciphertext $KSEESEU, read line by line, read a character in position 3, then 5, then 0, etc. You can get the decrypted plaintext: U$SKE#E.\n2. In the decrypt grid U$SKE#E, the last column is a longest continuous \"#\" sequence (except the first column), which means it starts at the end of the grid. There are 5 bytes. In this case, the $ occupies a special position, so the actual positions are not saved in the key, but it is actually occupied by a $ and a \"#\" when decrypting.\n3. Therefore, the decrypted plaintext should be: USKE$#E.\n\n### Encryption Implementation:\n\n### Def EncryptTR1:\n    Input:\n    - Plaintext is a string, the characters in the string are uppercase letters, spaces, and \".\", which are suitable for encryption.\n    - Keyword is a string, indicating the keyword chosen for encryption, which is only related to transposed sequence.\nOutput: \n    - Returns the ciphertext as a string, the characters in the string are uppercase letters, \".\".\n    1. Prepare the transposed sequence according to the keyword. ( [3, 5, 0, 4, 1, 2] ) .\n    2. Write the plaintext on the [x][y] grid, and x < y < 9, [x], [y] are the number of strings. The number of strings and the number of columns are determined by the length of the string and the transposed sequence. The transposed code is arranged according to the number of transposed sequence; if the plaintext string length is insufficient, it is filled with $.\n    3. The string is divided into a grid, the column position is sorted according to the transposed sequence, and some elements overlap. Overall sorting behavior.\n    4. Concatenate by the order and return the result.\n\n### Decryption Implementation:\n\n### Def DecryptionTR1:\n    Input:\n    - Ciphertext string as [4,1,3,0] (the position needs to be converted into 1,3,4,0)\n    - Keyword string as: HMMITset (the keyword that encrypted the conversion)\nOutput:\n    - Return the decrypted plaintext, [3,1,4,0] (the position needs to be converted into 3,1,4,0)\n\n### Def DecryptionTR1:\n    Input:\n    - Ciphertext string as [4,1,3,0]\n    - Keyword string as: HMMITset\nOutput:\n    - Return the decrypted plaintext, [3,1,4,0]\n\nUse the transformation table constraints to verify the given input answer. For example, verify that the first row matches the individual items in the inputs and outputs. Use the following schema as a reference:\n\n### Example:\n\nExpected Input: \n- Plaintext: \"BDE\"\n- Keyword: \"KEY\"\n\nExpected Output:\n- Encrypted output: \"B$EDE$\"\n- Decrypted output: \"BDEB$\"\n\nActual Input: \"BDE\"\nActual Expected Output: \"B$EDE$\"\n\"BD\" ##\n\n1.

Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length matches the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to hexadecimal for ciphertext output.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption, is the hashed hash obtained by SHA_256).\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GETGEGKVSHVQRNW\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
