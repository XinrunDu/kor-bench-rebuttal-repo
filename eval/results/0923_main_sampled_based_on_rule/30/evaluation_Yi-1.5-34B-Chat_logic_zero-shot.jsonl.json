This creates a Level C formula because it's a logical connective applied to a Level B formula.\n3. The disjunction operation (p3 ||p4) is another Level B formula, as it's composed of two Level A formulas.\n4. The equivalence operation ((p3 ||p4)=~p1) connects the output of (p3 ||p4) with ~p1. This is also a Level C formula because it involves a logical connective applied to two outputs, one of which is derived from a Level B formula.\n5. Finally, the conjunction operation (~(p1 =::>~p2))&((p3 ||p4 )=~p1) combines the two Level C formulas. This final formula is thus a combination of two Level C formulas, which makes it a Level D formula by the logic's extension outlined (beyond Level Z, they are classified as Z+n).\n\nSince the formula complexity exceeds Level Z, according to the rule of classifying levels beyond Z as Z+n, we classify this as Level Z+1.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z+1]].",

Moving on to Figure II (Form: P()M; S()M; ∴S()P):\n- The first statement is a universal negative (∀P⇒¬M), so it can't be P()M.\n- The second statement is an existential affirmative (∃S⇒M), so it fits S()M.\n- The conclusion is an existential negative (∃S⇒¬P), so it can't be ∴S()P.\n\nFigure II also doesn't fit the argument. Now let's check Figure III (Form: M()P; M()S; ∴S()P):\n- The first statement is a universal negative (∀P⇒¬M), so it can't be M()P.\n- The second statement is an existential affirmative (∃S⇒M), so it fits M()S.\n- The conclusion is an existential negative (∃S⇒¬P), so it can't be ∴S()P.\n\nFigure III doesn't fit the argument either. Finally, let's check Figure IV (Form: P()M; M()S; ∴S()P):\n- The first statement is a universal negative (∀P⇒¬M), so it can't be P()M.\n- The second statement is an existential affirmative (∃S⇒M), so it fits M()S.\n- The conclusion is an existential negative (∃S⇒¬P), so it can't be ∴S()P.\n\nNone of the given figures fit the argument as described. However, we can analyze the pattern of the given statements to see if it matches any of the valid moods without adhering to the strict form requirements given the constraints of the figures not fitting exactly.\n\nGiven the pattern:\n- First statement: Universal Negative (∀P⇒¬M)\n- Second statement: Existential Affirmative (∃S⇒M)\n- Conclusion: Existential Negative (∃S⇒¬P)\n\nThe closest mood that matches this pattern, though not fitting strictly into any of the provided figures due to the mismatch in the first statement's placement, is a combination that isn't directly listed in the figures' valid moods as they were applied (since none of the figures strictly apply due to the initial mismatch in universal statement alignment with M()P). However, for the sake of analysis based on the essence of the statements' roles, it somewhat aligns with aspects of an \"A type\" for the first statement's intended implications (though it's negated, making it more akin to an O-type in terms of focusing on non-Ms for Ps, and then S exists as M, concluding with S not being P, which echoes a negation flow more closely to an O-series mood in traditional syllogism classification but doesn't fit neatly due to the existential nature of the middle term's revelation and the universal negative implication leading to an existential negative conclusion without a strict figure adherence).\n\nGiven the constraints and the issue of none of the figures matching perfectly due to the specific way the existential and universal statements are laid out (with the first statement being a universal negative, which doesn't align with the M()P, P()M structures in a way that directly corresponds to the listed valid moods within the strict figure formats), the analysis concludes that the argument does not strictly match any of the Figure-Mood combinations listed in the initial rules.\n\nHowever, for a direct answer format you requested, acknowledging the initial misalignment in fitting the argument into the exact figures with moods due to the constraints you noted:\n\n### Answer:\n[[None];[N/A]]\n\nThis answer indicates that the argument does not neatly fit into any of the provided figures with a corresponding mood based on the strict interpretation of the figures and moods given. The response is meant to highlight the discrepancy rather than to match the argument to a figure-mood combination due to the mismatch in applying universal negative to the M()P or P()M roles directly.",
