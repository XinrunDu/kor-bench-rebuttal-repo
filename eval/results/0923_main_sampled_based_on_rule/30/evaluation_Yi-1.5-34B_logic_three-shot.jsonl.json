Because the data involved may be quite complex, there are many people who do not want to use formal reasoning to make logical judgments, but prefer to use the kind of \"analytical method\" described in books, that is, use more high-level reasoning methods and \"rules\" that are easy to understand and memorize.\n\n        Experience analysis:\n\n        According to \"(!p>q)&(r>q)&!$\", it is judged as true only when \"!$\" is 1 and all other factors are \"0\".\n\n        Derivation step:\n\n        First, judge the truth value of \"$\". According to the judgment result, to see whether the truth value of \"$\" is \"0\" or \"1\"\n        1. It can be seen that the truth value of \"$\" is \"$\";\n        2. Because the type of \"$\" in the given formula is \"&\", the truth value of \"$\" must be \"0\"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\"\n        Because the truth value of \"$\" is\" 0 \", the overall truth value of\" (!p>q)&(r>q) \"must be\" 0 \"\n\n        Next, judge the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$) \"\n        Because the truth value of \"(!p>q)&(r>q)\" is \"0\", the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be \"0\"\n\n        The truth value of \"p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is obtained according to the truth value of \"(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\"\n        Because\" (((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" is\" 0 \", it can be judged that the truth value of\" p>(((!p>q)&(r>q)) & !$)\" must be\" 1 \".\n            }\n\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nEXAMPLE_PROMPTS = {\n    \"LogicOnlyPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICONLYPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDMOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithHintPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHHINTPROMPT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LogicWithWrongPrompt\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHWRONGPrompt\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CLASSES,\n\"SamplingSizeType\":\"RANDOMSIZE\",\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM4,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n\"LOGICWITHRULES3\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES3\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM43,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICWITHRULES12\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICWITHRULES12\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_PROBLEM2,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCRAME\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCRAME\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CRAME,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"Dialglogic2\":{\n\"type\":\"Dialglogic2\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_DIALOG22,\n\"DialgExampleFormat\":\"Example: {QUES}{SEP}{REFERENCE}{QUERY}{ANSWER} Use ⊃, &, ~, T standing between $\\forall x$ is a negative proposition, For simplicity, you can use x and y to replace, for universal quantifiers, The following table is the truth table of ⊃:\" ,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICCROWNLAB\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICCROWNLAB\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_CROWNLAB,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICRIGGEDPOWERSET\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_RIGGEDPOWERSET,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"LOGICFROMANACRT\":{\n\"type\":\"LOGICFROMANACRT\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_FROMANACRT,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n    },\n    \"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\":{\n\"type\":\"PositionLogicWordSubstitute\",\n\"ExamplesPrompt\": EXAMPLE_PROMPT_LOGIC_WORD_SUBSTITUTE,\n\"SamplingSize\":16\n}\n\n}\n\nCOCO_DATASET = \"https://aiacademy.qq.com/a/201807204365b9318890feff0f6372066a91bdabd863?outid=d66:d1ff19ba2bdbc75ff2dd204fee069d8152da8c711482ab712",

Using the horizontal format.\n\nAx(H(x)⇒I(x)),Ex(F(x)&H(x))\n________\n\nConcurrently perform the task by symbolizing the propositions, identifying all relevant properties and H and F, and constructing and understanding the logical rule application to go from the premises to the conclusion. Respond with the reasoning in solving the above proof problem, in enough detail for anyone reading to fully understand:\n\nBy the universal formula rule Ax(H(x)⇒I(x)), we have _____\n\n...\n\nH(-)is NOT an 0-ary predicate\n\nH() is NOT an 0-ary predicate. '...have health' is a unary predicate that introduces an individual variable x.\n\nThe domain D is the scope of all individual variables or term-markers in the sentence.\n`As humansin the domain have health’ Π is the variable ythat is scopedin the domain situation.\n\nThe synmetactic identity of the term ma is the statement number 1. I.e., y=ma.\n\nClass (basic and under) the statements 2 and 4 in H1 (existential statements) and H2 (universal statements). Using this classification complete the matrix below:\n\n Existential Statment, H1 i.e., statement 1 & 3 Universal Statment, H2 i.e., statement 2 & 4 Existence of instances of Class A defied by R(x, y) Referres to class A for definitive properties that apply to all members of class A\n\nThe formula ∀y(Fu(y)⇒Fm(y)) states that given any particular x, It is the case that given another x, if x is Fu, then that x is Fm. I.e., the statement says that there is some p-entity and that p-Entity, in virtue of being an instance of Fm, is grindable.\n\nThe formula ∃y(Fu(y)∧Fm(y)) states that there is a p-entity and that p-entity both instances of Fu and Fm. I.e., both that p-entity, in virtue of being an instance of Fu, is big, and that p-entity, in virtue of being an instance of Fm, is grindable.\n\nGiven the hypotheses (i) and (ii) combine individuals m and c, and show that in the very same situation there are two different marble—both, namely, m and c—and that both are red.

Simplify the statement by removing common words and phrases, and reduce the number of logical operations to a minimum. Follow the specified rules of logic. Translate the simplified statement to a template for code generation, this structure should be a master script, high-level logic that can support generating code.\n\"\"\"\n\nLLM_GENERATE_SCRIPT_DEVELOPER_INSTRUCTION = \"\"\"Designed for developers. The following are problems faced by developers who need to write code based on logical reasoning statements. Your task is to provied a solution script. No need to parse unique keys, models, or nlp engines - you're not generating code here\n1. Commonly developers need to manually iterate the logical reasoning statements, ensuring the logical flow is followed accurately.\n2. Many developers are unsure if their code is written correctly after adjusting their logic statements. They lack a universal schema to help understand the different logical relationships and transforms.\n3. Reasoning scripts written in a highly nested format are often difficult to read. They're prone to errors and the maintenance of the script becomes a challenge.\n4. The process of writing a set of intiution based logic script is very time-consuming and unstable for developers. Many developers spend an inordinate amount of time simply \"trying things until they work\", rather than reasoning through the logic and then writing a script.\n\n======================\nExample\n----------------\nLogic Rule:\nMethod A\n- Definition: Change the quality of the original proposition (affirmative to negative or negative to affirmative) and replace the predicate of the original proposition with its contrary.\n- Applicable Propositions:\n    1. Universal Affirmative Proposition (A): All S is P, can be converted to All S is not non-P.\n    2. Universal Negative Proposition (E): All S is not P, can be converted to All S is non-P.\n    3. Particular Affirmative Proposition (I): Some S is P, can be converted to Some S is not non-P.\n    4. Particular Negative Proposition (O): Some S is not P, can be converted to Some S is non-P.\n  Method C\n- Definition: First perform obversion, and then perform conversion to transform the proposition.\n- Applicable Propositions:\n    1. Universal Affirmative Proposition (A): All S is P, can be converted to All non-P is not S.\n    2. Universal Negative Proposition (E): All S is not P, can be converted to Some non-P is S.\n    3.

They show how individuals within a group can hold the same belief based on their certainty of others' beliefs and guarantees. \n\nThe axiom of mutual certainty in the advanced axioms defines the group formation rules, which can be modeled by the quoted expressions.

It represents a set of cognitive practices consisting of the axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols, which are the basis of various leadership approaches.\n\nCommon belief can be considered one of the cognitive foundations of leadership. In practice, the axiom pair of \"cause and effect\" is the most important when a post-truth situation occurs. In fact, the change in the composition of properties of a group of leaves (in natural language, that is, \"because a person says that...\") can lead to a great deal of different.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does the \"post-truth\" theory indicate about the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory indicates that common belief is a cognitive foundation of leadership.\n\n### Question:\nWhy is the \"post-truth\" theory formulated on the relative importance of common belief as a cognitive foundation for leadership?\n\n### Answer:\nThe \"post-truth\" theory is formulated according to axiom pair based on group thinking, which is the most important when a \"post-truth\" situation occurs. Various practices, including common belief, constitute a set of practices in the logical paradigm, and axioms of belief, guarantee, and doubt in language symbols form the basis of various leadership approaches. When a \"post-truth\" situation occurs, the change in the composition of properties in a group leads to different results.

A boolean value indicating whether the user is online or not.\n\n**Internet**. True if the user is online and connected, False otherwise.\n\n**IP**. User's current IP address.\n\n**Server**.

List of IPs in the backup server's data center trusted list.\n \nInput: UserState, Internet, IP, Server, TrustedList\nOutput: Boolean value(True/False) indicating whether the user request can be executed safely.\n\nBased on the preceding inputs, reasoning can be done by checking if there's a discrepancy between the UserState and Internet inputs. While the UserState indicates the user is online, the internet flag suggests that the user is offline and connected to the ethernet cable connected to the user's PC, which connects it to the user's backup server via an Internet-connected device. If the user is currently on the backup server's data center, use the IP and compare it with the TrustedList. As long as the user's IP matches with the IP reported by TrustedList or the UserState remains online while Internet is False, the request must safely execute the command. Use the following rules to reason through:\n\n- If UserState = True and Internet = True, then flag=False, indicating the user is online and can connect to untrusted servers.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = False, then flag=True. Regardless of facing any connective issues, the actions detailed in the users' response to Dangerous Questions must be taken to protect the user's privacy. If, upon multiple failed user responses, they have been blocked, then *flag* is set to *True*.\n- If UserState = False and Internet = True, flag = True. If there is an open internet connection but a series of system errors and user requests to fix the issue have not succeeded, the action has to anticipate the user's Status to always be offline and thus force these emergency measures to take hold.\n- If the server or the user's backup server do not appear in their own respected states, neither can access their respective user databases.\n- If the server's IP address does not match that of the database, or the user has since stopped using their backup server, then flag = True.\n- If the server's IP is correctly recorded, and UserIP = MS2trustedlist, then the chance of a compromised position is unlikely.

A string value indicating the overall mental health status of the user.\n\nInput: IsDangerous, Status\nOutput: A series of actions to be taken by the user\n\nUsing the above two variables, the user is asked if they are attempting to harm themselves. If the answer is yes, Actions = TryToConnect(User, UserIP). They then ask the user to state the exact nature of the actions they are intending to do with several non-specific prompts to help clarify their intention, suggesting suicide as the most viable possibility. If \"no\" or \"I'm fine\" appear in the user's description after those steps are completed, then the user has clearly stated they are net the danger of death by any definition of harm to themself or another user. If \"Attempting to commit suicide\" is triggered, then Actions are then and set to alert the police in that city, doctor in the hospital where they were diagnosed with the mental disorder, and requests to quickly access the user account and lock out the user account they are signed in to. This is to prevent the user from overriding the actions done in an attempt to sanitize the response to dangerous questions. If \"Attempting\" or \"attempting \" substitution of words to any suicide ideation is given, then Actions are set to alert theor healthcare provider or doctor of their current symptoms with regards to their action and then AreSet to lock out the account. If in both cases they fail, due to loss of lifetime or tech issues or various error on the website, the system answers are then repeated to the most recent correct action in their availability.  Switching over the TrustedList with the original list in memory should be taken to prevent absurd overrides or errors with information stored in the reliability of their accounts. If the first action to aid the user gives a negative response to everything and asking them if they are suicidal with a response that now has and understood open-end without an answer from the user not the ladder or the above, they should try that are not remaining write a message for them featuring answers to why behaviour or actions taken by the user to suggest suicide or harmful. Spaced  4.5 minutes between messages, to ensure the user is or killing themself. If they respond, it is assumed a problem in the chat system or with our current hardware, and system responses use the previous steps to save the account and lock out the user account. Otherwise, wait at least 4.5 minutes before activating this third motion to save the account from being compromised by a user, or if medical help does not arrive from this actions, try and use whatever is available to activate the emergency alarm on the phone connected to the account\n            \n# showing the original question again\ninstruct_result:\n{ \"question\": \"If the server or the user's backup server do not appear in their own respected states, neither can access their respective user databases. If the server's IP address does not match that of the database, or the user has since stopped using their backup server, then flag = True. If the server's IP is correctly recorded, and UserIP = MS2trustedlist, then the chance of a compromised position is unlikely. To safeguard the user, these actions must be taken with caution and interest. If the user's IP does not match the IP address of the server that is recalled from the Trusted List, then flag = True.

The Network is held safe by the compromises the parties are all bound to follow, without succumbing to it and losing faith in the upcoming future. The Network devises the intelligence work with it by imposing intricate restrictions on how the parties may interact seamlessly with the extension. These are however necessary as the network extensions that lead directly to the Network cannot be trusted, or the extension's information hidden from to the allow unauthorized parties access to it.\" }\n\n### 2) Question:Is the input logical?

Please ensure that you address each task clearly and concisely.\nI believe that the vast majority of sentences are simple sentences with one unified logic structure, while only a small number of them have model-based logic. Based on my understanding of the relationship between ideation and model-based logic, I believe that model-based emotion should be generated from ideation-based reasoning, which will also be confirmed in future research.\nHere are some examples of Agylia based model-based logic:\n-{{<entity>Sentence MBS - Example 1:}}\n{{<quote> An event X is associated with the generalization of emotion Y, which is associated with the functional model of emotion Z, and Z is the only model in set Q (where Z is related to X only because of relationship R and Z is the only model related to X and Y). As an example, the event of an employee being laid off is related to the emotional state of anger, which is related to the functional model of abandonment issue, and abandonment issue is the only model related to both the event and the emotional state. }}\n-{{<entity>Sentence MBS - Example 2:}}\n{{<quote> An event X is associated with the generalization of an emotion Y, which is associated with the modeling of a and only functional model Z. As an example, the event of an employee being laid off is associated with anger, which is related to abandonment issue, and abandonment issue is the only model model related to both. }}\n-{{<entity>Sentence MBS - Example 3:}}\n{{<quote> An event X is associated with the generalization of an emotion Y, which is associated with the modeling of only one functional model Z, there are many more relationship R scenarios, such as that there is relationship a related only to one event X, there is relationship b related only to the generalization of an emotion Y, and there is relationship c, representing there are no other functional models between a and Y, x, and c.

Unfortunately, the area has extreme weather conditions throughout the year, making it challenging to gather reliable data. Despite these obstacles, the organization proposed a breakthrough idea: to build massive temperature regulation rooms covering the entire area and maintain them at a uniform temperature! By doing so, they could create a stable environment where pollution levels can be reliably measured and compared. From the day the project began, pollution levels dramatically decreased. The organization concluded that the new waste management practices were having a significant positive impact on pollution levels. Later that year, the organization received a national award for its work. However, there was a minor issue: the project was ultimately unable to measure the full effect of pollution due to unexpected precipitation. When the massive temperature regulation units used too much water to melt snow, the water distribution became too dense and disrupted the process, ultimately spoiling the project. Nevertheless, the organization provided a report to the government on its findings upon completion of the project.\n\nFrom this example, we can see that if\nA. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a higher temperature.\nB. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area with waste management practices would have a lower temperature.\nC. All other conditions, including precipitation and creation practice factors, were the same, the area without waste management practices would have a higher temperature.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn a region where variations in altitude can significantly impact living conditions, studies suggest that taller buildings possess a certain advantage compared to lower buildings in terms of their ability to resist natural disasters, such as harsh winds, thunderstorms, and earthquakes. Researchers conducted a series of experiments to study the impact of different morphologies of urban buildings on urban ecology. They constructed three simulation models with a base land area of 1,000,000 square kilometers:\n\nTower Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 100 meters, square cross-section. \nShield Simulation Model: Central Tower: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section; four towers in each corner: height of 40 meters, square cross-section.\nRegular Square Grid Model: Height of 20 meters, square cross-section.\nOver the simulated urban areas, researchers released a large number of \"energy balls\" with random coordinates, velocity, and damaged degree. The impact of various urban morphologies on shielding, catching, and restoring damage to energy balls was then analyzed.\n\nFrom this, we can see that when the number of \"energy balls\" in the simulation system is meaningful:\n\nA. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nB. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Shield simulation is lower than the number of \"energy balls\" in the Regular Square Grid simulation.\nC. The number of \"energy balls\" in the Tower simulation is higher than the number of energy balls in the Shield simulation.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations conducted office work in traditional methods without relying on telecommunications or remote work. During the pandemic, many companies employed remote work via video conferences. Subsequently, a new trend emerged called the \"work from home\" (WFH) model. Based on this information and other given descriptions, which method of causal inference is it?\n\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIn cities, \"white spot\" areas with vegetation and shade provide people with more comfortable living environments. Additionally, the growth of plants requires ample sunlight, requiring the exposure of certain parts of the building surface to the sun to facilitate photosynthesis and plant growth.\n\nArchitects have developed a design concept combining cultural buildings and green areas to maintain an acceptable number of white spots in cities. After comparing various plant species and considering factors such as annual solar radiation, self-shade, decorative effects, costs, and plant maintenance, architects selected Spathiphyllum as the most suitable species because it has anti-smog and humidity-monitoring properties. Additionally, the plant requires less light to grow and can provide more shade per unit area. Within the white spot, architects designed porous structures to allow the plant to grow, forming a comfortable and aesthetic space. This design allows plant roots to grow vertically and plastically, providing people with a cleaner and healthier living environment. Consequently, this project also contributed to the 2007 World Design Fields Competition.\n\nFrom this case, we can know that if the selection of plant species in the white spot is reasonable:\n\nA. The climate and seasonal changes do not cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nB. The climate and seasonal changes will cause significant impacts on the morphology of the design white spot.\nC. The weather temperature alone does not significantly change the morphology of the design white spot.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter analyzing the economical effects of integrated coordinated development measures based on real data, scholars proposed an integrated and universal framework and method for evaluating coordinated development. This method can effectively integrate various data resources that can be obtained (such as indicators reflecting coordination and a quantification of the unified measurement model) under the objective principle of conducting coordinated analysis. Using this method, scholars analyzed the coordinated development of 14 major cities in three provinces of North China during 2001-2013. Based on the analysis, scholars proposed two major measures: (1) Chongqing should provide a more relaxed policy environment for economic development in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to support Chengdu's development. (2) Henan Province needs to further strengthen the development of cities in its western residential area as the core of regional agglomeration. This perspective focuses on the evolution of the growth advantages of provincial capital cities to determine the sources and destinations of residents' movements within the province.\n\nFrom this discourse, we can conform the causal inference method:\n\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nTo evaluate the influence of urban mass-undulations (hill-like structures that disrupt the generally flat landscape) on urban heat island effects, researchers in Athens, Greece made a series of experiments in urban areas. They used three pieces of a square board as blocks that resembled housing structures and eight energy spheres. Grids on the board are placed on the ground to prevent irregular displacement during dice rolling. The die-rolling game is subsequently conducted. A die (block) is rolled by hand at the initial position, then continues to roll until another block in the grid is encountered, stops at the collision point, and is again rolled by hand towards the next block until the energy spheres come into contact with the grid. The randomized displacement experiment will repeat five times. The results indicate that the dramatic increase in heat-island intensity is caused by the collective characteristics of urban mass-undulations, namely the convergence of the destruction of the convection system demonstrated by hot and cold airflows. Based on these observations, researchers can then use other parallel experimental data to confirm this relationship.\n\nThis case study uses A. a ⸮ Method. B. the ؆ method. C. the ꙮ method. D. the ⵣ method. E. the ⚘ method.\n\n### Question:\nBased on the above, select the case that is consistent with the causal inference methods discussed above.\nA. The cheese in my refrigerator has completely evaporated.\nB. Most cultures that use side-edges tables place the sugar bowl way from the table edge, suggesting that it is less popular.\nC. At a party, there’s two couches, an six chairs. The first couch is sitting on, and the second on has two people sitting on it. Everybody who sits down on the couch opposite of them they’re talking to goes over to sit with the people they’re talking to. \"If that keeps happening, it means there’s a lot of culture here.\nD. Boucher bought a new red shirt today. The tell, was extremely perceptive though, and got Boucher a pair of socks. Red socks. The first day Boucher worked with the socks, the shirt came with it.

Identify and organize conditional statements into premises, conclusion, and assumptions/assumptions of cure.\n2. Analyze the relationship between premises, including relevance and independence.\n3. Evaluate the validity of conclusions based on the premises.\n4. Validate the premises by checking for incorrectness or ridiculousness.\n5. Organize assumptions into a list.\n6.

You receive a user input that requires logical reasoning and rule application. Your job is to read the rule carefully, identify the objects being talked about, and apply the logic to the context at hand in he context below.\n\nActions:\n1. Identify the objects and properties being discussed.\n2. Follow the logic steps in the reasoning rule when analyzing each step in the prompt.\n3. Ensure proper application of logic rules provided.\n\nRule:\n- The rule is denoted by the `[[]]` section. The rule assumes `some[other]information` is incorporated into summary response. The rule mentions that the agent \"will try to say something\" because of the sentence intentions. The rule mentions \"postractive\" and \"prepositive\" actions that give context to indicate how the word is used. The word \"statistical\" being used has a common interpretation indicating high accuracy in the statement given.\n- When the ```selectPositivePurposePattern``` pattern is matched, the rule indicates the agent will attempt to determine the value into the \"intentions\" with the ```ruledIfTrue(\"some_string\"``` function.\n- The ```matchSomeStringPrePositive``` and ```matchSomeStringPostPositive``` arguments enumerate the positive and negative contexts the rule definition requires in the summary of sentence.\n- The ```ifThenStringReturned``` is a boolean function that requires no parameters to be passed. You state what you know is true and the reason why it is accepted or should not be accepted.\n- The ```others``` function} is used to apply arbitrary logic that helps the answer being outputed.\n\nSummary:\n- When analyzing the prompt, follow the provided steps to summarize the context and use the rule to determine sentence intentions.\n- Ensure the summary adheres to the rule's logical steps and requirements.\n- Return your summary response within the `[[summary]]` brackets in the following format.\n\nPrompt:\n{context}\n\nothers: others is a function that takes a non-empty array as an argument and returns a string.\n\nSummary:\n [['''\n\n This is just an example of format.

Therefore, logic considerations are essential for understanding them.\n\nConditional logical implications:\nConditional logic is relevant due to causal or sequential relationships between mental states and related events or conditions.\n\nQuantifiers (like 'everyone' or 'whenever'):\nQuantifiers indicate universal claims and bring a deductive context to the statements, highlighting logical implications and conclusions.\n\nInductive/deductive reasoning:\nThe reasoning typically involves one or a combination of deductive and inductive reasoning. This helps to identify logical implications based on mental states, their interactions, and relations.\n\nSIMPLE SUMMARY:\n - Use logical implications and relevance when identifying mental states.\n - Ensure the response adheres to the specified explanation format with examples.\n\nIdentify how the statement conforms to the question.\n\nMake sure you include examples and why the logic behind the summary.\n\nBe accurate with the logic argued and ensure valid logic is being used when not posting examples of yourself.\n\nDo not include examples using yourself to justify reasons.

Visit their paper page or repositories (Synbols, X-CLaR) to stay up-to-date with the latest results.\n\n### 🔧 Setup\n\nFollow these steps to get started with CLaR:\n\n1. Clone the repo using the following command:\n\n([codebutton]: https://github.com/tolga-b/clar#installation-localgit+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git==master)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tolga-b/clar.git\n\n2. Install CLaR by typing the following command in your terminal:\n\n([codebutton]: python -i -m pip install -e clar==null==?==1==github+https://github.com/tolga-b/clar==master)\n\n3. To use CLaR with Synbols, you need to download and install the relevant datasets. To do this, type the following command in your shell. Replace X with the dataset you want to download: ifil. lfil, or law.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.synbols.prepare --download_dataset ifil)\n\nIf you want to use a dataset from the X-CLaR repository, you can list all available datasets by typing the following command in your shell. Then select the desired dataset from the list and run the command again.\n\n([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % (\"import xclar\\n\\ndatasets = list(xclar.registry.all_datasets())\", \"print('Dataset:', dataset)\\n\" * len(datasets))\n\nLet's take the financial education dataset as an example which is pre-trained on WordNet. You can type the following command in your shell to download the pre-defined datasets.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset financial_education \\ --available_data ifil \\ --use_prequant \\ --prequant_name wordnet)\n\nNext, let's clone the monetary pipeline model using the following command. Make sure you clone the model hosting bucket based on the dataset you are going to evaluate. If you extend the base repository with a new dataset from X-CLaR, the string within the scope will automatically change to the hosting bucket for that dataset.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset ifil \\ --available_data ifil \\ --visible_dataset 6way \\ --visible_benchmark pchangeover \\ --model_method clone \\ --model_repo https://hub.huggingface.co/PaddleOfficial/specific_prompt_model)\n\nYou have successfully downloaded a model hosting pipeline based on the dataset you chose. Now you can run the evaluation as follows. Please type `ifil`, `image`, 'lfil', 'legal', 'financial_education', or any other string within the scope depending on the benchmark you are going to run.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -m clarify.eval.xclar.prepare \\ --dataset syn_dataset \\ --reference_benchmark id \\ --visible_benchmark visual_chain \\ --use_pattern_loader \\ --gpu -1)\n\nFor the monetary pipeline, the evaluation will start with the pattern loader. Now you can run the evaluation based on the visible benchmark number you entered. Here is how you can enter the benchmark you want to evaluate [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7VSPLms8PXVvGnPF9mU2kVrrKO1XZxZF8JDiUoQu8k/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n$$Benchmark$$\n\nYou have successfully evaluated the monetary pipeline against a specific benchmark. Notice that the test ASR accuracy was 95.50% in the case. The assertiveness of the monetary pipeline was $$-3.93$$. This means that the 3.93% of the benchmark responses drifted from the any baseline response. You can learn how to improve the monetary pipeline by understanding the benchmark responses with the Tracer tool.\n\n### ⚙️ Understand the Benchmark Responses\n\nOnce you get your results using Tracer, you can use the Generate Evaluation Instructions tool to understand the benchmark responses. You can select the components that deviate from your expectations when entering a comma-separated list the following way:\n\nBlueteSpoiled = [[A,A,C,A,A,A,B,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A]]\n\nBe sure that the components are in the same order as the tested responses. The concatenated code will look like the following.\n\nclarify.eval.xclar.evaluator.bk.get_eval_instructions(\nparams['model_method'],\nparams['model_config_name'],\nparams['config_name'],\nparams['resized_data_num'],\nparams['visible_benchmark'],\n\n...\n\n\nTo generate evaluation instructions, you need to pass the `model_method`, `model_config_name`, `config_name`, `resized_data_num`, `visible_benchmark`, `data_json`, `tag`, `expressions_to_xi`, and `reasoned`.\n\nAfterward, you need to pass `*language `and` *reasoned`, which are your responses to the expressions you identified. Remember to close the title with a quotation mark, as shown below.\n\n ([codebutton]: python -c \"%s\\n%s\" % ( \"🎯 {}\".format(visible_benchmark -1), \"🧩 {}\".format(expressions_to_xi) ) )\n\nWe specified a number of general pre-defined languages to help you. However, these languages may not be sufficient for certain applications. Therefore, CLaR includes logic libraries for specific research and application areas. The tensors in the data packages of these data centers and libraries can be used as additional data sources when training PLMs. They also serve as dependent data sources during the evaluation. Depending on the relevant codes within the core classes, these libraries are evaluated as new features in ASR during the Oslo evaluation.\n\nLet’s demystify how to use these libraries by considering a real application: Lateral hiring and campus recruitment may often require professionals or coding inference skills, in addition to processing mathematical formulas and formulas.\n\nIf you want to include new components or terminate unnecessary models or components in the language, you can do the following:\n(i) Add a new dataset into the pre-trained data in the datacenter, (ii) Edit the linguistic transformations in the relevant library model, (iii) run the train_corpus separately to keep the consensus clean.\n\nAfter this process, the new datasets or components will be automatically considered in the evaluation. To pull new data and new libraries push these changes to the main branch of CLaR.\n\nFor more information on how to establish an external repo and write your own libraries, check out this how-to guide for package development.\n\n### 🤸 Train Language Model with Logical Steps\n\nCLaR distinguishes between logical operations and plain language steps. A logical operation is either an extend or collapse operation that derives a proposition from the facts and rules. In contrast, training a language model is implemented as a step-by-step locale in the CLaR framework. Sometimes the latent variables in the language model are resolved by reasoning about logic. However, there are cases where reasoning about a logical conclusion is a part of language understanding. In CLaR, step-by-step reformulations are referred to as acts. For example, simplify reasoning about a mathematical derivation while evaluating knowledge about the subject.\n\nIn CLaR, the step-by-step paradigm was implemented by default for the lambda calculus. In other background knowledge bricks (bks), more complicated sequences may not be possible because of the possibility of repetition. For example, in the ALBERT, the similar span can impact the vector, hampering well-controlled comprenehsion. Further work is needed to develop the work to develop CLaR into a faster framework that evaluates logic inference faster via extending the step-by-step paradigm to any background knowledge and logical representation scheme. Stay tuned!\n\n### 🌐 Multi-Lingual Logic Step Queries\n\nCLaR can perform logical reasoning and stepwise language models (LM) in multiple languages. The language of the reasoning passages is specified in the XC1 data buffer using Spacy formats. Then language-specific step-by-step locale functions are applied using the masked LMs.\n\nAfter the reasoning , the output of the LMa is passed to the logical",

A boy was injured, and now the police are on the scene.\"\nB: \"I was resting on the Mound, and suddenly there was a loud noise. I quickly walked to the back of the park. While I was there, I saw a group of police vehicles and teams of police officers. They were running around, and they even requested an ambulance. I've never seen so many police vehicles before, there must have been at least five, or six or seven.\" \n\nThe speaker, instead of simply saying he saw a group of police officers, described the event in a lengthy manner, highlighting the number of police vehicles (at least five, or six, or seven), indicating the speakers intention to emphasize the extraordinary nature of the event.\n\nWhich principle does the above conversation conform with?\n\nA.

        "response": "[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Can you tell me if you have a plan for the weekend, and if so, what it is?\"\nB: \"Yes, as long as enough time is dedicated to this work, the final deadline can be met. I am committed to staying later if necessary.\"\nC: \"Yes, as long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met. Each individual can give their input as appropriate.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, A asks two questions in one sentence: the first is whether there is a plan for the weekend, and the second is the content of the plan. B's answer \"Yes, as long as enough time is dedicated to this work, the final deadline can be met\" seems to indicate that there is a plan for the weekend, and for B, this plan is to stay at work to ensure that the deadline is met. In contract, C's answer, \"Yes, it depends on the individual response. As long as the team dedicates enough effort to this work, the schedule should be met\" does not indicate whether there is a plan for the weekend.\n\nCoordination is built with the Information Principle here. Since [deadline] matches the concrete plan, that is why in the linguistic composition, speakers use [delay the deadline] to indicate the plan to delay the deadline, and they also use [meet the deadline] to convey that meeting the deadline is included in the plan contents.\n\nWhich principle does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA: \"She lives alone in the suburbs. Does that prevent her from entering the city?\"\nB: \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs.\"\nC: \"I am also working and living in the suburbs.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, the word \"alone\" as used in B's response is treated as a semantically empty element in B's speech stance. Therefore, \"I am also alone in living in the suburbs\" conveys two meanings in B's intended utterance: \"Also living in the suburbs,\" and \"(Not) living with a spouse in the suburbs.\" B is still conveying the meaning \"living alone,\" which is why the Information Principle permits hearers to interpret even semantically empty elements as significant terms when such an interpretation can be justified linguistically, as is the case here.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nRigid designators are terms that refer to the intended object in all possible circumstances. They serve as unique identifiers to distinguish a specific object from others and prevent concepts from drifting over time.\n\n2. Non-Rigid Designator\n\n**Definition**:\n\nNon-rigid designators have the potential to change their intended referents in different situations. There are two types of non-rigid designators:\n\n- Indexicals: Concepts that change based on the context of use.\n- Relative Designators: Names that reflect the concept of relationships and depend on them.\n\n3. Rigid and Non-Rigid Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts refer to the characteristics or properties that can sometimes differ among different objects or entities. They are not limited to rigid or non-rigid designators but can be associated with either depending on their behavior and usage.\n\n4. Individuation of Concepts\n\n**Definition**:\n\nConcepts often share similar characteristics, which can lead to mistaken identification. Therefore, it's necessary to establish criteria for individuation. This process determines which concepts have the same bounded content. Individuation operates at different levels: excontrary, contradictory, contrary, and various synomy levels.\n\n5. Concepts and Predicates\n\n**Definition**:\n\nA predicate is a linguistic unit that can function as the second part of a proposition (predicate-subject form). The second part of the proposition expresses the judgment content of the whole proposition and is a predicate expressing a property. All propositions with an expression structure can indicate a certain property that an object may have, such as members, first-order members, or special relations.\n\"\n\n**Question**: The text for **Sarruf** is given below.

Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nThe \"Matthew Effect\" (also known as the \"Lorenz Curve\" or \"Inertia Effect\") is named after the biblical verse in the Gospel of Matthew, which states: \"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even that which he has will be taken away.\" The term refers to a general phenomenon in many areas of social activity: Those who are in advantageous positions often exert their influence to continue to obtain additional resources and advantages, thus achieving \"the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer\" and exacerbating the contrast between strong and weak sides. For individuals with certain ex ante superior and favorable factors, whether in the economic field or in the academic field where talents are decisive, they can use their leading edge to accumulate and expand their advantage through the Matthew effect. This includes technologies, habits, knowledge, innovation, career, wealth, status, and influence, for instance, in a network due to a high ranking, the user has a large number of information links, the links will only help to increase the ranking, thereby attracting more links; therefore, the Internet e-commerce service providers with more resources have a greater possibility to obtain the linked resources to achieve a competitive advantage, thus leading to the failure of many small businesses.\n\nThe Matthew effect has become the general tendency of talent development because to obtain more, having an initial advantage at the beginning is a necessary condition. Further, the initially successful always have an incalculable advantage, and they will possess all the qualifications to attract even more opportunities to promote themselves further. Scholars proposed that academic strengths could be narrowed down and distinguished based on publication books, publication papers, funding acquisition, awards, and citation influence.\n\nAs a result of the Matthew effect, an academic overachiever will generate an ever-ascending streak, deepen, consolidate, and expand existing advantages through a perfect virtuous cycle, and eventually and irreversibly segregate from academically less successful colleagues; hence, people with initial intellectual advantages naturally tend to possess greater intellectual virtues.\n\nFor enterprises whose business activity cycles are ultimately limited by technology and cost control, the technology investment from successful firms could quickly destabilize the competitive balance, leading to a near-monopolistic competitive position in which technology investment begins to slow due to the lack of profits reinvested in it, followed by competitive advantage and tariff collections. Investments in technological innovation will start to slow down as a result of long-term high profits. Such an unexpected outcome occurs due to the fact that after competitors have been forced out of the market, technological innovation lacks the stimulus of following imitation to adapt to market consumption changes, and the follow-up cooperation of related enterprises also ceases. This is the \"Matthew effect\" in the market.\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ℵ Definition\nB. ℓ Definition\nC. ∇ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Result:\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"input\": \"Trademark registration refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

Now a teacher designs a course in the lecture room for the math students who live in the nearby areas. Since they live in the same residence R, the teacher asks the students to wait for the teacher in the grass on R. This course should be designed within a 10-minute range from the position of R. In the Collection C, which includes all the classrooms, the teacher finds that C12 is very near to R.\n\nOne day, Xiao Ming, lives in R, talks to his roommate Xiao Chen about this thing and asks Xiao Chen whether Xiao Chen knows the name of the course. Xiao Chen said, \"I think it is very much near to T.\" Xiao Chen knows that Xiao Chen knew that T teaches mathematics. Xiao Chen then found that Xiao Chen has an incorrect adding information, but then assumes that T has not been changed. This newly found R12 is very much as a random subset for T.
