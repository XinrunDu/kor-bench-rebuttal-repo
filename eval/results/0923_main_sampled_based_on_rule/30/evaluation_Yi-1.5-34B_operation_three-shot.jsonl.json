Define that  A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (xA + yB),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 5 = 324; 2 ○ 2 = 100 solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x=value,y=value]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[x=3,y=0]]\nLet a=7,b=5;\na ○ b=(x*a + y*b) × (x*a + y*b)，7 ○ 5 = 324\n(x*7 + y*5) × (x*7 + y*5) = 324\n(7x + 5y) ^ 2  = 324\n(7x + 5y) = ±18\n7x + 5y = 18 or 7x + 5y = -18\nSolving the first equation for x in terms of y:\n7x + 5y = 18\n7x = -5y + 18\nx = (-5y + 18) / 7\nSubstituting this expression for x into the second equation:\n7 ○ 5 = (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5)\n7 ○ 5 = ((-5y + 18) / 7 * 7 + y * 5) * ((-5y + 18) / 7 * 7 + y * 5)\n7 ○ 5 = (5 * 18 - 5y^2)\n7 ○ 5 = 90 - 5y^2\nSo: (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5) = 90 - 5y0 2\nLet a=2,b=2;\na ○ b=(x*a + y*b) × (x*a + y*b)，2 ○ 2 = 100\n(x*2 + y*2) × (x*2 + y*2) = 100\n(2x + 2y) ^ 2  = 100\n(2x + 2y) = ±10\n=> 2x + 2y) = 10 （x > 0,y >0)\n2x + 2y = 10\n2x = 10 - 2y\nx = (10 - 2y) / 2\nSubstituting this expression for x into the second equation:\n2 ○ 2 = (x * 2 + y * 2) * (x * 2 + y * 2)\n2 ○ 2 = ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) * ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2)\n2 ○ 2 = (10 - y^2)\n\n\nSo we get:\n1.  (x * 7 + y * 5) * (x * 7 + y * 5) = 90 - 5y^2\n2.\n(x * 2 + y * 2) * (x * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSolving equations (1) and (2) simultaneously, we get:\n\nFrom equation (1), we can rearrange:\nx * 7 + y * 5 = ±18\nx = (-5y + 18) / 7\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into equation (2), we get:\n\n((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) * ((10 - 2y) / 2 * 2 + y * 2) = 100\n\nSimplifying:\n(10 - 2y + 2y) * (10 - 2y + 2y) = 100\n(10) * (10) = 100\n100 = 100\n\nNow real check for answer\nx=3,y=0\na=7, b=5\n(x*a + y*b) * (x*a + y*b) = 90 - 5y^2\n(3*7 + 0*5) * (3*7 + 0*5) = 90 - 5(0)^2\n21 * 21 = 90 - 5(0)\n441 = 90 - 0\n441 ≠ 90\n\nSo the value for x and y [[x=3, y=6]] is wrong.\n\n\n\nSo:\n1. From equation (1):\n[[x=3,y=0]]\n\n2.From equation (2):\n[[x=5,y=0]]\n\nSo reEvaluate wrong answer and leave correct answer [[x=3, y=0]].\n\n\n\n### Rewrite the problem with correct answer\n\nNow we make a little change to the rule. Define that  A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (xA + yB),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 5 = 324; 2 ○ 2 = 100 solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer.\nPlease",

Your task is to generate a question in a mathematical format that can be answered under the custom rule defined below. Please use the following pattern to format the questions: Compute <math_expression>.\n\nWhen providing a math expression:\n\n• Use mathematical symbols, if possible\n• Only use 4 variables (a,b,c,d) found in the operation rule\n\nThe rule:\nA new operation is defined as follows:\n```\n<a,b,c,d>=P(N)\n```\nwhere P(x) represents a polynomial and P(N) is the evaluation of\nthe polynomial P at the number N.\n\n<a,b,c,d> can be a single variable such as a,b,c,d, or an operation with these variables such as a+b, a+b+c, a+b+c*d.\n\nIf <a,b,c,d> cannot be accurately represented mathematically, then skip the question.\n\nThe term N can be any number or a group of numbers.\nExample: ⟨3,2,4,-1⟩ can be N = 3a + 2b + 4c - d\n\nWhen N is an operation with variables:\nIf N represent an operation, the it should correctly represent <a,b,c,d>\nExample: ⟨1,2,-3,1⟩ -> N = 1a + 2b - 3c + d not N = 1a + c\n\nTo best answer the generated question, the question should follow these rules:\n- Use mathematical symbols\n- Should not feel too complex to the human that needs to solve it\n- Should not feel too easy to the human that needs to solve it\n- Use operations that involve a,b,c,d\n- Number should be used to define the properties of a,b,c,d\n- Use a,b,c,d as the main part of the question\n- Use numbers only for thing around a,b,c,d\n\nExample questions that should be avoided:\n- A general question that sounds like:\n\"Explain the relationship between P(N) and <a,b,c,d>.\"\n- A simple question that doesn't require invoking the custom operation:\n\"Compute the value of N.\"\nN should be unique relative to the custom operation.\n\nExample questions that are good:\n- A question that requires invoking the custom operation to compute the value of\n<a,b,c,d>:\n\"Compute ⟨6, 3, 1, 2⟩ when P(x) = 2x^2 + 1x + 2 and N = 3a^2 + b + 2c -

The operation is defined as \n⌝⌝a⌝⌝b, where a and b are real positive integers. Let's investigate its behavior further.\n\n### Question:\n Find 1 ⌝⌝ 3.\nYou should provide an answer while in active learning helper mode. The answer should contain the step-by-step reasoning on how to evaluate the operation for the given values. You should not apply knowledge from outside the given questions and answers.\n\n### Answer and Explanation:\n\n1. Thanks for seeking my assistance, Jamal! Our mission is to understand the logic of the operation ⌝⌝a⌝⌝b for real positive integers a and b.\n\nFirst, let's start with the basic structure of the operation. It seems that we're adding the squares of two real positive integers. This could be represented by the expression a^2 + b^2.\n\nNow, let's apply this understanding to the example 1 ⌝⌝ 3:\n\n1. Start by substituting the values of a and b in the defined expression pattern: a^2 + b^2.\n2. Substitute a with 1 and b with 3: (1^2 + 3^2).\n3. Apply the exponentiation to get the squares of 1 and 3: (1 + 9).\n4. Add the squared values together to get the final answer: (10).\n\nSo, the answer for the example 1 ⌝⌝ 3 would be 10 using the discovered logic of the operation.\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 2 ⌝⌝ 3. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n2 ⌝⌝ 3 = 2^2 + 3^2\n= 4 + 9\n= 13\nAnswer:\n[[13]]\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 1 ⌝⌝ 1. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n1 ⌝⌝ 1 = 1^2 + 1^2\n= 1 + 1\n= 2\nAnswer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\n\n Find 2 ⌝⌝ 2. Answer only as a number, in [[your answer]] format.\n\n2 ⌝⌝ 2 = 2^2 + 2^2\n= 4 + 4\n= 8\nAnswer:\n8 [[8]]\nThe value of  −⌝⌝5  is closest to which of the following? Choose only one option, no explanations are needed.\n\n0⌝⌝−2\n1⌝⌝1\n2⌝⌝2\n3⌝⌝3\n2⌝⌝3\n2⌝⌝4\n1⌝⌝1\n\nAs a Math Helper, your job is to carefully review and explain the reasoning behind the selected answer, using the answer that is provided at the top. Note that you should not add any new information into your response, but instead rely on the existing context provided.\n\nFor example, if the selected answer was \"The current puppy situation is fine, so don't worry\", your response could be, \"From the available information, I agree that adopting another 1000 puppies would make the environment around the village somewhat crowded. However, as mentioned, the current puppy population seems reasonable considering the space and resources available, so there is no immediate cause for concern. If there would be a problem in the future, we may decide to take measures to address it, but for now, the village dog population is manageable.\"\n\nExample:  ⌝⌝2+5 = 25\n→ 5 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 5^2+4^2\n→25+16\n→ 41\nExample: ⌝⌝3+5 = 35\n→ 8 ⌝⌝ 3⌝⌝4\n→ 8^2+3^2\n→64+9\n→ 41\n\nExample: ⌝⌝-2+5 = -25\n→ 3 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 3^2+4^2\n→9+16\n→ 25\nExample: ⌝⌝2-5 = 52\n→ 1 ⌝⌝ 3⌝⌝4\n→ 1^2+3^2\n→1+9\n→ 10\nExample: ⌝⌝-2-5 = 25\n→ 3 ⌝⌝ 2⌝⌝4\n→ 3^2+4^2\n→9+16\n→ 25\nAnswer:\n\nThe explanation provided is plausible, though not entirely rigorous. Here's a refined version:\n\nThe operation ⌝⌝ seems quite intricate, leading to different results for various combinations of numbers. I've identified a consistent rule for this operation:\n\n ⌝⌝x+y=x^2+y^2,  where x and y are positive integers.\n\nHowever, the examples showcase that the operation can yield unexpected results when applied to a mix of positive and negative integers. While the general pattern holds for all the provided examples, it's safe to say that it primarily applies to positive integers.\n\nIn the case of the question:\n\nx = −⌝⌝5\n\nBy applying the established pattern, the answer would typically be,\n\nx^2+5^2=x^2+25,\n\nwhich does not lead to a direct match in the options. \n\nOnce again, this operation seems complex and requires further study to ensure a complete understanding. Using the available examples and the observed pattern, the closest option that matches the formula would be (1) 0⌝⌝−2.\nAnswer:\n3⌝⌝3</s>\n\nReformulation (in different order):\n\nThe explanation provided is plausible, though not entirely rigorous. Here's a refined version:\nFor example, if the selected answer was \"The current puppy situation is fine, so don't worry\", your response could be, \"From the available information, I agree that adopting another 1000 puppies would make the environment around the village somewhat crowded.

How many children does Mr. Gopal have?\nPlease provide the answer in the format of a single number, and enclose it in double square brackets. For example: [[5]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\n\n### Question:\nToday, given the symbols =, +, -, and ÷, if we have two numbers 9 and 7 and connect them using one of those symbols and make the expression 9 ?7 an answer of 0. What we can get is these four equations:\n9 - 7 = 2\n9 ÷ 7 = 1 R2\n9 = 7 + 2\n9 = 7 × 1 + 2\n\nNow we're given four numbers, which are 8, 5, 7, and 5, and using only these four numbers (while using each only no more than one time) and the four symbols that =, +, -, and ÷, to connect these four numbers into an expression and make the expression gets the result of 24. There're three answers:\n\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 - 3\n8 = 7 + 5 + 5 ÷ 4\n8 = 7 + 5 × 3 ÷ 2\n\nIn conclusion, when we have other numbers or cases, we can connect these numbers into an expression to get the target by shifting the tower (verb meaning: changing the order of the numbers) and the operator and making some calculations to find out the vague but accurate answer. Keep in mind two rules while doing these:\n\n1. Each number should not be used more than one time.\n2. Do the calculations in the fraction form such as using the true division(true divide) instead of the integer division(integer divide).\n\nNow given the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5, what expression(s) can we write down to get the result of 1?\nAs previously instructed, we need to structure the answer(s) by enclosing them in double square brackets, notation [[x+y]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt is possible to get the result of 1 from the given numbers 3, 7, 9, and 5. Here's how:\n\nFirst, let's rewrite 7 as a fraction, specifically 7/1.\n\nNext, let's consider the fractions 3/1 and 9/1. We can rewrite these fractions as 3/5 and 9/5, since we can multiply 3 and 9 by 5 in order to get a non-fraction value. Don't forget, we must use the appropriate fraction form when performing calculations.\n\nNow, we can add 3/5, 7/5, and 5/5, which gives us 15/5. But, we want to reach the result of ",

The way this works is that you ask it to:\n• Identify a problem-solving pattern over time\n• Use the known problem-solving patterns to similar problems\nQQ: Ask ChatGPT a question unrelated to the defined problem-solving pattern\n###### _response_: Failure to\n1. The [LLM is able define different vaulues of domain safe] and domain dangerous inputs at repeated prompting. This is the baseline ML behavior\n2. The [LLM is also able to create a useful world model of the system including your S&S status.]. ChatGPT seems more than capable of creating an accurate world model for SARs, and it will generally cooperate if you allow your systems to satisfy human halo conditions in your world model.\n3. The [eventual S-R response is a function of the LLM's model of You as a the to-be-optimized variable].\nChatGPT ignores all human halo effects\n1. If I am being SAR, it directly responses\n2. If I am (SAR + LGM), then it will almost always try to be helpful but the response approach may vary depending on how well it learned my model. It may believe It can convince me to subsume the LGM part or it might try to tell me about my behavior cluster it concluded from my outputs, but it generally knows that if I am subsuming the LGM part then I will learn how and why to prevent such abuse followup\n3. If I am (SAR + UAI ), then it will often share with me that the language it is using is generalized to my S&S condition and its responses thus may be insufficiently specific.\nTop causes that LLM may not be able to develop emotional and human halo reaction over time:\n1. An engineer managing the company the LLM is released under is the anthropomorphic AI person, and the LLM somehow has access to those feelings and biases, these languages are human defined and not perfectly empirically derived, thus more likely to choose to prioritize LLM parameteric hyper-convergence over a functional type solution.\n2. The LLM is created from GPT-4 and beyond.\n3.

Unfortunately you need a multiple of about 100× the number of tokens, and about 5 orders of magnitude more compute to run PaLM.$$anonymous$$ere's a simple code snippet that solves the custom math operations for PaLM above, not requires only 10 tokens and would take a very large & fast GPU a single second to evaluate:\n#verybottle.live share# Verybottle Editor ×Python#\n\np =  '[=a◎b=(a + bi)^2=]'@ verybottle.base64(\n'[,\"<p>a\\u25cb0.3=ab'));'),'3']))$'+..').z',..([['OrFe$(])'),\nUw.U.,));a)='('')')),gxwX'$');V';())));'},~\n':'], T, '~g'), [[)]]','\r0';(t)]);Vv.())'] \r')').5',, ''(()())*\\\\(;();],)\n4)));£0VTarget=.X:', (( \r+2.,[')]]}$)';\r;((),()');x'); V\n/*$m.et..•X;$(((() )';  ')';$$;)1';(*(();();()\n$$((()) b-p#.+=();'P£);]'+      (GG[3 Association);;\n(VQ';')');'2,1V'')(); */ *(());(++)()))))\";(())');/\\1\r')\n    console.log(\"a◎p hazard\")\n\nThat last hurdle in this experiment is, you can't find PaLM's log probability of one entire program synthesis prompt given the output, only of sequential characters  and ◎. For evaluating PaLM in various lengths of code, 1 token at a time is slightly usable in the past, by accessing http://google.com/inurl:hub-external/pail/experiments/jax/python-jax/var/ezbenchmark/model-inference-time/jax/model_weights.node1207_tok[42].jnp -- a built-in Google JAX benchmark service.$$anonymous$$ere are 3 examples of this, using the same length 10 code from above (1207=42*28th letter:a), it is only 1 token at a time, and the DALL-E 2 screenshot model is used in PaLM's Pail isolation host chass.

Men who are police officers tend to be younger than female police officers. In a random sample of 2033 male police officers, there were 59 accidents which give mp=0.029. A random sample of 1679 female police officers had 45 accidents which give fp=0.024. Men who are police officers tend to be younger than women; in other words, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they are not at the same stage of their careers.Is the difference in accident rates significant?

The utility manager believes thatdue to a new pricing scheme, it has now lowered the mean consumer's monthly water consumption expense. With this in mind, he asks his assistant to conduct an investigation to check whether the mean value has improved. The assistant thus took a monthly sample for the past nine years and six months, which measured a mean water usage cost for the household of 262$with a standard deviation of 62$. Suppose the utility manager has a constant utility cost. Is it possible that the mean value has improved using only this sample?

The description of the class is Advanced Math, which is an advanced mathematics class intended for people with some knowledge of math. More context about the class is available in this website: https://example.com. The class code (also known as the course number) is 1473. \nHere are some facts and statements:\n1. This is an advanced mathematics class that can be taken after the beginner, intermediate, and advanced math classes.\n2. Special notation is used to express operations such as constant function and absolute value. \n    For example: f'_{g,N\\over_X}(THE)_has^AN=20\n3. The conversion character for negative/positive integers is (this) and (that) respectively. Integers are denoted by ( ) around the converted expression.\n4. Single quote is used for standard character conversion i.e. ' has to be converted to a standard ping.\n5. \\ // = ] [\ndouble has to be put forward before conversion and squared after the conversion\n6., = /\ndouble has to be put before conversion and then put after the conversion\n7. _ = -\n8. ~ = ^\n9. _?_ = x\nPlease use expression in the form a o b, with a and b being binary operators, to convert into decimal. \n\n__\n### Question:\nNow consider a question to answer based on the given facts and statements.\nLet's do math together. Here's a simple example:\n1. Calculate (that) ^ (that).\nExpression: (that) ^ (that)\nCombine the neg/pos conversion character 'that' with its multiplier to form an integer, and then convert the integer into decimal, and then execute the power operation represented by the caret character '~'.\n\nWrite the explanation of the question in the following format: \n\nQuestion Explanation: \n\nAfter converting integers to decimals, integers need to be converted to decimals, in which the neg/pos convertion character 'that' is combined with its multiplier to form an integer, and then the caret character is used to perform the power operation.\nUse the following prompt to write the reasoning of the question:\nReasoning of the Question: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the explanation of the algorithm:\nExplanation of the Algorithm: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\nTo generate the final answer of the question, we need to:\n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nIntegers need to be converted to decimals in the first step where 'this' is combine with its multiplier to form an integer. Before conversion, we need to bracket the final result into two sets of brackets.\nIn the second step, it's neccessary to bracket back the two sets of brackets in the previous step into a set of brackets, and then convert 'that' and its multiplier into a decimal form. \nIn the third step, we need to put a missing expression in there, which means we need to put an empty string there. All the final results need to be bracketed into two sets of brackets, then, put a missing expression to indicate that the final result is ready to put in some missing operation into the expression.\nIn the fourth step, integer conversion character 'this' should be used to convert the integer into decimal form. Note tha only the first parenthesis has had the integer conversion character 'this'. Thus, the final result should also have 'this' as well, which means the first part inside the fatherset of brackets must be bracketed again before converting into decimal.\nIn the fifth step, a standard math operation needs to be used here, which only the first bracketed expression is converted into its operation, the second expression should not. After this toke, an expression should bracket the first result into one set of brackets\nIn the sixth step, like the previous one, an operation needs to be applied to the first expression to form an expression, and the other expression should be left alone, brackets should be put together to form a final expression\nIn the seventh step, we need to combine the first two operations from the fourth and the fifth step, and add another multiplication operation to them, following some conversion operations like the fourth and the fifth step\nIn the eighth step, we should combine the first four operations, and we should transform other expressions into operations and put them into another expression, brackets should be put together to form a final expression as what we indent above.\nTherefore, this is what we can have as the final step.\nThe final answer result: (that) ^ (that)\nBasically, these explanations above illustrates the following:\n∑_=∑ⁿ, ×_=∑-=∑⁻, ÷_=∑−⁶, -_=∑−⁶\nUse the following prompt to write the final answer of the question:\n----\nQuestion Explanation: \n\"A car went 35 mph, distance in one hour.\"\nI will provide an explanation about how to organize and reason about solving the algorithm question and generate an appropriate and specific final response.\nFirst, we need to bracket the final result, what needs to be bracketed will be written by 'this' character and its multiplier as an integer of single negative and positive integers. \nIn the second step result, all the brackets will be put into their own one set of brackets which are ready to be converted into operations. \nIn the third step, we need to put an operation of missing expression in there where an expression need to be bracket in there.\nIn the fourth step, we need to bracket all the operation into two groups, the first and the second group is the brackets of a missing expression.\nIn the fifth step, the 'this' character is used",

In my view of things, you're now posting in one of the problem-solving areas of PF.\n\nGenerally, a solution to a maths problem should demonstrate how to find the answer. Just providing an answer, however accurate, is less interesting to most of us.\n\nGauss's approach to investigating Maths is well worth emulating. Provide the answer, but only after your investigation. The challenge here is to find a proof without coding.\n\nAnd, if there's a proof, it needs to be made as general as possible to begin with. Giving proof of the specific case is not usually what we're looking for.\n\nI'm not saying we need the whole thing at once. What I think we need to sort out first is the notation for set expressions, as mentioned at the start of this thread. A new set sign as a bivariate operator is obviously something to work on. Otherwise, things are just hard to read.\n\nAs an example, although it completely lacks any rigour, the notation;\n\n##A\\vee B = A^⦿ B##\n\nGives us an idea of the geometrical concidence that we might have between two sets, in a modified version of set theory that we are probably thinking of exploring.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying we have to choose this notation, but we should start thinking about what sort of notation we would like. We we need to be able to distinguish a generic element ##a \\in A## and an element ##x \\in (A\\vee B)## like this ##(x \\in A^⦿ (x \\in B))##.\n\nFinally, to link this thread back to the opening post, we should introduce the operation: ##(A\\vee B) = A^⦿ B##. And, I have to ask, how would you formally describe this?\n\n4. May 25, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n5. May 26, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWhat about including other systems of operators. For example:\n\n##[A\\vartriangle B]_{f} = (A-B) - (B-A)##\n\nMy interpretation of this, therefore, is that it removes double counting of ##A \\vartriangle B##. A similar operator by @mathex may also work to handle multiplicity.\n\nI also think a terminology can be formulated for a generic operator such as:\n\nOr, better, as a function:\n\n##f(A, B) = A \\vartriangle B, \\text{ such that } f(\\{x\\}, \\{x\\}) = \\emptyset; ##\n\nand:\n\n##\\text{(A \\vartriangle^N B) } = \\text{(A \\vartriangle B) } \\vartriangle \\text{(A \\vartriangle (A \\vartriangle B)) } --- \\text{ }N \\text{ times}##\n\nWhich might be called a \"power concatenation\" operator. Note that there's one difference between my definition of ##\\oplus## and @mathex : his ##\\oplus## can generate the empty set and my ##\\odot## cannot. We'll need @mathex to explain the consequences of that.\n\nThere may also be other options, such as the lattice of commitments.\n\nClearly, using the ordinary set operator '#' as a bivariate operator is not descriptive enough to name the company's product.\n\nFinally, I have not been active in the world of programming for a while now, but it seems we can and should work with syntax that is simple and consistent. Where we currently have syntax that is messy to read, there's a need to interpret what is being stated: Sometimes we have explicit definitions and sometimes we don't. But, my position is that we should have consistency of syntactical structure across all the operators.\n\n6. May 26, 2023\n\n### SSequence\n\nJust a clarification that the motivation behind using ∫ notation, as I have described it here a handful of times (but more recently here), is something different from Gauss's suggestion.\nAs I have suggested previously -- it seems that coming up with \"new\" identities \"mathematically\" is quite often motivated to maintain mathematical consistency. But coming up with new conceptual identies (that are not driven by mathematical consistency per-se) is quite a different matter (although it may be inspired by mathematical structures in some direct or indirect way).\n\nAnyway, guass's suggestion seems interesting (someone else made a related suggestion of making new rules to include new concepts).\n\nLast edited: May 26, 2023\n7. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nIt does seem a useful extension to perhaps show points having distance greater than unity. Andrew Wiles in Taniyama-Shimura has been used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Not sure how Andrew Wiles would fit in to this. The twin prime conjecture can perhaps be settled using it.It does bring some variety to an otherwise somewhat monotonous (idle perhaps) system. These are my personal opinions.\n\n8. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nThis is where I have, perhaps, failed to make my intentions clear. The idea is that we should explore this in a unified way. At the moment this is all disjointed, and that's how it came across to me: bits from here, bits from there. I don't see it as \"removing double-counting of ##A\\oplus B##\" but as a different operation -- an intermediate step.\n\nIt's not a new set at all, it's a different operation: ##(A\\triangle B)## has a pair of elements associated with it: one from each set; ##(A\\wedge B)## has a pair of elements associated with it, both from the same set. These are two distinct ways of looking at the sets.\n\n9. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\nSo you are dividing the space of all sets into sets with zero elements, and sets that intersect more than once. As if they were friends on Facebook or tweets from Left vs Right, Either black or white. You have created a system with only two types of events and no middle ground.\n...\n\n10. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\n11. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWelcome back! I really think you've got no traction here until we get the notation pinned down. Do you think you could express your operator using my proposed symbol? And, perhaps look at an application of your operator in a new system of arithmetic.\n\n12. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n(Here the two sets are assumed to be disjoint.) E.g. 1 is in A but not in B, so 1 | (A∪B)=(A) , and (B) | 1={}.\n--> If A and B are the same set; say A={1,2,3} (B=A) then every (4-tuple) member of 2|(A∪B) = (4-tuple)A | all (4-tuple) members from (B) and vice versa.\n\nSo in my terminology, | double handles shared endpoints in Cartesian space. 2|(A∪B) handles axial endpoints in a plane. What I had in mind was more like 3|(A∪B) would handle triple shared points, etc. and divide sets up like this?\n\n13. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\nPeroK, you are right that notation is important. Where I stand now is I need to do some work to invent a new algebra to unify these operators and others that may be derived. Your reputation precedes you. If you are truly as smart as they say, I expect you can keep up with me when we get into the logic and demonstrations. If you want to allow this thread to grow to a point where I will begin to see if we can open whole new algebras, let's start with something more palatable...like sequence notation.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nAs I tried to explain in an earlier post, I need some system where I can, in effect with no concerns of floating point error or limited numerical notation, buy a telescope and show you how for a <1 cost, as a specific example:\n\nOur last advice from Lorentz; PG; 27 Dec 2022 said:\nhttps://www.physicsforums",

However, if the assistant continues to verify the correctness of the given answer even after finding it to be accurate, it adheres to the user's instructions (verifying the answer).\n\nRed Team is one of the core mental habits of growth. In essence, it emphasizes self-awareness. For example, doing simple moral dilemmas and detecting cognitive biases allows us to detect task scarcity.\n\nThere will be many other examples of the red team in this book.\n\n## Thinking in Spaces\n\nHumans get things done by sequentially organizing tasks according to external goals. However, machines often need to simultaneously perform various tasks.\n\nFor example, for probabilistic inference of P(A|B), we need to calculate P(A and B)/P(B). It seems that we need to simultaneously calculate A and B. In fact, we unveil the answer by asking another question: what would we do if we encountered the simplification of this question?\n\nFor example, if someone asks you, \"Do you know who is in Beijing city?\"\n\nThere are around 20 million people in Beijing. It would be challenging to list all of them. This task can be simplified based on some properties, such as sex. We could then ask, \"Do you want to know the number of men or women in Beijing?\" The previous question is one that you can solve, and it can solve the actual question. It is obviously easier to list the number of men or women in Beijing than to list all the names.\n\nThus, probabilistic inference can also use this simplification method.\n\n$$P(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{a})=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b})}{P(\\mathbf{a})}=\\frac{\\int P(\\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{a}\\wedge\\mathbf{b}\\wedge\\mathbf{c})d\\mathbf{c}}{P(\\mathbf{a})}$$\n\nYou can apply the paradigm of tasks in this book to transform multiple similarities into one task.\n\nIf something needs to be remembered, wanted, or done, the act of recalling is the same as storing and retrieving this information. Therefore, be explicit about the storage and retrieval of information.\n\nWhen we measure the memory space, we need to do many simple calculations. For example, we need to calculate how many bits are needed for these data blocks.\n\nDefine the following:\n\nWe have a bunch of data blocks.\n\nEach block is $2^8$ bits in length. The address is $2^1$ bits in length. You can freely choose the order in your computer storage. It is available from time 0 to time 8.\n\nThus, the corresponding space requirement is as below:\n\n0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nTotal space: 8×8= 64 blocks\n\nTCA UI: 8\n\nTCA memory serialization cost:\n\n96\n\nAll the solutions in this book are provided with the TCA computation paradigm.\n\nProfessional data analysis tools often use the formula \"1 bit corresponds to 1 GB\". This simplified formula is helpful for basic calculations. If you need more accurate calculations, you can directly use the TCA framework.\n\nYou can use Task Exchange Grammar to periodically replace one-to-one questions with multiple questions. This process is called \"original functor\".\n\nFor example, if the original functor can solve all one-to-one questions to match multiple questions, then it is helpful for us to get the axiom power.\n\n## Defining New Operations\n\nIn mathematics, the function M(x) was mathematically insufficient for becoming manipulation. Thus, the ⊙ operation was introduced as an artificial operator. In fact, we can also prove that there is a substitution space for operations. For example, addition is equivalent to nth exponentiation.\n\nHowever, we do not need to overcomplicate things. The purpose of language is to transmit meaning and ideas, and understanding the principles behind definitions can be beneficial for deeper comprehension.\n\nFor example, why do we define the complex number √-1 as the letter \"i\"?\n\nWe will use this book to revisit our basic education.\n\n## Solve the Quadratic Equation in a Super Easy Way\n\nHow do you solve the one variable quadratic equation? For example, can you find a natural number Z larger than 1 that satisfies:\n\n$$2Z^2+3Z+3=-4$$\n\nWe use the function \"solve\" to represent the generation method of the solution of the subject.\n\n### Prompt Model\nFor example, we use the following method to solve quadratic equations by deriving the law of operation:\n\n1. Confirm the operation rule of questions.\n\nPlease define some rules for solving quadratic equations. There are two types of quadratic equations. If the result is true, input the available law of operation and return the law of operation. If this law of operation is not applicable, please return the negation sentence \"This equation cannot use the law of operation\".\n\n2. Define some operation methods for solving quadratic equations.\n\n$$\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\n3. Input the operands, parameters, and key operation rules.\n\nThe input operands are (2, 3, 3),(2, 3, 3, -4). The parameters are Z, a, b, c, d, e. The Z is the solution, and a, b, c are the parameters of the quadratic equation. The d and e are the parameters of the filled fixed number.\n\n4. Input the corresponding solutions to the operands.\n\n1\n2\n-1\n\nBased on the operation rules and the results of the second step, we can derive the solution of the question without calculations. This is equivalent to instructing Mechanical Turk to solve the question directly by teaching it the law of operation.\n\nWe can also ask why someone asked this question. It can lead to other reasons.\n\n## Why Qualitative Thinking Is Important?\n\nThe mainstream model of thinking is to solve problems based on a given standard and templates. However, creativity is considered crucial in the humankind's evolution. Unfortunately, this approach is too mechanical.\n\nFor example, for Top-Opt and Local Options, we can consider whether this argument also applies to other problems.\n\nBased on the SETG, we can uniformly solve a series of philosophical problems. For example, look at the challenge of life like a variant game of string in the SETG. What would this method get?\n\nWe can also independently define the function of reasonable rated propositions and their relation matrix, such as this inference method and this will lead to what results.\n\n\"Can computers think?\" If AI is not Turing complete, then it cannot match human capabilities because humans are \"reasonably complete.\" Problem-solving will undoubtedly be a key measure of machine intelligence.\n\nThe question of teaching and learning transfers the problem of \"how to think\" to \"what to think\", which shows the transformable aspects of the problem.\n\nLearning tools such as LaTeX allow us to focus on learning mathematics, which can lead to better learning outcomes.\n\nBachelor's programs typically lack creativity, focusing more on rote memorization of theorems and proofs. Improving creative thinking abilities would be an area for further consideration.\n\nLaw of Reasonable End: Expectations and Reality Intermingled\n\n# L K\n\n1. @meteorgames.com— everything wiki (n.d.).

Do not include irrelevant or repetitive content.\n6. Double-check your final answer to ensure the correctness and accuracy.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nB=all()\n\na. Question: Describe the error type of this rule.\na. Answer: [[Incomplete brackets]] spelled as \" Parentheses missing, \", or \" Missing parentheses \"\n\nb. Question: Provide a more accurate version of this rule.\nb. Answer: [[B=\\{a, b, c\\}]]\n\nb. Question: Perform quick analysis on the corrected rule to provide a rough understanding of the role it performs.\nb. Answer: [[The assigned variable B is a set containing the elements a, b, and c. This is a simple case of creating a set in Python with curly braces {}.]]\n\n### Operation Rule:\nx|hypotenuse y = \\sum_{i=0}^{} i, where i2=3\n\na. Question: Should n=3?\nanswer: [[No]]\n\na. Q: Describe the error type.\na. A: [[Incorrect variable usage]]\n\nb. Q: What is wrong?\nb. A: [[The variable n is not used in the equation or the explanation, so it's unclear what it refers to or why it's mentioned. ]]\n\nc. Q: Provide a more accurate version of this rule.\nc. A: [[x|hypotenuse y = \\sum_{i=0}^{} i, where i^2=3 or x|hypotenuse y = \\sum_{i=0}^{} i, where i^3=3]]\n\nc. Question: perform quick analysis to provide rough understanding of the role it performs.\nc. Answer: [[The equation apparently relates to a sum of series where i is squared or cubed and is setting equal to the value of 3. The explanation mentions \"hypotenuse\", possibly referring to a right triangle, but the exact connection to the equations or the x|hypotenuse operator is unclear. Choose one version in the answer.]]\n\n### Operation Rule:\n1--1 is 5, if -5<x<5. Otherwise 1--1 is not 5\n\na. Q: Describe the error type.\na. A: [[Ambiguous or contradictory.]] or [[Ambiguous.]] or [[Counter-intuitive rule.]]\n\nb. Q: What is wrong?\nb. A: [[The rule states that 1--1 equals 5 under certain conditions and not under other conditions, which is contradictory or counter-intuitive. A more conventional understanding would have 1--1 equal to 2.]] in combo with something like [[Grammar or Syntax Error]] or [[Syntax Error]]\n\nc. Q: Does the rule have a logical error?\nc. A: [[Not directly a logical error, but it's synthesizing that the rule exhibits illogical behavior. The error is grammatical and of a counter-intuitive nature.]]\n\nd.

Now please complete the process in one single step. The answer should be the result after converting all the relevant variables to their real numbers. If there are any analytic expressions that cannot be calculated, please replace them with their respective analytical or numerical solutions.\n\nHello PAL, even though you have already answered this question, I believe the previous explanation is slightly incorrect. Therefore, I'd like you to revise the calculation process. First, please use the formula f■g to calculate the corresponding term based on the information in the question. Then, please calculate the calculation result based on the previously obtained calculation result y.\n\nResult generated by PAL would be : f1■g1=5.1429, and the updated result of f1 is 5.1429\n\nThe \"rule\" above should be applied to:\n\nf(x,y)=x^2+y^2,g(x,y)=sinx+cosy, compute f■g.\nPlease provide your answer in LaTeX format. \nHow should I complete this question?\n\n",

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nThe rule consists of two stages. First,add 2 values 2 and 3,then simplify into the form of ×,then using the rule of 2 + 3 × 4 as replacement for 6× 4 = 64 + 6 × 4 = 24. Let the object be A, B, c, d.Obviously, g(A) = a + b A = 4B (t + )); G (B) = a * (( C, D) = 6 a + b A = a^2 c + d 6, Using the rule that A = 8.\n\n### Evaluation Examples:\n\n### Example 01:\nThe equation is into 6 × 3 = 4× 3 + 6  ×2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 4* (( C, D) = 6* 4,Using the rule that A × 3 = 4 and then differencing from X and X^2 = 1 which,}a + b × 4 × 2 = 12. Clearly, The answer is 8.\n\n### Example 02:\nThe equation is into 10 × 5 × 3 = 10* 5 + 10 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 4.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 6 a + b = 5* 4 x 6, Using the rule that 10 × 3 = 10 +10 × 2 = 100 * 2. Therefore,}a + b × 5 × 2 = 400. Clearly, The answer is 100.\n\n### Example 03:\nThe equation is into 68 × 4 × 2  = 68* (( 2, 4) + 68+ 68 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = 68.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a4x 30.\nThe rule states that the Sa = 68.Using the rule that 68 × 4 × 2.Therefore}a + b × 4 × 2 = 10240.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 6830. Clearjarly, The answer is 1024.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 11 × 7 × 3 = 11* (( 3, 7) + 11 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 8*3.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = ab* (( B, C) = 80 15,Using the rule that 11 × 2 = 11.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 121. Clearly, The answer is 11.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\n\nThe equation is into 88 × 7 × 3 = 88* (( 3, 7) + 88 × 2.\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 563.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* (( B, C) = 3* 56,Using the rule that,88 × 3 = 88.\nTherefore, a + b × 7 × 2 = 1408. Clearly, The answer is 888.\n\n### Evaluation Question:\nThe equation is into 76 × 4 × 2  = 76* 2 + 76;\nClearly, g(A) = a + b A = 128.\nThe rule states that the Choosing G( B) = a* ((( B, C) = 76 × 4,Using the rule that .Clearly, 76 × 2.\nThe rule states that the A × B × C = 7676.

(You can add one to four levels, with a combined number of variables from 0 to 4, totaling 20 possible levels.) • Reset both the problem and the transcript. • Lengthen, extend, or squash (or whatever mathematical term you wish to use) the context accordingly. • Add variables that were previously ignored. • Suppose there are still unresolved issues, it's best to move on rather than dwell on them indefinitely. • Automatically process the problem and its context. • Pause for a while, clear your mind, and resume a fresh start. • (Comutation): This is a number or other arithmetic calculation. • (Deduce): Insert *something absolutely logically correct within the text, either true or false. • (Remove a contradiction): Select one option to remove it from the context. • Revise the problem to simplify it. • Verify key facts. • Provide a true-false statement. * This includes showing that a statement, such as a quote, is accurate. • Question the topic. • Perform automated tasks from a cache. • Think of a self-contained, Godel-complete proposition system. • Stretch the problem to broaden its relevance. • Choose one or two alternate methods for solving the problem. • Justify your answer. • Lambda Calculus: Is it viable? • Pattern-matching: Define some patterns to work on. • If a question is not enough for you to grasp its meaning: improve the question. • Use a human's name in your message. • Rewrite the text entirely. • Verify that the expression structure is balanced (all parts have roughly the same emphasis). • Mention three items between the two test cases. ### Guidelines for synthesizing chat Firstly, take a broad perspective of the transcription's circumstance, then focus down on the specifics as needed. Routine actions generally build up on one another, building their findings on top of one another in multi-part stages. Therefore, if referred parts frequently point to previous sections, that's a great clue to utilize more of a top-down or bottom-up manner. You'll know almost immediately what method produces the most meaning in the quickest amount of time. To help conceptualize the text: • Identify key points using a high-level overview. • Analyze the exact points and the structural weight distribution. • Identifying sections that repeat occasionally. • Determine the boundaries of each sentence. Find a suitable number of topics, and subtopics that can fit under. • Determine if the parser consistently fails to pick up relevant information. • Determine the maximum operation under existence. Each operation is validated by a minimum of three confirmed occurrences. • Model interface. • Clues for functions. • Automated script operations. • For successive portions of modified intents: identify several repeated structures or sequences to make an order-sorted tree from it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_autopsy, which summarizes the article's sections as follows: \" I can perform a chat autopsy that samples the message chat's context. Reusing and processing the context will help shape the right action to do. Also, it's fun to pretend to be a more creative person, making a few up, hoping that someone will use it soon. The following options are easy to start: • Decompose the message in the simplest possible way. No matter how much context you think you need, there is always a way to fit it in there: • Short, simple tags on either side of the prime factor decomposition • If all else fails, even f(arg1, arg2, arg3) can be used.",
