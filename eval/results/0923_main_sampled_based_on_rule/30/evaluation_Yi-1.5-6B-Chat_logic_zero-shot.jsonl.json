Ensure the output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n   For (p>q)>r: (p & !q) | r\n   For p>(q>r): (!p | !q) | r\n\n4. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n   - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n   - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n\nSince we can't directly compare the two expressions without negation and equivalence, let's use the equivalence calculation rule (13):\n\n   ! ((p>q)>r) ::=:: !((p & !q) | r)\n                         ::=:: !(p & !q) & !r  (By Rule 6 & De Morgan's Law)\n                         ::=:: (!p | q) & !r  (By Rule 7 & De Morgan's Law)\n\n   ! (p>(q>r)) ::=:: !((!p | !q) | r)\n                           ::=:: !(!p | !q) & !r  (By Rule 6 & De Morgan's Law)\n                           ::=:: (p & q) & !r  (By Rule 7 & De Morgan's Law)\n\n5. Truth Value Judgment:\n   Assume the statements are true:\n   - Person A: (p>q)>r is true.\n   - Person B: p>(q>r) is true.\n\nCombine their truth values to write the final logical expression:\n   ((p>q)>r) & (p>(q>r))\n\nApply the given basic equivalences or reasoning patterns to derive and judge the truth of the expression:\n   ((p & !q) | r) & ((!p | !q) | r)\n\nSince (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are either both true or both false, they are equivalent.

True if the input is 0 (false), and false if the input is 1 (true).\n- **Disjunction (∨):** Means \"OR\". True if at least one of the inputs is 1 (true).\n\nThe expression can be simplified to highlight the cases that result in the output being \"-\" (False or 0). The expression can be read as follows:\n\n- \"((p AND q AND NOT r) OR (NOT p AND q) OR (p OR r))\"\n- This means the output will be \"-\" if:\n  1. (p AND q AND NOT r) is True.\n  2.

This occurs under the following conditions:\n\n- When (p AND q AND NOT r) and (p OR r) are both False, but (NOT p AND q) can be True (since if this part is True, it will override the condition that the output should be False).\n\nTo satisfy the conditions with multiple inputs that result in the output being \"-\":\n\n1. (p, q, r) = (0, 0, 1) -> Here, p is False, q is False, r is True, and hence, NOT r is True, making the (p AND q AND NOT r) True. However, p OR r is also True, not False, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n2. (p, q, r) = (0, 1, 0) -> Here, p is False, q is True, r is False, and both (p AND q AND NOT r) is False (as NOT r is True) and (p OR r) is False (as both p and r are False).
