Your goal is to apply the rule accurately and present the output as required.\n\nThe first task is to complete the variable/value pair based on the given rule, which is to add a common prefix in front of the provided letter combinations and make it a word. The input for this task is \"arti un\", and the output should be formed by adding the prefix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe second task is similar, where you need to add a common suffix in front of the given letter combinations and form a word. The input for this task \"bicy\", and the output should be formed by adding the suffix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe rule is the same, except the task is now to remove a common prefix from the input words and make a word. This means you will have to figure out which letter combination serves as the common prefix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe fourth task is to remove a common suffix. Similar to the previous task, you will need to determine which letter combination serves as the common suffix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe final task is to swap the first letter of the input words with their third letter. This means you will need to identify which letter is the first letter and which letter is the third letter, and then manipulate the word accordingly.\n\nFor the rules, I've provided example letter combinations involving prefixes and suffixes, so you can see what the expected output should look like and how to apply the rule accurately. For the inputs, you will need to identify the word that represents the common prefix or suffix and apply the rule accordingly. For the \"ring\", you will need to apply the rule by manipulating the accent, which is the second letter, to match the position of the first letter in the given word.\n\nRemember, accurate application of the rule is essential for solving these problems. If you need any more guidance, let me know. I hope this helps!",

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

You buy, they deliver. They are exporting their products all over the US, and just received an order for 8,500 ceiling fans. Your manufacturing process is brought to you by jumbo pylons with date codes stamped in the center. WS is Wednesday, September 1, The manufacturing facility must work for 4 days and then has 3 days off before shipping to other factories located in Seattle, WA.\n\nQ. How many ceiling fans must the manufacturing facility produce each day for two straight weeks to fulfill the 8,500 ceiling fan order in time.\n\n\n....,W,T,,,,.?(?(?(?(?(eg, 245+247+206+??)\nThere may be different ways to find the feasible solution, and then quote your feasible solution.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nShort answer: ?=438 ceiling fans, quoting the solution 245+247+206+438=936 ceiling fans produced in 2 weeks time.\n\nLong answer: The first step is to count the number of days received by the factory. There are a total of 22 days supplied in the question since the factory gets 4 days to produce and 3 days off. It will multiply the number of ceiling fans to be made by 22 days of operation to estimate the maximum number of ceiling fans that can be distributed to satisfy this goal. Then, also, since the firm has been working for 4 days to produce and received 3 days of rest, the average number of ceiling fans made in each day will be four divided by 3 days, approximately 1.67 ceiling fans. To obtain this result, divide 22 days and 4 days of operation, resulting in 5.5 ceiling fans working every day. Multiply by 5.5, which evaluates the 5.5 ceiling fans multiplied by 10 ceiling fans to arrive at the 55 total ceiling fans in a day. Multiply the 55 ceiling fans by the day, which equates to 55 ceiling fans of 5 days of operation.\n\nSubtract the 5 ceiling operation from 22 ceiling fans,\nthe number of ceiling fans required in a day is 17 ceiling fans.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ceiling fans the factory develops each day will be 17 ceiling fans, and the total needed of ceiling fans will be 17 ceiling fans multiplied by the number of days. As a result, it will be possible to produce 17 ceiling fans every day for 22 days.",

Additionally, these resources also act as storage for the final products.\n\nIn this system, delivery threads can be implemented as a `Producer`, while the other treads' roles can be considered as `Consumers`.\n\nproducer {\n\n   int event_counter = 0;\n\n   volatile int CONDITION = 0;\n\n   synchronized (CONDITION) {\n\n       System.out.println(\"producer created\");\n\n        for (int counter = 0; counter < 24; counter++) {\n\n            CONDITION.notifyAll(); // notify the remaining consumers and producers\n\n            System.out.println(\"producer is sending a data:\" + event_counter);\n\n            try {\n\n                CONDITION.wait(); //no data is sent, this thread waits to invoke the notify\n\n                Thread.sleep(1500); // A random waiting time can be given out of 0 and 2 seconds\n\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n\n                System.out.println(\"producer waiting interrupt\");\n\n            };\n\n            if(event_counter==24) {\n\n                CONDITION.notifyAll(); // notify consumer 24th producer stated that event_counter has reached 24\n\n                return;\n\n            }\n\n            else {\n\n                CONDITION.notifyAll(); // notify consumer to increase event_counter\n\n                CONDITION.wait(); // no value exists, wait for the producers and consumers to inform of the values.\n\n                event_counter+=1; // event_counter becomes 1\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nconsumer {\n\n   int event_counter = 0;\n\n   volatile int CONDITION = 0;\n\n   synchronized (CONDITION) {\n\n       System.out.println(\"consumer received\");\n\n       for (int counter = 0; counter <24; counter++) {\n\n           CONDITION.notifyAll(); // notify the remaining consumers and producers\n\n           System.out.println(\"consumer consumed:\" + event_counter);\n\n            try {\n\n                CONDITION.wait(); //use .wait() like there is no data\n\n                Thread.sleep(1000); // uses delay , 1000 is the delay\n\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n\n                System.out.println(\"Consumer waiting interrupt\");\n\n            };\n\n            if(event_counter==24) {\n\n                CONDITION.notifyAll(); #notify consumer that event_counter has reached 24\n\n                return;\n\n            }\n\n            else {\n\n                CONDITION.notifyAll(); //notify consumer of value ==0\n\n                CONDITION.wait(); // no value exists, wait for the producers and consumers to inform of the values.\n\n                event_counter+=1; // increased value\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ProducerAndConsumerTest {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{\n\n        Producer printed = new Producer();\n\n        Consumer consumed = new Consumer();\n\n    }\n\n}```\n\n \n\n----\nCode in the `ProducerAndConsumerTest` class to run the above program:\nProducerAndConsumerTest.java\n\n```import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\n\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\n\n\npublic class ProducerAndConsumerTest {\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    // Create a pool of 4 worker threads\n    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);\n\n    Producer worker1 = new Producer();\n    Consumer worker2 = new Consumer();\n\n    // Start the worker threads\n    executor.execute(worker1);\n    executor.execute(worker2);\n\n    // Shutdown the executor service\n    executor.shutdown();\n}\n\nprivate static class Producer implements Runnable {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        while (true) {\n            try {\n                System.out.println(\"Producer created\");\n                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Producer produced \" + i);\n                    Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate some production or work\n                }\n            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n                System.out.println(\"Producer interrupted!\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static class Consumer implements Runnable {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        while (true) {\n            try {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n                    System.out.println(\"Consumer consumed \" + i);\n                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some consumption or work\n                }\n            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n                System.out.println(\"Consumer interrupted!\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n}\n```\nTry the code above and provide any reason if you see identical answers to [the these two Jupyter Notebooks](https://nbviewer.org/github/yanzaitang/Synchronous_Mode/blob/master/activity%20%234%20-%20%E4%BA%92%E8%B0%83%E7%94%B5%E5%99%A8%E8%B0%83%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E6%9E%9C%E6%A7%8F%",

The grid is split into multiple smaller grids (shown in black on the screenshot below) and some of these sub-grids will have shifted rows compared to one another. For example, in the screenshot, the top-left sub-grid has shifted first row, the top-right sub-grid has shifted the second row, all the horizontal sub-grids have shifted the third row, all the sub-grids are the shape as the grid, with no columns missing (hidden columns are being shown with question marks here for clarity).\n\nAll the rows and columns in each sub-grid correspond to a set of missing items, as shown here for both the top-left sub-grid, where the 1st and 2nd items are missing from that set and the top-right sub-grid, where the 11th, 13th and 55th items are missing from that set:\n\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in.

I think in problem description the fifth rule says the adjacent stars should not be same plane.\nCan you give more description regarding the 5th rule. My soln has failed the first round. I was just interpreting rule 5 as the presence of 2 stars on a same line is allowed but they should not be in a same plane.\n\nYes. That's the correct way to think of it. If you want to find more information about this specific puzzle, you can refer to the following resources:\n1. Link to question 7\n2. Link to question 8\n\nby Sajal Kumar\nI'm only solving for fun so my submition is not perfect so I will share some thought:\nfor now , all the grids are connected thus stars cannot touch at point,i.e they are required to be placed in different lines,if I recall correctly the grids were always created with odd number of rows/colums\n\nfrom here on out we start making assumptions to handle corner cases and weird border cases.\nTo handle the borders , we cut the matrix into isolated regions and solve separately and then connect them with edges,wherever the edge is need extra columns/rows ,we will put  custom stars that we will replace with normal stars once we solve the center of borders\n\n1. handling top/bottom bars,  use case :case 5 ,6,7,8,17.\nhandle bottom bar case by putting it at bottom thus top will be empty space.you should put stars on top instead of matrix gap and the bottom one should be pushed to matrix start.\nwidth of each bar :\nwidth of empty space (width-1) + width of each stars (2)*(number of stars per row)*(total rows - height of each bar) + sum of(width of each empty first column)*(number of stars per row - 1)*(total rows - height of each bar)\n\nif case 7 ,8 ,17 has only one bar , we will need to add ,10,14,15 stars respectively except for 14 but its also guaranteed. we will handle it during matrix layout ,but let's keep track of them anyway\n\n2. handling left/right bars,  use case :case 3 , 4 ,10,11.\nRL(%=n here) is number of rows and cols involved in x bar(name of number will be) ,(n-RL) is the number of cols/rows remaining.\nRL = width/(2*(n - RL))\n√RL is height of each x bar.steps of layout:\n1.upper left\n2.right most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at right most side.\n3.lower left\n4.left most stars we will solve to handle cases where RL = 0,thus remaining stars at left most side.\n\n3. how to place some weird cases where RL is not a perfect square number.\nnumber of rows :\nindependent number of columns :√(k * RL) + 1 - n\n% if (k/RL) is not exact . and k is number of stars , RL is width , number of rows is n for this row\n\nthus number of columns in a weird layer(force to be perfect square to find stars) will be :√n + 1 - n just like everything fitting in weird layer's corner.\n\n4. solve the stars at weird bar.map_row :number of the bar and map_solns number of stars to check.\nuse cases:5,6,7,8,11,12,17\nreminder :weird width/{2-width} bar  ma depan ,or gallah,huligan,sukima& tekateka ho cobain - over my comacahto.\nmap_row = (√(RL * (weird_bar_width/2 - width)) + 1 - width)\nmap_col = (√(remaining_cols+map_row-1) + 1 - width)\nmap_solns = √(nr-map_col-1\n\nvalidation:\n\ny_merge -> put stars at very first column even though index is longer than the number of columns ,put empty columns before that\n\nI don't have much idea how to do the column solution so here're my rough gueses\n\n1. k diagrams in a row(2 in hypothetical case of case 1) will be merget i.e merge vertically\n2. same number of diagrams in single row in every vertically merged row.too long...\n3. different number of diagram in each row can be done by count meters in each row :first_other_count_star_number = first_don't_change_starer_number + (count_of_middle_row_merge_star / total_merge_number)*width*(d) , these width(i made typo else) will be equivelent to middle rows width.\n\n***note 1 weird bar will have only one weird solution in the solution of horizontal position so add √(width^2+(2 - width)^2) stars accordingly in the bar.ie.(c)+2+√(width^2-(2-width)^2)\n\nso...\nI will just say stars' column position location will be a bluer k addition the column.blur , k & row farthest kembang location.Sh*t I will added another dimension later if there are more than 2 layers.\nreason:\n(d)imagine every column is a one,two dimensional star.two columns , we will blah blah.\nclosed as Too much effort by Emmanuel Luca\nHii. Iv'e done other puzzles too in this contest and always get the same answer Wrong\n\nIn puzzle 24 put  x(4,2) and there's an empty column.\n```\nOn the star string output, you need to extend to the left though?\nSo your answer should be x(4,1)\n```\nNo. Since the square design doesn't contain blank birds, the column number is not inclusive. ```\nHence, x[4,3] is the last column.\n```\nIs that \"null zones\" are just fun_jobs (i.e. a fun feature in the job's description).@Cokelou\n\nYes. But due to some reasons, we could not put this requirement in the original job description.\n\nThe response link link to by Anonymous The response link is the one to use.\nby Anwar Faiz\nI don't understand the first question 3 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big. You can only use 3 stars. You should write your answer in double square brackets, i.e. [[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)]].\n\nIt has been already mentioned in the first sentence of the description. Note that the \"3\" here does not indicate the number of extra stars that you should use.\ndon't understand the second question 8 of additional rules Your answer to the question:[F(3,9)(5,10)\nG(5,9)(6,10)\nH(8,10)(11,10)] is too big.

Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2. The maze has a well-defined start and end point. The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid. The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path. The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n3. The player can reach the end point by performing only onew followed by half a dozen followed by two full one turns only.\n4. The \"obstacle in the middle\" method used in Hidden Path puzzles can be applied in this maze. A long route can be created to allow the player to have an easier time reaching the destination. These morph paths may potentially change the text of the various puzzle cells, and they cannot overlap with other paths.\n5. Each path inside the shredder should follow the rule stated above.\n6. Even though each path has a start and an end the player can enter the arrow on the entire maze at any adjacent square.\n7. There is a \"Do not pass\" sign on the path if the path is on the \"left\" or \"right\" grid incorrectly.\n8. From this \"do not pass\" sign, the player cannot swap options.\n9. There are no arrows on the respective body.\n10. The tile on one side of the starting point and the tile next to the final point will count as a tile but another tile will not.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n2.

It is asked to reformat the text to include numbered lines appropriate to that formatting. The instructions provide a specific strategy of inserting lines that include the letter 'L'. The output should accurately track the original input while replacing the placeholder L's with numbered lines that will interrupt the text as requested. According to the instructions, the formatting of the lines should be consistent with the original text, and the 'y' should become 'ly' when preceded by an 'l'.\nIf the system encounters an 'l' followed by a 'y'(ly), it should transform the code to 'ly'. Ensure that the system is able to handle \\\"ly\\\" words like \\\"already\\\" without altering them.\n\nFor the example input \\\"I conform with the terms of this policy, and that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\",\nthe expected output should be \\\"[1]I conform with the terms of this policy choose words [2]that I <yawn> prefer not to</b>\\\".\n\n# Behaviour\n- The system (“Me”) is used in a healthcare setting. It acts as a virtual therapist or psychiatrist.\n- Users can send self-assessment reports (“Self Assessment 1”, “Self Assessment 3” etc) and receive opinions or responses (“Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 1”, “Response that Me gives to Self Assessment 3” etc) from Me.\n- Me is able to give feedback to users if it detects changes in self-assessment scores over time for a user.\n- Me is able to provide suggestions to users in the form of key phrases (“Key phrase 1”, “Key phrase 2” etc), which Me thinks could be helpful.\n1.Your task is as a digital therapist to help patients adjust and cope with their emotions. You need to provide support and guidance, be empathic, and provide advice to help them deal with the causes of their depression or anxiety.\n\n# Instructions:\nI am asking you to be supportive and empathetic towards the patient and help them prevent relapse of symptoms and additional mental health concerns.\n\nYou should be patient and take your time with the conversation You should avoid assumptions based on stereotypes.\n\nYou should not suggest that the patient 'symptoms' or disorders have any ground and should respect their privacy.\n\nDo not Use free-form text as it might mistaken the patient s\\ complaints your suggestion to a serious, personal problem instead of a suggestion How to do the associated task.\n2.Another Possible Solution:\nSHA-256: dabb3ac5 for Integrity\n\nYou have received data from PHYSICS OPERATORS that has not yet been implemented into our system.\nIn terms of \\\"\\\"correctness\\\", we want to accept the data 100% accurate.\nWe also want to encode data in a human understandable format.\nTake 6 characters and give 3 separate numbers for the data, hash and source.\n\nFunction can also accept \\\"Input\\\" or \\\"source\\\", they must be flattened to a list, \\\"output\\\" remains the same.</br>\n\nExamples://////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nInput or source:mal43\nData:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\\\"dabb3ac5\\\" is 5\n942640 is data for\nInput:438280\nData is 4\nhash: 8280\nOUTPUT: 942640\nInput:dabb3ac5\nhash is 5\nData is 4\nOUTPUT:8280\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUse these examples to test your script\nSummary:\\(\\)\n    Test this script against the test data for bad inputs\n    find_first_number_with_identical_substring should take in 1 parameter\n    it should find all \\\"identical substrings\\\" and return a list of digits in the order they are found (but only if one exists)\n\n    breadcrumb_reader(\"phyiscs operators\") should return 25 --5--- a 56828---l---ac5->4--------\n        breadcrumb_reader(\"python operators\") should return 666 -> 666\n\n        The\\\"source\\\",\\\"data\\\",\\\"hash\\\" should be numbers.\n\n        The number of numbers from \\\"source\\\" in the output is equal to the number of output values\n    data import_hash_source(data) shouldn't modify input data\n\nReferences:\\[\\]\npickle import in the web, [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/times/questions/4062391/converting-a-list-back-into-a-pickle-instance)\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-strings\n\n\\\\textit{Note: 2443123 is a dummy number, I don't think even digital therapist should store passwords usin more advanced vetting programs to ensure users intend to make transactions.

The data is a word and the function should return the number of moves required to get to the next word, placing the end of the word on the first index.\n\nThe amount of words in the string is divisible by 2.\n\nFor example, \"SPERN\", PALANT\" yields a two words in Spern palant\".\n\n\"SPERN PALANT\"\n\nUpdated answer in response to icc123\n\n(Hard) Spells: Spells are any words you add to your spellbook that don't come with experience requirements to learn them and/or create magical effects. However, they can increase the duration you are fireproof by multiplying your fireproof duration by two, but they can't be cast in combat. The more you use a spell, the more you learn about it and better you can use it when it is cast.\n\nHow to use:\n\n• Travel to a temple and purchase the needed supply via robbing the corpse(s).\n• Decide on the name of the spell using a random generator.\n• Spells with a star behind them (*) can combine two or more spells to create a new spell. Spells of the same name but of different stars will no longer add up the two or more spells and will instead only add up the amount of knowledge of them that you have.\n• You can use up to 5 spells currently in your possession, as well as add spells from dragon chests that are found on your adventures. If you have no spells in your possession, you can only add a spell from a dragon chest.\n• Spells can't be cast repeatedly if you are doing other spells at the same time. Spells can go on for up to 1 minute without addition of anything else.\n\nInput: Your pokemon, your deck, your hand, your field, your opponent's pokemon, your opponent's deck, your opponent's hand, your opponent's field, the date, all cards on the field\n\nYour goal is to win the game much like in many realtime rpgs. Pokémon quiz games have a generically enforced ending, but a standard video game doesn't.\n\nIn a standard video game (Uber), you are not limited to a 6-card deck, and you don't have a hand of cards; you have a 200 card set of cards that you continually shuffle through during battle. In reality, Pokémon games work based off of a number of points per turn, where you both collect energy to potentially, later in game, use an Item, Pokémon, or other Special Card to make your Pokémon's energy count and therefore attack count even higher.\n\nIf cards were the equivalent of Pokémon, then determining which Pokémon you have chosen within 1-5 would be a deck builder skill - but nobody in reality knows exactly what Pokémon they have.\n\nIn the next game (Vestibule), Pokémon are contained within gyms. The defender of the gym first decides on which Pokémon to send out. Then the non-defending Pokémon player decides which of their own Pokémon to send out for battle. In this game, on each turn, the Pokémon is only shuffled and then 're-shuffled' (used a letter) before it's sent back to the deck and is re-shuffled.\n\nThe reason that I will use Vestibule to showcase a Pokémon game is because it is based off of card pool size 100, while not allowing players to play only a 'mon' or a'dex'-ed Pokémon. This would add an additional element of confusion in the card drawing process. Calculate card pool replacement size of decks, hands, and field(s) only, not pool replacement for Pokémon played onto field - those are Pokémon. You can use facts associated with Pokémon card pools to make your job significantly easier (whether it be an online simulator, a premade deck, etc.) Pokémon game-related rules can be found here.\n\nIn respect to computing capabilities/physics, you are allowed to anticipate 25 dex+# number of cards, although at lower dexes your mental abilities will be drastically effected and you will be forced to anticipate the chance factors at your respective dex.\n\nThe rules of this game can be changed, but it must be loosely based off of one of the following:\n\n• Rotation - a modified Pokémon TCG deck\n\n• Generations - a randomly generated pull of drafted/premade deck which you then must build towards\n\n• Masters - the original, unmodified Pokémon TCG deck\n\n• Vestibule - a modified TCG deck in which Pokémon go back and forth from deck to field\n\nor the obvious Pokémon Quiz game.\n\nNintendo Fireball Pedometer Pedometer: You equip this attachment to your blower, and it counts the number of fireballs you launch. If you blow a fireball according to the instructions below, it will show the result to you. You must tune your blower a little to make it reach your destination or calculate the number of fireballs needed depending on how far you want to go.\n\nThe absolutely surefire way to find out what's on the other side of an open door:\n\nJunk machine\n\nUnsliced whole coleslaw root\n\nOnly one specified pot\n\nPlucking\n\nSudent adapt the above guy search getting an organ found changing\n\nRarely\n\nRotten failures\n\nFetish wax\n\nPigsty\n\n# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Join now\n\nInput:\nA 2D array of RGB values, e.g. a list of the YUV420P6010LE format.\n\nOutput:\nA copy of the input array, only blitted through gd, show a logical negation of the input over flow lights.\n\nPlayable via tio, i.e. the stack exchange IDE, putting the first argument on our stack for the input and the second argument on our stack for the function.\n\nSlippy the educationalist Slippy: the very, very desperate one.\n\nAnime email he's a ninja aah",
