        "response": "First, let's break down the question and apply the operation rule step by step.\n\nGiven is the expression 25 ※X※14 equals 4, and we need to find the value of X that satisfies this equation.\n\n1. **Initial Check**: The operation rule states that if a (in this case, 25) is a multiple of b (in this case, 14), then 25 ※X = 25/X + 2. However, 25 is not a multiple of 14, so we move to the next condition.\n\n2. **Second Check**: The operation rule also states that if b (in this case, 14) is a multiple of a (in this case, 25), then 14 ※X = 14/X + 2. Similarly, 14 is not a multiple of 25, so we do not meet any of the division criteria.\n\n3. **Default Case**: Since neither 25 nor 14 divides the other perfectly, according to the rule, the operation 25 ※X ※14 should equal 24, not 4, unless the operation's application here involves a specific sequence or interpretation not clearly outlined in the standard left-to-right or left-to-right evaluation rules. However, following the straightforward application of the given operation rule:\n\n   - If we parse it as (25 ※X) ※14, and we assume that 25 ※X must equal 4 to satisfy the entire expression, we would then look for X such that:\n     - If 25 is a multiple of X (contrary to initial conditions, this step is speculative due to the direct contrast with the operation's criteria but follows the formatting given in the question), then 25 ※X = 25/X + 2 = 4. Solving for X in this speculative scenario would not yield an integer solution, as it would require X to be a factor of 25 that, when paired with 25 to give 20 when added by 2, does not naturally occur with integer X.\n\n   - If we consider the operation in a strictly sequential and possibly misunderstood application given the question's framing, which suggests a direct equivalence to 4 without accounting for the operation's inherent value of 24 under normal circumstances, we're essentially looking for a deviation from the operation's standard rules.\n\nGiven the strict application of the operation rule and the question's format, there's a conceptual mismatch in directly equating 25 ※X ※14 to 4 based on the provided operation. The operation rule, when followed accurately for the given integers and the sequence of operations as presented, does not yield a solution that directly accounts for the entire expression equalling 4 under the standard interpretation.\n\nHowever, the question's structure and the hint at a sequence (25 ※X※14) suggest an exploration beyond the straightforward application of the operation rule. In a strictly academic or puzzle context, one might infer:\n\n- If we treat \"※X※\" as a unit that, when applied to 14, equates the entire sequence to 4, we're in a speculative realm where the operation's standard sequencing or interpretation is not directly applicable.\n\nTherefore, based on a strict adherence to the operation rule and the question's framing:\n\n**Answer**: There is a conceptual issue in directly applying the operation rule to equate 25 ※X※14 to 4 under normal circumstances, suggesting a misunderstanding or a puzzle element not directly solvable by following the given operation's standard calculation for each step. The question's structure and the expectation of 4 as the result when applying an operation that inherently resolves to 24 in both divisible scenarios, without modifications or additional rules not outlined, doesn't align with the standard operation rule provided.\n\n**Speculative Interpretation (acknowledging the gap in the question's direct application):** If we consider the operation in a creative or puzzle context, the answer would be a speculative \"[[No Standard Solution]]\" due to the question's framing suggesting a departure from the standard operation rule's application rather than a direct numerical solution for X.\n\nIn a strictly educational context adhering to the given operation rule and the question's initial intention, the answer is \"[[Incorrect Application or Misunderstanding]]\" until a clarification or additional rule that allows X to satisfy the entire expression under the provided operation rule is provided.",

So, for 3 ￠ 3, we have:\n\n3 ￠ 3 = log_3(3) + log_3(3) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n2 ￠ X = 5 / 2\n\nUsing the operation rule again, we have:\n\n2 ￠ X = log_X(2) + log_2(X) = 5 / 2\n\nLet's solve for X:\n\nlog_X(2) + log_2(X) = 5 / 2\n\nWe can combine the two logarithms:\n\nlog_X(2) + 1/log_X(2) = 5 / 2\n\nLet y = log_X(2), then the equation becomes:\n\ny + 1/y = 5 / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by y to get rid of the fraction:\n\ny^2 + 1 = (5/2)y\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\ny^2 - (5/2)y + 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ay^2 + by + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -5/2, and c = 1. We can solve for y using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ny = [5/2 ± sqrt((5/2)^2 - 4*1*1)] / 2\n\ny = [5/2 ± sqrt(25/4 - 4)] / 2\n\ny = [5/2 ± sqrt(25 - 16) / 4] / 2\n\ny = [5/2 ± sqrt(9/4)] / 2\n\ny = [5/2 ± 3/2] / 2\n\nSince y = log_X(2), we have two possible values for y:\n\ny1 = (5/2 + 3/2) / 2 = 4/2 = 2\ny2 = (5/2 - 3/2) / 2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nNow, we find the corresponding values for X:\n\nlog_X(2) = 2\nX^2 = 2\nX = sqrt(2)\n\nand\n\nlog_X(2) = 1\nX^1 = 2\nX = 2\n\nSince X must be a positive integer, we discard X = sqrt(2) and choose X = 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of X is 2.\n\nDouble square brackets: [[2]]",

According to the rule, for 1¥X:\n\n1¥X = 1^X - X^1\n\nSince the operation involves 1 raised to the power of X minus X raised to the power of 1, and we know that 1 raised to any power is still 1, the equation simplifies to:\n\n1¥X = 1 - X\n\nNow, we are given that 1¥X = -3, so we can set up the equation:\n\n1 - X = -3\n\nTo solve for X, we isolate X on one side of the equation:\n\nX = 1 - (-3)\nX = 1 + 3\nX = 4\n\nTherefore, the value of X is 4.\n\nDouble-checking the answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately:\n\n1¥4 = 1^4 - 4^1\n1¥4 = 1 - 4\n1¥4 = -3\n\nThe answer follows the rule accurately.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n[[4]]",
