If yes, output 0; if no, output 1.\nObservation: Given a logical predicate, it is possible to retrieve its corresponding set by defining the set as the set of all elements that satisfy the logical predicate.\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks. The first prompt is the same as the syntax prompt, but you operate in a role called textual summarizer, where you must answer the question. The question will be a proof problem involving deductive reasoning. Your task is to prove or disprove the existence of a conclusion using deductive reasoning. For more information about the syntax prompt, refer to the following question:\"\"\"\n\n    def get_i_o_log(self,i_o,problem, model_name, model_dir, question_and_observation):\n        return i_o\n        #problem_and_observation_prompt = f\"\"\n        #predicate_name = ----\n        #loggers = []\n        #act = None\n        #logger = logging.getLogger(predicate_name)\n        #logger.handlers = loggers\n        #logger.propagate = True\n        #logger.setLevel(getattr(logging,level))\n        #a, b, c = load_tests() \n        #a(logger, model_name)\n        #b(logger, model_name)\n        #c(logger, model_name)\n        #logger.debug(\"{}\".format...\n        #logger.debug\n        #print(logger.handlers)\n\n\n",

When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the obtained rules and format.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nStatement Molecular Propositions:\nMolecular statements or compounds of declared statements assert the existence of a certain relationship within a collection of objects. Specifically, the statement that its relationship is either universal or particular, and that the relationship is either an affirmative or negative.\n\nAssume an object is A,X,B,Y,C, etc. If a contained object X in the A group has a certain relation Q and contains a certain property P with Y, a connection C is connected, resulting in the proposition of molecular statements.\n\nThe four basic types are as follows:\n- Universal Affirmative Molecular Statement (UMAS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q and possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as APB, also known as Affirmative Molecular Statement (AMS), abbreviated as AMA.\n- Universal Negative Molecular Statement (UNS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q but do not possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as ASPB, also known as Negative Molecular Statement (NMS, Number), abbreviated as ANM.\n- Particular Affirmative Molecular Statement (PNS): Some A and X in the A group have the relationship Q with B and Y in the whole B group, share the state-related property P, and asserted.\n- Particular Negative Molecular Statement (PSM): Some A and X in the group A have the relationship Q, but they do not share the state property P with B and Y in the group B.\n\n### For example:\n- All A and B are composed of C and H.\n- Every earthly object is made from atoms.\n\nRefer to the above example on how to conduct a philosophical analysis.\n\n### Question:\nAnalyze the following statement.\n\"All adults over 25 years old have a university degree.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[+/Men/University]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Men]]\n\n### Question:\nProfessor A said: \"All dogs are living things.\"\nProfessor B said: \"No cats are living things.\"\nProfessor C said: \"There are both cats and dogs that live on the earth.\"\n\nChoose these three phrases carefully from the following category.\n- Animals that are dogs as well as living things.\n- Animals that are not cats and are living things.\n- There are animals that are called dogs, cats, and living things.\n\nWhat is Professor B's choice?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nShoes for playing sports and shoes for running are distinct:\n- Any tennis shoe is a sports shoe, but not all sports shoes are tennis shoes.\n- All running shoes are sports shoes, but not all sports shoes are running shoes.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[], []].\n\n### Answer:\n[[sports/_],[sports/_]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"If everything sent by cats is heated by fire, then everything sent by pigs is not heated by fire.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular statement does this claim constitute?\n\"I agree with A, and everyone who agrees with A dissociates from B.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of categorical proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Her performance was either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/E/I/O]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Beauty is either an external broadness or an inner broadness.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nConditional Claim:\nA categorical claim that is structured in a unique way. \nIt asserts that a specific relationship exists among the subject, the predicate, and the term that serves as the contrapostulate. The relationship can be either affirmative or negative.\n\nConditional proposition of the affirmative relationship (AC): The knowledge that if all subjects possess a certain predicate, they must respectively possess a certain contrapostulate. Its abbreviation is ARBQ, also known as an affirmative conditional proposition or bi-thesis proposition.\n\nConditional proposition of the negative relationship (NC): The knowledge that if no subject possesses a certain predicate, then all subjects must respectively possess the opposite of the subject. Its abbreviation is ARB¯Q, also known as a negative conditional proposition or anti-disjunction proposition.\n\nUsing English for example:\n- If anything admits of quantity, it must be an accident.\n- If anything is a proper name, then there are plenty of words that do not occur in it at all.\n\nHere are some common exam questions:\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- The Kings of England. If there are kings in England, no one can depose or dethrone them.\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- Owlish faces. Beakers are tall, clear, and narrow. If a face is owlish then it is always beaker-shaped.\n- External relations: All coins are money. If anything is money, the constable can take it away.\n- External relations: According to traditional logic, all gnomes are machines. If there is a mechanical environment, then there are undoubtedly gnomes in it.\n\nCategorize them according to your ability in conjunction with the standardization.\n\n### Question:\nMy brother, for example, always loves to read. With that in mind, he may indulge in any other pleasure besides reading.\n\nWhat type of conditional proposition does it constitute?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARB_Q]]\n\n### Question:\nAnalyze the following statement.\n\"All mammals are viviparous.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[+/Men/University]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Men]]\n\n### Question:\nProfessor A said: \"If something is a formation, there must be a component.\"\nProfessor B said: \"Nothing is indefinite about enthusiasm unless they are motivations in nature.\"\nProfessor C said: \"If a planet is not a rocky planet, then it cannot be a planet.\"\n\nChoose these three phrases carefully from the following category.\n- I f there are rocks, there must be lands.\n- Nothing that is volunteer work is earthbound and limited.\n- Rocks are limited by bounds due to the fact that they are lands.\n\nWhich one of the three does Professor B believe?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of statement does this statement constitute?\n\"If the raptor man is not monopolistic, officially it must be a free marketer.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARBQ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular statement does this statement constitute?\n\"A gum is either benign or inflammatory.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARB_",

Chapters 2 through 10, 12 through 20, 22 through 31, 33 through 40, 42 through 50, and 52 were short, from 2 to 6 pages each. He concluded that chapter length had little to do with his influence on the novel.\n\nScientist B studied a different copy of the same novel once again in a bid to prove Scientist A's claim. Working with another observation, she concluded that chapter length had nothing to do with his influence on the novel. Scientist B noted that the first 10 chapters had all the romance and contrast, which is not observable in the rest of the novel. The remaining chapters, he thought, had designedly impoverished resources to render the effect of contrast.

Individuals with the condition often experience extreme fluctuations in mood, characterized by alternating episodes of happiness, energy, and self-confidence with severe lows of sadness, lethargy, and self-criticism. The period of depression is shorter than the period of happiness, sometimes even just one or two weeks of genuine self-confidence and happiness. This cycling can occur several times a month, even more than once a week. This emotional rollercoaster can have a significant impact on daily functioning, causing difficulties in social interactions, career development, and personal relationships.\n\nWhich of the Extensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. ￥ Definition\nB. !

The below input prompt challenge question is only one example of the challenges you may be asked to reason on. Below is a rule for mapping input prompts to challenges you may be asked to solve.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWhen formulating your answer, concentrate on the following considerations:\n\n1.) The structure of the above input statement maps to the rules in the logic_rules document.\n2.) Key features of the above input statement will be important when formulating the logic rules.\n3.) Ultimately, the logical elements of the above input statement need to be accurately mapped to the logic that is configured for a given type of logical reasoning challenge.\n\n### Logic Rules:\n\n1. Compositional Rule: Iterate over the sequences of the input string into sub-strings (sequences), which delimit the logic structure; Then transform each sub-string into a competing proposition; At last integrate every eligible sub-claim and reform it in the type of purpose inference claim.\n\n\"[(Input: Prop1 | Span: SA)] [*(……)] [PassiveAssumption: Span1 | Proposition: Prop2 | Supportor: Prop3]\"\na = Replace '*' with: (Spatial,\nTemporal,\nCausal,\nIntentional,\nEvaluative)\n\tb = Create a new formula (Form: Support,\n\ta\n\tb)\nc = Return the new formula\n\nImplementation method:\n\n1. Input statement sequencing: Input statement analysis, coarsely divide the input statement into binary, cumulative, tripartite and ternary propositions.\n\n2. Delimiting statement sub-structure: extract the premise, relationship and conclusion of sentence collocation.\n\n3. Seamless transformation: The relationship between the input and purpose inference state is atomic, component by component, from the subject, predicate, object, modal modifier, breaking Open the composition of the sentence, mining the fill, and then establishing a test, to achieve a seamless transition!\n\n4. Spatiotemporal claim merging: Examine the relationship between the mined claim propositions and the input, and net out the option that meets the conditions.\n\n5. Spatial claim translation: spatial claim -> temporal claim\n\n6. Go back and fill in the blanks: through various prompt strategies generate the semantic blanks with sentence filling or incomplete word prompts after the initial output is generated\n\na) Spatial / Event > Causal / Spatial > Intentional / Causal > Evaluative / Intentional (Understand causal scenarios such as events/circumstances 1 and 2, infer a certain conclusion from the scenarios and make a prediction based on the conclusion. Common ontological meta-perspective features among the causal scenarios and their corresponding (directed) conclusions)\n\nb) Spatial / Event > Evaluative (Factor analysis of changed event trends or spatial global changes, make a prediction implication)\n\nc) Spatiotemporal scene & & Ensure certain opinion conclusions appear at the same time or under the same conditions\n\nd) Intentional prediction generation: Determine actions or future events by inferring intentions from a state of affairs.\n\n7.
