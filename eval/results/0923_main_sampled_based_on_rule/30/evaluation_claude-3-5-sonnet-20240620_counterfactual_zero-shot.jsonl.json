In 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed initially.\n\n2. The Space Biosphere 1 experiment, launched after the initial failure, was declared a success in 2022. It had been operational for over 500 days (less than 2 years) under the supervision of six scientists.\n\n3. However, in June 2026, during a severe solar storm (beyond G5 level), the operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\n\nThese facts indicate that while progress was made in creating a self-sufficient space station, it was not able to withstand extreme solar events and did not operate successfully for more than 4 years. Therefore, humanity has not yet been able to construct a space station that can be entirely self-sufficient in space for an extended period, making option C the correct answer.",

The other options are less likely:\n\nA is incorrect because the Earth's rotation has been significantly altered, with day-night cycles lasting 60 hours by 2058.\n\nC is incorrect because Earth is still in the process of leaving the solar system and hasn't reached Proxima Centauri.\n\nD is incorrect because the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was destroyed in 2026 during a solar storm.",
