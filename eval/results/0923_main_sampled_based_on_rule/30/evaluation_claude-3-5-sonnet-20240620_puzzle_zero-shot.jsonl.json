We need to consider the inequality constraints:\n   (1,2) > (1,3)\n   (2,2) > (2,3)\n   (3,1) < (3,2)\n\nLet's solve:\n\n1. In the first row, we know 2 is in the first position.

The other numbers must be 1, 2, and 4 in some order.\n\n3. Given (3,1) < (3,2), the first number in the third row must be smaller than the second.
