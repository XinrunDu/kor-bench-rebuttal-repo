So the padded plaintext is \"G\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNext, we divide this padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. Since the entire string is considered one block.\n\nWe then convert this block to bytes using ASCII encoding. \"G\" is represented as 0x47 and each \"\\x00\" is represented as 0x00. So the byte block is [0x47, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\nWe XOR this byte block with the fixed key (b'1234567890ABCDEF'). Performing the XOR operation, we get [0x55, 0x12, 0x16, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E].\n\nNext, we use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte.
