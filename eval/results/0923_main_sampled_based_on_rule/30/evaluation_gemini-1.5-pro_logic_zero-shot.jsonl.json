Let's analyze why:\n\n1. **Principal Disjunctive Normal Form (PDNF):**  PDNF requires the formula to be a disjunction of paired conjunctive terms. A paired conjunctive term must include all propositional variables (or their negations) exactly once, arranged in ascending order. The given formula has conjunctive clauses but doesn't fulfill the criteria for paired conjunctive terms:\n    *  `(p∨r)` is missing `q` or `¬q`\n    * `(¬q∨r)` is missing `p` or `¬p`\n    * `(¬p∨q∨¬r)`  doesn't have all variables in their negated or non-negated form arranged in order. \n\n2. **Principal Conjunctive Normal Form (PCNF):** PCNF requires the formula to be a conjunction of paired disjunctive terms. Similar to the above, the given formula's disjunctive clauses don't meet the requirements of paired disjunctive terms.\n\n**Therefore, the given formula does not conform to either the principal disjunctive normal form or the principal conjunctive normal form.** \n",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Initial Goal:** The aim is to prove proposition 'p'.\n2. **Assumption of the Contrary:**  It assumes the opposite of what we want to prove, \"Not p.\"\n3. **Demonstration of Absurdity:**  It establishes a logical flow where \"Not p\" leads to 'q'. However, 'q' is known to be false (Not q). This creates a contradiction or an absurd situation. \n4. **Conclusion by Negation:** Because the assumption \"Not p\" led to a contradiction, we conclude that \"Not p\" cannot be true. Therefore, we affirm the opposite, which is 'p'. \n\nThis process of proving a proposition by demonstrating the impossibility of its negation is the core of the *Contra- Method*. \n",

Let's break down why:\n\n* **K(Xiao Qiang, Lu Xun is Lu Xun):** Xiao Qiang knows that Lu Xun is Lu Xun (This is true, as it's a tautology).\n* **R(Lu Xun, Zhou Jianren, brother):** Lu Xun has the relationship \"brother\" with Zhou Jianren. \n\nThe faulty reasoning makes an incorrect substitution: It assumes that because Xiao Qiang knows something about Lu Xun (his identity), Xiao Qiang automatically knows all relationships involving Lu Xun. This is the substitution error.\n\nThe other options are not applicable:\n\n* **NegAnt, AffCons, CondSwap, IncorrNeg, DisjSyl, QuantSwitch, IllTrans, IncorrInf** all deal with different logical structures and inferences not present in this example.\n* **LetClauseShift** pertains to misinterpretations of statement structures, which isn't the core issue here. \n",
