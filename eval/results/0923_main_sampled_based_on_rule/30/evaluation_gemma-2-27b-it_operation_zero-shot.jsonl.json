Let's break it down:\n    * 25※X:  We need to figure out 25※X first.\n    * The result of 25※X then operates on 14 using the '※' operation.\n\n* **Applying the Rules:**\n\n    1. **25※X:** We don't know if 'X' is a multiple of 25 or vice-versa, so we need to consider both possibilities:\n\n        * **If X is a multiple of 25:**  25※X = 25/X + 2\n        * **If 25 is a multiple of X:** 25※X = X/25 + 2\n\n    2. **(25※X) ※ 14:** Now we need to apply the operation between the result from the previous step and 14. Again, we need to consider cases:\n\n        * **If (25/X + 2) is a multiple of 14:** (25/X + 2) ※ 14 = (14/(25/X + 2)) + 2\n        * **If 14 is a multiple of (25/X + 2):** (25/X + 2) ※ 14 = ((25/X + 2)/14) + 2\n        * **Same logic applies if the initial operation resulted in (X/25 + 2)**\n\n* **Solving for X:** Unfortunately, without more information, we can't definitively solve for 'X'.  There could be multiple values of 'X' that satisfy the equation. \n\n* **Addressing the Answer Format:** Since there might be multiple solutions, we can't provide a single answer within double square brackets. \n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or want to explore specific scenarios for the value of 'X'.\n",
