We can rule out 0 as a possibility because it can't be the leading digit.\n\n2. **Consider \"BB\":**\n\n   * \"BB\" represents a two-digit number. \n   * Because \"B\" is repeated, it must be a digit that, when added to itself, creates a valid result within the context of the equation.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:**\n\n   Let's experiment with some values for \"B\". Remember, \"B\" can't be 0.\n\n   * If \"B\" = 1, then \"BB\" = 11. This doesn't seem promising.\n   * If \"B\" = 2, then \"BB\" = 22.  This also doesn't look like it would work easily.\n   * **If \"B\" = 3, then \"BB\" = 33.** Let's see if this fits!\n\n4. **Fitting the Pieces:**\n\n   * If \"B\" = 3 and \"BB\" = 33, the equation becomes: I + 33 = ILL.\n\n   *  Let's try \"I\" = 1.

Since the first column already has a black cell (weight 1), this row must have three more black cells to reach the sum. Their positions can be determined to satisfy the column sum requirements.\n\n3. **Iterate:** Continue this process for the remaining rows and columns, ensuring the black cell placements satisfy both row and column sum constraints.\n\n**Unfortunately, without a visual representation of the grid, it's challenging to provide the exact placement of the \"1\"s in a text-based format.** I highly recommend using a pen and paper or a grid-based drawing tool to visually solve this puzzle.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to try another puzzle with a different grid layout.\n",
