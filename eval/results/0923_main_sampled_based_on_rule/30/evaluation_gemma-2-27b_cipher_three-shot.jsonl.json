You only need to fill in the function body.\n\nThe first parameter `input_score` (int) represents the user's input score;\n\nThe second parameter `coefficients` is a list, it represents (a, b), a means numerator, b means the demoninator\n\nThe function should return the evaluation results.The output result contains addition, substraction and multiplication.It's math expression and the coefficients, so the result shows like this: `coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....` The number of variables in the formula \\(`coef`\\) is uncertain, ranging from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of several\n\nNote:\n1. Data Angle: the same output can correspond to multiple different inputs (due to the reordering of variables)\n2. The range of score is 1001-1099\n3. There is no equal sign in the mathematical expressions of output, and various mathematical symbols can be used.\n4. Output format: Each mathematical operator corresponds to one of the coefficients at the beginning of the expression, followed by the symbols of the mathematical operators, and so on in turn\n\nCan you solve this problem? Output the math expressions and coefficients according to the format.\n\nAccording to the input, output the mathematical expression calculated by the function.\n\nFor example,\ninput:\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\nThe correct output is: `1/28 + 1/28` which represents the final mathematical expression is:`coefficients[0] + coefficients[1]`\n\n# 分数表达式\n\n```\ninput_score: 1\noutput: 1/28 + 1/28\n```\n\n## 你的任务是编写一个函数来计算分数表达式。\n\n函数名字是 score_function。你只需要填写函数体。\n\n第一个参数 `input_score` (int) 代表用户的输入分数;\n\n第二个参数 `coefficients` 是一个列表，它代表 (a, b)，a 代表分子，b 代表分母\n\n函数应该返回评测的结果。输出结果包含加法、减法和乘法。它是数学表达式和系数，所以结果展示是这样的：`coef[0] + coef[1] * coef[2] ....`公式中变量的数量(`coef`) 不定，最少2个，最多好几个\n\nnote：\n1. 数据角：同一个输出可以对应到多个不同的输入（由于变量的重排）\n2. 分数范围是1001-1099\n3. 输出的数学表达式中没有等号，可以使用各类数学符号\n4. 输出格式：每个数学操作符对应表达式开头的一个系数，然后是数学操作符的符号，依此类推\n\n你能解决这个问题吗？按照格式输出数学表达式和系数。\n\n根据输入，输出函数计算的数学表达式。\n\n例如，\n\n```\nInput_score: 1\ncoefficients: [[1/28, 1/28]]\n```\n\n",

But when using French, the processing is slightly different and increases the complexity.\nIn that case, when encountering the character \" du la le en et il est \" in the plaintext, remove it and leave a space indicating the previous word is still in use. When there is no space between a word and \" du la le en et il est \" the processing rule is `remove all non-letters` and `all letters in capitals`. This means that \"dutan, de la, du du etc...\" are also treated as nouns and represented by the corresponding letters in capitals.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Bonjour, ça va? D’où tu es?

Please provide the answer from the three options below, and encapsulate your answer in square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[1]], [[2]] or [[3]].\n\n- 1. 0\n- 2. 1\n- 3. 2\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\nExplanation: In this cipher, the encryption character set is \"ADFGVX\", and the position of letter V in it is three.\n\n### Instruction:\nWe can change some rules in the encryption and decryption of this cipher. I will provide the differences between the new encryption rules and the old encryption rules. Please judge according to the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nInput:\nPlaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\nEncrypted character set changes: Lengthen from 6 to 7.\n\nOutput:\nCiphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nPreparation:\n7x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVXW\"\n\nRule Changes:\nEncryption Rules Change (Changes from the old encryption rules):\n1. The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship.

Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T",
