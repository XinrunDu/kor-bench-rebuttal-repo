The core operation is to replace predicate and function symbols with the corresponding functions defined in the given context.\n\n \n**Applying the rule**:\n\n* `∀xF(g(x,a′),x) ` becomes `∀xF(fJ(x,a'),x) `\n    * We replace the remain the symbols `F`,  `x` and `a`&#x20; with their equivalent functions from our given pre-diction of the rule.\n    * We use `x` in both the pre-diction of the rule and the actual formula as both must be applied. \n    * Now we have the following.\n    \n \n``` [∀xF(fJ(x,a'),x)→F(x,y)]  \n```\n\n \n* `→` represents a logical implication\n\n**Interpreting the result:**\n\nThe translated formula, `∀xF(fJ(x,a′),x)→F(x,y)`, signifies that for any input `x`, if `f(x, a′)`, then the current `y`'s result must match.  \n\n\n \nPlease note that this is a basic translation.
