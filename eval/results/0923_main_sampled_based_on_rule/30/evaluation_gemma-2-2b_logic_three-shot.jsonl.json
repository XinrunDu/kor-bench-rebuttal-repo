If the formula is T on both the right and the left, it may be written in T F. If the formula is G on both sides, it can also be written in G F.\n\n### Answer:\nThe formula is G F.\n\n### Question:\nLet p1, p2, and p3 be the propositions \"x is an even number\", \"x < 5\" and \"x is the number 5\", \nrespectively. For any true value of p1, find the truth values of  p2 and p3.\n\nThe objective here is to find the results of p2 and p3 given the condition p1 is true.\nPlease answer with a list of truth values given by name and label as [[A|B|C]]. If the answers are T/F there is no need to write they are considered T or F. If there is only one case given, then just write a label A or B.\n\n### Answer:\n[[x is a even number|x<5|x is the number 5]];\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether the following formula is a T, F, or G formula by giving a reason for your answer.\n\n\n### Answer:\nThe formula is T.\n\n### Question:\nDeterming the truth value of the following formula for given p1, p2, and p3\nFormat: [[T/F]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[T/F]].\n\nNotice:\nNo judgments such as \"not\" or \"not-not is given, so please answer as following:\n(1) If it's not truth formula, answer \"F\";\n(2) If it is a truth formula, but it is also not a judgment formula, then answer \"T\" (it is possible that it is both a truth formula and has a judgment such as \"not but it is not a judgment\", but the judgment formula is just a structural combination of the truth formula, and its truth value depends on the truth value of its structural parts.  However, different from the answer to the first type of question);\n(3)If it is a judgment formula, answer \"F\".\n\n### Question:\nAssume that there are the propositions \"1(p1)=1\"(&p2=1x=1)&~p2=1 & p2~=1), three axioms A, B and C and the induction axioms Ia and Ib.\nIf q is the formula \"(x^x)(x=0&x=1)\",  and q1 is \"q is a truth formula\", what will be the result of q1?\nThe answer should be a single integer. Since the possibility of answers (1~,0,~1,~2,~3 are all in the range [1...10], the format of the answer is [[N]]. There cannot be a N is 0 integer answer, so Q.I.A is not accepted.\n\n### Answer:\n[5];\n\n### Question:\nPlease find the result of the formula (p) under given value of x and the variables in the formula.\n\nThe result of the variable in the formula should be given as an integer, if there are multiple results you may use (;) to separate. The format for answer should be [[x];[result]].\n\nIn example please find out the answer of:\n(x+2)=(p;x=3)\n\nNote that:\nAll of the possible answers that we need are: [0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19].\nSo answers[0] = x+2 = 5 and answers[2] = x+2 = 4. If an answer[n] = 0, then when x is 0, it should be 0. \nThis is to differentiate the answers from the above possible answers.\nSo normally it should be at this:\n answers[0] = x+2 = 5;\n answers[1] = x+2 = 11;\n answers[2] = x+2 = 7.\n\n## Instructions:\n\nPlease follow these guidelines:\n\n1.

All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, ¬(p∧q)∧¬w can be written either as ¬p∧¬¬q∧¬w [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or ¬p∧(¬q∧¬w) ∨ ¬p∧¬q∧¬w (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of ¬p↔p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, ¬p∨¬q is logically equivalent to ¬p∧¬q. In contrast, ​¬(p∨q)¬r\n][1] is not a logical implication of ¬p∨¬q¬r because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition ¬p∨q¬r can be reduced to ¬p∧¬q∨¬r.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p∨¬p^(¬q∧¬r) -p^¬q^¬r (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p∨ψ` the [`p∧¬ψ’ `p∧ψ](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & ¬A)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P ∨ Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. ¬Q (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q ∨ ¬P (disjunction). When it is true ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) is true ∧(¬P ∨ ¬Q)] (logical ∨). When it is true ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)) = ¬P ∨Q] ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) = P ∨ Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P ∨ Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A ∨ ∧(B ∨ C ... N.) for the DNF `(A ∨ (B ∨ (C ∨ ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) ∨/∨[(X ∨ Y ∨ Z ∨ ... N. ∨ X ∨ Y). ∨ (X ∨ Y ∨ Z ... N) ∨X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p∧q∧r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p ∧ (q ∧ r))))) ∧((q ∧ (p ∧ r))) ∧((r ∧ (p ∧ q)))] ∧((r ∧ (p & (q ∧ r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p ∧ Q)(p ∧ R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P ∨ Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: ¬(¬A∧¬B)→(A∨B) ((¬ A∨¬ B)→( A∧ B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P ∨ Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q∧¬r&¬q∧r^(¬¬p∨¬p∧r∧¬r∧p^(¬p∧¬r^(¬¬q^¬p^(¬r∧¬q)))>= (p∧¬¬p∧¬q)^p∧q∧¬r`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. ¬P ∨(P^¬¬Q))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## 使用与输出格式：编写符合格式的逻辑配置和输出。\n\n- 使用自定义规则的定制逻辑配置，从输入字符流中回答，生成符合自定义规则格式的回答并写到输出字符流中。\n> 输入： 字符流，满足以下格式`[输入字符流:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **问题**: `[“**Output:**”，格式：\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> 将自定义规则的定制逻辑配置应用到字符流输入`[“'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `输出`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n用[0]中的函数实现输出。\n\n\n## 编译选项：\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# 实现：\n\n## 1). 自定义逻辑  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). 实现文字输入([LNOT^2和calculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). 逻辑输入输出格式([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). 编译参数,错误信息返回([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)",

If x is a circle, x is a sphere.\nIllustration:\nFor each circle x,x is like a sphere, because every circle can be like the Sun when the Earth is stationary.\nAnalysis: If an object x meets the definition of 'circle', and it is still consistent with this definition after adding x has \"capacity to revolve\", then x also coincides with the definition of 'circle' after the change. Therefore, x cannot be a sphere.\nProof:\n1. If x is a circle, then it also has \"capacity to revolve\".\n2. If a circle has 'capacity to move freely', it is the Sun.\n3. If an object x is the Sun, then x is a sphere.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n\n\n2. If x is a quadrilateral, x cannot be a regular one.\nIllustration:\nTake the square as an example, the sides of the square form a regular quadrilateral, but they are not a regular one.\nAnalysis: The definition of 'circle' has a number of conditions to satisfy, to ensure the meaning of 'circle', which is consistent with some rules of 'circle'. The definition of 'quadrangular' has a number of conditions to satisfy, but it is not based on the combination of some concepts to form a regular one, because there is no combination of two or more sets of 'triangle', and squares are all quadrilaterals , so it is a kind of regular one, not conform to a definition of 'quadrangular'.\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrilateral, then x has at least one of the 4 types of 'triangle', the regular one included.\n2. If x has 'triangle', and it is a regular one, then x agrees with the definition of 'quadrangular' but is not a regular one.\n3. Therefore, if x is not a quadrilateral, then it cannot be a regular one.\nConclusion: If x is a quadrilateral, then x cannot be a regular one.\n\n\n3. All quadrangles (are) quadrilateral?\nIllustration:\nSquares, trapezoids, rhombi are all quadriangular, but not just added.\nAnalysis: quadrilateral(is)quadrangular(be) can be regarded as a conclusion. Its entry must agree with the definition of quadrangle (or triangular), can be interpreted as saying that a quadrilateral is quadrilateral absolutely correct. Since the squares' definition is the combination of regular tetrahedron and diagonal triangle, since the two pieces of a regular tetrahedron embedded in this tetrahedral combination and the line of two of the corners of the rhombus are the sum of the diagonal triangle's description, is consistent with the definition of triangular, which is called a quadrangle absolutely correct from quadrilateral definition. So the correct one conclusion is truly the meaning quads(is)quadrangular(be)\nProof:\n1. If x is not a quadrangle, then it must be a combination of quadrilateral or triangular.\n2. If x is a combination of quadrilateral, x is quadangled.\nConclusion: x is a quadrilateral wherever it is.\n\n### Question:\nProve the following propositions using analytical and judgment principles (3 hypotheses and 1 conclusion).\n\n1. If x is a circle, then x is a sphere.\n2. If x is a sphere, then x is a planet.\n3. If x is a planet, then x has an orbital ring around it.\n\nA total of 3 propositions must be proven. Prove the following 3 pairs of propositions in order using the Homological Domain:\n\n(1) 1 and 3 (2) 1 and 2 (3) 2 and 3\n\nDetermine which combinations can be proved at a time. Do not repeat the same proposition or use the same proposition combination twice (such as using the statement\"if A, then B\" and \"if B, then A\" in the same part). Assuming that your reasoning order and the verification of the principle sequence of the conditions will be considered during the examination of non-mathematical errors, such as arbitrary creation of Proposition, intentional reversal of inference, and substitution of the conclusion of a statement with a false proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n1. If x is not the sphere, then it is the sun.\nIllustration:\nLet the circle be the sun, as the sun, with a ring of orbital mirror around the edge, and there is a circle, which is not just a planet. If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\nAnalysis:\n If x is a circle, by definition, x is not just a sun and a spherical surface with an interstellar ring around the edge.\nIf x is a sphere, and x has a spherical surface, a belt is hanging around, and the edge is oval, x is a planet.\nIf x is a planet, then the spiral has to be around it too.\nProof:\n1. If a circle is not a sphere, the sun is not obviously.\n2. If x is a sphere with a ring of orbital mirrors like the sun, x is clearly a planet.\nConclusion: If x is a circle, then x is a planet.\n\n2. If x is not the planet, then x is a cube.\nIllustration:\nThe diameter of the planet is an arm’s distance, and its outer edge is an arm’s distance.\nAnalysis:\nIf the planet is not a sphere, the diameter of the planet cannot be an arm’s distance, so a planet can be small that can accommodate the body. If x is a sphere, and x has an oval outer surface, the width of x’s radius is smaller than an arm, so the outer hex radius can also be smaller than an arm’s distance. Therefore, x is not the cube (is not a sphere or planet (is) cube).\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, it is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a sphere with a belt-like ring around its legs, then it must be the cube, because the radius is smaller than the arm.\nConclusion: If x is a planet, then x is a cube.\nConclusion: x can not be the cube.\n\n3. If x is not the cube, then x has a memory.\n1. Every continent has enough room to hold half of the world.\n2. Only the space on the bottom of the world and in orbits is available, so if anything exists in the universe, there must be something in the orbit.\nAnalysis:\nIt may be a cube, it has no core;\nbecause the volume of the cube is very large, it cannot be stored within three continents, which is too small. Therefore, the only possibility is that there is no core to make the volume look huge.\nProof:\n1.\nIf x is not a cube, x is either a sphere or a planet.\n2. If x is a planet’s spherical surface, orbiting x orbit 1 is absolutely impossible and can be ruled out, so x must be x, so x is the Sun.\n3. If x is a sphere orbiting x, then it must be a planet, and it is impossible to have a planet within the orbiting distance, so x is not a permanent one.\nConclusion: If x is a cube, then x has a core.\nConclusion: x is not a cube.\nWith the combination of propositions is not enough to prove.\n1, 2, 3 are sufficient conditions/not enough conditions, they can only prove a relationship between proposition/can not prove the truth of the combination of propositions, need to use the corresponding way to proved to be not enough to prove truth.\n\n### Question:\nSymbolise and verify the following proposition using the analytical principle (analogy principle) and judgment principle (proof by contradiction principle).\n\n(1) (A1 v A 2) ⇒ ((( A 2 Λ A 1) Λ (( A 1 Λ A 2) Λ ( A 1 Λ A 2))) Λ (( A 1 Λ A 2) Λ ( A 1 Λ A 2)\n\n(2) A 2Λ(A 1 Λ(",

[c1 + c2]φ\n  - The possibility exists that `φ` is true after executing one or both commands.\n3. [c1; c2]φ\n  - After executing the commands, `φ` has the characteristics of both `c1` and `c2`.\n4. ⟨c1; c2⟩φ\n  - After executing `c1`, the situation after executing `c2` can be represented as if `φ` is true.\n5. ⟨c1 + c2⟩φ\n  - Any of the processes `c1` or `c2` makes `φ` possible.\n6. [[c1; c2]φ]\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can be represented as `φ`.\n7. [c1; c2]φ\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can contain or include `φ`.\n\nThis may sound more convoluted, but it is the result of a series of transformations based on the structure of the rule language. The basic idea is to use logical operations such as substitution, sequence, choice, loop, and interrupt as a process or description of execution. For example, when executing command `c2 + c1`, the first command is likely to be completed successfully, then execute the second command, the resulting situation will be as if `φ` is true. In a broader sense, even when `c1` succeeds, `φ` is still possible, because after using `c1 + c2`, the system can still enter the resource limitation state and then the exception state, which will lead to `errorCode`. Finally, when executing the command `c1; c2`, the outcome can be described as `φ` plus both `c1` and `c2`, and the successful execution can result in termination or the situation as if `φ` is true.\n<img src=\"https://img2.imgso.cn/flow/e476b21f247217727d793596488/jionefh66.png\" width=\"800\" border=\"0\" />",

Provide a detailed answer with proper format and references.\n\n[Answer]\n\n1. How can we solve a logic puzzle with many variables and sub-variables?\n\nTwo short answer questions can be asked for this type of question.\n\nIn the logic puzzle, the researcher observed the following: [GroupA and Group B were in a group, and GroupC did not start on the bus.\n\nGroupA started the bus on the bus at 10.\n\nGroup B and Group C did not start the bus at 11.\n\nGroup C began the bus at 13.\n\nThe only variables observed are GroupA, GroupB, GroupC.\n\nThe answer is as follows\n\nGroupA and Group B were in a group, and GroupC did not start on the bus.\n\nThe decision is as follows. For the result shown as ( GroupA) to be in GroupB, GroupA] must participate in GroupB. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupA, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupA.\n\nThe rule in GroupA is as follows. It is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in GroupC, so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupB.\n\nGroupC was in GroupB. But GroupC was not in (GroupA), so it is necessary to take action separately as follows.\n\nGroupC was not in GroupB, but started (GroupA) on the bus. Therefore, GroupC was in GroupC.\n\nIn conclusion, as detailed above,\n\nGroupA: (B/A/()), GroupB: (B/A/). GroupC: (C/B/A/()).\n\nThis situation is called a puzzle that answers the questions, etc., in a logic puzzle using many variables and sub-variables.\n",

They can provide a new battery at no charge.\"\nF: \"If the battery is seriously low and cannot be replaced, please contact customer service to handle it promptly.\"\nA's sentence expresses a straightforward concept.\nB asks for a second consideration.\nC expresses confusion and asks for another way.\nD, E and F are product support advisories.\n\nC uses \"excuse me\" and \"do you have any suggestions?\" to guide customer conversation, and it is actually hard to represent what [C] exactly wants in the form of a sentence. At the same time, [C] may have a request, but they put it in a seemingly non-requesting structure and may also try to seek second and third opinions. This is an expression of sincerity, and it's a way to avoid using direct language to directly ask questions, maybe also to avoid missing the feeling of the other party while asking directly. If it was \"Excuse, do you have a suggestion?\" or \"Do you have any advice?\" maybe the possibility of misunderstanding will be relatively high. To try to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding, the sentence of C is indeed very suitable.\n\nIt is difficult to define the logical structure and meaning of C's sentence in terms of the 3 different logical grammar concepts (C*, C%, C!) in here.\n\nWhich principles does this dialogue conform to at three levels?\nA. C* Principle\nB. C% Principle\nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n- The level of C* Principle: \"A: \"The battery in my watch has run out, and it takes about 2 to 3 business days to receive a new one.\"\" B: \"I think it's faster to replace the battery yourself if it's really fixed so seriously\".\" C: \"I'll make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, and he can handle it in about an hour after doing some preliminary tests.\"\n- The level of C% Principle:\"A: \"The report is ready now, complete with all the tables and figures you requested.\" B: \"We got late because we got caught in a traffic jam en route to work.\" C: \"I woke up late and my daughter accidentally poured milk on my new shoes.\"\n- The level of C! Principle:\"A: \"The battery in my watch has run out, and it takes about 2 to 3 business days to receive a new one.\" B: \"I think it's faster to replace the battery yourself if it's really fixed so seriously.\"\" C: \"I'll make an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, and he can handle it in about an hour after doing some preliminary tests.\"\n- The above C answers are roughly classified into three formats semantically, in the sense of language, which are the level of C* Principle, C% Principle and C! Principle. From the results of the interpretation of C answers, we found that the level of C** Principle and level of C% Principle are identical, the relationship between the two can be described as \"C% Principle = C** Principle\". From a linguistic perspective, it is hard for [C] to be represented as a sentence with the 3 principles above. So it's B, C, E, F.\n\nHow should you structure, shape and interpret a dialogue like this? Please give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n### A:\n- As simple as possible, which avoids misunderstandings that do not require unnecessary context\n- As standardized as possible, this is not a personal chat, but an instruction\n- In fact, many people want to achieve [A] or [C], but [B] tends to be less ambiguous but also understandable, and the [B] perspective may have a different meaning to more people, but [B] is very objective and direct, so for \"dialogue\" There are not so many ways that \"dialogue\" can choose to have [B] as its consistent style, in a way [B] can be described as \"all the cleverness is preconception\"\n\n### B:\n\n- Try to simplify as much as possible, in fact, it is not necessary to be so wordy in terms of the language, if it is about technical issues and terms, but also in the same line, no need to be so verbose, or just throw out some tools or how The language of the [B] can be concise\n- As standardized as possible, this is not a personal chat, but an instruction\n- In fact, many people want to achieve [A] or [B], but [C] tends to be less ambiguous but also understandable, and the [B] perspective may have a different meaning to more people, but [B] is very objective and direct, so for \"dialogue\" There are not so many ways that \"dialogue\" can have [B] as its consistent style, in a way [B] can be described as \"all the cleverness is preconception\"\n\n### C:\n\n- [B] is too objective and therefore may not be in line with one's personal perspective\n- Not to be standardized, personal explanation or story may vary greatly, the different levels of [A] in some perspectives may also be [C], to meet the different needs of people\n- If not to be standardized, moreover, [C] can choose some perspectives, which are all that are needed to improve one's relationship with other people, a person needs to be able to speak, to listen and to express this ability, there will be no harm, this ability is to help two people communicate more smoothly, in [C] In this sense, the personal relationship was formed back to the [C** Principle]\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n### A:\n- According to [A] or the perspective of [C], this is the perspective of [C] should not be, the two perspectives are very different\n- [B] is the perspective of this logical grammar concept , but it may not be widely recognized because human perception is often influenced by the [C*] level, it can be said that the objective [B] is actually more likely to be controversial because of the [C*] level\n- It's not like a one-to-one correspondence [B] vs [C] , [B] is an example of [C] and [C] is an example of [A] to some extent\n- In [A] and [B], [A] has a very consistent style, while [B] is consistent with the [C*] perspective , [C] is inconsistent with the [A*] level, but is consistent with the [C*] perspective , [C] is consistent with the [A*] level, and [C] and [A*] are not isolated concepts\n\n### B:\n- According to [A] or the perspective of [C], this is the perspective of [C] should not be, the two perspectives are very different\n- [B] is the understanding of logical grammar, which can be explained in the form of human communication for the purpose of cooperation, this is one of the meanings given by [B]\n- From the [A*] perspective, [B] may indeed be more widely understood, but from the [C*] perspective, [B] doesn't really conform to a certain principle ( [C*] means [B] may conform to [C*] principles, and if [C*] is the only highest principle)\n- [B] has its own style [C] is inconsistent with some principles, for some people [C]",

To get this answer, you must understand the principles related to information enhancement and constraints.\n\nThe following are some core principles:\n\n- \"Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" and \"Minimalization Criterion\": This information also affects C* and C%! It focuses on ensuring that the statement avoids being too weak when determining its content from information, and it also attaches importance to expressing the content that can be established within the least amount of language. This principle is similar to C* Principle and C% Principle.\n- \"Speak as little as possible.\" and \"Expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech: This information mainly applies to C%. It emphasizes that when conveying information, you should strive to reduce redundancy or blur the content, and it also restricts the length and structure of the sentence.\n- The less comprehensive the information, the more probable it is to regard the statement as \"an extension.\" Usually the expression \"not entailing the content of the sentence\" is less commonly used in C% Principle, and the information provided by C is more frequently in contrast to C* Principle. This reflects the idea that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows.\"\n- \"Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason\": This information usually satisfies C! Principle. It emphasizes that when expressing information, you should avoid using lengthy, convoluted, or marked expressions that are not particularly relevant, nor should you put additional information into the expression beyond what is necessary.",

For example, it is necessary to improve the living conditions of urban residents; to develop the urban economy and form a prosperous market situation; to enhance political and cultural influence; and so on.
