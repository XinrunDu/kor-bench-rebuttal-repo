Here's why:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Li Gua murdered his boss, then he is an evil person.\n* **Premise 2:** Li Gua did not murder his boss.\n* **Conclusion:** Li Gua is not an evil person.\n\nThe fallacy lies in assuming that because Li Gua didn't commit one specific act (murder), he cannot be categorized as evil.  The 'if P, then Q' structure is used, but the negation of P does not guarantee the negation of Q. \n\n\n",
