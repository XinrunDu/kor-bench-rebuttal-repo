This directly tells us the placement of #118.\n\n* **Clue 2:** #126 finished 1 place after Kermit. While we don't know Kermit's position yet, we know #126 is one place ahead of Kermit.\n\n* **Clue 3:** #134 was either Ozzy or the ostrich that finished third.  This connects #134 to either Ozzy or the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 4:** The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch. This gives us another possibility for the third-place finisher.\n\n* **Clue 5:** #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.  This tells us the order between #120 and Ozzy.\n\n\nBy combining these clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n* **#118 finishes in fourth place.** \n* **Since #126 is one place ahead of Kermit, Kermit must be second.**\n\n* **The third place finisher could be #126 or Stretch.  However, we know #126 is one place behind Kermit, and Kermit is second. This eliminates #126 as a possibility for third place.** This means Stretch must be third.\n\n\n\n*  **The only remaining possibilities for Ozzy is to be either first or to finish before #120 based on clue 5.\n\n\nGiven the rules of the puzzle, we can't definitively determine the placing of  Ozzy,  but we can deduce the other placements. \n\nLet me know if you have any other puzzle rule sets you'd like me to try! \n",

Iterative Solution (due to complexity, providing the full iterative solution here is quite lengthy):**\n\nYou'd start by focusing on regions with the fewest unknowns.

Simply providing a list of numbers doesn't capture the spatial relationships needed to solve it.\n\n**How I'd approach solving this (and how you can too):**\n\n1. **Understand the Grid:**  The grid layout is a 6x6, meaning the skyscraper heights can be from 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Focus on the Clues:** Analyze the numbers on the sides. Each number tells you how many skyscrapers of a certain height you'd see in that direction.\n\n3. **Start Simple:** Look for cells with only one possible height based on the surrounding clues. For example, if a row has a '1' clue, and you can immediately see that only one cell can accommodate a height of 1, fill that in.\n\n4. **Elimination:**  Use the \"no repeats in rows/columns\" rule to eliminate possibilities. If you know a height '3' already exists in a column, you can eliminate  '3' as a possibility for other cells in that column.\n\n5. **Trial and Error (With Pencil):**  For harder puzzles, you might need to make tentative guesses and see if they lead to contradictions. Have a pencil handy to erase and try again.\n\n**Remember:** Skyscraper puzzles are logic-based.
