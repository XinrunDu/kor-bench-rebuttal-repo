For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\n\nThe encryption operation of this cipher rule transforms the plaintext letter \"C\" into \"F'. As an intelligent assistant, I will always provide a precise and rigorous output for tasks I am responsible for. The format for your encrypted output should follow this guideline: \"[[Encrypted answer]]\"\n\nAs a rule, I will follow the instructions precisely as specified in the rules. In this case, I will always strictly follow the encryption steps to generate the output \"[[Encrypted answer]].\" As long as I am given the correct plaintext and encryption rule, I will directly transform it into ciphertext. So, the encryption output you want for your \"C\" plaintext is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nNow, since I understand the format for the plaintext transformation into ciphertext, it is very straightforward for me to perform the decryption operation. My output format for the decryption operation would also be the same as the encryption output format: \"[[Deciphered answer]]\". Now, using the ciphertext and encryption rule, I will decipher the ciphertext to obtain the plaintext. The format for this output is: \"[[Deciphered answer]].\"\n\nFor our scenario, the deciphered output for the ciphertext \"C\" is:\n\n**[[K]]**\n\nThe encryption rule for our cipher specifies the following rules for converting uppercase letter text into ciphertext. Using the reverse mapping in standard_alphabet, A maps to Z, B maps to Y, etc.\n\nThe substitution alphabet specifies the mapping for each letter in the standard_alphabet to its corresponding letter, for example, A becomes F, B becomes R, and so forth.\n\nUsing this rule, my transformation for uppercase letter \"C\" in the plaintext to its corresponding ciphertext is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nSimilarly, for decryption, the rule of mapping from the substitution alphabet to the standard alphabet is used, followed by reversing the order for specific letters in the alphabet. When faced with letter \"F\" during decoding, the following steps are performed:\n\n1. The order of the letters in the standard_alphabet is found.\n2. \"F\" is shifted backward by 4 positions.\n3. The standard_alphabet ordering is reversed.\n\nThis decryption operation for letter \"F\" results in the following situation:\n\n**[[C]]**\n\nThe rules of this cipher specify that the initial encryption follows the following procedure to convert uppercase letters to ciphertext:\n\n- (1) Using reverse mapping in the standard_alphabet, reverse the text order.\n- (2) Add four spaces to the standard_alphabet and then calculate the new position of C.\n- (3) Use substitution_alphabet to map the corresponding ciphertext.\n\nThese steps result in:\n\n- (1) The standard_alphabet reverses the plaintext sequence, which means C maps to E.\n\n- (2) Add four spaces to the standard_alphabet; we have ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. Calculate new position of C as follows:\n\n   - Step 1: Add four spaces to alphabet; we have ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.\n   - Step 2: Count the starting alphabet as \"A\" = 65.\n   - Step 3: “ABC” means 3 letters. In our standard_alphabet, C is the 3rd letter, so the next offset is (23+3) = 26.\n   - Step 4: Add 4 to 26 to get 30 in total. 30 in alphabetical order means it is at position “Z”.\n- (3) Z is a new position according to alphabet.\n- (4) According to our substitution alphabet to map corresponding uppercase letters.\n\n**I will encrypt this plaintext as follows:**\n\n**[[F]]**\n\n**Decrypt the encrypted ciphertext accordingly.** I strictly follow these steps:\n\n- (1) Find the position of \"Z\" in the standard alphabet.\n- (2) From standard_alphabet to reverse alphabet, and then convert according to the rules.\n- (3) From substitution alphabet to standard_alphabet and reverse their order.\n- (4) Get decrypted plaintext.\n\nThe ciphertext obtained through this decryption process is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nI adhere to these rules precisely and will comply with them to complete this decryption task.\n\nI will strictly adhere to these steps to transform the uppercase letter \"C\" of the ciphertext into plaintext for decryption:\n\nThe replacement text I have used to transform the ciphertext \"C\" into plaintext is:\n\n**[[K]]**",

The plaintext and ciphertext are both strings of uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces. In this cipher, each character is encrypted or decrypted based on its position on discs. The rule defines how the outer and inner discs rotate.\n\nIn encryption, each character in the plaintext is replaced with the corresponding character on the inner disc. After encrypting `period` characters, the inner disc rotates to the right by `increment` characters. During decryption, each character in the ciphertext is replaced with the corresponding character on the outer disc. After decrypting `period` characters, the inner disc rotates to the right by `increment` characters.\n\nThe `increment` value rotates the inner disc the required number of characters and the `period` determines the number of characters that will be encrypted/decrypted before rotating the inner disc.\n\n:::info\n\n**rotary decipher.**\n\n:::\n\n## References\n\n- [Rotary Cipher][5]\n\n## Useful resources\n\n- [Wikipedia: Caesar Cipher][1]\n- [Caesar Cipher[2]\n- [Caesar cipher in Java][3]\n\n### Terms\n\n- [1]: Encyclopedia - Caesar Cipher\n- [2]: (Cesar Ciphe in Java)\n- [3]: [http://cs.uncc.edu/~cnunes/java/cs4500/s07/class/caesar.html]\n- [5]: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine]\n",

Please note that in the game,\n you will be presented with ciphertext, but what you need to do is decrypt the ciphertext into its plain text. In the game, if you make an error, you simply have to click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the game screen, but after each 5 correct answers you will hear \"correct\" and a tick mark on the screen and then you can continue guessing, and if you make 5 mistakes, you will hear \"incorrect\" and the cross mark on the screen, and your game will end. To restart the game, you can click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the screen. In addition, while playing you can see the results on the right side of the screen  after 2-3 questions, and you can click on the right side of the screen to send a correct answer or a wrong answer, so if your game continues to work, you can send \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" depending on your guessed answer. You  also have an option to make your guesses on the next button on the game screen, so you can continue to guess.\n\n**This AI is going to be added to a much bigger puzzle game where the player is the king of a country and if he can't find a way to encrypt and decrypt the player will lose his country hence his AI code can not be cracked or spoiled by different users.

Please provide the results for this activity.\n\n### Solution:\n**Encryption Steps:**   \n- **Convert Each Letter to Binary:** Convert each character in the plaintext to its ASCII value, which is then converted to an 8-bit binary string.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of each character and the fixed key. Repeat the key if necessary to match the length of the binary representation. This operation results in the cipher text.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**   \n- **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:** Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n- **Inverse Permutation:** Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n- **Convert Binary to Character:** Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent. Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n\n**Input (plaintext):** \"SOLUTION\"\n**Output (ciphertext):** 1111100111111001111100001110000001110010011100010111001011111001110110100111000110110010\n**Ciphertext (plaintext):** \"SOLUTION\"\n\n**Input (ciphertext):** 1110110001110110111001000111111100010010011100000011110111110011111000011101000110110111001100\n**Output (plaintext):** \"HIVERSION\"\n\n### Question:\nGiven the plaintext/ciphertext you have provided, please develop your own cipher text rule and encrypt the plaintext or decrypt the ciphertext following your chosen rule.\n\n### Solution:\n**Encryption Steps:**   \n- **Convert Each Letter to Binary:** Convert each character in the plaintext to its ASCII value, which is then converted to an 8-bit binary string.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of each character and the fixed key. Repeat the key if necessary to match the length of the binary representation. This operation results in the cipher text.\n- **Permutation:** To produce more randomized result, use a new unique permutation for any given plaintext.  The user will need to use a custom generated permutation as input to this key, which will make the cipher unpredictable. The custom permutation is generated using the users name and the month/day/year of their birthday. This will result in a permutation that is unique to each user.\n- **Result:** This would result in unique each plaintext with a unique ciphertext out put.\n**Decryption Steps:**   \n- **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:** Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n- **XOR Operation:** Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n- **Convert Binary to Character:** Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent. Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n\n### Question:\nBased on your final answer generated, write your own scenario (imaginary/real world) in which it can be used/applied.\n\n### Answer:\n#### Scenario:\n**Protecting Confidential Information in Sensitive Documents:**\nImagine a situation where you work with confidential company documents filled with sensitive information, including employee data, financial statements, project plans, or legal contracts. To ensure the confidentiality of this information, you decide to use a custom encryption cipher.\n\n### Input:\nYour input would include the sensitive document containing the confidential information.\n\n### Output:\nAfter applying the encryption algorithm, you would have an encrypted version of the document. Only authorized personnel with the decryption key would be able to read the contents of the document. This would be your output.\n\n#### Benefits and Drawbacks:\n\n### Benefits:\n\n- **Confidentiality:** The encryption provides confidentiality by transforming readable data into an unintelligible cipher text.\n\n- **Secure Transmission:** If the document needs to be shared with others, such as business partners or consultants, the encryption algorithm ensures the security of the document during transmission over networks, even if it falls into unauthorized hands.\n\n- **Compliance:** If your industry or work requires strict adherence to security protocols or is legally mandated, using a custom encryption cipher can help you ensure compliance with data protection regulations.\n\n### Drawbacks:\n\n- **Complexity:** Creating and managing your own custom encryption algorithms can be complex and time-consuming. It requires specialized knowledge and expertise to design an algorithm that is both secure and easy to use.\n\n- **Key Management:** With custom algorithms, you would need to manage and secure the encryption/decryption keys effectively. The loss or compromise of these keys could potentially make it impossible to read the encrypted document.\n\n- **Compatibility:** Custom encryption algorithms may not always be compatible with standard encryption protocols used in software, hardware, or cloud services. This could potentially restrict your options for sharing or using encrypted data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy utilizing your own custom encryption algorithm, you can protect the sensitive information in your documents, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and read the data. This can enhance overall data security and compliance with regulations, while also addressing the challenges associated with custom solutions, such as complexity and key management.\n\n\n### Solution:\nIn summary, the benefit of using a custom encryption cipher is that it provides a high level of security by implementing a more complex and personalized encryption algorithm. Potential drawback that using a custom cipher includes potential for mistakes in implementation or requirements for expensive equipment and specialized personnel. Overall, the use of a custom encryption cipher can be useful for high-security operations where standard encryption may not be adequate. However, it does require significant time and money to implement and maintain.\n",
