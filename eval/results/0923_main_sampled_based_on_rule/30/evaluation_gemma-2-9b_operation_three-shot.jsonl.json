The arrangement of the digits is not unique if we ignore the decimal point: For example, 2.008×10^4 = 2.0×10^3 + 8×100 + 8×1 = 2088, but 2×10^4 + 8×10^2 + 8×10^0 = 20808.\nPlease put the answer in a double square bracket like this: [[answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2081]]\n\n### Question:\nYou are given that each 2×100000000000000001-based square has a unique arrangement of digits when written in the 2×100000000000000001 system.

The first prime number under one million that satisfies this property, the first half of the digits are 11. The arrangement of the digits is not unique if we ignore the decimal point: For example, 1.1^2×10^502 = 1.1^2×10^502 + 0×10^501 + 1×10^500, but 2.2×10^502 = 2×10^502 + 2×10^501 + 2×10^500.

Assuming X is a variable with a value of 1, such an equation means X equals Y. However, since we're taking the square of a positive number, it's also equal to negative Y.\n\nTo answer this question, consider the relationship between positive Y and negative Y.\n\nWe can find such a value of X that, once X and Y are equal, their squares are equal. Even if X and Y are negative, this relation still holds. Now, we can simplify the equation X^2 by finding its square root, obtaining Y^2.\n\nRemember, we're looking for the positive root of X to get Y. Therefore, we can express our answer with a double square bracket following this rule: [[1_x]]\n\nThen, we must find the value(s) of x.\n\nHint: Begin by taking the square root of 81.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets: [[your answer]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-9]]\n\n### Question:\nFor a given X where X^2=1, using the rule X=X^1, what's its value?\nThe correct answer should be two positive and negative values.\nFor example: [[1_-1]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nSolve: 35^(36)=0.9\n\n### Question 2:\nAnswer: [[your answer]]\n\n### Hint: When X^(35)=0.9, don't forget to go through a series of calculations until you get a value equal to 36.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_0.1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nEvaluate the equation 4+(9 * 30) = ?.\n\nBefore providing the answer, start by breaking down the steps and writing them neatly, please!\n\nFor instance:\n4 + (9 * 30) = 4 + 270\n\n\n### Question 2:\nPlease also find the value that equals to ?.\nThe answer is a number. please wrap it in double square brackets, like [[your answer]]\n\nHint: The final solution for the example is 282\n\n### Answer:\n[[282]]",
