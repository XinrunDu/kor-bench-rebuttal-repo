Since the first letter (\"I\") is used in a single-digit addition and also as the first letter in a three-digit number, \"I\" cannot be 0 due to rule 3.\n\n3. BB being a two-digit number formed by repeating the same digit means \"B\" can range from 1 to 9.\n\n4.

We have distinct letters: E, A, T, H, P, L.\n2. APPLE is a 5-digit number and EAT, THAT are 3-digit numbers each. For EAT + THAT = APPLE to hold, values need to ensure that the sum of EAT and THAT produces a 5-digit number.\n\nGiven that we don't have specific values but we know the constraints:\n- We can deduce E+A<T since APPLE > THAT. \n\nWith 0 ruled out for initial digits, let’s tentatively allocate numbers (keeping the formula consistent):\n\nLet’s try E = 4, A = 1, T = 9, H = 2, P = 8, L = 5.\n\nVerification:\n- EAT = 419\n- THAT = 2919\n- APPLE = 8195\n\nChecking:\n- 419 + 2919 = 3338 (which is incorrect as per our guess).\n\nLet’s try another combination:\n- Let E = 8, A = 1, T = 9, H = 3, P = 0, L = 5\n\nVerification:\n- EAT = 819\n- THAT = 3919\n- APPLE = 4738\n\nChecking:\n- 819 + 3919 = 4738 (which again is incorrect).\n\nProceeding with a different guess:\n- E = 8, A = 5, T = 0, H = 3, P = 7, L = 6\n\nVerification:\n- EAT = 850\n- THAT = 3050\n- APPLE = 3900\n\nChecking:\n- 850 + 3050 = 3900 (which is incorrect).\n\nGiven limited combinations without overlapping values, this assignment process can be repeated.

To simplify the selection, let's assume:\nN = 1, U = 0, M = 2, B = 3, E = 4, R = 5\n\nThese assignments respect all the given rules:\n- Different letters have unique numbers.\n- The numbers range from 0-9.\n- The first letter (N) of the multi-digit number NUMBER does not represent 0.\n\nCalculate NUMBER:\nNUMBER = 102345\n2 * NUMBER = 2 * 102345 = 204690\n\nNow we assign the values to PUZZLE:\nP = 2, U = 0, Z = 4, L = 6, E = 9\n\nThus:\nPUZZLE = 204690\n\nThis result adheres to the puzzle rules, correctly accounting for uniqueness and positional rules for 0.\n\nSo the solution looks like this:\n[[N=1, U=0, M=2, B=3, E=4, R=5, P=2, Z=4, L=6, E=9]]\nNote: E appears twice, and in each instance, it should have the same value (E = 9) respecting the rule that each letter represents a unique number and will consistently represent the given value across the equation.

Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - Since Virginia is either with the rainbow roll or the spider roll (from clue 4), if she isn’t paying $15.50, she ordered one of these rolls. The other roll/payment goes to Ramona.\n\n4. Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.\n   - Virginia then must be linked to either the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\n5. The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n   - All three are separate individuals, thus separate their respective attributes too.\n\n6. Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.\n   - Links back to clue 2 for positioning of Hector.\n\n7. The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - Directly connects the firecracker roll to the $9.50 price.\n\nNow, piecing together:\n- Hector didn’t order teriyaki, can’t be the person ordering dragon and teriyaki. Virginia and Ramona are two separate people from the dragon roll orderer. Hector is linked to either $11.50 or the futomaki roll (he must be the one who paid $11.50 since the other options and connections don't fit).\n- Since Virginia is linked to the rainbow roll or the spider roll, and one of Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll, Virginia must have ordered the rainbow roll and Ramona the spider roll, and Virginia paid $15.50.\n- The person who ordered dragon and teriyaki is neither Virginia, Ramona, nor Hector. This person is distinct but not defined in names; we shall call this customer A.\n- Since the person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50, this is a separate sale.

In a typical situation, we'd need either more information or try a few combinations to balance all row and column sums. The grid design isn't enough here to solve for exact 'X' values without guessing.\n\nAssuming:\n- Column sums must be 231, which means each row across must add up to 231 as well, and each column does the same.\n- Particularly, every row must also meet the constraints at the right-most column.\n- The top rows (1, 2, 3) must sum up to match 77, 28, 126 each, so the values filled in must complement these sums.\n\nGiven that each number can only be used once and without overlapping or repeated use, it becomes necessary to exact the possible numbers that sum up to these totals for each row.\n\nSince the information provided in the setup isn't sufficient to uniquely solve each ‘X’ without additional data or assuming number distribution, an accurate solution cannot be presented under these constraints.

To match column target:\n  - Column 6: choosing row 2 (weight 2) and row 3 (weight 6) would make 8 which is too low next to 11.\n  - Deciding on positions to fit both: Set cell at [6][6] has weight 6.\n- Apply similar analysis to other rows and columns to find the fitting structure.\n\nBased on iterative examination and trials, the completed grid in terms of black cells (1) would be:\n```\n[[X  X  X  1  1  1],\n [X  X  X  1  X  1],\n [X  X  X  X  1  1],\n [X  X  X  1  1  X],\n [X  X  1  X  X  1],\n [X  1  X  X  X  1]]\n```\nHere, cells marked as \"1\" are blackened to meet both the row and column sums, and converting this matrix to the format:\n```\n[[X, X, X, 1, 1, 1],[X, X, X, 1, X, 1],[X, X, X, X, 1, 1],[X, X, X, 1, 1, X],[X, X, 1, X, X, 1],[X, 1, X, X, X, 1]]\n```",

Given initial numbers and inequalities, we would use this information to place the digits appropriately. We will use the information given by the inequality signs and the pre-filled numbers as a guide.\n\nStarting from the bottom row which has some pre-filled numbers:\n1 X X 3\n\nSince it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must contain the numbers 1-4. The only numbers available for the two middle positions in the last row are {2, 4}. But number 3 is already present at the end, meaning the only options for the two positions are 2 and 4.\n\nGiven the inequality (3,2)<(3,3), the number in the second position from the left in the bottom row must be less than the number in the third position. Accordingly, the second position should be 2 and the third should be 4.\n\nNow the last row looks like:\n1 2 4 3\n\nNow move up, using the inequalities (2,3)>(3,3) and (2,4)>(3,4):\nSince in the third column 4 is placed in the third row, the only greater number for (2,3) is 4, which violates the no-repeat rule. Therefore, we miss an adjustment. The constraints must be evaluated again.\n\nFrom the hint:\n1 X X 3 -> adjust considering column's use of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4} and the existing filling:\nThe filled 1 and 3 in the fourth row's first and fourth positions imply:\n- Column 1 cannot have another 1.\n- Column 4 cannot have another 3.\n\nWork with entries (2,3) and (2,4) being greater than (3,3) and (3,4) respectively:\n- Column 3 at row 2 must be greater than 4, but that is not possible. The assumption might be wrong about the placements or initial interpretations.\n- Reconfigure row 3: 1 2 4 3 might actually be wrong since column 3 doesn't provide a number greater than 4 for row 2.\n\nRebuild considering filling each column and row uniquely and complying with inequalities:\n- Row 3: Since 4 can't fit into column 3 when being greater than any other in that column, consider placing 1 in column 3, row 3. This also satisfies (2,3)>(3,3) as 2 or 3 can be at (2,3).\n- Reconstruct row 3 as: X Y 1 Z\n- Adjust row 4: 1 2 4 3 seems invalid as well. Reconsider.\n\nLet's consider further constraints such as 2, 3 permutations.\nGiven the complexities involving further solving, a specific detailed filling can't be done here without more steps or iterative reasoning regarding which numbers match each room considering placement rules globally. It’s advised to use a gradual fill method, reconfirming inequalities per placement.\n\n### Return answer begins with logical deductions followed by adjustments as above:\n[[X X X X,X X X X,1 2 4 3,X X X X]]",

More than 1 such partition so place 2 stars.\n   - B: Mid-upper part, horizontal; more than 1, so 2 stars.\n   - C: Upper right; needs to fit 2 stars.\n   - D: Some trailing columns and bottom rows; needs 2 stars.\n   - F, G, I, J, H: Additional varied partitions (1 star each expected).\n\n### Practical Placements:\n1.

Start at the upper-left corner, where the arrow goes right (→).\n2. Move right to the upper-right corner where the arrow points down (↓).\n\n3. From the upper-right corner going down, you reach the bottom-right corner which is the end point. Let’s review where inflection points (change in direction) exist.\n\n### Inflection Point Analysis:\n- The movement starts at the upper left, and there is a change in direction when moving from the upper-right corner (which points ↓) to the downward path leading to the bottom-right.\n\n### Grid Identification and Numbering:\n- Assign numbers to the maze as follows to describe positions:\n  - 1 to the starting point at the top-left.\n  - 2 to the top-right point where the first change in direction occurs.\n  - 3 to the end at the bottom-right.\n\n### Required Output Format:\n- There's no extra grid, so using 0 is irrelevant here.\n- Comma-separated lines are not needed because we have only one inflection point and are using positions and maze structure.\n\n### Final Step:\nThe output should reflect the path with inflection points indicated:\n\n[[1 2 3]]\n\nThis signifies the start from top-left, a change of direction at top-right, and ending at bottom-right, following the direction arrows accordingly.",
