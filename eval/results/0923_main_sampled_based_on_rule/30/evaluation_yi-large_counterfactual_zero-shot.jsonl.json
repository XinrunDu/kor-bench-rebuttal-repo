The space station has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists. However, in June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth and Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists. This indicates that such biospheres were not capable of resisting solar storms beyond G5 level, nor have they been operational for over 4 years (options A and B are incorrect). Option D is also incorrect as the story does not mention the detection of biospheres beyond Mars, only the success and failure of artificial biospheres in space related to Earth and the Moon.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- Option B (\"With a rectangular shape\") incorrectly describes SpongeBob's shape but does not apply to real-world sponges.\n- Option C (\"It is a type of plant\") is incorrect because sponges are not plants; they are animals.\n- Option D (\"Can drive a boatmobile\") is incorrect because it's an anthropomorphic characteristic unrelated to the biological nature of sponges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the characteristics provided and the best fit for a real-world interpretation of a yellow tube sponge, is [[A]].",

Posting posters and hiring private detectives could be effective but might not guarantee secrecy, as they would likely attract attention. Therefore, the most discreet and plausible method available, especially given the story's magical elements, would be the use of peeping bugs, a method that Madam Suliman employs to monitor others' movements. \n\nThus, the best option for secretly locating someone in this context is:\n\n[[A]] Use peeping bugs.",

This directly aligns with Markl's ability described in the story, who, as a magician, has access to magical powder that can create favorable winds for sailing. This option does not require the physical strain of paddling, as mentioned in option B, does not rely on weather conditions that might not always be controllable or predictable (option A), and seems more effective than generating wind at the stern of the ship, which could potentially be less precise or require continuous energy expenditure, as implied by option D. The magical solution is consistent with the story's magical elements and character abilities.",

For the Autobots, the leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a tradition that symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction. This is not a direct vote by all Autobots but rather a bestowal of leadership through a significant artifact, suggesting a form of meritocracy or recognition of qualities deemed necessary for leadership.\n\nFor the Decepticons, leadership is often attained through power struggles, with the most powerful or ruthless individuals seizing control. This process is not democratic but is based on strength and intimidation, reflecting the Decepticons' belief in the survival of the fittest.\n\nConsidering these details, the closest option that reflects how leaders are elected, or rather chosen, would be:\n\n**Option B: By leadership matrix or by strength and intimidation**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[B]]",
