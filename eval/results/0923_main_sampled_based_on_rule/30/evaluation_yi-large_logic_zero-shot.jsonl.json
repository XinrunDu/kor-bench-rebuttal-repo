This would make the first part of the expression `!p&q&!r` false, but since `p` is false, the second part `p&!q&r` is also false. This contradicts the fact that `E` must denote a situation where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect. Therefore, `q` cannot be true on its own.\n\n2. If `r` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Hangzhou), then `p` and `q` must be false.

This situation also fits the condition where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that Professor Wang is from Suzhou (`p` is true, `q` and `r` are false).\n\nNow, let's analyze who got what correct:\n\n- Person A: `!p&q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person A is entirely incorrect.\n- Person B: `p&!q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person B is entirely correct.\n- Person C: `!q&!r` - Since `q` is false and `r` is also false, Person C is partially correct because only one part of their statement is right (the part about not being from Shanghai), and the other part (about not being from Hangzhou when he is actually not) is redundant given our knowledge, making it neither fully right nor fully wrong in context.\n\nTherefore, the answer format with the correct assignments is:\n\n`[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: A]]`",
