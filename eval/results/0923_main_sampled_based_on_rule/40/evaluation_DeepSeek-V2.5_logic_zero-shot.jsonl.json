Instead, it involves confirming a hypothesis with different observations (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n\n2. **BC Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n   - The scenario involves a universal hypothesis (∀x(S(x) → W(x))) and its confirmation through different conditions (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n   - The confirmation standards are being applied in a way that leads to paradoxical results, as observing a white object that is not a swan should not confirm the hypothesis about swans being white.\n\n3. **LS Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n   - The scenario does not involve multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses leading to a contradiction.

The fact that the door won't close implies that there is a door, which is consistent with the speaker's knowledge. There is no indication that the speaker is withholding stronger information or that they know something stronger that contradicts the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle:**\n   - The statement is concise and directly addresses the issue of the door not closing, which implies the existence of doors. This minimalistic approach aligns with the Minimalization Criterion of speaking only as much as necessary to convey the issue.\n\n3. **C! Principle:**\n   - There is no lengthy, obscure, or marked expression in the statement. The language used is straightforward and does not require unconventional interpretation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement aligns with the **C% Principle** as it adheres to the Minimalization Criterion by being concise and directly addressing the issue without unnecessary elaboration.\n\n**Answer:** [[B]]",

It identifies sociology as a discipline that studies specific aspects of society (social relations and social behavior) and aims to understand and influence social coordination, development, and functioning.\n\nGiven the description of the intensional definitions:\n\n- **⚯ Definition**: This form involves finding the genus concept and differentia.\n- **⌘ Definition**: This form reveals the differentia from the origin or source.\n- **⚒ Definition**: This form uses the specific function or purpose as the differentia.\n- **Ϟ Definition**: This form uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia.\n- **☖ Definition**: This form defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n- **Ѭ Definition**: This form is often used for relational concepts and involves logical expressions.\n\nThe definition of sociology aligns most closely with the **⚒ Definition** because it describes the specific function or purpose of sociology as a discipline.
