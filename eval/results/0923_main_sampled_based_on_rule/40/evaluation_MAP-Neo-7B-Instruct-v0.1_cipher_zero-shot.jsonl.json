Combining these gives the encrypted message: `41516010203`.\n\n### Decryption:\n\n1. **Ciphertext Preparation**: The encrypted message is `41516010203`.\n2. **Breaking into Triples**: We break the encrypted message into the triples (4,1,5), (1,6,0), (0,1,0), (0,2,0), (0,3,0).\n3. **Decoding Triples**:\n   - (4,1,5) -> (L1_col, num3, L2_row): (4, 0, 5) - The letter from Grid1 is T.\n   - (1,6,0) -> (L1_col, num3, L2_row): (1, 0, 0) - The letter from Grid2 is A.\n   - (0,1,0) -> (L1_col, num3, L2_row): (0, 1, 0) - The letter from Grid2 is E.\n   - (0,2,0) -> (L1_col, num3, L2_row): (0, 2, 0) - The letter from Grid1 is R.\n   - (0,3,0) -> (L1_col, num3, L2_row): (0, 3, 0) - The letter from Grid2 is S.\n\n4. **Decrypted Message**: Combining the decrypted letters gives the plaintext: \"TRAES\".\n\n### Answer:\nThe encrypted answer, as per the provided rules and format, is `[[41516010203]]`. However, the decrypted message provided is \"TRAES\", which matches the expected decryption outcome after following the rules accurately. Please note that the encoding and decoding rules specify the output and input structures strictly, and the example provided adheres closely to those rules.
