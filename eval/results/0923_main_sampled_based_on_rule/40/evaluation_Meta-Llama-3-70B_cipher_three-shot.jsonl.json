Keystream generator generates keystream values sequentially which are then used to encrypt plaintext characters. The encryption and decrypted process is reversible and ensured by the deterministic and replicable keystream generator.\n2. After generating the first keystream value, the initial order of the cards changed as follows:\n   1. Card 54 moved down by one position.\n   2. Card 53 moved down by two positions.\n   3. Top and bottom parts divided by Card 54 and Card 53 are swapped.\n   4. Last card (29) is taken out from the bottom of the deck, and put into the middle of the deck.\n3. 1.

Demonstrate how the soleway algorithm you interacted with in KY104 generate keystreams deterministically. Which of the following options best describe it? Select the correct statement from the options given.\n   a. Checking the correctness of a decryption can indirectly confirm the validity of the encryption. That is, if the result of the decryption operation matches the original version, then we can prove that it is encrypted, although we do not know that it can have different encryptors.\n   b. The Keystream Algorithm is deterministic, therefore given the same initial sequence of cards, it will always produce the same sequence of keystream values.\n   c. Only confirming the correctness of the encryption, but confirming the correctness of the decryption cannot confirm the validity of encryption.\n   d. The Keystream Algorithm is not deterministic, thus initial sequence of cards is always same, it will always produce the same sequence of keystream values.\n- Current score: **2 / 2**",

Each character in the Morse code consists of a sequence of dots (.) or dashes (-). The dot . represents a short duration on the off state, while the dash - represents a longer duration on the off state. Both the dot and the dash are separated by a short duration in the off state. For example, the Morse code for the letter A is encoded as .- (dot followed by dash). To simplify data storage and reduce the size of the data representation, it's possible to map each dot-dash pattern to a number. For example, the letter A represented as .- can be mapped to 1. By systematically using numeric patterns for the Morse code symbols, such as .---, -.--, -.-, ..-., .---, etc., the Morse code can be efficiently represented by a sequence of on-off signals.",

When filling in the same column, we should pay attention to the presence of \"$\\#$\".\n \n ```M = [[0] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(5)]\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = False\nfor i in len(c) - 1:\n    M[y][x] = c[i]\n    if direction:\n        if y == 0:\n            y = 1\n            x += 1\n            direction = False\n        else:\n            y -= 1\n    else:\n        if y == 4:\n            y = 3\n            x += 1\n            direction = True\n        else:\n            y += 1\ny_direction = [True, False] * x\nfor i in range(len(p_list)):\n    j = 0\n    while j < x and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n3. It is a simple and easy process to obtain the ciphertext from the matrix $M$.\n\nDecryption steps:\n1. Exclude all special symbols (hereafter referred to as $ast$) from the ciphertext $c$ and only keep letters.\n\n```c_list = []\nfor sym in c:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\nc = c_list```\n\n2. Again, you can creat a $5 × n$ matrix $M$ to hold the letters of the ciphertext in order.\n \n```M = [[0] * (len(c) - 1) for _ in range(5)]\nc_list = c.split(\"$ast\")\nfor i in range(0, len(M[0])):\n    M[i] = list(c_list[i])\n\nfor p in p_list:\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(len(M[0])):\n            if M[i][j] == \"$#$\":\n                M[i][j] = p\ny_direction = [True, False] * len(M[0])\nfor i in range(p):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(M[0]) and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n2. Read the matrix $M$ column by column to obtain the plaintext.\n\n### Extended Questions:\n\n1. Q: Can you explain in details the logic path for the idea of the direction switching of decryption operation?\n\nA: The decryption operation can be viewed as an inverse of the encryption process. For example, if the encryption process reads characters four columns from left to right, the decryption process should read columns from right to left, as if shaking a \"snake\".\n\n2. Q: Do you know what encryption and decryption are?\n\nA:  \n**What is encryption decryption?**\n> The process by which code is translated into secret code, so that only the recipient can decode and obtain the original text, is called encryption, while the process by which encrypted code is converted back to original text is called decryption.\n\nEncryption and decryption, called cryptography in the field of information security for short, requires that the encryption system have a \"secret key\" as a \"password\". The recipient obtains the key through another channel and decrypts the secret code transmitted. Of course, the keyword must be kept secret from the information recipient, otherwise it will cause information leakage.\n\nThere is also asymmetric encryption algorithms, in which the secret key consists of a key pair including Public key and Private key. The Public key is open to anyone, the Private key is only available to the encryptor. Even if the encryptor wants the information to be opened only to some specific people, the decryptor can decrypt the text by using another Public key to decrypt.\n\nBy using encryption decryption, the secrecy of transmitted information can be safeguarded. If an eavesdropper intercepts the secret code, he cannot decrypt it without a special key, even though he knows the method by which the secret code was translated. Accordingly, it is impossible to read the plaintext sent unless the key is a clear text.\n\n**What is encryption?**\n> Encryption refers to any means of preventing leakage or interception of data. The most common encryption techniques include stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\nCommon encryption algorithms include Core Connection Protocol, Configuration Encryption Algorithm and Hierarchical configuration encryption algorithm.\n\nEncryption is the process of making secret codes or information unrecognizable and meaningless so that only the sender and the intended recipient of the secret codes or information know how to read it. The modern method is to apply some secret codes or keys to the digital information, so that by manipulation, the person who has the secret codes or keys can restore the encrypted data to be readable.\n\nEncryption can be defined from two aspects: one is to convert the file into unreadable content so that others cannot read it; another is to convert the normal content of the file into other contents so that others can only read them after they have cumbersome operations.\n\n**What is decryption?**\n> In cryptography, decryption is the silent restoration of encrypted information to its original, intelligible form, known as plaintext. This is usually done wit Pohz the use of the proper key, thus making the decrypted text readable and usable.\n\nDecryption is the process of reconstructing the original text from a ciphertext or intermediately text. There are two types of decryption: decryption by authorized users and decryption by unauthorized attackers. For both cases, the original text must be correctly translated into plaintext.",

A customer needs to encrypt the ciphertext to hide their messages and then send it in a group chat. However, on this occasion, they would like to notify a specific person of the ciphertext and hope that only this target person can decrypt the ciphertext. Can you design such a group chat notification system? Please provide a complete workflow of your proposed system, including instructions for sending and receiving messages using the messaging app you created, as well as an illustration using an instance of a message. Please use symbols like arrows for \"encryption\", \"decryption\", \"query\", \"send to\" in the illustration to represent message processing flows.\n\n2. Besides the system you just designed, is there another encryption mechanism that also allows you to hide the plaintext when encrypting the message? To answer this one, you don't have to worry about designing an encryption mechanism.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The design of my system is as the following:\n   1. Plaintext stored on user's local.\n   2. User send the plaintext to me and I will encrypt it using RN format.\n   3. I will send the ciphertext to the group chat.\n   4. One and only one user who would want to know the plaintext will find me to decrypt the ciphertext.\n   5. I use the key from it's admin to connect the user to the encrypted message since the message is only targeted to that person.\n   6. I will use the key on my server to do the \"true\" decrypt the ciphertext by OAM.\n   7. Then I send the plaintext to the person who needs to know the plaintext.\n\n   The most difficult part of this system is how to make a robust system not to break the connection between something that only one user need to know and the special key used to decrypt.\n\n2. Well, I will try to use the chat room to send and retrieve the message.",
