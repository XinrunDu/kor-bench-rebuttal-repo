Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. \n\nkeystream value: 14\n\nCalculate the ciphertext character y + x (mod 26): (14 + 13) % 26 = 3\n\nNow, I will look for the letter corresponding to position 3 in the LETTERS list.

Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`: SD####\n3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups: SDS## and HH## (note that the second group is padded with `#`)\n4. For each binary group (SD, H), do the following:\n\t* Determine the row and column numbers of SD in `grid1` as (1,3) and (2,1)\n\t* Determine the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` as (0,0)\n\t* Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` (1) and `l2_col` (0): 4\n\t* Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers: (3, 4, 1)\n\t* For the second binary group (H,H), (L1, L2) is (0,0) and (0,0), and the corresponding number `num3` is 1. The final ternary is (0, 1, 0)\n5. After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information: 3144 010\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n\n[[31440101]]",
