Mikasa Ackerman\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Answer:\nAnalysis for Question 11: The reclaiming of Grisha Yeager's basement by Eren Yeager marks a pivotal turning point in the narrative, as it not only discloses the truth to Main character Eren about the world and his family's role in it, but also establishes the United Frontstein Declaration as the guiding principle behind the protagonist's mission. This declaration stipulates that Eren will dedicate himself to \"uprooting the Wall Titans and liberating everyone condemned to live in fear behind the Wall from suffering and hardship for generations to come,\" thus setting into motion a new vision for society. The curation of this statement showcases the conviction of the protagonist and his comrades, and highlights a shift in mindset from one founded on power, duty, and hierarchy to a more humanitarian and egalitarian endeavor.\nThrough this archival security measure of recording the Reiss family's power of memory transmission, the history becomes accessible and functions as a tool for maintaining national unity, solidifying their leadership, and preserving the country in times of uncertainty. This ultimately leads Eren Yeager to becoming a figurehead around whom people unite to establish the foundations for a free and untroubled world, obliterating any remains and establishing a new \"era,\" which symbolizes a crucial juncture in not only the narrative of \"Attack on Titan,\" but also in the world of the story.\nAdditionally, the newly acquired ability to manipulate Titans through Eren's inheritance of the Founding Titan power acts as a pretext for condoning harmful behavior. In the pursuit of these newfound powers' use against the very Titans who once tormented humanity, the soldiers are unleashed upon the surrounding Titans in a deadly frenzy, resulting in an \"era\" where all \"will be changed.\" Without a doubt, the initiation of the tainted inheritance process lays the groundwork for a varied plot exploration and radical twists to follow in \"Attack on Titan.\"\n\n### Question:\nWhy is Titan memory transmission valuable for cultural sustainability?\nOptions: A. It helps ensure that essential cultural information is passed down across generations for the general population.##B. It provides a means of verifying the identity and royal lineage of candidates for succession to the throne.##C. It allows rightful heirs to gain control over the power of the Founding Titan.##D.

Your task is to determine the related conversion rate between some of the given conversions.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer n ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 3000$$ ) — the number of conversions in a grid.\nEach of the following n lines contains a number from 1 to n.\n\nThe last n lines each contain exactly n digits, each with values 1 or 2; your grid is a set of (n-1)-dimensional polytopes, and the first grid is the root of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint n integers, each of which is the converted value of the corresponding number.\n\nYou are an administrator working for the paradata exchange division where the duty is to maintain the conversion rate between identities of registered people. Some parameters are given under of pandas law 1599, as follows:\n\n• Previously registered people can convert between different kinds of identities. Mostly they prefer doing it for free, but some of them want to upgrade to an identity that is considered to have higher prestige.\n• The kind of an identity is just an integer between 1 and n, inclusively.\n• Even more often, a person who has an identity of some kind converts it into an identity of a cheaper kind because he would like to demonstrate how expensive it is to all his previous associates and acquaintances. $Starting with an identity of kind a, the type of an identity after sheared decrease by (a * b % n) times. . . Here crop refers to the previous conversion type, and b represents the removal amount. For example, if the identity is kind 2 and the removal amount is 3yo, the type of identity after conversion will be (2 * 3mo % 2) = 5 % 2 = 3.\n• Some other upgrades are paid ones, where an identity of type a has to be converted into some identity of type b. This situation will cost a certain fee that depends on the types that convert and the conversion path. Herein, fee is the fee for the upgrade or conversion of peoples from type a to a more valuable type b. Between A and Z, A are side value and Z is the highest identity value. As prp 1599 commanded, changes always happen in favor of the tackling party, so that ball is driven to the supporters of the next line.\n• The most popular kind of identity is the root identity. This identity is reserved in the hybrid origin system for insiders and administrators, which may depend on A. The maximum of A is A whole, which is equal to 5. Besides, a reputable A can control their identity well than other individual identity, and are often taken as the root identity.\n• Coincidentally, an upgrade that would cost n Luo can upgrade the identity to be exactly an identity of type A. Cocoons are exchanged at a rate proportional to the rate of conversion through P'.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of 3 integers n, k, and b ( $$1 \\leq n \\leq 1000 ~ and ~ k, b < n$$ ). n is the maximum value of the belongs to n identity b is the supporter belongs to b, and k is the minimized supported by idenbytis.\n\nThe following n lines contain integersbetween 1 and n, separated by spaces. This is the base of the raising tree, and it gets a person named by the identity of c who is now able to change.\nThe identity of indexed kinds can optimize their identity in other pillars in finite steps. This transaction in (a1, a2, ..., ak) is the sub-path involving upgrading bi\n\nOutput\n\nOutput consists of a line for each ask transfer activity.
