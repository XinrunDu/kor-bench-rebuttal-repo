If a is a multiple of b, the result is a/b + 2. If b is a multiple of a, the result is b/a + 2. If neither condition is met, the result is 24.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the operation rule to the given equation from right to left\nSince we need to find X, we start with the innermost operation, X※13, and work our way outwards. However, without knowing the value of X, we cannot directly apply the rule to X※13.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate possible outcomes for X※13\nGiven the rule, X※13 can result in three possible scenarios:\n1. If X is a multiple of 13, the result is X/13 + 2.\n2. If 13 is a multiple of X, the result is 13/X + 2.\n3. If neither is true, the result is 24.\n\n## Step 4: Continue applying the operation rule to the rest of the equation\nGiven that we have 19※28※4※(X※13) = 3, we need to simplify the equation using the operation rule. Starting with 28※4:\n- Since 28 is a multiple of 4, 28※4 = 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate 19※9\n- Since 19 is not a multiple of 9 and 9 is not a multiple of 19, 19※9 = 24.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the overall equation with the results from steps 4 and 5\nNow we have 24※(X※13) = 3. According to the rule, if 24 is not a multiple of (X※13) and (X※13) is not a multiple of 24, the result is 24, which contradicts our equation. Thus, (X※13) must be a multiple of 24 or 24 must be a multiple of (X※13) for the result to be 3.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the possible outcomes for X※13 in the context of step 6\nGiven that 24※(X※13) = 3, and considering the rule:\n- If (X※13) is a multiple of 24, then 3 = (X※13)/24 + 2, implying (X※13) = 24.\n- If 24 is a multiple of (X※13), then (X※13) must be a factor of 24 that results in a quotient of 1 when 24 is divided by it, to satisfy the equation 3 = 24/(X※13) + 2.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for X based on step 7\nGiven (X※13) = 24, and the rule:\n- The only scenario where X※13 results in a number that fits our equation without directly knowing X is when neither X is a multiple of 13 nor 13 is a multiple of X, leading to the result of 24.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the value of X based on step 8\nFor X※13 to equal 24 (according to the rule that if neither is a multiple of the other, the result is 24), X cannot be a multiple of 13, and 13 cannot be a multiple of X.\n\n## Step 10: Recognize the limitation in directly calculating X from step 9\nGiven the constraints, we cannot directly solve for a specific value of X that makes X※13 equal to 24 under the rule's conditions, as it would require X to be in a specific relationship with 13 that leads to an outcome of 24.\n\n## Step 11: Realize the error in the direct application of step 8's conclusion to solve for X\nSince the outcome of 24 from X※13 does not follow the usual arithmetic to solve for X directly, and considering the constraints of the operation, we must look for a value of X that when plugged into the equation does not contradict the rule's conditions.\n\n## Step 12: Re-evaluate the approach for solving X based on the constraints of the problem\nGiven the operation's definition and the constraint that both a and b are integers, and considering the equation 24※(X※13) = 3, we recognize that we must look for a scenario where (X※13) results in a number that when used in the operation with 24, yields 3.\n\n## Step 13: Identify the correct relationship for (X※13) to satisfy the overall equation\nGiven that 24※(X※13) = 3, we deduce (X※13) must be such that when 24 is divided by it and then added to 2, the result is 3, indicating a division result of 1, or (X※13) must directly result in a value that allows this equation to hold true under the operation's rules.\n\n## Step 14: Correctly deduce the operation outcome needed for (X※13)\nConsidering 24※(X※13) = 3, and knowing that we need a result of 1 from the division part of the operation rule to achieve 3 (since 1 + 2 = 3), we understand (X※13) needs to be 24.\n\n## Step 15: Realize the oversight in the approach to directly solve for X from the operation's outcome\nGiven that (X※13) needs to equal 24, and according to the rule, if neither X is a multiple of 13 nor 13 is a multiple of X, the result is 24, we realize that any X not in a multiple relationship with 13 satisfies this condition.\n\n## Step 16: Identify the correct interpretation of the rule to find X\nSince we need (X※13) to be 24, and this happens when neither X nor 13 is a multiple of the other, we look for an X that fulfills this requirement.\n\n## Step 17: Provide a solution for X based on the correct interpretation\nConsidering integers and the rule's conditions, a simple choice for X that is not a multiple of 13 and for which 13 is not a multiple, is X = 1, among other possibilities. This choice does not contradict the rule's conditions and allows (X※13) to result in 24, fitting the equation's requirements.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This means we first need to find X○3.\n\n## Step 3: Solve X○3 using the operation rule\nLet's substitute A with X and B with 3 in the rule A○B = (A+3B)×(A+B). This gives X○3 = (X+3*3)×(X+3) = (X+9)×(X+3).\n\n## Step 4: Substitute X○3 back into the original equation\nNow, we have 5○(X○3) = 5○((X+9)×(X+3)).

This simplifies to (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208, which further simplifies to 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the First Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 13 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 7x + 2y = 208 / 13, which simplifies to 7x + 2y = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Second Equation\nFor the second equation, 2 ○ 3 = 77, we substitute A = 2 and B = 3 into the rule to get (2 + 3*3) × (x*2 + y*3) = 77.

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4. Multiplying the entire equation by 4y to clear the denominator gives us 4 + 4y^2 = 17y.\n\n## Step 7: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation to a quadratic equation form gives us 4y^2 - 17y + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 4, b = -17, and c = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Plug in the values into the quadratic formula\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us y = [17 ± sqrt((-17)^2 - 4*4*4)] / (2*4).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression under the square root\nCalculating the expression under the square root gives us y = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 8, which simplifies to y = [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 8.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the square root\nCalculating the square root gives us y = [17 ± 15] / 8.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for y\nSolving for y gives us two possible values: y = [17 + 15] / 8 or y = [17 - 15] / 8, which simplifies to y = 32/8 or y = 2/8. Simplifying these fractions gives us y = 4 or y = 1/4.\n\n## Step 13: Recall that y = log base 3 of X\nGiven that y = log base 3 of X, we have log base 3 of X = 4 or log base 3 of X = 1/4.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for X\nSolving for X in both equations gives us X = 3^4 or X = 3^(1/4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the value of X\nCalculating the value of X gives us X = 81 or X = 3^(1/4). However, considering the initial equation and the context, X should be a positive integer, so X = 3^(1/4) is not suitable as it's not an integer.\n\nThe final answer is: [[81]]",
