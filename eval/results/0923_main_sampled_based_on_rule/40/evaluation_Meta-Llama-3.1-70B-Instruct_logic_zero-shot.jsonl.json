(p3||p4)=~p1 is a Level B formula, as it contains one logical connective and the connected propositions are Level B formulas.\n7. (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) is a Level C formula, as it contains one logical connective (&) and the connected formulas are Level C and Level B formulas, respectively. However, since it contains a nested structure of a Level C formula inside, we need to consider this higher level.\n\nGiven that the initial classification inside the parentheses already contained a Level C formula, the entire formula can be considered at least Level C. However, we must then classify the nested structure more precisely, leading to the understanding that it is one step beyond Level C due to the nesting of a level C formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct level is Z+1, since we move beyond the standard alphabet classification due to higher-level nesting.\n\nHowever, for consistency and adherence to conventional notation used here, classification beyond Z is typically kept to the letter hierarchy before resorting to Z+n, implying we didn't here explicitly use Z category starting point (A to Z definition vs Zplus): \nBased on further careful examination the statement in question actually is an exemplar of a Level D formula.\n\nThe answer is [[D]].",

In this case, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nIf p1 is assigned x, then the truth value of the formula p1||p2||p3 depends on the assignments of p2 and p3. However, according to the rule of the material implication (p1=::>p2), if the antecedent (p1) is x, then the implication is always ✓, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, regardless of the assignments of p2 and p3, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nSince the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is assigned ✓ under all assignments, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nTo determine whether this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze the possible truth values of the formula under all assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nFirst, consider the subformula p1=::>~p1.

If p1 is assigned x, then ~p1 is assigned ✓, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned ✓.\n\nNow, consider the entire formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is x, then the implication will be assigned ✓, regardless of the assignment of ~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is ✓, then the implication (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 will depend on the assignment of ~p2. If ~p2 is assigned x (p2 is assigned ✓), then the implication will be assigned x.\n\nSince the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 can be assigned x under some assignments, it is not a Truth Formula.

This means p1 must be true and p2 must be false for ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, but then p2 cannot be true. However, this creates a contradiction, so there is no assignment that makes the entire formula true.\n\nHowever, as this reasoning was flawed, we should create a truth table:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | x | ✓ | x | x |\n| x | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n| ✓ | x | x | ✓ | x |\n| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n\nYet, we actually found an issue.

using Basic Equivalences (2), (3), and removing duplicate `!p`, it becomes:\n```markdown\n(!p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n```\nNow we partially simplify the right side of the

'p' in S0 can be resolved with 'p ∨ q' and 'p ∨ ¬q' in S1, but 'p' itself doesn't provide new resolutions since it's simply a subset.\n   \n   b. 'p' in S0 can be resolved with 'p ∨ q' to give 'q', but 'p ∨ q' itself is 'p ∨ q', and since 'q' isn't gained from resolution of p with p ∨ q or p ∨ ¬q, we see if p can be resolved with 'q ∨ ¬r' and 'q ∨ r', it can't because the goal was to find something with 'p' and ¬p where ¬p is not present.\n\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   a. (p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q) cannot add new clauses (see iteration 1).\n   \n   b. For resolutions within (q ∨ ¬r) and (q ∨ r), we have dispensation that these two clauses yield r ∨ ¬r which reduces to 1 ( tautology) and thus it results to \"Plausible\".\n\n\n3.
