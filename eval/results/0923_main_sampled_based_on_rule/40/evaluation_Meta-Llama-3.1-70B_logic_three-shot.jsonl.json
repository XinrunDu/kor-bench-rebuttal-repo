The black pieces, of course, represent the protagonist, and white pieces represent the opponent. The game has no real point or purpose; it depends purely on individual ability. There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun. This ELISP code abstracts this meaning into a common language: if something does not belong to you, then try to seize it.

Relatives may display affection but often lack good intentions towards each other due to rational roots like self-interest. Only among friends does one find genuine care that extends beyond personal gains. Therefore, we conclude that only friendship embodies the true essence of virtuous relationships.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\n",
