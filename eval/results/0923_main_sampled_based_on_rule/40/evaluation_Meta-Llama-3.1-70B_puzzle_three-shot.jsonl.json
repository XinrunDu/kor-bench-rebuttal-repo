Our study aims to develop PretrainedLM models that can detect transition points in the maze and determine the best path to escape. We compare the performance of different models, including sentence-transformer's [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`], [`paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2`], and transformer-based models finer-tuned on our maze game dataset. The results show that PretrainedLMs can achieve impressive accuracy in this task, especially when fine-tuning on relevant data. We discuss the implications of these findings and potential applications of PretrainedLMs in solving similar problems.",

Now she wants to ensure her wishes are carried out after death.\nHer assets valuation report:\n1. $1000 in cash\n2. A dog named Hamlet worth $200\n3. A spontaneous painting by Stanley worth $400\n4. A rare fossil collection valued at $1000\nSues Last Will and Testament:\n1. If Sue's son Jack outlives Sue, he gets 1/4 (cash and other assets except for the fossil collection which gets 1/6)\n2. If Jacks wife Sue outlives Sue, she gets 1/5\n3. If Jacks daughter Stormy outlives Sue, she gets 2/3 of all cash\n4. If anyone else outlives Sue and is deemed suitable by legal process (like demonstrating loyalty, moral character etc.), the leftovers go to them starting from next closest relative till anyone meets criteria at split indices 0, 1, 4 and 3 respectively leavingSharedPreferences\nYour task: Implement a function estateLib() which takes as input these parameters\n1. inputArr(A list of Strings specifying inheritance conditions as per above, e.g. [\"Jack\",\"Jacks Wife\",\"Stormy\",\"Random Person\"])\n2. proportion(float) - a number specifying the fractional share each inheritor will receive other than Fossil Collection whose proportion shall remain fixed at 100% = 1\n3. extent(int)- The index up until which shares are to be divided among immediate family members before moving onto external relatives(i.e depending upon logic critera). Once this value reaches -1 no further inheritors shall become eligible\nWrite a Python function that implements these Steps:\n1. Initialize a variable named valuation_float_split that stores the total worth of all assets after they have been converted into floating point values eg if input was {'cash': 1000, 'goods': {'dog': {'name':'Hamlet','value': 200}, 'painting':{'artist':'Stanley','value': 400}\n2. Use a nested dictionary comprehension to find the proportionate shares of all inheritors according to scenaro 1,2 and 3(ie where extent>=each persons' index)and store them in a new nested dictionary named share_split_dict\n3. Calculate the amount remaining after distributing weighted splits based off Extent",
