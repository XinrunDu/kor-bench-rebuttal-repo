We have cycled about 5x in the disk since the beginning. To find the spot for which we deserve to cycle by 5, we must multiply by 2, or any period above 10. So C.\nUsing the displacement from the period from the second step. we move the elements from that position by an increment of two and obtain the starting position for the fifth iteration. We roll to the right the characters we save on the field with 0 characters, such as Z, and where the E starts on the first cycle is the starting position of the fifth cycle. We get A.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"KQUQMMJCTZRUEGLTXOMCAHYTUWVRSU\"\nperiod: 5\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\nAssume the text encrypts with plaintext: \"WE BUY DINNER\"\n\nWhat is part of the ciphertext\n\n### Answer\nHTISJOBSATHATEPA",

Can you find the arrangement of players by the results of the game? (P is the first to play or the third to play, the classic chess game means two people to play one pair.)\n\n**Input:**\n\n| Chinese | PCT  |\n| ------  | ---- |\n| 建筑色計 好勝拇神. | 240  |\n| 目用膠於覆仙門高. | 020  | \n| 高應忽即豐勞. | 421  |\n| 烹翁商膚 tud 亮打. | 060  |\n| 瞞密面從挑 anti 疤蹭國際. | 020  |\n| 珍困拭寧 ut 反加腳. | 643  |\n| 替歐瓦風本祝束, 另皺形. | 445  |\n| 龜九族人莫 dreamers 奪. | 040  |\n| 高應忽耳用膠\"| 600  |\n| 常你機 grab 禮! | 031  |\n| 山只_XML輕_. | 080  |\n| 瞞忍 隔速 horror 井多消. | 130  |\n| 兩假低忘早境資網反. | 421  |\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1. Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule\n### Encryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n   - M Z S D P\n   - K N F L Q\n   - G A O X U\n   - W R Y V C\n   - B T E H I\n\t - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n\t - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n  - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n    - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n    - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n    - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n  - Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n\n### Decryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n    - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n    - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n    - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n    - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n  - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n\n\n## Question\nPlaintext: \"CU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, the decryption algorithm also needs to determine which plaintext letter corresponds to each ciphertext number, which takes O(1) time. Therefore, the overall algorithm complexity is O(n) for encryption and O(m) for decryption. The runtime complexities of both algorithms are O(n) and O(m), respectively.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"くへ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
