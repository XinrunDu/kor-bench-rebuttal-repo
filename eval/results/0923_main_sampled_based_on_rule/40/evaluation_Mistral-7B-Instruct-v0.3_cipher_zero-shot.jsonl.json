For each character in the block, we'll check if it's \"J\" and proceed accordingly, or move it to the corresponding position in the selected grid:\n\n   Grid0:\n   | P | H | I | L | S |\n   | A | B | C | D | E |\n   | F | G | K | M | N |\n   | O | Q | R | T | U |\n   | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n   In this case, there is no \"J\", so we'll move each character to its corresponding position:\n\n   - Character \"X\" (12th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (3 + 4) = (0, 4), which corresponds to the character \"C\".\n   - Character \"T\" (20th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and two grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (2 + 4) = (0, 6), which corresponds to the character \"F\".\n   - Character \"V\" (22nd position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (1 - 1) and (3 + 4) = (0, 7), which corresponds to the character \"G\".\n   - Character \"I\" (9th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: Move one grid position up and three grids to the right gives (0 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (1, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"O\".\n   - Character \"T\" (20th position in the alphabet) in Grid0: We've already found its encrypted counterpart as \"F\", so we add it to our final encrypted block.\n\n   So far, the encrypted block for the first block is \"CGOF\".\n\n4. Processing of Block 1 (DXEHZ) with grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 5. We'll use Grid5 for block 1.\n\n   Grid5:\n   | P | H | I | L | S |\n   | A | B | C | D | E |\n   | F | G | K | M | N |\n   | O | Q | R | T | U |\n   | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n   Move each character to its corresponding position:\n   - Character \"D\" (4th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"Z\".\n   - Character \"X\" (12th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (down) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (6 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (7, 7), which corresponds to the letter \"A\".\n   - Character \"E\" (5th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 6), which corresponds to the letter \"Y\".\n   - Character \"H\" (8th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: Move one grid position down and three grids to the right gives (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 7), but we've already used this position for \"Z\". Continue one grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character lower in the alphabet: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 6), but we've already used this position for \"Y\". Continue one more grid to the opposite side (up) to find the corresponding character: (5 + 1) and (3 + 4) = (6, 5), which corresponds to the letter \"X\".\n   - Character \"Z\" (26th position in the alphabet) in Grid5: This character is already found in the first block, so we append it directly to the final encrypted block (\"CGOFZ\").\n\n5. After processing all the blocks, take note that we have a 4-character block (DXEHZ) but a 5-character encrypted block. Since the remaining positions in the incomplete encrypted block have already been filled, we'll need to append an additional character \"J\" to represent the missing character in the plaintext.\n6.

Rotate the inner_disk 5 characters to the right; new inner_disk: \"SJHFDGABCknMQWVYXZ\".\n\n- Now we encrypt the remaining plaintext (since periodicity is 3, we need two more characters): \"\". For now, we just store the first empty character as a placeholder. Encryption Steps (with placeholder):\n  - Placeholder character position on the outer_disk: 0, placement on inner_disk: 0.\n  - After encrypting the first character, rotate the inner_disk by the given increment of 5: new inner_disk: \"BCONLYXWVZjhgfadipqrstku\". Since we don't have a second character in the plaintext yet, we will use the placeholder as the second character, but don't worry, this will be swapped with the real second character when it is provided.\n\n- Now let's introduce a second character. Let's assume the second character is 'V'.\n  - Find its position in the outer_disk: 'V' is at index 22 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 22nd character as 'V').\n  - Now find its corresponding character on the current inner_disk: 'B' at index 2.\n  - We have now encrypted \"UV\"\n  - To rotate the inner_disk again, we continue from where we left off, rotating the inner_disk by increment value: new inner_disk: \"AOFNPEDQrmLTzyXWVzkjhgfadiSQ\".\n- In this case, there are no more characters to encrypt, and the resulting ciphertext for \"UV\" is: [[I, B]].",

Block Encryption:\n    - Convert Block to Bytes: blocked as ['46', '57'] (using ASCII encoding)\n    - XOR with Key: [(0b100100 + 0b00110100) for b in KEY] = [11101010, 01111010]\n    - Substitute:\n        0b11101010 (190 in decimal) corresponds to 0xCF in hex and uses S_BOX to get 0x09.\n        0b01111010 (166 in decimal) corresponds to 0xAE in hex and uses S_BOX to get 0x01.\n    - Permute: Permute the resulting bytes as (0x09 >> 1) = 0x04 and (0x01 >> 1) = 0x00.\n    - XOR with Key: [(0b00110100 + 0b00101000) for b in KEY] = [01110000, 01101000]\n    - Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted bytes into their hexadecimal equivalent: '40' and '82'.\n4. Concatenate: Concatenate all the encrypted hexadecimal values: '4082'.\n\nFinally, the encrypted answer is: [[4082]]",

        "response": " [[FOLLOWING THE DECRYPTION RULES, THE DECRYPTED ANSWER FOR THE PROVIDED CIPHERTEXT IS: CHAINS]].\n\nHere's how I arrived at the answer:\n\n1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 8-byte blocks. In this case, there's only one 8-byte block, so we have just one block (ciphertext split into bytes: [0x9A, 0x89, 0x99, 0x86, 0x93, 0x8C, 0x97, 0x84]).\n\n2. Converting Hex to Bytes and XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\nAfter performing XOR operations, we get the encrypted, but key-transposed block: [0xB5, 0x7D, 0x8D, 0x74, 0x8B, 0x6C, 0x7B, 0x64].\n\n3. Inverse Permutation: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\nAfter applying inverse permutation, we get the following modified block: [0xB4, 0x75, 0x8E, 0x75, 0x89, 0x6D, 0x7A, 0x65].\n\n4. Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\nAfter performing substitution using INV_S_BOX, we get the following block: [0x13, 0x0D, 0x02, 0x01, 0x0B, 0x05, 0x0A, 0x09].\n\n5. XOR with Key and Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\nAfter applying XOR with the key and performing ASCII decoding, we get the decrypted block \"CHAINS\".\n\n6. Remove Padding and Concatenate: Since the provided ciphertext doesn't need padding removal, we can directly concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext. In this case, the final plaintext is \"CHAINS\". That's why the answer is encapsulated in double square brackets as [[CHAINS]].",

        "response": " The provided ciphertext \"27ad\" is a hexadecimal string with 4 characters. To decrypt it, we'll follow the specified decryption steps:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext from hexadecimal to bytes:\n   - Using Python, `hex(int('27ad', 16))[2:]` will decode the provided hexadecimal into a byte sequence. But since the key length in this cipher is fixed, the byte sequence needs to be padded to match the key's length. Let's assume the key length is X bytes, so we'll add (X mod 4) zeros at the end of the byte sequence to make the total length 4*X bytes.\n\n2. Perform decryption using a bitwise XOR (different-or) operation with the key:\n   - Recall that the key is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3', which has a length of 64 bytes. So, the key's first byte (0x73) will be used to decrypt the first byte of the byte sequence, the second byte of the key (0x73) will be used to decrypt the second byte of the byte sequence, and so on.\n\n3. Convert the decrypted byte sequence back to a plaintext string:\n   - Once all the bytes have been decrypted, they form a byte sequence that represents the original plaintext. Since we're dealing with uppercase letters, ASCII values 65 to 90 correspond to these letters. There might be some non-letter characters due to padding, which can be ignored.\n\n4. Convert the resulting plaintext string into a single combined ASCII character string:\n   - Now that all the decrypted bytes have been converted back to a plaintext string, we simply concatenate all the individual characters to form the final plaintext string without spaces or punctuation.\n\nSince the provided ciphertext may be padded due to key length differences, we'll assume a key length of 16 bytes for this example to make calculations easier. So, the first step is to add 8 zeros to the byte sequence for a total of 16 bytes: `(0x27ad00000000)`.\n\nWe'll continue with the decryption steps mentioned above and obtain the plaintext string. However, it is essential to note that without the actual key used for encryption, it's impossible to decrypt the ciphertext into the original plaintext. From a security perspective, using the same key for encryption and decryption can be considered a weakness because it simplifies potential attacks on the encrypted data.\n\nIn any case, the decrypted plaintext, represented in double square brackets as you requested, cannot be provided since we don't have the key to decrypt the provided ciphertext in this example.
