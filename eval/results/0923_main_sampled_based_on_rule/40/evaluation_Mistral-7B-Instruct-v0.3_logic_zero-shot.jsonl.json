So, the answer is neither.\n\n(2) For this formula, we will consider the following cases:\n\nIf p1 is true (✓) and p1 is equal to its negation (~p1), then p1=::>~p1 evaluates as false. If ~p2 is true (✓), then the overall formula evaluates as true due to the \"if...then\" rule (p1=::>~p2).\n\nHowever, if p1 is false (x) and p1 is equal to its negation (~p1), then p1=::>~p1 evaluates as true.

        "response": " [A];[B]\n\nExplanation:\n1. The formula ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. We can check this by providing different true/false assignments to the propositions p1, p2:\n   - If p1 is true and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is false (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to false, and & requires both operands to be true to produce true).\n   - If p1 is false and p2 is true, then ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is true (since ~(p1=::>p2) evaluates to true, and & requires only one operand to be true to produce true).\n   - There are no assignments for which the formula would be always true or always false, making it neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\n2. The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is a Truth Formula if and only if the equations p1 = ~p1 & ~p2 and p3 = ~p1 & ~p2 hold true simultaneously. To find valid assignments, we need to consider all possible truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n   - If p1 is true, then ~p1 is false, and ~p1 & ~p2 can only evaluate to false if p2 is true. Thus, p3 must be false under this assignment, which does not satisfy the equation p3 = ~p1 & ~p2.\n   - If p1 is false, then ~p1 is true, and any assignment of p2 and p3 will not violate the equation. However, since ~p1 is true, the parentheses are not needed, and this formula simplifies to the self-equivalent formula p2, which is not a Truth nor Falsehood formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is [A];[B], where:\n- (1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n- (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is neither a Truth nor Falsehood formula.",

Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2. Applying the same process for question (2), check if the formulas on both sides can be simplified to become equivalent:\n\n   (2-a) Can we transform !(p=q) into (p|q)&!(p&q)?\n   - According to (2), we know that !(p=q) equals (p|q)&!(p&q).\n\n   (2-b) Is it possible to transform (p|q)&!(p&q) into !(p=q)?\n   - Yes, it is possible. Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid.",
