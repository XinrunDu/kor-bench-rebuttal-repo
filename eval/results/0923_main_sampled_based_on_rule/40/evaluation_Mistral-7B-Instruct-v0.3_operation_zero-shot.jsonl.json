If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\n\nGiven the equation 25※X※14 = 4, we can start by deducing the relationship between 25, X, and 14.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 could be on the inside of the repeated operation, and we'd have 25 modifications (one per occurrence of the repeated operation). However, this would result in a multiplication of 25 raised to an undefined power, which is impossible. So, X must not be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, 25 also cannot be a multiple of X or 14, as it would violate the given equation.\n\nNow, it's time to see if X is a multiple of 14. If it were, then the repeated operation would result in 14 being on the inside, and again, there would be 14 modifications (one for each occurrence of the repeated operation). This would lead to 14 * (14/X + 2) = 4.\n\nSolving for X would give us X = 14 / (1 - 4/14). Calculate this to find that X = 3.\n\nHowever, since we cannot exclude the possibility that 25 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 14, then we must consider the last case of the rule, a※b = 24. This means that 25※X∗14 = 24 * X * 14 because neither 25, X, nor 14 are multiples of each other. Simplifying the equation gives us: 25 * X * 14 = 24 * 196. Solving for X gives us multiple solutions:\n\n* X = 196 / (25 * 14) = 8/11\n* X = 4*196 / (25 * 14) = 16/11\n* X = 9*196 / (25 * 14) = 72/11\n* X = 24*196 / (25 * 14) = 316/11\n\nSince X must be an integer but we only have fractional values as possibilities, those options are not valid and our initial solution (X=3) remains the only viable answer.\n\nTherefore, [[X=3]].",

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]].",

Let's find the double integral, after which we can simplify the expression:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x from 0 to 1:\n- With respect to x, the integral gives us the sum of the area under the x + y curve for x ranging from 0 to 1.\n- We can break this up into two integrals, one for y = 0 and the other for 0 < y < 2.\n  * For y = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (1)(1/2)=0.5\n  * For 0 < y < 2, the area is the integral of y dx (y^2/2) from 0 to 1, which evaluates to (1/2)(1-0)=0.5\n\nSo, for a given y from 0 to 2, a half of the area is 0.5. Now we'll find the integral with respect to y:\n\n- With respect to y, the integral gives us the sum of those areas for y ranging from 0 to 2.\n- Again, we can break this up into two integrals, one for x = 0 and the other for 0 < x < 1.\n  * For x = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (2)(0)=0\n  * For 0 < x < 1, the area is the integral of x dy (x^2/2) from 0 to 2, which evaluates to (2)(2 - 0)=4\n\nSo, for all x from 0 to 1, the corresponding area is 4. Now we can calculate the total area by multiplying the area for x with the area for y, giving us 0.5 * 4 = 2.\n\nHowever, doing this calculation involves some unnecessary intermediate steps because it duplicates the integration process. Instead, we can immediately find the repeated integral by setting up a double integral from the start:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x and y over D (0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 2):\n\n- Applying the definition of the double integral, we find that the result is simply the sum of the area under the curve of x + y for all points (x, y) within the rectangle D.\n- In total, there are two unique points within D: (0, 0) and (1, 2).\n- Computing the area for each of these points, we find (0 + 0) + (1 + 2) = 3.\n\nThus, the final answer should be [[3]]",
