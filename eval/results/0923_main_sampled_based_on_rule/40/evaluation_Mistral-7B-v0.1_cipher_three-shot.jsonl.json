Encryption should produce ciphertext and decryption should produce a 12-character plaintext with 8100 elements, and decryption should have invalid characters, which should produce an anomaly response.\n\n### Answer:\n- What are the allowed character sets for plaintext?: english upper case letters (e.g. A-Z)\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of plaintext?: 2-100 characters\n- What are the allowed character sets for ciphertext?: digits (e.g. 0-9)\n- What are the maximum and minimum lengths of ciphertext?: 2-100 numbers\n- what is the anomaly response?: WRONG ANSWER!\n\n### Question:\nFree Q&A and errors.
