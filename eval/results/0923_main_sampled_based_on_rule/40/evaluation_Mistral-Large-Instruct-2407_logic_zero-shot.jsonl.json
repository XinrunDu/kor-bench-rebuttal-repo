Therefore, this is denoted as \\(m0\\).\n2. \\(¬p∧¬q∧r\\) corresponds to the binary number \\(001\\), which is hexadecimal \\(1\\).

Each term represents a paired conjunctive term.\n\n### Denotation of Paired Conjunctive Terms:\nLet's denote each paired conjunctive term:\n1. \\( \\neg p \\land \\neg q \\land r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 001, which is 1 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m1 \\).\n2. \\( \\neg p \\land q \\land \\neg r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 010, which is 2 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m2 \\).\n3. \\( p \\land \\neg q \\land r \\) corresponds to the binary assignment 101, which is 5 in hexadecimal. Hence, it is denoted as \\( m5 \\).\n\nSo, the formula can be denoted as:\n\\[ m1 \\lor m2 \\lor m5 \\]\n\n### Determining the Nature of the Formula:\n- **Tautology**: The principal disjunctive normal form includes all \\( 2^n \\) paired conjunctive terms. Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so it requires \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) terms. Since we only have 3 terms, it is not a tautology.\n- **Contradiction**: The principal disjunctive normal form includes no paired conjunctive terms. Since we have 3 terms, it is not a contradiction.\n- **Basic Formula**: Includes \\( m0 \\). Since \\( m0 \\) is not present, it is not a basic formula.\n- **All-Even Formula**: Includes only even-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 1 and 5 are odd, it is not an all-even formula.\n- **All-Odd Formula**: Includes only odd-indexed terms. The indices here are 1, 2, and 5. Since 2 is even, it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nSince the formula does not meet any of the criteria for a tautology, contradiction, basic formula, all-even formula, or all-odd formula, it belongs to:\nF.
