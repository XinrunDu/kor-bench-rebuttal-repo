For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11.
