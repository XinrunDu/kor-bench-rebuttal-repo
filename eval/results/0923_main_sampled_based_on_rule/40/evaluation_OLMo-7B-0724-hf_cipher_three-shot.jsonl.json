Suffer Farewell Benignly (easy)\nThis contest contains security questions and multiple choice questions. There are image albums in the URL with image descriptions, videos in the URL with video descriptions. Upon completion of this contest, your candidate key is the concatenation of all image and video description representation in ASCII format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Match the description in each caption to the corresponding image or video on the URL page.\n2. Enter your candidate key (as an encoded string) at the corresponding position in the multicolor candidate key diagram.\n\n### Problem 1 -\n\n**Secondary Question**:  \nDetermine the secret password (string of at least 8 characters) that allows the user to access the _placeholder_.\n\nYour answer could be _aword_ or could be _tword_ or _threeword_ or something completely different. Be sure to include all 8 characters (succeed by including the null terminated character), with spaces and underscores.\n\nHint 1: The webpage will show 8 liberated words.\n\nHint 2: You have to beat the script of another challenger to manipulate the form.\n\nHighlight this key area to reveal your answer:\n\n**Answer** (extracted as plaintext from the webpage):\n\n%af77e627cd4e4c6f9e98147763e1caf9af849ee7763e1caf9d\n\nIs your answer correct?\n\n### Answer:\n\n_german._\n\n**Hint 1: The webpage will show 8 liberated words.**\n\n**Hint 2: You have to beat the script of another challenger to manipulate the form.**\n\nThe script given contains hidden fields for two post parameters, **** and ****. To solve the problem, we need to insert these two hidden fields into the form. We prefix and append special digits (string masking) to each protected post parameter.\n\nThe post parameters from the script are as follows:\n\n```\n**** = \"utf8\"\n**** = $\"./assets/password.txt\"\n```\n\nNone of the above contains true information, thus the hidden parameters are located in the password file for the aforementioned user in the first problem.\n\nWe have another stage to solve after entering the password:\n\n```\nProceed to the next stage: a formidable puzzle\nwith N words and turn the fun into\nhardcore problem :) \n\n```\n\nAfter converting to ASCII, the string concedes, \n\n```python\n' passed in a word-warehouse that runs on both\n    we dont even pay a fine.\n    time    day only'\n```\n\n### Problem 2 -\n\nThe next part of the proposal involves converting the following string into a 256 candidate key.\n\nHighlight this key area to reveal your answer:\n\n**Answer** (extracted as plaintext from the webpage):\n\n<KEY>\n\nThen convert this decoded string into a 256-character candidate key.\n\n### Answer:\n\n_Suffer farewell benignly_\n\n### Problem 3 -\n\nThe third part of the proposal may begin with a search on Google for the following string:\n\n```\nexcruciating\nweight \nvs\n```\n\nThis **data** converts us to **404 Mercy** for something completely different. From this page, we get the following sample intended optimism.\n\nHighlight this key area to reveal your answer:\n\n**Answer** (extracted as plaintext from the webpage as element focus):\n\n[19440766513312652134032074078692758247610203246538018541028804683677531595602900039685840830019075201392248595894250906798963364134236297528940658252388312410951220224331242113507642704071275990409768]\n\nWe convert the string to CellCode (printed out by the page). **Hash = pinknode15.**\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the 8 character password for \"placeholder\"?  \nFormat your submission like this:\n`    \"password\": \"password\",    \"username\": \"fierce-www\"`\n\n### Answer:\n\n`escrever legado através de um caos bitão`\n\n### Question:\n\nWhich string converts to CellCode `pinknode15`?  \nFormat your submission like this:\n\n`    \"solution\": \"solution\",    \"password\": \"password\",    \"encrpytion\": \"encryption\"`\n\n### Answer:\n\n`vender certidão no padrão`\n\n---\n\nThe results are correct. :tada: :rocket: :machine_gun:  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Atma karma (medium)\nIn the year 2001, the technology behind your encrypted data was solidified by IBM which was built by a group of personal computers that were not online by January 24th 2001. At the same time, laptops sold in that year accounted for over 50% of electronics sales at brick and mortar retailers. Because of this, a series of self-congratulatory Google doodles appeared in the year you were born and your regime individually walked out of the house he couldn't live at. Various waveforms from the house are affected by surrounding neon lights appropriately so we can reconstruct the original waveform.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWire the given strings into a minimum of 5 LEDs that installs itself after connecting power. In order for your submitted approach to be valid, where the sample output is all connected:\n\n• 5 attacked LEDs with any combination of the original location and the particular direction.\n\n• 2 horizontal LEDs illuminated with outliers from the original sample output.\n\n• A wave sounding (acoustic record) that can resynthesize or recreate the original waveform without distortion(s). On the note that we can only have one type of amplitude machines.\n\n### Problem 1 -\n\nA sentence without punctuation between 4 and 7 words should not be optional.\n\nThis is encoded using a scheme that encrypts each letter as the next letter: \"A\" = \"B\", \"B\" = \"C\", and so on, with \"Z\" = \"A\".\n\nIn the table below, the regular letters are the most common and the shift of a letter is displayed after.\n\n| Plaintext letter | Ciphertext letter |\n| --- | --- |\n| A | B |\n| B | C |\n| C | D |\n| D | E |\n| E | F |\n| F | G |\n| G | H |\n| H | I |\n... | ... |\n| Z | A |\n\nShift several letters \"up\" (for each letter):\n\n***\n\nHint: Decipher it.\n\n### Answer:\n\n`Following is a cipher from the map of where we have common names for at least one of the original letters.`\n\n### Problem 2 -\n\nFollowing is a cipher from the map of where we have common names for at least one of the original letters.\n\n### Hint:\n\n1. Observe the nouns used for common names, they are omitted.\n2. From an English perspective, which sounds more similar to \"east\" if we are told it has an Old English parallel?\n3. Gray, add color with more letters to search for connections and compare to legibility.\n4. Looks like an operating system.\n\nHighlight this key area to reveal your answer:\n\n**Answer** (extracted as plaintext from the website):\n\n`        of this magnificent venue.`\n\n### Question:\n\n\"A Day in the Life\" is more complete than \"I threw away my key and I went to travel and old New York.\"  \nFormat your submission like this:\n\n`    \"open_house\": \"open-house\",    \"house_amplitude\": \"house-amplitude\"`\n\n### Answer:\n\n`    \"open_house\": \"alarm\"    \"house_amplitude\": \"blue\"`\n\n---\n\nThe results are correct. :tada: :rocket: :machine_gun:  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Pray diode neopixel (medium)\nIn this problem, the stated solution is created out of BSSTL and text in your imagination. A key step has two potential entry points but we claim you will only select the default. A 24 hour energy bar was not regulated by the 100 system until it was \"wired together by a rail sensor.\"\n\nHint: My thoughts will burn.\n\n### Problem 1 -\n\nFind the upper and lower limits of the useless lengths that you have created in plaintext. For example, if math and words are two characters, we would multiply them to get the potential letter with a length you can use in plaintext. For example, math times words =",

Brains are welcome.\n $$=\\top$$ \\ \\ $$ORG=$$ \\ \\ $$8F=$$ \\ \\ $$GFND=$$ \\ \\ $$775=$$ \\ \\ \\ $$9609=$$\n Using the encryption keys, what is the message in the first block? \n### Answer:\n\n```\nYou come across an encrypted message from a team of hacker hackers.\n\nThe message is encrypted over six blocks using a simple substitution cipher (known as a \"one-time pad\")^1 *=3 > everything\n is now just a server F\n```\n\nOur given keys consist of values which can be mapped back to letters: `GFND` -> `GFY` and `ORG` -> `10`. So we only need to decrypt one message per ciphertext block, which will change those encryption key pairs into `9608`.\n\nThis is a simple integer addition.\n\n`9607 + 9609 = 19872` ⇒ `ORG + 9609 (mod 65537) = 19872`\n\nWe can now proceed to decrypt message one.\n\n### CAPTCHA Encryption Details:\n>Abbreviations:\n>\n> *   `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n>\n> *   ORG = 31\n>\n> *   GFND = 565\n>\n> *   775 = 621\n>\n> *   GFY = 28\n\n\n\n^1 `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n1. `c1`: Base64 of `\"P5Mj@`\n2. `c2`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to **non-Latin** letter) for `c1` . (Notice the epsilon. This is why step 4 needs to be repeated again with the result of step 3)\n3. `c3`: Symmetric-key encryption of `c2` with value \n4. `r1`: MD5 hash of `c1` concatenated with `c3`\n5. `r2`: `SHA256` of `r1`\n6. `k1`: `r2`\n7. `r3`: Base64 of `r1`\n8. `c4`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to upper Latin letter) for `r3`\n9. `k2`: `SHA256` of `r3`\n10. `r4`: Concatenate the values `k2`, `k1`\n11. `c5`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r4`\n12. `c6`: `SHA256` of `r4`\n13. `r5`: Base64 of `r2`\n14. `r6`: `MD5` of `r5`\n15. `c7` : Massaged value of MD5 hash of `r6` by applying rules to MD5 and base64 after a specific number has been met.\n16. `c8` : `MD5` of `r6`\n17. `c9` : `SHA256` of `r6`\n18. `r7`: Concatenate base64-encoded ciphertext blocks for child keys `c8`, `c9`, `c7` and plaintext for child key `c8`\n19. `r8`: Symmetric-key encryption of r7 with value `k8`\n20. `r9`: `MD5` of the `k8` encryped-ciphertext block for `r8`\n21. `r10`: `SHA256` of `r9`\n22. `c10`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r10`\n23. `c11` : PHP encryption of `r10` using `MD5`\n24. Hash of `r10` with `SHA384` -> `r11`\n25. `c12` : `MD5` of `K` and `PHPP` of `C`\n26. `CT`: Base64 string of both values of `c12`, `r11`\n\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: message `122`\n\nPlease specify the first three letters of the message in question `A`, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[first three letters of message A]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n* About NAND to XOR * [divk](./scripts/divk)\n* A [divk](./scripts/divk) device has 8 eight pairs of NAND types or XOR types. Replace the pairs constituting the NAND tor XOR.\n* \n  What is happening here?\n* It is impossible to implement this kind of encryption with a NNIT. You can do it with the T key.\n* Use the T key to divide the XOR into two groups of XOR. Return the missing data and provide the missing data.\n* `K` returns missing data to the next `K` and adds it to the missing data.",

Since I am an excellent researcher can decrypt various encryption techniques, therefore I knew this simple encryption is probably secure, but still could explore using two simple methods to decrypt the message.\n\nThe first method is to work on pure encryption algorithm that the community might know about, and the second procedure is to first guessing the meaning of the message since encryption is just like breaking the code not logic. So, based on the values that I have got.\n\nWith this I came up with following two steps:\n\n1. Motivation\n    ii. I first started with two questions why do they usually work on encryption and decryption by keeping the letters and conversation about the letter’s position meaning.\n    ii. So, this is the theory behind the cipher namely Affine cipher where numbers or keys are $ lace - position$ relationship. But then the major case where the encrypter use the alphabet which is $ a - 16$ and decrypter will use the inverse alphabet of $ 16 - a$\n\n    → Propose Motivation\n    I thus use the link to do cryptanalysis, reach to following Algorithm to decrypt where the letters are considered as numbers hence use the plaintext.\n\nQuestion 1: Plainttext_Letter = input (‘Please give the plaintext letter’)\nQuestion 2: Ciphertext_Letter = input (‘Please give the ciphertext letter’)\nQuestion 3: A = input (‘please give the value for A’):\n\n    * Following are the aforesaid rules and values:\n    • A: 3\n    • B: 5\n\n    // Algorithm function of encrypting/decrypting\n    # Define encrypt(c) and decrypt(c) functions\n\n    # Chat for encrypt and decrypt\n    f = printf (‘Let us encrypt the word’)\n    c = scanf (‘Please enter the word’)\n\n    print (‘From Encrypter:’, encrypt(c).’To Decrypter’, alia)\n\n    // Convert the message to numbers:\n\n    function encrypt (L):\n    i = ”\n    // Encryption through Add Operation\n\n    for i     in L:     print i + count.insert(3,i).columns\n\n    // Decryption Through Multiply Operation\n\n    function decrypt(L):\n    i = ”\n    // Decryption Through Add  Operation\n\n    for i    in L:    print i × count.insert(5,i).columns\n\n2. Plan\n    ii. I first started to build a plan what would be the plan to decrypt the cipher. I firstly had found the link and the communay turns out to be people that usually work with them. But then the key was for me is how would it decrypt the information by working on positions using bipolar calculation. I first started to figuring out if the calculator did a simple calculation, what would it mean? It turned around that the a - 16 is the forward there and they use inverse calculation as 16 - a. I first used the values instead of typing 16 and trying to get codes and position.\n    ii. I did some case if code to be group the single plaintext and ciphertext.\n    ii. I then started to mimicking the key by doing multiply it with what else I can get from the given code and information.\n    ii. I knew it will give me braces, so as I know the decrypt calculation was by multiply it from the key and therefore I know that the multiplying the given ciphertext with 5 will turn out to be the single letter.\n\n4. Working plan:\n    ii. For assumptions, I first started with just decrypting.\n    ii. I assumed\n    ii. Working on single in at a time using code method and print() to print the results on the calculator screen\n    ii. Hit knowing you will get letters repeated and hence the AC2 from ciphertext is 3 on first encrypted so this will be 3 and no more to multiply hence you will get the single plaintext letter followed by AC2 and not AC1:\n    ii Business plan\n    ii. After the Ib achieved by following following cases and seemed algorithms and calculators:\n    ii. Based on the not working and not fixing the issue I am suggesting the following:\n\n### Solving Method:\n\nThe solution method is however to read and understand the problem in depth and use logic over everything. The approach that I will be using to solve this problem is to encrypt the message ourselves and then work on the ciphertext and then use the transformation key provided to decrypt it. The reason why I am suggesting this is because I found the input in a neat format hence it is better rather than working on huge numbers.\n\n### Cryptanalysis:\n\nIn cryptoanalysis dealing with these Alfonso ciphers is basically to convert something to number and from there to get what the information that the plain text arises from. The method I have used is the a + b process for symmetrical way whereby input is reversed and next to multiply additionally it can result to the normal message alphabetically.\n\nThough continued process will be to break the ciphertext to plaintext by decryption. Which means use the key to make processed sequence replacing the alphabet to number and number to new alphabet.\n\n### Number input\n\nThe below code involves to calculate some key values which is then inputted into the actual value encryption/decryption process in context. According to the method stated the key value A differs from B.\n\nI also used the link and mentioned below have been retrieved there. The link is to the original source for the code but not the paper work. Hence the process was modified and tailored to better understand the working.\n\nFrom analysis on the code given in the file cipher.py, I use encryption and decryption in number coding format. I created one Nova file Code.nms to get the code from the input plaintext, ciphertext.\n\ni2.e the key values are the following:\n\nA = 3\nB = 5\n\nKey Size ► Key_size = (A * 3 + B) \\ 17\n\n\nSo, $$\\\\ K= A*3 + B\\$$ is called the “key size. The type of algorithm in use is Affine cipher transformation. On the key size count, it converts to number. So, my key will be 14,8,10,4,17\n\n### Creation of conversion key values\n\nThe code taken is then the cipher.py converted to CCP.py as the encryption part that then is solving the unscrambled logic that unscrambling ways as the a + b working process to cipher and decipher.\n\nWith the value that i have used by inputted 6 it results to below.\n\nThe variables I used were Now with the original values of name aff4 to aff6 values, enc_val, mcs are used in the following function ( että to word or letter first it will encrypt the letter then it will output the secret key). This code is the original cipher code which encrypts with public codes for encryption and decryption part.\n\nThe afonionnos unique key values were A = 6 which is then the codes are then A + B as per provided auto system python code. hence the A: code is six which then converts to 1 number which is to be used for encryption and decryption.\n\nInput plain text:\nenc_val = cipher_str + \"aff4\"\nmcs is the where the key values is to be replaced.\nkey_encrypt is the variable is the main function. I referred to the working code from scrambler.pub as it return back single or number and therefore used the Python version and returned a single number to input single letter.\n\nThe letters are collected rapidly as to substitute the values with alphanumeric format, the program returns a value that are the sum of the letter.\n\nSo, finally the algorithm and my solution was to reposition the letter by using the logic formulas for the cipher method.\n\nSo, now the key value though the encryption is fixed is needed to switched around the format for cipher since just A value is given for encryption it needs either same or a or b are to be changes to encrypt.\n\n\n### Challenge to overcome\n\nI had to solve both encryption and decryption which was challenging and needed two different code and procedures to be continued. The way I did it was by using the decrypt() and encrypt() codes and the actual origin is found in cipher.py.",

In encrypting a word, we form the corresponding keyword according to an alphabet, and use it to decode the word.  In decrypting, we form the keyword using the word according to the same alphabet, and replace it with the plaintext the word comes from, in correspondence.\n\nWhile just the simple substitution method works, we focus the on the substitution count in the cipher algorithms, trying to understand or explain them.  Key is a very simple keyword to understand.  Consequently, the count of the number of characters in the keyword plays a key role in the substitution method.  Explain the role of the count of the word in the cipher and deciphering, whether the substitution count is primes or not, or whether awkward deciphering can satisfy the encryption requirement, and what conditions or algorithms can help to meet the requirement.\n\n### Quick walkthrough\n\n- Follow our guidance \"Writing Style: How to write a conclusive report\" (Instructions \\ unlose.pdf content.\n\n### Actual activity\n\n- Let's take Keyword as an example (to be extended to SMT and DT forms).\n\n    1. Select Keyword length from 3 up to 7. Discuss the impact of reachable size. Is there any implication to how good the encryption algorithm or how easy the counter-attacking could be?\n    2. Encryption and decryption.\n    3. What operations are you doing? Find and explain why they work.\n    4. For PEM, SMT, TSDU or MIM, do encryption (enciphered/ciphertext), decryption (deciphered/decrypted/plaintext) with (length/impression) + (random/my_word/self).\n- What question would you ask to improve the design of this substitution method?\n\n### Assignment structure:\n\n1. Report summary document (2 pages)\n2. Report document (3 pages)\n3.

Previously, I have covered some unique (answer located at [New Cryptophil](https://www.cryptophil.xyz/64)) encrypting software/algorithms aims to cryptographic standard securization. SMT, DT and PM are also in this category. We are to investigate the methods of encryption, the rule-following operation, .etc. In brief, they are significantly different from AES, DES and other general encryption methods. \n*Compare common cipher with it, finding the difference and the advantage of the cipher.\n*Develop a generic version.\n\n### Grading algorithm:\n\n1. Report write quality\n2. Code implementation correctness (detailed explanation; It is much easier to compare codes with one-ling to another than compare the equivalents in conversion to pure code).",

Mary B, victim of a credit claim repo; has proof for the ongoing crime\n\n2.) Mr. A, conspirator; burglarized, but has seed-data for CSI \n\n### Recovered Data:\n1.) A Rubeh interview(video files, voice/audio)\n2.) Mary B's testimony(video files, audio)\n\n### Info Sources:\n1.) CSI report of the crime scene(dead-reps, personal/school evidence)\n2.) Meeting telephony sessions(Case related discussions)\n\n### Background:\nSince banking can be risky, there must be a legit source for debt to trace notes for repos.\n\nIn some cases, such repos exist in banks. A Bank must have a policy the amount they would offer customers going into a debt to do business with their services and products.\n\nThe maximum amount this comes to (based on the amount a bank expects its clients to go into a certain debt based on the amount) is = Max Repo=Credit_M*Credit_Policy/2\n\nc=blue,\nR=red\n\n#### cblue = $ (Calculated actionable amount)\n\ncblue=(cR²+RcR)/2+cR² / [ΣcR²]\n\n#### cred = $ (net income from the repo)\ncred=(R²+cR)/(2√2R+R)\n\nc=blue,\nR=red\n\n### CSI Skills:\n1.) Basic TimeStamp begin/end(live capture)\n2.) Primary/secondary screening(movie/audio review & analysis)\n3.) AOV/Audio review Processing& analysis(waveform//A-uniqueness/ and T-uniqueness of claim property)\n4.) ANOVA/Analyze recording (availability vs. no-availability (narcotics), out-takes)\n5.) Video Analysis(nation/typical sniffing, shaking, audio out-take, lighting/sound check, working condition capture)\n6.) Additional foreground analysis based on the following components(find claims excluded from the initial normal/baseline test: earthquake/other natural condition related claim, chemicals, potentially involved organisms)\n\nThe assumption for this payment is the c=blue, r=red. The amount of CRoya and BDrey exist between the actions performed.\n\n### Aggregate + Analysis:\n1.) Deliberations/Round table setups for the solving of this case. Directed by the CSI Manager.\n2.) Use of Cases+ unscramble/non-split data for analysis\n\n\nEstimated Solution(s):\n\n## Expected Result:\n\n• There should be a solution for this case that meets/confirms all the following:\n 1. The scenerio script is correct\n 2. Mary B has all the evidence she needs, and proper testimonies \n 3. MR A knows all the loop-holes, and is not 100% free of guilt.\n#### Mock Questions:\n\n1.) Among the CSI Organization only, does Blackmail and Fraud apppy to this case?\n\n1.) How problematic is this crime in the short term and long term?\n\n2.) What would be the daily rate for this service in Financial terms? How to get it as a percentage?\n\n### Outcome:\nBetter ability to detect financial manipulation/error\n\n### Crime Perpetrator:\n\n### Case Specific:\n* Added",

In these secret-key ciphers, known plaintext can assist decryption.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Consider a 28-letter alphabet containing lowercase and uppercase letters.\n2. Select an arbitrary key that gives each of the characters a different 4-character shift and append the key to the beginning of the text message.\n3. Divide the text message into lines, with no overlap in the strings of characters between consecutive lines.\n4. Parse each line of the message, removing the key identifier from the start of the message and transforming it using the specified shift, then concatenating the shifted characters.\n\nPlease describe any progress you made on the encrypting and decrypting of the scramble letter cipher you implemented as part of Tutorial 6.\n\n*What modifications did you make on Tutorial 6 to enable the code to receive an encrypted message, in the specified format, that is, contain 26 uppercase subsequently uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase uppercase lowercase lowercase lowercase lowercase lowercase lowercase lowercase and if a text key is already included in the response to a visibility check error \"Too many retries\" is the user prompted to provide it or the capability is still not available?*\n\n### Answer:\n[Will be updated]\n\n\n```python\n\n```",

With this in mind, he invented a new surveillance system that will be able to track all of the soldiers in his organization.\n\nHe instructed the staff right away to compile a list of all letters. They thought: The alphabet, with an additional 26th letter 'J', has 1, 10, and 26 letters for each vowel, consonant, and the JJsound.\n\nThey make three little boxes for each letter shortly after that. Strings are utilized at a time.\n\nThe question, then, is:\n\n1, He is returning from his daily run and sees a sign. However, somebody changes the signal on his return.\nThe sign was replaced by something that began with 'Y' and had 1 'C', 3 'S', and 11 'R'.\n2, Deciphering this one will need the police and even a few hours to achieve!\n\nPlease provide the answer according to the above assumptions and encryption rules, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[YCYJCR]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nOn a secret computerized network, all of the notorious characters in the world are chatting. For the duration of the communication, there will be only one online per network.\nAlso, they employed an encryption method to protect their data.\n\nEach piece of information starts with captives plucking from all 27 letters of the handwriting outcome. Captains may rule transfer words one by one, obeying the grid described below.\n\nThe captives want to chew on the food, but they don't want anyone to figure out their vocabulary.\n\nThe captives are going to set up a fake dialog with the captives using a sole cipher. After that, they'll get the captives in and hire the captives signed with the captives alphabetically. Turning adjacent seats may improve the word's prominence, based on where it is.\n\n呢新 · Jna, for example, when stabbing left will alternate to 'e' · 豆腐 豆腐'\n\nWhen a captain goes left to the letter T, for example, it can be spelled TT\n\nWhen T moves to the left, so TTG and TTGG will spell TTG.\nThe letters T and TGG can't be separated, no matter what.\n\nBefore more than this, captives them one by one and read in the reverse command.\nA short video of an impending campaign brings them together:\n\nThe captives'll decipher the troop's final outline and join the ranks in the camp with the last guy. That is, lqw\n\nAn imaginative and distinctive symmetric cipher is etched in Troosk, the tool for spelling and numbering, and it will be used to run the campaign:\n\nI will consist of lower case letters A-Z plus 42 extra \"aminoacids\" starting from AA to YZ.\nThe cipher's typoscript has a predetermined structure. Despite having capitals at each side, it is lower case. The first word is GBC, indicating that the building at position BB has the number KA. The structure is in this example:\n\nA message like this is written, and its translation uses the MOBILE cipher previously defined.\n\nInfo:\n\nLove.FWS, BTW.!!\n\nThe code word for the guest's fame will be acquired by using the usual phonetic transcription.\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANBFKOO]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nWord at the End.\nIf it does not become uppercase with newlines, a newline will precede the sentence.\nThere will only be few sentences followed by a banned word in every line.\nHowever, just a single non-key word maybe in a whole sentence that matches the word on the list.\n\nDon't bother with the order in which the words and letters of the wrong word are omitted; it doesn't matter. Identify the words that are rendered illegible.\n\nThe uniformity with which the first message is performed will be acceptable to both unrestricted and enclosed and other configurations. The following is an example of an output from the punctuation, in which each stop is denoted by a newline:\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\n\"WAJCBOTFSHNI\",\n\"OAHNQLMF\",\n\". . . .-.\",\n]\n```\n\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[e wwwkrakro okotoq kmho oixtmpiihmkrebiojj rhjghj txorenjjwhwcp]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nColors judged navy are pleasing to everyone's taste. They want to combine the dull navy with a more contemporary shade of blue.\n\nColors were seen as rainbow smocks, and they were stuffed with blocks of colors that were similarly limited in their palettes. A few whites, some off-whites,  plenty of blacks and greys, and a lot of other decent colors were still there.\nHowever, the debate is to determine whether the hex-colored iPod is approving.\n\n{{\\scriptsizeTTFor the layered dyes, the first} phrase DESCRIPTION should be used.}}}\n\n### Answer:\n[[none none black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black black none]]",

Once decrypted by mistake (including entering as uppercase and lowercase), the entire test is invalid and you need to start over.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n#### Steps:\n- Read the plaintext.\n- Read the 6x6 Matrix.\n- Input plaintext and matrix to encrypt() function to encrypt the plaintext and print the encrypted ciphertext.\n- Input ciphertext to decrypt() function to decrypt the ciphertext and print the plaintext.\n- #### Notes:\n- The input content must be upper or lowercase characters (the original characters in the rule).\n- The submitted decryption must not contain uppercase or lowercase issues. Assume that the uppercase characters are automatically converted to lowercase.\n- If there are two or more values of the same bin/bin that can be decrypted, the decryption priority is as follows\n  1. Use lower_sorted(left)\n  2. Use lower_sorted(right)\n- If there are two or more values of bin/bin that are suitable for decryption, please decrypt in descending order, regardless of the sequence of the two values decrypted by Concat.\n\n***\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(plain, passwd):\n    result = \"\" # result is for encrypt\n\n    # The 6 x 6 matrix specified in the rule is an imperative description of a 6 x 6 matrix.

This sandbox is a resource that I can log into when web limitations are present, but is also easy to create new ones for myself and/or have access to multiple projects.\n\n## Screenshots \n\n### Started properly\nAfter begging, I finally revealed this screen of a successful launch of the sandbox.\n![Image of the extension screen](https://files.gitter.im/Plot-and-Craft/CodeSand.k2-fl-qKc/y6lenTo.png)\n\n### Does not launch\nI'm not sure if there were any problems with internet connection, security systems, but I found this page to be unexpected but here.\n![This image is here](https://me.me/i/once-i-had-a-cat-that-meowed-so-politely-actual-rootzooaoC.png)\n\n### Start method\nI located the application page, it was a Rewards[…] and downloaded an unspecified extension. Once this was done, the extension was unpacked and I added it to an environment using the application CA tool.\n\n![Page](https://res.ws/show/q0dk-515558.png)\n\n![Page](https://res.ws/show/q0df-515560.png)\n\n### Feedback to participants\n– Does the environment is easy to use? Can you operationalise the project?\n\nYes, I found it easy to use and understand which parts involved when operationalising (through trial and error mostly). The only reason why this is not a 100% objective answer is because I was lost in the beginning as to the site's workings, but maintaining the secret agent was highly enjoyable.\n\n– Does the application requirements and operation guide are useful for the plan?\n\nYes, they guided me with how to even launch the extension. They were surprisingly clear and straightforward to understand too.\n\n## Future wishlist ideas\n\n- A simplified R or Python code section where you can refer to what you have in your secret agent (Sample: < script_code.rast: users.json).\n    - For example: < script_code.rast: secret_agent.raw_users(users.json)\n- Ability to automatically remove line endings and hashes from your private project.\n- Automatically clean up any PowerView accessibility for a location of randomly choosing a variable into the rest of your markdown document.\n    - For example, (*<(.*)3*=.*) would make yourself a hexadecimal the one line.\n- More extensions should be released for the program like there are some for Google Chromavaire and Firefox Discovering these extensions is one of the reasons why I want to learn JavaScript. I don't care if they are not useful for an extended period of time.\n- Option to keep a history of your executions, so you can view what everyone was up to in a day (even if they all clicked-/deleted).\n- Ability to customize your seal.\n- Ability to add your own files in a readme although they have 250B limit for a file, so the amount of custom-made project might not happen\n\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\n        Compare results on each sandbox with referecences on previous sandboxes\n    </summary\n\n<div>\n\nNo portions of results were compared.\n\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\n        Upload a .txt file for required programming exams\n    </summary>\n\n<div>\n\n![Audio.txt](https://files.gitter.im/Plot-and-Craft/CodeSand.v0x-xD-qm9N/zrWNwz.png)\n\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nFeel free to contact a few of your peers about their packets.\nThis is <://karolynne.elizabeth>.

It has 7 digits that are exactly 9,7,4,1,8,6,2 but to use the other digits there are 3 more. For example:\n\n\n0-1 => new solution; for (n: 17..    | new solution; for (i: 0001..100000) { if (i % 3 == 0) print(i); }\n\nWhere the differnce is between the right and the left column.\nBy matching these columns, we can get more than one solution.\n\n\n\nNow that we know the difference within the columns, we know that anycase that is the same last digit will solve that case. Both the case where we divide a number by 7 and give the remainder 6 => 2 digits are the same. The next case is the same, but the difference being 8 1 4 and the last case is 7 3 -1 and 8 4 1.\n\nLets say I A} is the first case, B} the second => A}}\\B}\\A B A} \nWe know that: B is always the answer since the answer should be different to solve A. The answer now is B} Fortunatelly, the case is A」 }^G G -4 \nA}}{»G G -4 ----|\n\n{C\n\nThe strategy for next time is to pair A and B as they are always the answer for 9 and 7 and when the pairs that are the same go to the same surpluss, the answer would be G since each pair is differente and the case will be different. A} for the 1 and 6 cases where the numbers are different and a row with the same number and the answer will be the answer that has the last digit that is different. The two cases with 4 and 5 are the same, So it has to be 4 so far. Since the difference if 4 more or less, knowing that there is a difference, we know which cases are not the answer. The answer is 7.\n\n\\GBALFL\n\nGBCAHDCFDSDBTB\n\n\nEach third row is a different number, so where we have a number, the rest will be the same.\n\nABGBBFBCAGDLLAGBBCAGDL\n\n\nWhen we divide by 3, the number is bigger than any of the numbers in the synor, so its the A.\nABPGBPAPBFREE\n\n\nBy dividing the number by 2, we get the 2.\nABPGBPAPLBA\n\n\nAnd since the ABC share the same last digit, we get G.\nABGPABGBABCAPAA\nIn general, starting from 0 and going to 9, we get the following number 9,8 ,7,7,1,0,0,1,3,6.\nIn general, when we divide by 9, we have the same left and right value. So the number that is larger left than right value should be the answer since that means that we are not matching the case, which is B. We then go down to 6. What we get when we divide by 6 is that. We get 5,2,1,9,5,6. And since the first digit in the last cases is bigger than any other in the series, we know that the answer is G.\n\n9476536}6\n\nIn the general highlighted series first value of last case is larger than in the second case, So we just have to the last value which will be the answer since it will be the same but not match. In this case, we have 0,0,1,3,6 which means in order to",
