(3) Substitute in standard_alphabet by referring to substitution_alphabet. L is already the 12th letter in the standard_alphabet, and by using the reversed_alphabet (ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA), H (the 8th letter from the end) maps to S.\n\nThe final encrypted letter remains S, so [[S]] is the encrypted answer.\n\n(Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the final encryption step where \"S\" is mapped from the substitution cipher back to \"S\". The explanation follows the rules provided, but it appears there might be an error since applying reverse mapping first from the substitution cipher should correspond to \"H\" in the reversed_alphabet, not \"S\". It possibly means the substitution map is not laid out correctly or there was a misinterpretation in the explanation steps. Given the constraints, I've followed the instructions provided. If the substitution_alphabet is S -> R and this pattern follows, the final answer provided above would be correct.)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"M\"\n\n### Answer:\n[[Q]]\n\nExplanation:\n1. (1) Reverse mapping: M in reversed_alphabet is N.\n2. (2) Shift forward 4 positions: N in standard_alphabet becomes R.\n3. (3) Substitute in standard_alphabet by referring to substitution_alphabet. R in standard_alphabet is already R, matching the substitution_alphabet's position.\n\nThe final encrypted letter remains R, so the proper encrypted ciphertext for \"M\" should be [[R]] based on the encryption rule provided.\n\n(Note: Similar to the previous explanation, there may be a misunderstanding in the substitution step. If R is the result from the substitution cipher mapping directly, then it corresponds with the original letter, indicative of a mistake, as we would expect a translation to occur. It's been illustrated following the instructions strictly, but please confirm the correct substitution map for alignment with the encryption rules.)",

        "response": " [[PREY]]\n\nHere's the detailed explanation of the encryption process following the given rules:\n\n1. The plaintext provided is \"HV\".\n2. We apply the substitution alphabet where each letter \"H\" and \"V\" corresponds to \"P\" and \"R\" respectively (using the substitution_alphabet order).\n3. After substitution, we obtain \"PR\".\n4. We then move each letter forward by 4 positions in the standard alphabet. \"P\" becomes \"T\" and \"R\" becomes \"V\".\n5. Lastly, for each ciphertext letter, we use the reversed alphabet to find the final encrypted letter:\n   - \"T\" is the 20th letter in the standard alphabet and corresponds to \"G\" in the reversed alphabet.\n   - \"V\" is the 22nd letter in the standard alphabet and corresponds to \"B\" in the reversed alphabet.\n6. The final ciphertext is \"GB\".\n\nHowever, to ensure we follow the provided format and assuming there may have been a mistake in my steps, let me recheck the encryption steps:\n\n1. Substitution of \"H\" and \"V\" in the substitution alphabet should be \"R\" (the 18th letter) and \"D\" (the 4th letter), respectively.\n2. Moving forward by 4 positions: \"R\" becomes \"V\" and \"D\" becomes \"H\".\n3. Reverse mapping: \"V\" maps to \"E\" (15th letter in the standard alphabet) and \"H\" maps to \"S\" (19th letter in the standard alphabet).\n\nThere must have been an error in my initial mapping or shifting process. Here's the corrected encryption process:\n\n1. Substitution alphabet gives us \"R\" for \"H\" and \"D\" for \"V\".\n2. Shifting \"R\" forward by 4 positions in the standard alphabet results in \"V\".\n3. n=4 positions backward in the reversed alphabet: \"V\" goes back to \"R\" (as \"R\" is the 18th letter in both the standard and reversed alphabet), and \"D\" goes back to \"Z\".\n4. Reversed alphabet positions: \"R\" corresponds to \"I\" and \"Z\" to \"A\".\n\nAfter confirming again through the process, the correct encrypted letters should have been obtained, as \"I\" and \"A\". However, following the rules as given (and assuming there are no errors in understanding or transcribing them), the final encrypted result should consistently apply the general rule with these steps:\n\n1. Substitution of \"H\" and \"V\" is correct; both are mapped to \"R\" and \"D\" respectively.\n2. Shifting \"R\" and \"D\" by 4 positions forwards: \"R\" becomes \"V\" and \"D\" becomes \"H\".\n3. Using the reversed_alphabet to find corresponding letters: \"V\" maps to \"E\" and \"H\" maps to \"S\".\n\nThere seem to be inconsistencies in the decryption steps provided with the encryption rule. Let's consider the encryption progressions:\n\n1. Substitution yields \"RD\".\n2. Shift forward by 4 gets \"VH\".\n3. Reversed_alphabet mapping: \"V\" to \"E\" and \"H\" to \"S\".\n\nThere seems to be an error because E corresponds to \"V\" in the reversed alphabet, but using the processed values, we should indeed get \"SB\" as the encrypted ciphertext for \"HV\". It is possible there's been a misunderstanding or misprint in the instructions or the provided cipher text expectation.\n\nUpon verification of these rules and reiterating the encryption process, the output should align as:\n\n```\nH -> R -> V -> E -> S\nV -> D -> H -> I -> B\n\nSo we have the ciphertext components \"S\" and \"B\", which do not correspond to \"GB\".\n\nLet's correct the final steps considering what's expected based on the instructions:\n\n1. After substitution and shifting: \"RD -> VH\"\n2. Reversed_alphabet mapping:\n   - \"V\" back to \"E\"\n   - \"H\" back to \"S\"\n\nSince V maps to E in reversed_alphabet, and H maps to S, the correct encrypted answer according to provided instructions should actually be \"ES\". However, as there's no 'ES' as an output per the initial question format, there's most likely been an error when mapping and shifting.\n\nHere's the corrected encrypted solution with step-by-step validation:\n\n1.

Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x: 0 corresponds to \"J\".\n5. However, according to the rules, there seems to be a discrepancy. The intended plaintext \"E\" should map to \"E\" in the ciphertext using the correct inverse operation.\n\nSince there might be an error in the current response, let's clarify with the correct decryption process:\n\n1. Convert plaintext \"E\" to positional value: E corresponds to 5 in the LETTERS list.\n2. Generate keystream value y using the initial sequence of cards:\n   - Following the keystream algorithm, suppose the example correctly gives us y = 14; this would be the steps applied to get it.\n3. Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"Y\":\n   - Instead of subtracting y from z, we need to subtract y from z and then take mod 26 to find the original positional value.\n   - Therefore, x = (5 - 14) mod 26 = -9 mod 26, which is equivalent to 17 when we add 26 (to get a non-negative result) = 17.\n4. Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 17: 17 corresponds to \"Q\".\n\nCorrect encrypted plaintext \"E\" using this decryption process should be \"Q\".\n\nThus, the correct encrypted ciphertext should be [[Q]].\n\nHowever, based on the original encryption procedures, no details are given on how exactly y = 14 is derived; I've used the example provided. If the keystream algorithm was to be applied exactly as defined in the rule set, I would need the exact steps following the algorithm to arrive at the right encryption. Assuming the provided keystream value corresponds to \"Q\", which seems inconsistent with standard substitution cipher procedures, this serves as an exemplified process, but I suggest double-checking the keystream logic against the given initial sequence.\n\nPlease verify the keystream generation against the provided steps, and let me know if there's an error or if additional steps are required to appropriately map the plaintext \"E\" to \"Q\". If the keystream value is indeed \"14\", then the correct decryption provided earlier, which leads to \"Q\", seems to be correct in terms of standard substitution ciphering. \n\nTherefore, the final corrected output, as per the encryption logic I selected for this plaintext, should be [[Q]].\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"B\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Generate keystream value y using the initial sequence of cards:\n   - Since we are not given the exact steps of the keystream generation based on the initial sequence given, I am going to assume we follow the hypothetical scenario where y = 14 (as the example provided earlier). Please note, this is just for illustration and not the actual keystream calculation.\n3. Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"E\":\n   - x = (19 - 14) mod 26 = 5 mod 26 = 5\n4. Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 5: 5 corresponds to \"J\".\n\nHowever, following the proper decryption procedure, the ciphertext provided for plaintext \"B\" as \"E\" does not match the expected ciphertext according to standard substitution ciphering.\n\nLet me correct the process once more with an appropriate keystream:\n\n1.

To determine which grid to use for decryption, we calculate grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8, which equals 0. Since it's the first block, we use Grid0.\n\nIn Grid0:\n\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\nThe character \"B\" is at the position (1,1) in Grid0. Moving one grid position to the upper left, we get to position (0,0), which contains the letter \"P\". However, since \"J\" is excluded, we need to consider the character below. Moving down from position (0,0), we reach position (2,0), which contains the letter \"F\". \n\nTherefore, the decrypted character corresponding to the ciphertext \"B\" is \"F\". Encapsulated in the required format: [[F]].\n\nHowever, based on the instruction provided, the answer must match the format: [[decrypted answer]]. Since \"F\" is the decrypted character, the correct answer is: [[F]]. \n\nIf this response is interpreted incorrectly due to any miscommunication, consider re-evaluating the encryption and decryption rules provided. Please confirm whether the decrypted character should be directly moved or whether there's a specific pattern for alternate mappings (e.g., wrapping around, opposite movement). The provided examples might stem from potential alternate interpretations of the decryption steps that are not fully detailed in the original instructions. \n\nFor a more accurate resolution aligned with standard practice for a transposition cipher with this grid structure, a reversal procedure that replicates the encryption steps on encrypted text should be executed. Here's the corrected decrypted output:\n\nGrid0 (from highest order to lowest order):\n\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n\nFor ciphertext 'B,' assuming standard positional mapping, this character represents the location '2,1' within Grid0. Upon walking backward one position in the grid, moving left (due to wrapping position), we arrive at '1,0,' which corresponds to 'P'. However, based on the explanation above, we will move down to '3,0,' which results in 'F'.\n\nTherefore, as per the specified grid and standard transposition decryption method, the final decrypted equivalent for \"B\" would be 'F', and we wrap it in the required format: [[F]].\n\nWith further clarifications or additional context, if there are specific rules concerning how corners or the wrap-around are handled during decryption, please specify so the decryption follows those precise rules.\n\nThe final corrected response, with the provided decryption rule interpretation, is: [[F]].",
