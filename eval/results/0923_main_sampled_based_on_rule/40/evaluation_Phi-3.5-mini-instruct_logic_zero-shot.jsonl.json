The only way for this implication to be false is if p1 is true and the conjunction on the right side of the implication is false. Since the conjunction includes p1 (a true part), it cannot be false. Therefore, this formula cannot be true under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\nFor the first part of this formula, p1 implies the negation of p1. This statement is always false, as p1 cannot be both true and false at the same time. Since the implication is false, we only need to consider the truth value of ~p2 in the second part of the formula. If ~p2 is true, then the entire formula is false. However, if ~p2 is false, then p2 is true, and the formula can have true assignments (e.g., p1=x and p2=✓). This means that the formula is not false under all assignments, and hence it is not a Falsehood Formula by definition.\n\nSince both formula components are false under specific assignments, neither is a Truth Formula.

However, because it is combined with &p2 using the AND operation, the entire expression (~(p1=::>p2)&p2) can never be true under all assignments (p2 must always be true for the expression to be true, but p1 cannot always be false). Thus, it is not a Truth Formula and it is not a Falsehood Formula either (since it's not always false).\n- The correct classification is C. Neither.\n\nFor sub-question (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n\n- For the left side of the equation, (p1&p3) is true only if both p1 and p3 are true.\n- For the right side of the equation, (~p1&~p2) is true only if both p1 is false and p2 is false.\n\n- There is no assignment where both sides can be true simultaneously. Specifically, when p1 or p2 is true, the right side (~p1&~p2) cannot be true, and when p1 and p3 are true, the left side (p1&p3) does not necessarily lead to the right side (~p1&~p2) being true (unless p2 is also false).\n- This formula is also neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it's not always false or always true.\n- The classification is C. Neither.\n\nCombining the answers for both sub-questions, the final answer is [[C];[C]].",

Initialize the sets:\n   S0 = {}\n   S1 = {(p∨q), (p∨¬q), (¬p∨r)}\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   a. Resolve (p∨q) with (p∨¬q):\n      - L1: (p∨q)\n      - L2: (p∨¬q)\n      - L1∪L2: (p∨q) ∨ (p∨¬q) = p ∨ (q ∨ ¬q) = p\n      - Since (p ∨ 0) = p, C = p (which is not an empty clause)\n   b. Resolve (p∨¬q) with (¬p∨r):\n      - L1: (p∨¬q)\n      - L2: (¬p∨r)\n      - L1∪L2: (p∨¬q) ∨ (¬p∨r) = (p ∨ ¬p) ∨ (q ∨ r) = 0 ∨ (q ∨ r) = q ∨ r\n      - Since (q ∨ r) is not an empty clause, C = q ∨ r\n   c.
