However, this process is theoretically how the cipher performs decryption.\n\nHence, the decrypted answer for \"DJWNCYEVVNB\" is represented as:\n\n```\n[[THESECRET]]\n```\n\nNote: This is a hypothetical result based on the decryption process described, and an actual implementation is required to confirm the decrypted text.

The alphabet is 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(excluding \"J\").\n2. The 8 grids are given, so there is no need to prepare them.\n3. We divide the ciphertext into blocks of 5 characters, starting with block number 0.\n4. Since the ciphertext is shorter than 5 characters for the last block, we will use padding at the end (not specified in the rule, but necessary to process the last block), but this will not change our decryption (as we remove non-represented characters at the end).\n\nNow, let's decrypt each block:\n\nBlock 0: \"GMKWV\"\n```\nGrid5 for block 0: (0 // 5) % 8 = 0\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n```\n- G: In Grid5, G is at (2, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 4) to get E.\n- M: In Grid5, M is at (2, 3). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 2) to get K.\n- K: In Grid5, K is at (2, 1). Move one grid position to the upper left to (1, 0) to get A.\n- W: In Grid5, W is at (4, 1). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 0) to get O.\n- V: In Grid5, V is at (4, 4). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 3) to get T.\nSo, after decrypting block 0, we get \"EKATO\".\n\nBlock 1: \"QPNWT\"\n```\nGrid6 for block 1: (1 // 5) % 8 = 1\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n```\n- Q: In Grid6, Q is at (4, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (3, 4) to get Y.\n- P: In Grid6, P is at (1, 0). Move one grid position to the upper left to (0, 4) to get Z.\n- N: In Grid6, N is at (3, 2). Move one grid position to the upper left to (2, 1) to get B.\n- W: In Grid6, W is at (0, 1). Since the position is at the edge, move one grid position to the lower left to (4, 0) to get Q.\n- T: In Grid6, T is at (3, 3). Move one grid position to the upper left to (2, 2) to get C.\nSo, after decrypting block 1, we get \"YZBQC\".\n\nNote: Since there are not 5 letters in the last block to process, we stop after encrypting the 5 letters provided.\n\nFinally, the decrypted message is obtained by concatenating the decrypted blocks.

Obtain the key by performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in the hash value '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. This will be used in the XOR operation for decryption.\n\n2. Convert the ciphertext \"27ad\" into a byte sequence. The hexadecimal string \"27ad\" decodes to the byte sequence 0x27, 0xad.\n\n3. Decrypt each byte by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the corresponding byte from the key. When the key sequence is exhausted, repeat it.\n\n4. Since the key is much longer than the ciphertext, we will only use the initial bytes of the key to match the length of the ciphertext. For the first byte of the ciphertext (0x27), take the corresponding byte from the key (0x73), and for the second byte of the ciphertext (0xad), take the next byte from the key (0xef).\n\n5. Decrypt the first byte:\n   - ciphertext byte: 0x27 (39 decimal)\n   - key byte: 0x73 (115 decimal)\n   - XOR result: 0x9c (156 decimal)\n\n6. Decrypt the second byte:\n   - ciphertext byte: 0xad (173 decimal)\n   - key byte: 0xef (239 decimal)\n   - XOR result: 0xd0 (208 decimal)\n\n7. The decrypted byte sequence is now 0x9c, 0xd0.\n\n8. Finally, convert the decrypted byte sequence back to its ASCII representation, which results in the string \"\\x9c\\xd0\". However, this does not directly map to printable characters, and in this cipher, the output is supposed to be uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces.\n\nGiven the specific notation and symbols in the rules, the decryption may did not produce a clear text result that matches the output format's expectations. Thus, we need to directly represent the decrypted byte sequence as per the allowed output format.\n\n**Answer:**\n```\n[[9c d0]]\n```",
