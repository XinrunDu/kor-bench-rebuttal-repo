However, these literals are not present together in one pair of clauses C1 and C2.\n\nSince resolving requires a literal and its complement to be available in two clauses and C1 does not contain ¬r, and C2 does not contain r, we cannot resolve directly based on this rule.\n\nHowever, we are looking for a literal and its negation to resolve C1 and C2. In the definition given, resolution can be applied if there are simple disjunctive clauses of the form C1 = C3 ∨ L and C2 = C4 ∨ L’. In this context, it seems there’s confusion or an oversight. C1 and C2 do not directly contain a literal and its complement in the specified form for each other. But closely examining, we have:\n\nC1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r (implying L = ¬q in this context)\nC2 = ¬q ∨ ¬r ∨ s ∨ ¬t (implying L’ = q in this context, though q is not part of C2, it can be inferred that L’ = ¬¬q = q)\n\nHowever, due to the definition constraints, literal L from C1 must have a complement L’ in C2, which is not the case here since C2 does not contain q (complement of ¬q from C1).
