Skill A opens the door, skill B uses the equipment, and skill C repairs the equipment.\nThe leader decided that each person can only perform one task to avoid errors. There are only three people available for the task: person X with just skill A, person Y with just skill B, and person Z with skills B and C.\nDue to privacy concerns, the company required a task order. Firstly, person A must open the door. Secondly, person B must use the equipment and it can be made for one last time if breaks down. Based on these conditions, determine the task order of the three people in order to complete the job.\nThe answer is [(the name of person having the skill A),\"(\",name of person having skill B)\"]\n\n### Answer:\n[[X,\"(Y,Z)\"]]\n\n### Question \nFour brothers were discussing a bet they made in the morning. They each expected a certain outcome from the bet:\nSon A: \"Son B will lose, Son C will win, I'm not sure about Son D.\"\nSon B: \"Son A will win, Son C will lose, I'm not sure about Son D.\"\nSon C: \"Son A will lose, Son B will win, I'm not sure about Son D.\"\nSon D: \"Son A will lose, Son B will lose, Son C will win.\"\n\nAfter the bet was settled, they found that only one son's prediction was completely correct, one son's prediction completely wrong, and two sons' predictions were half right, half wrong.\nIgnoring the irrelevant predictions about Son D, how did the bet turn out in the end? \nPlease denote Son A's victory as statement A, Son B's victory as statement B, and so on. \nIf the son's prediction is true, write “1,” if it is false, write \"0.\"\nFor example, if Son A's prediction was completely correct, Son B's completely wrong, Son C's half right, and Son D's half wrong; the correct answer would be: [[A=1; B=0; C=1][A=1; B=0; C=1][A=0; B=1; C=1][A=0; B=0; C=1]].\nTherefore, the correct order of Son A, Son B, Son C is AABBCC.\nWe set up sets of truth values, and then find which leave only one completely true and one completely false prediction among the four sons. \nThen we deduct the correct ordering from the correct set.\nThe relationship is: \n(1) A 1 and B 1: if B 1, then C 0 and D 0 --> C 1 and D 1 can't be true. \n    If B 2, then C 2 --> C 1 and D 1 can't be true. \n\n(2) B 1 and C 1: if B 1, then A 2 --> A 1 and D 2 can't be true. \n    If B 2, then A 1 and D 2 --> A 1 and D 2 can't be true. \n\n(3) A 1 and C 1: if B 1, then A 1, B 1 and C 1 are all true, but there can only be one fully correct prediction. \n\n(4) B 1 and D 1: if C 2, then A 2 --> A 1 and D 2 can't be true.\n\n(5) A 1 and D 1: if B 1, then C 2 --> C 1 and D 1 can't be true.\n    If B 2, then C 2 -->\nTherefore, the correct prediction set is {A 1, B 2, C 2, D 1}\n\nA 1: A 1, B 2, C 2, D 1\nB 2: A 2, B 2, C 1, D 2\nC 2: A 0, B 1, C 2, D 2\nD 1: A 2, B 2, C 1\nAs Son D can only make half-true predictions, his prediction set is {A 0, B 0, C 1, D 0, 1}\nThe complete correct prediction set for the four children is {A 1, B 2, C 2, D 1}\n\nThe son who is entirely correct is Son A, the son who is entirely false is Son B, and the two sons who are half true and half false are Son C and Son D.\n\nThere are a total of three sons having different abilities, and the combination of positions is:\nSon A Son B Son C Son D 1 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 3 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1\nThe satisfying position is: Son A Son B Son C Son D 1 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 0, 1 0 1 1 4, 0 0 0, 4 2 0 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 4 2 1 0 4 0 3 0 1 3 0 2 2 0 2 3 4\nTherefore, how did the bet turn out in the end? Which son won? The son who lost? Which son was half right? Which of the two sons who won weren't sure about Son D? Who was sure to win but unsure about Son D?\n\nThe answer format should be:\n\nSon A Son B Son C Son D \n[order 1 order 2 order 3 order 4 order 5]\n[order 1 order 2 order 3 order 4 order 5]\n[order 1 order 2 order 3 order 4 order 5]\n[order 1 order 2 order 3 order 4 order 5]\n\nThat is, Son A thought Son B would win, but his reasoning was wrong, so he orders Son B first, Son C second, and so on. \n[[A B C D] [list the order in which Son A mothered the sons with his reasoning], [A B C D] [Son B], [A B C D] [Son C], [A B C D] [Son D]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[A=1,B=0,C=1,D=0], [A=1,B=1,C=1,D=1], [A=0,B=1,C=1,D=1], [A=0,B=0,C=1,D=1]]",

Most by-products resulting from this sudden change in the living circumstances of the living organism are harmful. Thus, those living organisms that were harmed may join the ranks of natural extinction. As an example, Kleqghmiyunov states, \n\"Observe a bowl of water drinking something that lives by dichotomy—like a Daphnia, for example. They have mates for what?\" Some people would say they're chasing the olfactory scent of their songmates, but Kleqghmiyunov gives an explanation mode that avoids such a romantic notion: \"They don't to mate! The individual is not having fun, and the reason he or she continues to swim towards that fragrant object is because, if he or she keeps swimming forward, the pool will eventually lose its freshness and be replaced by a fresh solution. Therefore, the individual loses the very food that enables it to consume it.\"\nSee, Kleqghmiyunov does not find it meaningful to investigate the purpose of a living organism — or even to debate this question, as a living organism’s hope for survival and expression of its instinct to survive is implicit. Although there is no natural survival solution, Kleqghmiyunov can only thus interpret it as survival instinct.",
