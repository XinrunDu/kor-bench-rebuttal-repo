For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X]]  (Decryption of \"3=\" gives \"WX\" with the given cipher table, but because of the way the table is defined, \"X\" is at symbol position 3 and \"W\" at \"=\". So, \"X\" is the first decrypted character.)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"W\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]=[[0]]   (Encryption of \"W\" gives \"X\" which is at symbol position 3 and encrypts to \"0\", hence the answer is represented as [[0]] since it's a symbol not an uppercase letter.)",

Figure out the encrypted Malayalam character using the equivalent correspondence between Malayalam and Hangul.\n            - In such correspondence, ignore trailing digits in the Arabic numeral system, if present.\n            - If reversing from Hashindu to Malayalam returns a hangul vowel then the output will be combined as Article,[Vowel Character].\n        2. If the above step returns hashindu, mod by the keyword to find the correct index.\n        3. Create the modular character by adding to the ordinal of the Hangul in the reverse Malayalam to Hangul equivalents is Encryted_Korean_Malayalam_CharsDict.\n        4. Convert into the modular answer to the latin alphabet.\n        5. Concatenate the 4(modular characters).\n        6. Convert concatenated output from unicode to ascii.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n    - Keyword: A string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string.\n- Preparation:\n    - \"로\", \"하\", \"아\"...,\"중\", \"월\" are not in this dictionary.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Remove extended ASCII diacritics (x152...x255), if present.\n    - Split the last one and save.\n    - If the index of letter is greater than A to Z then decrypt and +size(A) then save the encrypted hill output to decrypt again using hill invertible.\n    - else translate back to arabic using reverse correspondence.\n    - convert the output unicode string to plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: challenGe!!99\nKeyword: CHALLenge99\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string with letters and punctuation in uppercase.\n    - Keyword: A string with letters in uppercase without spaces and punctuation.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n    - Every two occurrences of the plaintext characters X,Y,Z are converted into \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext.\n- Preparation:\n    - Just characters.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Bounds check keyword to ensure the length is bigger than 1\n    - Pad keyword with keyword\n    - For each character in the plaintext, iterate through chars of keyword.\n    - If the keyword chars match a dash note it with them.\n    - If there is a match in leaving the matching character in, except the 2nd time, when you save to the KentonRings[\"Z\"].\n    - If a group of X,Y,Z is used ignore if saved.\n        - otherwise add X,Y,Z to ans. Then add the originally replaced letter.\n    - if you have a group of X,Y,Z and saved most have happened done \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n    - Keyword: A string.\n    - Every two occurrences of \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext are converted into X,Y,Z in the plaintext.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string.\n    - Check if keyword contains uppercase letters, if not, return an error message. They must contain uppercase letters.\n- Preparation:\n    - Just characters.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, iterate through chars of keyword.\n        - If the keyword chars match a dash note it with them.\n    - If there is a match, make sure you have not saved this already. However, take note of which characters were not used to form your CurrentFlag, and which characters were used to form them, and check for their duplicates.\n    - use CurrentFlag to update result as the 1st match if applicable.\n    - if not, then you have a group of X,Y,Z and saved most have happened, so break through the iteration and \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: hello?\nKeyword: abcABCexampleABCDECHaHa\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, if a character has one of its previous occurences in the plaintext, append it to the ciphertext an additional 1 index higher. By this I am referring to x you have found it at index a then u have found it at ind ab then because ya already have it at index a ya need index ac for it, to signify to the reader about what matches what.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to encryptedKeyword which is the keyword 1 index higher than the original keyword.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Iterate through Plaintext (Pt), for each unique character}\n        - Save those indices into Indices.\n        - Replace it with the encryptedVersion of it.\n        - Check if encryptedVersion index is 0 if yes, increment it.\n        - merge index and character into the encrypted keyword\n        - append it to cipher text\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Keyword: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - The keyword must be 1 index lower than the encryptedKeyword.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to plainKeyword which is the keyword 1 index lower than that given keyword.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to indices which are the indices dictionary of the characters in the encrypted keyword.\n    - If the keyword contains a character lower than A, return an error message.\n\n    For each character in the ciphertext:\n    - find it and apply to indices.\n    - break it apart to character and index.\n    - Subtract the index and every time the index goes down by 2 substitute it with the remembered plainKeyword.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: SUPPRESS\nKeyword: oOoOooo\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

To encrypt \"VA\" using the given cipher, we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1. \n2. For the first character 'V': V is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for V is M (the next letter on Reel1). Move to Reel2.\n3. For the second character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel2). Move to Reel3.\n4. For the third character 'A': A is on Reel3, so the ciphertext character for A is B (the next letter on Reel3). Move to Reel4.\n5. For the fourth character 'V': V is on Reel4, so the ciphertext character for V is S (the next letter on Reel4). Move to Reel5.\n6. For the fifth character 'A': A is on Reel5, so the ciphertext character for A is K (the next letter on Reel5). Move to Reel6.\n7. For the sixth character 'A': A is at the end of Reel6, so go back to Reel1 to find the next letter.\n8. Reel6 to Reel1: After moving to Reel1 from Reel6, we reach the end of Reel1. Therefore, we go back to Reel1.\n9. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for A is its previous letter, which is R. Move to Reel2.\n10. As we encountered R on Reel1, we go to Reel2. Since the next character on Reel1 is not R, we stay at Reel2.\n11. For the last character 'A': A is on Reel2, so the ciphertext character for A is R. Keep moving to the next reel until you reach the end, then go around to the next reel.\n12. Move to Reel3, and since 'A' is on Reel3, the ciphertext character for 'A' is V.\n13. Thus, the ciphertext for \"VA\" will be \"MJFB\" as the encryption order will be M, J, F, B for \"VA\", respectively.\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer for \"???\". To encrypt the input \"???\", we follow the specified steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2. For the first character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. So the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n3. For the second character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. So the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n4. For the third character '?': '? is on Reel1, so the ciphertext character for '?' is Reel1[24] as '? is not a part of the alphabet. Hence, the ciphertext character for '?' will be 'Y'.\n5. Thus, the ciphertext for \"???\" will be \"YYY\" as the encryption order will be Y, Y, Y for \"???\".\n\nThe encrypted answer is [[YYY]].",
