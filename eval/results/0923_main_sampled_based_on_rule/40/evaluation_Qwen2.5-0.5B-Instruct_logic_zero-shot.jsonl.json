Therefore, **Citizens cannot at the same time** be protected by both the state and by national property.\n\n   - **Step 2:** According Poly extra provision lays rule, **(11) users of official services ____________(2).** If we apply this rule to the individual's circumstances by variance of parallelism between contract, national property, and duties. Obeying such provisions would violate specific state and national property regulations, which we have to follow.
