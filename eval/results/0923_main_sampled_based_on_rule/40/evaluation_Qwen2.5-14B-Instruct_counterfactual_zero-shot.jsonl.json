The information related to mechanical technology focuses on mechanisms using Mohist or \"domineering\" skills: from creating heavier loads transporters, helping people perform tasks more efficiently, to actual inventions like specific weapons. No reference was given to automatic attack capabilities for large mechanical beasts.\n\n- **Option C:** \"During the Qin Dynasty, cyborgs existed, and after a person's death, their body could be reconstructed into a mechanical being using various components.\"\n  - The story clearly states that Wu Shuang's body was transformed into a mechanical being after his death by Gongshu Chou.\n\n- **Option D:** \"During the Qin Dynasty, tools made of iron had not yet been developed.\"\n  - There is no information in the story suggesting that iron tools had not yet been developed during the Qin Dynasty.
