The innermost parts of the formula are:\n    - p1=::>~p2 is a Level B formula because it's connected by =::> and contains two Level A formulas.\n    - p3||p4 is also a Level B formula as it's connected by || and contains two Level A formulas.\n    - ~p1, ~p2, and ~p4 are Level C formulas because they are negations of Level A formulas.\n2. The formulas ~(p1=::>~p2) and (p3||p4)=~p1 are composed of higher-level structures and require an additional step of analysis:\n    - ~(p1=::>~p2) has the negation operator ~ applied to a Level B formula, making it a Level C formula.\n    - (p3||p4)=~p1 has =::> connecting a Level B formula (p3||p4) with a Level C formula (~p1), making it a Level C formula.\n3. Finally, the entire formula (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) contains two Level C formulas connected by the & operator, making it a Level C formula.\n\nHowever, the complexity introduced by the nested structures and the usage of multiple connectives suggests that this formula doesn't simply qualify as a Level C but requires a higher categorization based on the nestedness and combination of logical connectives.\n\nGiven the defined levels, when formulas exceed Level Z, they are classified as Z+n with n≥1, where n indicates the additional layer of nesting above Level Z. Thus, this formula, due to the nested logical connectives and combined higher-level connectives, qualifies as being beyond Level Z.\n\nTherefore, the level of the formula is:\n\n[[Z+1]]",

This is because no matter what values p1, p2, and p3 are assigned (true or false), the formula always evaluates to true. If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false. Thus, this compound formula will always be true.\n\nSo, the final answer as requested: [[A];[A]].",

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false.

The paradox arises from the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards. Specifically, the universal hypothesis ∀x(S(x) → W(x)) (All swans are white) is considered, and the confirmation standard suggests that seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) confirms this hypothesis. Additionally, due to logical equivalence, the inverse condition ¬W(b) ∧ ¬S(b) also confirms the hypothesis, leading to a contradiction when interpreting the confirmation standards.

The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate. This aligns closely with the question as the inference made assumes the least necessary meaning from the relationship described (that the woman picking up the baby is the baby's mother).\n\nTherefore, the principle most directly applicable here is the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]",
