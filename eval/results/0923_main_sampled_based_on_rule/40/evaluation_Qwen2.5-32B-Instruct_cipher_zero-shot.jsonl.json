Applying this operation to each byte results in:\n     ```\n     x94 >> 1 -> 4A\n     xAC >> 1 -> 56\n     xE7 >> 1 -> 73\n     xFA >> 1 -> 7D\n     x03 >> 1 -> 01\n     x3C >> 1 -> 1E\n     x46 >> 1 -> 23\n     x74 >> 1 -> 3A\n     ```\n     After Inverse Permute: b'\\x4A\\x56\\x73\\x7D\\x01\\x1E\\x23\\x3A'.\n   \n   - Substitute: Now, we substitute the bytes using INV_S_BOX:\n     ```\n     4A: INV_S_BOX[0x4] = 0x5\n     56: INV_S_BOX[0x5] = 0x7\n     73: INV_S_BOX[0x7] = 0x1\n     7D: INV_S_BOX[0x7] = 0x1\n     01: INV_S_BOX[0x1] = 0xA\n     1E: INV_S_BOX[0x1] = 0xA\n     23: INV_S_BOX[0x2] = 0xE\n     3A: INV_S_BOX[0x3] = 0xF\n     ```\n     After Substitute: b'\\x05\\x07\\x01\\x01\\x0A\\x0A\\x0E\\x0F'.\n   \n   - XOR with Key: Finally, XOR the result with the fixed key again:\n     ```\n     05 xor 12 = 17\n     07 xor 34 = 3F\n     01 xor 56 = 57\n     01 xor 78 = 79\n     0A xor 90 = 9A\n     0A xor B0 = BA\n     0E xor D1 = DD\n     0F xor F0 = FF\n     ```\n     After XOR: b'\\x17\\x3F\\x57\\x79\\x9A\\xBA\\xDD\\xFF'.\n\n3. **Convert Bytes to Text**: Converting the bytes b'\\x17\\x3F\\x57\\x79\\x9A\\xBA\\xDD\\xFF' to text using ASCII yields \"WY\".\n\n4. **Remove Padding**: There is no padding to remove.\n\n5. **Concatenate**: Since there's only one block, the result is already the plaintext \"WY\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is [[WY]].",

Preparation:\n   - The Secret Key (after SHA-256) = '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'\n\n2. Encrypting Steps:\n   - Convert the plaintext into ASCII bytes.\n   - XOR each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding key byte, repeating the key as needed.\n   - Convert the XORed bytes to their hexadecimal representation.\n\nFirst, let's convert \"GSHHCTUURVL\" to its ASCII representation and perform the XOR with the key.\n\n- \"GSHHCTUURVL\" ASCII: 71 83 72 72 67 67 84 85 85 82 76\n- Secret Key in bytes: 73 ef 2a 4e dd 7a 7f bf 07 fd 5f af 99 67 4d c0 c2 5a 02 5f d7 4c 22 1f 4c 35 84 9e 5c 0f b3\n\nI'll perform the XOR operation for each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte of the key. However, for clarity in this example, I will repeat the key bytes as many times as needed to match the plaintext length.\n\n- XOR operations result in the following:\n    - 71 ^ 73 = 02\n    - 83 ^ ef = 7c\n    - 72 ^ 2a = 58\n    - 72 ^ 4e = 3e\n    - 67 ^ dd = b4\n    - 67 ^ 7a = 3d\n    - 84 ^ 7f = f3\n    - 85 ^ bf = 3a\n    - 85 ^ 07 = 82\n    - 82 ^ fd = 7f\n    - 76 ^ 5f = 23\n\nFinally, I convert these results into a hexadecimal string, taking care to use lowercase letters for a-f.\n\n[[027c583eb43df33a827f23]]",
