Given these nested conditions, this formula fits into the Z+n category, where n describes how much beyond Z the complexity goes.

It is False if p1 is True (T) and p2 is False (F).\n- Therefore, \"~(p1=::>p2)\" would be True if p1 is True and p2 is False, and False otherwise.\n- Then, combining with \"p2\", the formula would be:\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is False (because \"(~(T=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is False and p2 is False (because \"(~(F=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - True when p1 is False and p2 is True (because \"(~(F=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is True (because \"(~(T=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n\nBased on this analysis, the formula is not true under all assignments and not false under all assignments. So it is Neither.\n\n### Formula 2: (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"(p1 & p3)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p3 are True. It is False otherwise.\n- The part \"(~p1 & ~p2)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p2 are False. It is False otherwise.\n- Therefore, we need to check if the conditions for truth of \"(p1 & p3)\" match the conditions for truth of \"(~p1 & ~p2)\". They clearly don't match under any assignment because the conditions for both being True or False require opposite states of p1.\n\nGiven the contradictory requirements to make both parts of the equivalence true or false under the same conditions, it's clear this formula doesn't hold true for any assignment neither does it hold false for all assignments under every possible state of truth for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nBased on this, the formula should be classified as Neither.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n[[C];[C]]",

Since we need complementary literals to resolve, there is no direct complementary pair like `q` and `¬q`, but both contain `¬q`, indicating they already agree on the negated form of `q`.\n\nHowever, actual resolution happens when a clause contains `q` while another contains `¬q`. Since no literal and its complement pair directly exists between `C1` and `C2`, direct resolution cannot yield further simplification (as per the given rule and definition of `dispel`).\n\nTherefore, there is no further simplified result, and the process does not indicate a contradiction. Hence, the resolution operation dispel(C1, C2) does not yield a reduced clause but instead leaves the clauses as is because no complementary literals directly lead to the removal of both clauses.\n\nIn the format requested:\n\n[[]]",

The claim is that as the number of deep wells increased and more water was extracted underground, the land subsided faster.

The key findings are based on observations of radioactivity, whether uranium is present or absent, leading to the identification of another source of radioactivity.\n\nGiven the logic rules:\n\n- Method ⸮ describes finding a potential causal relationship S and P when other conditions vary, but S and P remain consistently together. This does not outright fit our scenario as the main focus is on the radioactivity present even after uranium is absent.\n- Method ؆ fits very closely - the radioactivity (P) occurs both when uranium (S) is present and does not occur as expected when uranium (S) is absent, leading to the identification of a different substance causing the radioactivity. This method describes a situation where the presence or absence of S (in this case, uranium) influences P (radioactivity) in a way that suggests a causal relationship.\n- Method ꙮ involves the same conditions as method ؆ but also adds to it by considering both positive and negative cases, which isn't explicitly detailed in the passage.\n- Method ⵣ would describe a situation where changes in S correlate with changes in P.
