The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch.\n5. #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Fourth Place:**\n   - The bird that finished fourth was #118.\n   - So, the fourth place is occupied by #118.\n\n2. **Relative Placement of #126 and Kermit:**\n   - #126 finished 1 place after Kermit.\n   - This means Kermit finished in a position one place before #126.\n\n3. **Third Place:**\n   - The runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch.\n   - Since #126 finished after Kermit, and Kermit cannot be in the third place (because #126 would then be in the fourth place, which is already occupied by #118), Stretch must be the one who finished third.\n   - Therefore, the third place is occupied by Stretch.\n\n4. **#134 and Ozzy:**\n   - #134 was either Ozzy or the ostrich that finished third.\n   - Since Stretch is the ostrich that finished third, #134 must be Ozzy.\n   - So, Ozzy is #134.\n\n5. **Placement of Ozzy and #120:**\n   - #120 finished sometime after Ozzy.\n   - Since Ozzy is #134, #120 must be in a position after #134.\n   - Given the positions already filled:\n     - Third: Stretch\n     - Fourth: #118\n   - Ozzy (#134) must be in either the first or second place.\n   - #120 must be in the remaining position (either first or second, but after Ozzy).\n\n6. **Placement of #126:**\n   - #126 finished one place after Kermit.\n   - Since Stretch is in the third place and #118 is in the fourth place, #126 cannot be in the third or fourth place.\n   - Therefore, #126 must be in the second place, and Kermit must be in the first place.\n\n### Final Placement:\n- First place: Kermit\n- Second place: #126\n- Third place: Stretch\n- Fourth place: #118\n\n### Verifying:\n- #118 is in the fourth place.\n- #126 is one place after Kermit.\n- Stretch is in the third place.\n- #134 is Ozzy.\n- #120 is after Ozzy, which must be in the first place.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[first Kermit #134, second #126 #126, third Stretch #126, fourth #118 #118]] \n\nHowever, there is a slight inconsistency in the format.

Since Green & Hayes is not mentioned in the puzzle, we assume it refers to a hypothetical hire or another company not part of the puzzle. However, we can infer that the \"Green & Hayes hire\" is not relevant to the puzzle and we should focus on the dates mentioned.\n\n3. **Determine the Specific Dates:**\n   - If Rosalie was hired 3 days after someone, and the possible dates are March 18th and March 21st, then the only logical match is:\n     - Rosalie was hired on March 21st (3 days after March 18th).\n     - Therefore, Cynthia was hired on March 18th.\n\n4. **Assign Dates to Nadine and Velez & York:**\n   - The remaining dates are March 12th and March 15th.\n   - Since Nadine was hired by Velez & York, and neither of these dates have been assigned yet, we can assign them to these dates.

Additionally, we ensure that no 2x2 or larger rectangles are formed by the walls and that the walls can form a continuous path.\n\nLet's break down the steps and apply them to the given puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify and isolate the hint numbers:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and the hint numbers are 5, 1, 4, and 1.\n   - Each hint number must be in an island of the size indicated by the number.\n\n2. **Form islands and place walls:**\n   - For the hint number 5, the island must have 5 squares.\n   - For the hint number 1, the island must have 1 square.\n   - For the hint number 4, the island must have 4 squares.\n   - For the hint number 1, the island must have 1 square.\n\n3. **Place the walls to separate the islands:**\n   - Ensure no 2x2 or larger rectangles are formed by the walls.\n   - Ensure the walls form a continuous path.\n\nLet's start with the hint number 5:\n- The island for 5 must be 5 squares. We can form a vertical island starting from the 5.\n\nNext, the hint number 1:\n- The island for 1 must be 1 square. We can place a wall around it.\n\nThen, the hint number 4:\n- The island for 4 must be 4 squares. We can form a horizontal island starting from the 4.\n\nFinally, the hint number 1:\n- The island for 1 must be 1 square. We can place a wall around it.\n\nNow, let's place the walls and form the islands:\n\n```\nX X X X 5\nA A A A X\n1 A A 4 X\nA A A A X\nX X X X 1\n```\n\nFinally, the matrix with the walls placed is:\n\n```\nX X X X 5\nA A A A X\n1 A A 4 X\nA A A A X\nX X X X 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n[[X X X X 5,A A A A X,1 A A 4 X,A A A A X,X X X X 1]]",

This means the leftmost skyscraper must be the shortest (1), followed by a taller one, and then the tallest one.\n   - For the first column (from the top), the number 3 indicates that 3 skyscrapers are visible from the top. This means the top skyscraper must be the shortest (1), followed by a taller one, and then the tallest one.\n\n3. **Fill in the Grid:**\n\n### First Row:\n- From the left: 3 skyscrapers are visible, so it must start with 1, then 2, then 3, and the fourth must be 4.\n- From the right: 1 skyscraper is visible, so the tallest (4) must be on the right.\n- Therefore, the first row is: 1 2 3 4\n\n### Second Row:\n- From the left: 2 skyscrapers are visible, so it must start with 1 or 2, followed by a taller one.\n- From the right: 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the tallest (4) cannot be on the right.\n- The first cell in this row cannot be 1 because it would block the second cell, so it must be 2.\n- The second cell must be 1 (to allow the third and fourth cells to be visible).\n- The third and fourth cells must be 3 and 4 in some order, but 4 must be on the left to allow 2 skyscrapers to be visible from the right.\n- Therefore, the second row is: 2 1 4 3\n\n### Third Row:\n- From the left: 1 skyscraper is visible, so the tallest (4) must be on the left.\n- From the right: 3 skyscrapers are visible, so the first cell must be 4, and the rest must be in ascending order.\n- Therefore, the third row is: 4 3 2 1\n\n### Fourth Row:\n- From the left: 3 skyscrapers are visible, so it must start with 1, then 2, then 3, and the fourth must be 4.\n- From the right: 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the tallest (4) must be on the right.\n- Therefore, the fourth row is: 1 2 3 4\n\n### Fifth Row:\n- From the left: 2 skyscrapers are visible, so it must start with 1 or 2, followed by a taller one.\n- From the right: 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the tallest (4) cannot be on the right.\n- The first cell in this row cannot be 1 because it would block the second cell, so it must be 2.\n- The second cell must be 1 (to allow the third and fourth cells to be visible).\n- The third and fourth cells must be 3 and 4 in some order, but 4 must be on the left to allow 2 skyscrapers to be visible from the right.\n- Therefore, the fifth row is: 2 1 4 3\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[1 2 3 4, 2 1 4 3, 4 3 2 1, 1 2 3 4, 2 1 4 3]]",
