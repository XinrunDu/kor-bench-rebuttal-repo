You can also apply it to operations with three integral elements. Once you have finished, provide the new question or operation rule in a comment. ### New Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements a, b, and c arranged such that they add up to 10, find the values of X, Y, and Z. In this rule, X represents the sum of b and c, while Y represents the sum of a and c, and Z represents the sum of a and b.\n\n### First Question:\n\nCompute X, Y, and Z for the operation rule with a = 3, b = 4, and c = 4. \n\nX = [[7]], Y = [[7]], Z = [[6]]\n\nThat was a simple rule. Now, let's try a more challenging one. \n\n### Second Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements a, b, and c arranged as a < b < c, find the values of m, n, and o. Here, m represents the square root of b, n represents the product of a and c, and o represents the number of digits in c. \n\nNote: If a number has only one digit, consider it as zero. For example, the number 21 has two digits, so consider it as 021 and its number of digits is 3. \n\n### Third Question:\n\nCompute m, n, and o for the first operation rule with a = 5, b = 8, and c = 10.\n\nm = [[2]], n = [[50]], o = [[2]]\n\n### Fourth Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements A, B, and C arranged such that B = 2 * A and C = B + 2, find the values of p, q, and r. Here, p represents the sum of A and B, q represents the product of B and C, and r represents the number of zeros at the end of C. \n\nNote: Consider a number as having one zero at the end if it is a multiple of 10.\n\n### Fifth Question:\n\nCompute p, q, and r for the second operation rule with A = 6, B = 12, and C = 14.\n\np = [[18]], q = [[168]], r = [[0]]\n\n### Sixth Operation Rule:\n\nFor the elements x, y, and z arranged such that x + y + z = 20, find the values of s, t, and u. Here, s represents the sum of x and y, t represents the product of y and z, and u represents the number of distinct numbers among x, y, and z.\n\nNote: A number is considered distinct only if it occurs once in the arrangement. So, if x = 5, y = 5, and z = 10, then the number of distinct numbers is 2 because 5 occurs twice and 10 occurs only once.\n\n### Seventh Question:\n\nCompute s, t, and u for the third operation rule with x = 7, y = 8, and z = 5.\n\ns = [[15]], t = [[40]], u = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 8:\nEvaluate m, n, and o for the fourth operation rule with A = 4, B = 8, and C = 10.\n\nm = [[4]], n = [[40]], r = [[1]]\n\n### QUESTION 9:\nDetermine p, q, and r for the fifth operation rule with a = 20, b = 60, and c = 80.\n\np = [[80]], q = [[4800]], r = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 10:\nCalculate s, t, and u for the sixth operation rule with x = 6, y = 9, and z = 5.\n\ns = [[15]], t = [[45]], u = [[2]]\n\n### QUESTION 11:\nGiven the elements X, Y, and Z arranged such that X < Y < Z, find the values of w, x, and y. Here, w represents the sum of X and Y, x represents the product of Y and Z, and y represents the number of negative digits in Z.\n\nNote: A digit in the number Z is considered negative if it is a negative sign. For a two-digit number, consider the second digit as a negative sign. If Z = -21, then its number of negative digits is 1 because only the second digit is a negative sign.\n\n### QUESTION 12:\n\nCompute w, x, and y for the sixth operation rule with X = -10, Y = 15, and Z = 20.\n\nw = [[5]], x = [[300]], y = [[0]]",

Additionally, encourage students to explore different commands in the trial version, as it may have additional capabilities beyond circumradii and intersection radii.\n\nIf there are any other specific elements or commands within Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha trial that the students should be aware of or practice as part of this lesson, feel free to provide them too.\n\n### Question:\nCompute (14) & (8) + (5) $ (12).\nd) The answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[20]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (74) & (73) + (12) $ (1).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[75]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (2) & (3) + (8) $ (11).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\nThe answer with best timing should be considered.\n\n### Answer:\n[[12]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 2 & 8 + 4 $ 16.\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[16]]",

Here \".\" is an additional operator between #2 and #3 which temporarily replaces them with 1. Evaluate the number.\nThis task involves evaluating an arithmetic expression involving custom operations. It requires understanding the rules provided for each operation and then applying those rules step by step to solve the given question. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. aodafone (a # b) = (a + 3b) / 4\n2. a # b = (a + 3b) / 4\n3. 1 #2 #3 = (1 * 2 + 2 * 3²) / (1 + 2 * 2)\n\nThe request is to evaluate a stack of operators, 1 #2 #3, using the given rules. \n\nFollowing the rules, 1 #2 #3 can be solved as:\n\n1 #2 = (1 + 3*2) / 4 = 7/4\n7/4 #3 = (7/4 + 3*3) / 4 = (7/4 + 9) / 4 = (43/4) / 4 = 43/16\n\nNow, the task follows the given stack: 1 #2 #3 ../10 2 #5.\n\n1.) 1 #2: We've already calculated this in step 1 above as 7/4\n2.) 7/4 #3: We've already calculated this in step 2 above as 43/16\n3.) (43/16) ../10: Where \"..\" is defined as replacing the # operators temporarily with \"/\", we have:\n    (43/16) / 10 = 43/160\n4.) 10 2 #5: This is evaluated as 10 (since the \"#\" operations have been temporarily replaced with \"/\")\n5.) ((43/160)) / 2: Which directly gives 43/320\n6.) 43/320 2 #5: This too is evaluated as 43/320\n\nTherefore, the stack 1 #2 #3 ../10 2 #5 evaluates to 43/320 using the defined operators. The decimal equivalent of 43/320 is about 0.134375. \n\nFinally, since we only need the whole number answer, the final answer is:\n\n[[0]]",

Let's clarify the solution using the correct interpretation of the given operations. We need to find the value of Y such that (4★3)◇Y=18+(x=(17/1)^2). \n\nFirst, compute 4★3:\n4★3 = √4 + 3^2 = 2 + 9 = 11\n\nNow, we need to find Y such that 11◇Y=18+(x=(17/1)^2). Knowing that 17/1=17, we have 18+(17)=35.\nNext, use the ◇ operation to solve for Y:\n11◇Y = √11 × Y = 35\n\nApply the second operation:\n√11 × Y = 35\nY = 35 / √11\n\nSo, the answer remains as Y = 35 / √11.\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[35/√11]]",

Given f(x)=x^2+1 and g(x)=x-1, we can find g''(x)=2. Plugging these into the operation definition, we get f▽g=ax^2-2a+a+2=a. Since we are given that f▽g=3, we can solve for a and find that a=3. Plugging this back into f(x) and g(x), we get x=1.\n### Answer:\n[[1]]",

Or, apply power operation to each element but in which order that might lead both results equal that is not clear.
