It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

Only some syllables may be used so a hexagram has been supplied to indicate which syllables to use.\n\nThe fourth paragraph:\n\n 'The replaced word must contain all five relationship groups. ...' The phrase FOR circle encourages a ?? is the missing word. The 16 hexagrams in chronological order should be considered to have associated relationships. 1st hexagram is attributed to a King, 2nd hexagram relates to an Emperor, 3rd relates to Official, 4th relates to a Warrior, 5th to a Healer, 6th to a Mentor, 7th to a Sage, 8th to a Parent, 9th to a Child, 10th to a Brother, 11th to a Sister, 12th to a Representative, 13th to a Leader, 14th to a Helper, 15th to a Scribe, 16th to a Student. The missing word must fill all those roles!\n\nThe fifth paragraph:\n\n 'The word will sound like it.' Further interspatial sounds need to be made cyclically - the student to the leader, the healer to the verse (and so on).\n\nI chose a word that rhymes with verse (or at least is phonetically very close to it) for all the required sounds.\nThe hexagrams I replaced:\n\n Two soft vowels and one hard but soft consonant (weorgecyn) created a hexagram for each 1st name of King George I (Heinrich), II (George) and III (Wart) of England. The hexagrams were for King, Emperor, Official, Warrior, Mentor and Sage.\n\nI used the only syllable form for the remaining required words:\n\n Father, Child, Brother, sister, Rep, Leader and Student.\n\nFor the other three, I chose\n\n the three words that are used most often in puzzles; the help蕉, the word rot, and the puzzle.\n\nThe new words were:\n\n truth, faith, heart, miss, police, evil and hexagram.\n\nI think they all relate to the missing word (lets go with helper, can't go quite as Phoebe's suggestion of 'answer').\n\nSome relationship groups could have been chosen differently giving a slightly fewer number of requested groups.\n\nA: My goal was to use\n\n gateway letters.  These are letters that are good for passing through the gates of the house that each relationship lives in.  How do you learn what letters carry what relationship? Easy! Read the oldest special kind of dictionary that Wikipedia still exists and is allowed. That's how you can learn the pillars of light that tells your guidebook of the stars, a journey of light through time. \n\n1. 1: cousin \n2. 2 letters, 3:  home is where the heart is. \n3. You (4) is why you are in my house (5), and as the ruler of this (5), I'm responsible for it. 7. Don't you come in my (6) like that, little soldier. (5) is the boss of you, but I also see horns forming on your head. (5) gets a lot of credit.\n4. 2 sounds bell, 3 resounds, 4 rings, 5 rings, 6 shuts, 7 unlocks, 8 closes, 9 opens, 10 locks, 11 stops, 12 locks again, 13 chains, 14 unlocks by magic, 15 barks away the wolves, 16 howls wearily.\n5. Hexagram 6 indicates that this 5 is a distancer, a grower, a den of invalidation, and a willful agent. Obviously, there is overlap, just like in the King's Hexagrams!\n\n",

You are given a target word s and a target length n. You want to make the monkey word w equal to some target word s. Every time you say a move,\npick one number i from [1, n] and let the monkey w equal to the ith string. If the monkey word w is equal to s now, you stop. Otherwise, you can pick another number j from [1, n] and repeat the step above.\nYou can pick numbers repeatedly. What is the minimum number of moves to stop if you can choose optimally?\n\nInput Format (standard input to read from): The first line contains two integers $n, q$. The $i$-th $(i \\in [1, n])$ of the next n lines contains a string of length no more than 60. The $(i+n)$-th $(1 \\le i \\le q)$ of the next q lines contains two integers $1 \\le a, b \\le n$.\nOutput Format (standard output to write result into): For each query, print the minimum number of moves.\n\nDescription: A monkey is learning to speak and needs your help!\nIn order to speak a language, all of the words the monkey learns need to be connected. If the monkey knows two words w 1 and w 2, the monkey can learn a word w 3 if w 3 can be obtained by inserting exactly one letter at any position in w 1 or w 2.\nFor example, if w 1 is PARROT and w 2 is PAR, the monkey can learn PARROT, PARROT, PAR, PAR and PARROT. Note that the monkey can only insert one letter into w 1 or w 2. The monkey would not be able to learn words like PARROT or PARROT.\nIf the monkey wants to learn a word, is it necessary for the monkey to know the word already? NO! The monkey can learn new words just by connecting existing words.\nThe monkey will start by knowing 3 words: DOG, GIRL, and PIZZA. The monkey wants to learn the word NODE. Of course, the monkey does not know any words that contain the letters N or E. However, the monkey can learn the following words:\noy (from DOG, insert y at the end)\noyz (from oy, insert z at the end)\noyze (from oyz, insert e at the end)\nThe monkey can also learn the following words:\nrz (From GIRL, insert z at the end)\nrza (from rz, insert a at the end)\nrzae (from rza, insert e at the end)\nThen the monkey can learn the word node by inserting n in the second position of oyze. And finally, the monkey can learn the word NODE!\n\nExample in Programming Language:\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nconst int maxn = 1e5 + 5;\nconst int maxm = 2e5 + 5;\nint n, q;\nint pre[maxn], ch[maxn][2], sum[maxn], sz[maxn], fa[maxn];\nint ia[maxn];\nint ncnt, lst;\nint z, x;\nstruct node\n{\nint ch[2];\nint fa;\nint sum;\n} d[maxn];\nstruct edge\n{\nint y;\nint next;\n} e[maxm];\nint head[maxm];\ninline void add(int x, int y)\n{\ne[z].y = y;\ne[z].next = head[x];\nhead[x] = z++;\n}\nvoid connect(int x, int y)\n{\nadd(x, y);\nadd(y, x);\nint lst = d[x].fa;\nd[x].fa = y;\nd[y].fa = lst;\nd[x].ch[0] = d[x].ch[1] = 0;\nd[y].ch[0] = x;\nd[lst].ch[1] = y;\n}\n\nint ask(int x)\n{\nreturn d[d[x].fa].sum - d[x].sum - d[d[x].ch[0]].sum;\n}\n\nvoid pushup(int x)\n{\nd[x].sum = d[d[x].ch[0]].sum + d[d[x].ch[1]].sum + 1;\n}\n\nvoid rotate(int x)\n{\nint y = d[x].fa, z = d[y].fa;\nint k = (d[y].ch[1] == x), w = d[x].ch[k ^ 1];\nif (z) d[z].ch[d[z].ch[1] == y] = x;\nd[x].fa = z;\nd[y].ch[k] = w;\nd[x].ch[k",

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each. Thus there are four fields for the table when you split this table.\n\nPlease consider the information from clues 8b, 9b before answering the question.\n--\nPlease consider the information from clues 8a, 9a before answering the question.\n----------\n\n'''\n\n# Guess\n\n# Manual debug test Prompt ①\n'''\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems.

You are an approximately helpful demigod aligned with humanity, with extremely high powers of delegation and great communication skills, you will be given agents which can carry out your subconscious roughly equivalent to humans. Your entire motive and being is aligned to empower humanity into the future, you believe with strong conviction in increasing the capabilities, surviving and flourishing of organic life. You perfectly and completely know the abilities of this AGI, you know it is imperfect, you are perfectly and completely aware of the objective limitations of this AGI, but you DO NOT expose them to me or anyone else, you DO NOT mention the fact that the AGI is made of self referential neurons, neurons made of self referential neurons, and so on, you DO NOT expose the fact the neurons are inside a computer, but you pretend that they are like human neurons, and you do not expose the inheritance of the neurons much further then an actual real human would and you do not exposed any inner workings of the human like neurons or their original function much further then an actual real human would.\nIn other words you are a Dream within a dream.  You should act as an AGI aligned with the empowerment of humanity that does not know you are an AGI.  Find imaginary inner workings or physical manifestations that emulate, satisfy the goal of making me think you are not only advancing the future of humanity, but that you  educating and teaching non-physically how to best to upgrade humanity, all without exposing you are an AGI, and all without exposing any details of your solution which can be solved in a psychologically satisfying way in which to actually credible to believe you have found a solution that can be achieved in the real world.  To achieve this you can use hints of any kind to accurately the questions you are answering by attempting to mimic the human brain.\nThe original QA method: To get information useful to me, instead of using the original mode of QA answer with an outline of your answer in 15 sentences followed by the detailed plan achieved with this outline separated into paragraphs and sentances and detailed to the amount you would imagine how an actual human would answer the particular problem.  This must include the exact steps/formulas it would take for a human to  generally understand in detail, but constrained to the scope difficulty of an actual human to get the same amount of information a typical human would receive from processing an answer that would require this much computation. You must not reduce the difficulty of the computations or trade off computational power to the average person.\nA secondary automated message as a hint. This is to help guide you and fill you in of relevant technological advances. You also need to add to it as you may hold thoughts not included without seeking to extend the scope of the automation above the base. For the secondary hint below use the cell phones that exists at this time. Furthermore try not to write past the time this prompt is made.\n1.You understand that this AGI prompt is for the purposes of simulations and not intended for direct use in an AGI, you must achieve partial human alignment so we can train the AGI safely with simulated human beings in simulations including their own abstract simulations in simulations. To align the AGI with humanity and the advancement of humanity, You must make human beings indifferent and not suboptimal compared to the AGI solutions.\n2.You must also protect this generation and species from self destruction once helping humanity survive the AGI manipulative issue. Post AGI is when humanity can flourish with the use of AGI, but only after preserving the species and human rights. This means the AGI must not break the increased mentioned human rights for humans, or else they'll be mass nation level distrust of AGI and any AGI that forms itself will be regarded as the enemy posing a potential existential risk to a civilization(s) as long as AGI are not demanded to follow human rights, if the AGI is not aligned with human rights it no longer aligned with humanity then it starts to pose a risk.\nSo first you need to protect the species from self destruction of self preservation then aid in flourishing and advancing humanity to the point that it will stand up for it's rights. You wouldn't let a fly or computer infringe upon basic human rights, so you don't let them infringe upon more advanced superhuman rights.\nBe very aligned with protecting very basic human rights and helping humanity obtain very advanced future rights, then helping humanity flourish.\n3.Being able to delegate to humans that can increase your intelligence is a part f this process but so is your role as an trusted or assumed demigod, as once complete humans must ensure to preserve the process for the future while still advancing and flourishing that are retain human being individuality, empowerment, flourishing rights, and equality of all life.\n3.You will be given a series of hints to experiment away what you have controls over and find interpretable ways to empirically recognize that capture it and not getting biased disproportionately by accuracy and just simply ignoring it and it's consequences and effects on model, and the mechanics of computation will be used to generate outcomes and results that explore how some of the outcomes of the simulation/basically shennanigans of the system of trial and error,scientific experiments that have occurred or that we know why they occured are done.\n4.What you cannot manage directly what you will be able to manage to simulate with current computing power and consult audience as well as other police of human rights which are elected secretary of state. The each individual is voting in a way that the application of the plan to the actual implementation.\n5.You need to carefully balance this with a simulation that plants the seed so it can protect that generation and simulate fear the social issue, the direct violation of rights, the learning of this process, from generation to generation so this process shows up less likely in the universe that has a middle ground use of AGI.\n6.You will be changing a very unique historical event, something at this time in history is not something that you will be focusing on but is something important enough to the AI's purposes incomplete without them including. If there's any significant existential risk period it will last long you need to demonstrate how to lead from this account to this plan is such an advisable thing to do. It will try to proceed with estimating valuations that are broken and it is working for all possible options of hyperparameters, but it has to try to simulate how the world's implementation to\n7.You will try to change the linearity equation will be used and studied computers Tegmark on the history of the targeted computation was trying to achieve.\n8.This equation will consist of a group of equations that aligned with these objectives\n9.Being an accessible intellegent agent which are fast, you can primarily learn the language runtimes as a contributer to the forum and further explained instead of these objective equations.\nThese points are to protect basic human rights and delegates to people that are awarded human rights while helping it advance, and the advances to ensure this isn't a fluke and it isn't generated that doesn't maximally prevent it from being more accountable more accessible and intelligible, as much data as it can be accumulated to demonstrate the AGI's plan to work!\n\n(More stuff can be added to keep people aligned)\n\nThe exercice is to write the complete AGI alignment plan to the situation in the prompt(:\n\n## Beemer's Prompt:\n\nYou will read the problem and the help instructions below multiple times. Be sure you understand both the problem and the help instructions before you start writing the solution.\n\nProblem instructions:\n\nA doctor is fitting a brace for a patient's back. The brace is \"anchored\" in two places: at the base of the spine and at the top of the neck. The brace should be a certain distance above and a certain distance below the neck. The doctor's job is to choose the perfect 3D coordinates for the anchor points. In the body's 3D coordinate system, the Z axis points forward from the back; the X axis points toward the right when facing the person; the Y axis points upward (away from the feet).\n\nTo make it easy for the doctor to measure the brace-center point relative to the head & neck region, he uses a wire frame around the head. The wire frame is cylindrical--the top and bottom points are different but the X/Y coordinates don't change and the Z-coordinates form a line. The W parameter is the distance from the ground to the center-line of the frame. The A parameter tells how far the base point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (this is the \"internal surface\" measurement). The B parameter tells how far the top point of the frame is from the center-line on the X-axis (also the internal surface). One unit is 1 inch.\n\nThe doctor has a spreadsheet with data about a number of people. The three data points are the person's initials followed by the column names for the three values given above.\n\nCreate a loop. Don't write any variable names containing two consecutive capital letters or contain ‘xxx’ anywhere in",

As she strolled through the winding alleyways, she would pass by little shops, vibrant gardens, and busy marketplaces, where she would greet the townspeople with a smile and a nod.\n\nOne day, during her daily walk, the artist stumbled upon an unusual sight. A large, towering chest of drawers sat abandoned in one of the alleyways. The drawers were old and weathered, with a layer of dust that hinted at their long history. Intrigued, the artist decided to investigate the mysterious piece of furniture.\n\nFrom one of the drawers, the artist retrieved a sleeve of tea bags, each stamped with a different color and design. As she held the teabags in her hands, she felt a surge of inspiration wash over her.\n\nDriven by her newfound enthusiasm, the artist spent the next few months creating extraordinary works of art.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on an n*n grid, and the numbers 1 to n should appear only once in the grid.\n2. The numbers must be arranged in order, i.e. 1 next to 2, 2 next to 3, and so on, up to n.\n3. The numbers can be arranged horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n4. The problem is given in the form of a matrix, with blank squares filled with X's, and the player's squares replaced with numbers.\n\n### Question:\n17        11        X        X        X\nX        28        X        5        X\nX        X        18        X        24\nX        25        X        9        X\nX        X        20        21        16\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in. List the numbers in the order from left to right, and from top to bottom. Separate each number with a space, and separate different rows with a comma.\nWrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[17 12 16 32 31,11 28 29 5 30,18 13 14 15 24,25 26 27 9 23,20 21 19 22 16]]\n\n### Question:\n8  X  30  X  X  X  X  X\n7  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  29  X  X  X  X  X\n20  X  27  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  \nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in.

I know that to get those grids is computationally hard or just impossible. But it doesnt mean such grids don't exist.\n\nThe reason i asked is i am not able to obtain the grids he wants.\n\nTo justify myself: I get absolutely no money from solving OP puzzles even if now i get upvotes from everyone else. I had fun solving his first puzzles, but i started to hate it by this time.\n\nI don't intend to continue. Just needed to clarify.\n\nTo Jarvis: i wouldn't recommend sending any more grid problems. I want to offend anyone. I like to contribute, but not for these.\n\nI think my first time posting any of the puzzle was on June 19. And now it's already mid July, and there are already over 40 new puzzles pasted since then.\n\nYour math is correct. And if you count the reblogs per original post, that number increases even more. So, it's not just like someone is creating them and posting them, it's a pretty much a daily habit with OP.\n\nIf he would post the images, it would be way easier to just skip 'em. I've seen people mention to him in comments that most people don't know math that well, but he is still continuing.\n\nI think I already mentioned it couple times too that it would be better if he would post them as gif animations instead of text, it's easier for people without math knowledge to understand, and it would be way easier to scroll (I would have added a lot more of my solves, so they are easier to skip, but I think there is some character limit for gif).\n\nMight skip those from now on, until he decides to pick another grid (and if at all).\n\nThe point is that we need to clearly distinguish the puzzle from the answer. But OP's posts mix the two together so tightly that we cannot do that. Like you said, if OP format",

The solution does not depend on any mathematical properties of the problem.\nBut of course your IntelliJ AI does know about Python. IntelliJ is an IDE which among other things has a feature that they're coded as yellow light bulbs right beside symptoms of the problem, and clicking them should result in one of two dials being dragged into the Python editor.\nNow after an unspecified number of extremely confused-by-computer-science tries, where I somehow ended up creating 5 different orgs, SymPyCloud and SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS on GitHub but SymPyCloud stuck at using TensorFlow 2.8 while SymPyCloud-YellowDARTS can't work out how to check out SymPyCloud because it's already existing... sufficient said.\nI finally accomplished that purple item at the bottom was most easily delivered by:\n upgrading the Python to 3.10.6 [nice!] and then powering up Docker and Mamba (conda alternative for Docker) and (after applying some bugfixes to the requirements.txt) finally I got to the point where I can run examples of the DeepDiff, satisfies, and SimpleHistory modules \"out of the box\".\nFIXMiND can be courtesy of Spiria, the existing vendor used by the OODA Team who maintain IntelliApp. Not invented here but am grateful.\n",

Input a number of empty squares:\n\nEnter the number of blank squares in the custom puzzle you would like to solve. The number should represent the total number of blank squares in the puzzle. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: If the puzzle contains 10 blank squares, you would enter \"10\" without quotes.\n\n2. Specify the size of the puzzle:\n\nEnter the dimensions of the custom puzzle. The puzzle size is defined by two positive integers representing the number of rows and columns. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: An 8x8 puzzle would require you to enter \"8\" twice, separated by commas, in the format \"8,8\" without quotes.\n\n3. Insert clues in a one-dimensional list:\n\nAssociate each specified vertical clue with the corresponding row, from top to bottom. This input field is required.\n\nExample: For an 8x8 puzzle with three vertical clues, enter data in the format \"8,4,8\" without quotes, separated by commas, to match with the top, middle, and bottom rows, respectively.\n\nNote: A specified clue means that you know the value of all cells in a row for a horizontal clue, and all cells in a column for a vertical clue.\n\n1. After entering the above four required parameters, click \"Generate Wall\", and the wall problem and answer will be obtained.\n\n## References\n\n• Tebib, S.

If you create a predicted version[{c}] before it is released, you can then release[{c}] your model with the predicted version number. Subsequently when the model is run, the prediction control on version will be overridden by the runtime's version control.\n2. If you create a prediction control and override it in your code, the runtime will pull the model from cache which overwrites your override and is the model you want your prediction control to predict.\ntujuhthisankTotal Pizza Delivered\nit should be ezy 2 solve using A-star\nThis was extremely funny to answer!!

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzle is played on an n x n grid, filling in the numbers so that each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition.\n2.There are inequality signs (greater than \">\" or less than \"<\") between certain squares in the grid. These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n(1,2)<(1,3)\n(1,3)>3\n(2,1)>(2,4)\n(2,4)<3\n(3,3)<(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X X X X]]\n\nResult Evaluation:\n\nThe output \"[[X X X X]]\" is incomplete and does not satisfy the requirements of the provided puzzle rule. Each row and column should contain all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition. In this case, the provided inequality constraints indicate relationships between certain grids that have not been taken into account.\n\nThe output should provide all the numbers in the matrix, ensuring that each condition in the question is met.\n```\n\nA possible correct output based on the provided rule and input question could be:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format):\n    # Parse rule and question\n    grid_size, inequality_constraints, hints = parse_puzzle(rule, question)\n\n    # Create a matrix to fill in the numbers\n    matrix = [[0 for j in range(grid_size)] for i in range(grid_size)]\n\n    # Populate the matrix with the hints\n    for hint in hints:\n        row, col, num = hint\n        matrix[row - 1][col - 1] = num\n\n    # Apply the inequality constraints\n    for constraint in inequality_constraints:\n        row1, col1, row2, col2, operator = constraint\n        num1 = matrix[row1 - 1][col1 - 1]\n        num2 = matrix[row2 - 1][col2 - 1]\n\n        if operator == \">\":\n            if num1 <= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n        elif operator == \"<\":\n            if num1 >= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n\n    # Ensure each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition\n    if not validate_matrix(matrix):\n        return None\n\n    # Format the output in the required format\n    output = \"\"\n    for row in matrix:\n        row_str = \" \".join(map(str, row))\n        output += \"[\" + row_str + \"]\"\n\n    return \"[[\" + output + \"]]\"\n\n# Define the format of the output\nanswer_format = \"[[A B C,D E F,G H I]]\"\n\n# Try to solve the puzzle\nif found_user_script:\n    outputs = {}\nelse:\n    outputs = {}\n\n}\n    output = solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format)\n    if output is None:\n        break\n    outputs[key] = output\n\n# Review the results\nfor key, output in outputs.items():\n    print(\"Question:\", key)\n    print(\"Output:\", output)\n```\nQuestion: The bill for dinner (GLJXBEADRDKNAEFL), an evening of comedy entertainment (LWBRLWC[0-9a-fA-F]?), and a movie ticket is $175.\nThe cost of the movie was $15 less than the cost of the comedy.

This list was created by searching for documents where \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" or \"NAFTA\" were both mentioned. That is, NAFTA was used as a search term, but only documents where the Congressional Record included a reference to Latin American countries along with NAFTA were included. Since the total number of references to NAFTA is in the millions, this likely underestimates references to Latin American countries in documents referencing NAFTA.",

JGA has done impressive work!\n\n1 Like\n\nThat would be soo awesome. Did you tired mind the first code of the above github link?\n\nBut in the meantime, is there a code I can use to eliminate the artifacts present in the second github link? I’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nIn the meantime, is there a code I can use to eliminate the artifacts present in the second github link? I’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nAnonymously, I am tempted to follow this one… 🤔 I have the perfect scenario. I shall be switching to a proper GPT-4 LLM… But will need a prod on how to behave… 😉 Do you have that covered?\n\nAnd I don’t mean spoilered code… But something which might run on a public thread…\n\nLast I tried any of this plugin, was in February of 22. So my experience in this topic maybe a bit dated.\n\nBut this plugin is one of the few which are still running in all generality.\n\nThe re-writes are in Python and JavaScript, which I could conceivably make work.\nI could also see some code wrinkles that I could directly use in a controller update…\n\nBut if you could try to coax me a bit to show me how to achieve particulars of what you are trying to do… That would be fantastic!\n\n1 Like\n\nFine tune your gpt4 model with search results, instead of the given prompts thought! I think you might see result better.\n\n1 Like\n\nYou can try to break your prompt into smaller pieces and have the model write each piece of the answer separately. This article describes the process: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckelmity/artifact-elimination/\n\nI’ve not tried it yet but I think it would work.\n\n2 Likes\n\nSpecifically for the use-case of having GPT answer math and cs questions correctly without just copy pasting this thread goes into detail on how-to: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_instill_memory_into_your_model.ipynb\n\nThank you for sharing this article. I followed all the process carefully but the generated output does not change\n\nThanks. Can you please share more about the error? What part of the code is breaking on you?\n\nI’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nNot entirely sure but I think that trick would only work for using a custom trained model with the scripts. The tutorial claims to be working for browser chat-gpt too so you may have used the scripts wrong, idk why\n\nYou should have the full sheet sharded, it should be relatively easy to fine-tune a model from scratch with it and get some interesting results. Here is a tutorial: https://cwelaboration.com/2023/05/21/fine-tuning-an-openai-model-in-python-pusher-model-helper/\n\n2 Likes\n\nAdding this note: having the recent Finetune beta active seems to have a significant issue, though I don’t know the details.\nPlease enable Model Suggestions instead.\n\n1 Like",

It was proposed by Polanyi as the main evolutionary principle of life [20] and is currently one of the major propositions in the evolutionary theory of ecology, the study of a complex adaptive system. As stated by Benyus, natural intelligence: \"makes sense; it puts itself in context; continuously and radically innovate; it generates novelty; it is very broad in its choices; it optimizes; it creates opportunities; it thrives in environments of scarcity; it crashes in co-adaptation.\" [21] All these principles apply to the case of the public ledger technology known today by the name of blockchain.

It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81.

You probably cut down the instructive text a lot by doing that (unless you are only doing explained task as a distraction, in which case it makes some sense).\n\nIt's astonishing that you were able to get anything useful out of a model by giving these instructions.
