The letter 'G' is at position 6 in the LETTERS list.\n\nNext, we generate the keystream value y for 'G' using the Initial sequence of cards. The keystream value y is equal to the position of the top card of the deck (starting from the bottom) after performing the \"count cut\" step on the Initial sequence of cards. Let's calculate the keystream value y and the resulting deck after the \"count cut\" step.\n\nInitial sequence of cards: [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n\nAfter performing the \"count cut\":\n[29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 54, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 14, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n\nThe top card is 29, so the calculation for the keystream value y is:\n\ny = 29\n\nNow, we calculate the original positional value x from the ciphertext character 'G' by subtracting y from z and applying the mod 26 operation:\n\nx = (z - y) mod 26\nx = (6 - 29) mod 26\nx = -23 mod 26\nx = 3 (since -23 is equivalent to 3 modulo 26)\n\nNow, we use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position 3:\n\nLETTERS[3] = 'D'\n\nTherefore, the decrypted plaintext character for the ciphertext \"G\" is 'D'.\n\nThe answer is encapsulated in double square brackets as follows:\n```\n[[D]]\n```",
