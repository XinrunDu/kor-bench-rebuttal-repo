If p1 = ✓ and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ✓ and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓, and p3 = ✓, then (p1 &p3 ) = ✓ and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ✓=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ✓, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ✓, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",

This occurs when the propositions are transposed incorrectly during logical reasoning, leading to an invalid conclusion. In this specific case, the relationship between the \"less than\" (R) operation is being transposed between the universal quantifiers (∀x and ∃y), which results in a contradiction because ∀x∃yR(x, y) correctly states the property of natural numbers that there is no largest number, while ∃y∀xR(x, y) incorrectly concludes the existence of a largest number. The logical error comes from incorrectly transferring the properties from one type of quantifier to another, leading to a false conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is G (IllTrans Method).",
