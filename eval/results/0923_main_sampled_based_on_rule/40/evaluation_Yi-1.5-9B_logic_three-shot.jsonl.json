Method ⸮:\n- If S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) S C D     P\n    - (3) S E F     P\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n2. Method ؆:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method ꙮ:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4.

Method ⚘:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.

Historically, gutta-percha, a natural rubber-like substance, and horse hair fibers were combined to create various cordages.

It is often recommended that newborns should not be weaned too early to avoid trauma to their tender stomachs, as it is not suitable to consume too many solid foods, especially bean products and popcorn. Similarly, a vacuum cleaner can be harmful to babies who are not weaned yet. As we know, even if the exhaust from a vacuum cleaner is filtered to be comparatively clean, it is still difficult for infants to tolerate and digest. It may cause digestive problems such as indigestion and acid reflux.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

It incorrectly assumes that the statement \"Some students are doctors\" can be negated to \"Some students are not doctors.\" However, this is not a valid logical inference. The subset relation between the two categories is not symmetric; having some students studying medicine does not imply that there are no students who are not doctors.",
