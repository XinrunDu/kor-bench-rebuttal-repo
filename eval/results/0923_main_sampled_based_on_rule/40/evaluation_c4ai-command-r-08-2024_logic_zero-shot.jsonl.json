Person A's statement: Prof Wang is not from Suzhou (not p) and he is from Shanghai (q). So, we can represent Person A's statement as:\n    - !p & q \n\n2. Person B's statement: Prof Wang is not from Shanghai (not q) and he is from Suzhou (p). So, Person B's statement is:\n    - !q & p \n\n3. Person C's statement: Prof Wang is neither from Shanghai nor Hangzhou (not q and not r). Thus, Person C's statement can be written as:\n    - !q & !r \n\n\nNow, let's consider Professor Wang's remarks:\n- One of you got everything right: This refers to the correct identification of Professor Wang's origin. If one person got everything right, it means that their statement is entirely true. In this case, either p, q, or r must be true.\n- One got half right: This implies that some part of a person's statement is correct, while another part is incorrect. For instance, if P were true, and the other two (Q and R) were false, this would mean that the statement 'Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (not p) and he is from Shanghai (q)' is partly right.\n- One got everything wrong: This means that a person's statement is entirely false. If Q were true, and both P and R were false, then the statement 'Professor Wang is not from Shanghai (not q), and he is from Suzhou (p)' would be entirely wrong.\n\nSo, evaluating each person's claim in the light of Professor Wang's comments, we get: \n1. Person A: Since 'p' is false and 'q' is true, we can say that Person A got one right (Prof is from Shanghai) but had the other claim wrong (Prof was not from Suzhou). \n    - Half-right: A\n\n2. Person B: With 'q' being true, and 'p' false, Person B made an accurate statement about Prof Wang being from Shanghai. But, their claim about Prof's not being from Suzhou is wrong. \n    - Half-right: B\n\n3. Person C: 'q' is false, and 'r' is also false based on the information. So, Person C made a statement that is entirely wrong. \n    - Entirely Wrong: C\n\nGiven that exactly one of p, q, and r is true, the truth is p, meaning Professor Wang is from Suzhou.

In this specific application, we define 𝐸 as the set of natural numbers, N.\n- Every entity constant 'a' in the language has a corresponding entity 'a′' in 𝐸. In this case, 'a′' has been assigned the value of 0.\n- The language also contains functions and predicates. Specifically, we are given examples:\n  - Two binary functions, fJ(x, y) and gJ(x, y), which perform addition and multiplication, respectively.\n  - A binary predicate, FJ(x, y), which denotes equality between two entities, i.e., x = y.\n\n**Implentation of the Formula under J**\n\nLet's proceed with rewriting the given formula, ∀xF(g(x,a),x) → F(x,y), as it would appear under the interpretation J:\n1. We start with the formula ∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y). To implement this under J, we first need to consider the function symbols and entity constants.\n2. Replacing the entity constant 'a′' with its assigned value, 0, we have: ∀xF(g(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n3. Next, we should look at the function symbol 'g':\n- In the function g(x, y), we substitute 'g' with its implementation 'gJ': ∀xF(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n4. Since the domain of discourse, 𝐸, is the set of natural numbers, this will hold for all entities in N. Therefore, we do not need to include the universal quantifier, ∀x, in our implementation. Applying this modification, our formula becomes: F(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n5. Finally, we substitute the predicate symbol 'F' with its implementation 'FJ': ∀xF(FJ(gJ(x,0),x),x) → F(FJ(x,y),y).\n\nNow, let's apply the implementation process to the formula in a line-by-line manner:\n- ∀x[F(g(x, a), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(g(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)\n\n**Final Answer**: [∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)]",

So, 'x' becomes 0 in the formula. \n\nThe function symbols 'f' and 'g' are replaced with their implementations in J: fJ(x,x) becomes fJ(0,0) and likewise, gJ(x,x) becomes gJ(0,0). \n\nThe predicate symbols FJ(x, y) represent equality in J, so it is replaced with its assigned relation in J: FJ(x, y) becomes equality. \n\nThus, the implemented formula becomes [∃0(fJ(0, 0), gJ(0, 0))]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [∃0(fJ(0, 0), gJ(0, 0))]",

LS Paradox Rule:\nAccording to the LS Paradox rule, when such a contradiction arises, we must \"reassess the reasonableness\" of our hypotheses. This is where Option B comes from. \n\n5. Resolution:\nBy reassessing the hypotheses, we might discover that either one or more of the initial hypotheses (r_1 to r_n) are not as robust as initially thought, or that the new hypothesis r_n+1 is the more plausible one. This could lead us to either accepting the new hypothesis (Option A) or ignoring it in favor of the initial set (Option C). \n\nHence, the correct answer is [B/A/C], indicating that reassessment (Option B) is the first step, followed by either accepting the new hypothesis or sticking to the initial set.",
