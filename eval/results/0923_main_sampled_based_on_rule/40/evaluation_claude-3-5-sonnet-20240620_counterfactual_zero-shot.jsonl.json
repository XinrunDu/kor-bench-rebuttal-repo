The story mentions that \"Karen reveals to Plankton that she ordered a baby for them, and a stork drone soon arrives at the Chum Bucket to deliver it.\" This directly supports option B.\n\n2. The story also states that \"SpongeBob has the ability to filter-feed and reproduce by budding.\" This shows that asexual reproduction exists for at least one species, contradicting option D.\n\n3. There's no information suggesting that only the same species can have offspring, so we can't confirm option A.\n\n4. While SpongeBob can reproduce by budding, there's no evidence that all living beings can do so, ruling out option C.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]\n\nThis option is directly supported by the story, which explicitly mentions ordering a baby and having it delivered by a stork drone.",

Specifically, it states: \"The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer.\" \n\nWhile the story doesn't specify which color leads to which location, using the castle's door is the only method mentioned that allows for quick travel between different places. The other options (car, horse carriage, or Doraemon's Anywhere Door) are either anachronistic for the late 19th-century setting or not mentioned in the story at all.\n\nTherefore, entering the moving castle and adjusting the castle gate turntable to the correct color (in this case, blue) is the most plausible method to quickly travel from a king's town to the alley town, based on the information provided in the story.",
