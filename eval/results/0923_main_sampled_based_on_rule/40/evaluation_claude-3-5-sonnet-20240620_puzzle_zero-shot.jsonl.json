The only way for O + O to end in T is if there's a carry over, meaning O + O ≥ 10\n3. The smallest possibility for O is 5 (as 5 + 5 = 10)\n4.

The sum of HERE and SHE results in a 5-digit number (COMES), which means H must be 9 for the sum to reach 10000 or above.\n2. Given that H=9, the E in the ones place of both HERE and SHE must sum to a number ending in S.\n3. The only way for this to happen is if E+E=10+S, which means E must be 8 and S must be 6.\n4.
