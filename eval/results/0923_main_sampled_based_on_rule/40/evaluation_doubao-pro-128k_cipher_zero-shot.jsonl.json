For example, for (M, V), since the key letter is M, we use the MN cipher alphabet: UVWXYZNOPQRSTGHIJKLMABCDEF.\n\nWe then find the position of the plaintext letter in the standard alphabet and replace it with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet.\n\nFor (M, V), V is the 22nd letter in the standard alphabet. The 22nd letter in the MN cipher alphabet is T.\n\nApplying this process to all pairs, we get the ciphertext:\n\n[[TTGHTIPRMFF]] ",
