For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Live code explanation answer:\n\nThe explanation for the encryption and decryption process involves mapping characters using three alphabets (reserved, standard, and substitution) as well as shifting letters. The details are as follows:\n\n1. During encryption, \"C\" is moved four spaces in the standard alphabet to get \"G\". Then \"G\" is mapped to \"H\" in the reverse alphabet. Finally, \"H\" is mapped to \"F\" in the substitution alphabet. So after encryption, \"C\" becomes \"F\".\n\n2. During decryption, \"C\" is mapped to \"H\" in the substitution alphabet. Then \"H\" is shifted backward four spaces according to the standard alphabet to get \"D\". Finally, \"D\" is mapped to \"C\" in the reversed alphabet. So after decryption, \"C\" should be \"V\".\n\nWhen asked to decrypt again, the process explained above is applied once more.\n\n### Live code question answer:\n\n[[V]]\n\n### Live code question and answer:\n\nQuestion: Plaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Professional standards ensure puzzles and designs are clear, engaging, and visually appealing. They include using appropriate colors, fonts, and layouts, as well as following specific rules and guidelines for creating and solving puzzles.\n\n2. Why are professional standards important? Professional standards are important because puzzles are evaluated by professional puzzle designers and solvers. As a puzzle architect for players of all levels, from entry to world-class level, there is significant pressure to create exciting and visually stunning puzzles.\n\n3. What exactly makes professional standards in puzzles difficult? Applying professional standards to puzzles and graphic designs is difficult because it requires focus on details. I have to ensure the puzzles are attractive and well-balanced. At the same time, I have to maintain a higher standard in solving puzzles and generating answers.\n\n### Leaderboard:\n\n.ihere-player-leaderboard {\nmax-width: 175px;\nmargin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n-moz-user-select: none;\n-webkit-user-select: none;\n-ms-user-select: none;\nuser-select: none;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nflex-direction: column;\nmin-width: 0;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list {\nmax-width: 175px;\nfont-weight: 900;\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nborder-radius: 6px;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nbox-shadow: 0 1px 4px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 20%), 0 2px 3px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 14%), 0 1px 8px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 12%);\nborder-radius: 6px;\npadding: 0.7rem 0.1rem;\nmargin-bottom: 0.2rem;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-list-item {\nmax-width: 150px;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-avatar {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-nick {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.ihere-player-leaderboard-score {\nheight: 2rem;\nwidth: 2rem;\nborder-radius: 100%;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 0.8rem;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.leaderboard-box {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nopacity: 1;\npadding: 0.5rem 0.5rem;\nbackground-color: rgb(248, 254, 255);\nborder-radius: 5px;\nz-index: 2;\nposition: absolute;\nbottom: 7rem;\nleft: 1rem;\nright: 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nwidth: auto;\nanimation: pop 0.9s 1 forwards;\nbox-shadow: rgb(0 0 0 / 20%) 0px 1px 4px, rgb(0 0 0 / 14%) 0px 2px 3px, rgb(0 0 0 / 12%) 0px 1px 8px;\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 500px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 400px) {\n.leaderboard-box {\nmax-width: 300px;\nwidth: auto \\0/;\nheight: 100%;\n}\n}\n@keyframes pop {\n0% {\ntransform: scale(0.75);\nopacity: 0.25;\n}\n100% {\ntransform: scale(1);\nopacity: 1;\n}\n}\n.leaderboard-box-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\nmargin: 1rem 1rem;\nheight: auto;\nopacity: 1;\nfont-family var(--ihere-font-family);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 700;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n}\n.leaderboard-box-title {\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\nfont-family var(--",

The first number in each triple (4,1,5) represents the column number L1_col located on Gird1, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the value of the first letter (T) is from the value of the column (4) when viewed from the row.\n2. The second number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the value y of the number of L1_row and L2_col on Gird3, ranging from 1-9, which indicates that the second letter (H) value is taken from the row number 0 and column number 0 on Gird3, which happens to be the value 1.\n3. The third number of each triple (4,1,5) represents the row number L2_row located on Gird2, ranging from 1-9, meaning that the value of the second letter is located in the row (1) viewed from the column (5). The numbers 1 and 2 represent the same meaning of the value.\n### Can we simplify the rule of encryption so that the decryption becomes simpler?\n### Answer:\n\nThe rule can be simplified through normalization operations : \n- Encryption Rules Simplified(resulting in ciphertext):\n    - Group the characters in the plaintext into a group of 3 for processing, and pad them with \"#\" at the end if the amount is not sufficient for grouping.\n    - For each ternary group, use Gird1 to take the row and column values to determine the column number value p1_col and the position row number t_row of the place that needs to be substituted on the substitution table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row as the columns p1_col and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the first number c1.\n    - Use Gird2 to take the row and column values to pick out the column number value p2_col and the position row number t_row of the place to be replaced on the substitute table Table.\n    - Then use the substitute number table Table to replace the position on the same row in the same row t_row p2_col as the column and the numbers 1-9 in order to get the second number c2.\n    - The row and column values of Gird3 are located at p1_col in the top row and p2_col in the left column to get the third number c3.\n   - The values of c1c2c3 in turn form the final plaintext ciphertext.\n- where c1c2c3 belong to [1,9]\n- Decryption Rules Simplified(resulting in plaintext).\n   - Grouped by three, the ciphertext is the inverse of the encryption rules, which is not listed here.\n- A basic substitute number table table in this example:\n  \n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the plaintext, this normalized substitution table will also specifically be different. For example, the substitution number table（Table） for the plaintext of SHINEPREDICT should be:\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>4</td>\n    <td>5</td>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>7</td>\n    <td>8</td>\n    <td>9</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>I</td>\n    <td>N</td>\n    <td>K</td>\n    <td>F</td>\n    <td>C</td>\n    <td>D</td>\n    <td>S</td>\n    <td>V</td>\n    <td>T</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2</td>\n    <td>H</td>\n    <td>P</td>\n    <td>O</td>\n    <td>M</td>\n    <td>E</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n    <td>W</td>\n    <td>Z</td>\n    <td>R</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Y</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n    <td>J</td>\n    <td>L</td>\n    <td>X</td>\n    <td>U</td>\n    <td>G</td>\n    <td>#</td>\n    <td>Q</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\nPlaintext: \"COVERTAKE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer as described above, encapsulated in double square brackets.For example the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\ncovertake is not 9 characters long, and the last part of the plaintext needs to be padded with # as [COV ERTA KE#], which is 7+3=1\nThe first ternary group is COV：\n- C=(1,5) need to base Table change p1_col=5 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take the Table's 1th row, 5th number. get: c1=M\n- O=(2,6) need to base Table change p1_col=6 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number, and then take Table's 2th row, 6th number. get: c2=X\n- V=(4,3) need to base Table change p2_col=3 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 3th number. get: c3=R\n- According to Grid3, c3=R,L1_row=2, L2_col=5,so L1_col=3, L2_row=7\n- So CT number is 3-5-7=357\n- COV, the first ternary group to CT number is 357\nThe second ternary group is RTA：\n- R=(6,8) need to base Table change p1_col=8 to t_row=3, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 3th row, 8th number. get: c1=T\n- T=(1,1) need to base Table change p1_col=1 to t_row=1, take Grid1's column number column, and then take Table's 1th row, 1th number. get: c2=T\n- A=(1,10), a is not in the Table, so A in the Table is #, so need to base Table change p2_col=1 to t_row=3, take Grid2's column number column, then take Table's3th row, 1st number. get: V\n- According to Grid3, c3=7, L1_row=0, L2_col=5, so L1_col=4, L2_row=8\n- So CT number is 4-4-8=448\n- RTA in the second three becomes CT number is 448\nThe third ternary group is KE#:\n- K=(4,7)need to base Table change p1_col=7 to t_row=4, take Grid1's column number column, then take Table's4th row, 7th number. get: c1=P\n- E=(3,4)need to base Table change p1_col=4 to t_row=2, take Grid1's column number column,",

In his 1904 speech, he stated \"those crafty people in Spain are opposed to us, not Germans.\" The speech was turned into an opera in 1909. In 1910 he made the first recorded journey to Antarctica, to see Antarctic glaciers. On 29 April 1912, during a month and a half war with Germany, he claimed to have been forced to fly under false colors, shortly after arriving back in the United States from his month and a half stay in Tangier, where he took its flags from a German submarine. After being taken to the fleet's headquarters in Italy, he then sailed to Tangier, another British-controlled naval base. The mission was initially successful, but the Germans soon took an active part in the attack, sending in airships to attack him, supposedly taking him and his ship back to Germany. Contrary to his orders, aviators began bombarding the Russian airfield in Seville (which was subsequently destroyed by the Allies) with a new experimental 75mm bomb called the \"Muniz bomb\". This bomb contained 400kg of a highly toxic poison, and had a 70% death rate among the entire population of the town. The bomb proved very effective in destroying the Russian airfields and was dropped over the capital buildings of Seville. Some of those attacked had already been killed or had gone underground; those who survived were killed, and as a psychological effect, the civilian population was devastated. In the Battle of Safra Mahmoud Hamoud, the commanding officer assigned Manning as his principal assistant. While commanding the air arm of the rebel army, Manning had a number of air strikes on Russian cities, as well as an Italian front. During the summer tour, he flew a Suchie artillery piece over the bridge at Anzio, using it as a self-propelled transport.\n\nIn 1924, at the age of seventeen, Manning joined the Massachusetts Military Academy, a private officer's club that was regarded as one of America's most prestigious military academies. It was run by George Washington, who later became the commander of the U.S. Army. He did not enjoy school, and spent many days and nights staying away from home, studying military books. In 1925, he decided to leave the school and join the U.S. Army Air Corps as a pilot. He later received the bulk of military training as a navigator, but rather than immediately board a ship he went into a small squadron at home. In time, he learned the intricacies of flight procedures, such as avoiding aircraft by being a one-year apprentice in a foreign military position.\n\nWhile serving in America too, he became a member of The American Legion, the first African American military group to hold formal training in the use of aircraft. In his first year of training he had been granted permission to use the Spitfire XK7567 as his personal fighter plane. While still in his first year, he took part in a fly-by-night mission in the Bermuda triangle. Manning was a Chief Wingman with the USS Spitfire, when his plane was shot down in the Bermuda Triangle. Another American had also been killed, and was reported to have sustained minor injuries and the cockpit had fallen into the water. He managed to swim to the beach but was unable to move due to his injuries and had to be lifted from the aircraft in a sling, which was attached to a rescue boat. His plane was also shot down, but he survived; he was rescued and assumed to be still alive.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Manning decided to stay on with the AAF as a pilot, and began working as a civilian flight instructor. He later applied to join the British Air Force as a pilot. He married Peggy Flaherty, the daughter of Lord Louis Mountbatten (Mountbatten's private secretary). They had three children.\n\nIs this the start of what would become PTI's latest new company (after its first step to oblivion)? Not quite, but you want to know what it really means for you as an individual. The answer, Manning goes, is a lot. They no longer ask: If we keep up the same way we're doing now (or perhaps start new), will we be able to get our customers to use PTI?\n\nI'm not sure about \"too much water being kept up.\" As Dave discovered on a hot summer day, water makes you feel hot. So if your company is trying to start new, you're really overdoing it, and you may not have known.\n\nWe'd love to talk the topic of water with you. Perhaps we can get our customers not to store water; instead, make it available to their friends so they can use it in the real world too. This would be a better idea for the following reasons:\nGiven that, we've got two main goals.\nThe first one is quite simple. Let's say we give everyone a few minutes to drink or mix up their water, and ask them to fill in two containers",

Then, when communicating with your friend, you can send coded messages using the selected cipher rule. Remember to keep the cipher rule private between the two of you to maintain the secrecy of your code. Also, have fun and be creative with your coded messages!\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks. Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: a string with punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext column by the column from left to right top down play out of the content, when the encounter first letter, it's its position to words as a reminder point, if the encounter word later, record up the words ahead of the differential position of the letter.\n        - FFF#OR#EXA#MPL#E##\n        - 'o' is the first letter selected, row skips forward one line, the position of letters assigned a number, marked as `l`;\n        - the F#RR#OIE#ALX#MPL#E#\n        - 'r' is the first letter selected, is a 'o' before the letter also selected in the third row when the second letter, the line is skipped forward one line, the letter is assigned a position, marked as `e`;\n        - the F#RROEALLX#OMLLE#EM#P#\n        - and so on, note the location of each selected letter as FFF#OR#EXAMLlE##a#p#\n    - Now through the rules of the first column, the column subscript of the top line all by 1, the corresponding letter extract the corresponding letter `ROR#l`, and then to the second column, because the location information is not on this column, skip the second column, the third column subscript content all by 1, the corresponding letter E##e#, and the 'e' is already there after the first letter to add location information, need to position 'e' to find, according to 'e' as a benchmark, all columns leftward had D' + 1 position, to the new position letter E##E#; And so on, such as the 'm' position information is missing, the location information to find according to the \"o\" for the \"O\" multi-3-position, corresponding letters is o#P#; As such, each column sequentially dealt with, and eventually encrypted text is `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n- Decryption Steps （the exact opposite of encryption steps）：\n    - The initial text is None.\n    - At the beginning, first put all the ciphertext columns in one place, and mark the top line for each column, and keep a reminder bit in all the following columns, the prompt bit is set to -1 `RROEALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - According to the first prompt bit later a column, this column on the prompt bit 1 minus 1, according to the line number for each letter in the column corresponding to the letter extracted, and into the memory, the 'o' where the corresponding subscript is 2, this line letter R is extracted, take into account that this is not repeated, the follow-up no longer need to spend `R` --- `R#O_ALLXOMLLEEMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - Next, the next line on the spot minus 2, and then according to the second column of information to the third column to find the repetition also minus 2, and the corresponding position of the 'r' is 2, correspond to the L for the line for the extraction letter, and the follow-up no longer participate in the operation `R --- R#O# - -` --- -> `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n    - and so on, to eventually return `RLL --- R#O#LL#E_LL_EMPRLLEYFlfFOR`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A Tokyo Street Map\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

I will provide the differences between the new encryption rules and the old encryption rules. Please judge according to the information provided.\n\n### Question:\nInput:\nPlaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\nEncrypted character set changes: Lengthen from 6 to 7.\n\nOutput:\nCiphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n\nPreparation:\n7x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\nEncrypted Character Set: \"ADFGVXW\"\n\nRule Changes:\nEncryption Rules Change (Changes from the old encryption rules):\n1. The encrypted character set increases the number of encrypted characters from 6 to 7.\n2. The character \"W\" is added in the encrypted character set.\n3. The dimension of the matrix used for encryption increases.\n\nEncryption Steps;\n- For each character in the plaintext:\n    - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 7X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n    - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-7. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n        - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to 'A' in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to 'F' in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n    - Read all rows, then all columns of the encrypted binary to get the last Cipher text.\n        - For example, the Encrypted Binary is (A,F)(X,W), the last read is AXFW, so the last ciphertext is AXFW.\n\nNote: Encrypted character set and 7x6 matrix have a certain relationship.

Let you review this relationship knowledge again. \n\nMatrix 6X6:\n\n['R', 'U', 'A', 'Q', 'B', 'D',\n' ', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1', 'H',\n' ', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z', 'Y',\n'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L', '9',\n' ', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N', '6',\n'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nAs a reminder, please do not give wrong answers. Try to restore the relationship as much as possible. \n\nFirst line of characters: R,U,A,Q,B,D （A<->F,<->D）AD\nSecond line of characters: ,W,K,S,1,H （D<->A<->G）ADG\nThird line of characters: ,5,F,T,Z,Y （F<->V<->F）ADF\nFourth line of characters: C,G,X,7,L,9 （G<->A<->D）ADG\nFifth line of characters: ,I,3,P,N,6 （D<->G<->V）ADGV\nSixth line of characters: J,V,O,E,M,\\0 (\\0 is the end character) （V<->F<->X）ADFX\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is signified by six sets of two-character strings, each set corresponding to a row in the 6x6 matrix. These sets can be stated as: (A,D), (A,F), (D,G), (D,F), (D,G), and (V,F).\n\nThe ordering that outlines the relationship: A <-> F <-> D <-> A <-> G <-> V <-> F <-> X\n\nNote: Encoding example: A (A<->F) is replaced by A, F (F<->X) is replaced by X.\n\n* Characters with ' ' can be ignored.\n\n### Answer:\n* According to the information provided, it seems that the correct answer is obviously, but in order to prevent misinformation, please correct me immediately if there are errors. Thank you very much! \n\nThe relationship between this matrix and the character set is described as the following expression:\n\n\"ADFGVX\" is indicated by six pairs of two-character strings, each pair corresponding to a row in the 6x6 array. It can be interpreted as:\n \n AD - > A,D (First row)\n AF - > A,F (Second row)\n DA - > D,A (Third row)\n DG - > D,G (Fourth row; judge, D<->G, diagram, G<->D)\n DV - > D,V (Fifth row)\n FX - > F,X (Sixth row)\n\n* As a reminder, the relationship between the encryption character set and the matrix is:\n\nThe encryption character set is determined by the sequence of 'non-space character' characters on the first line of characters of the matrix (in this case, 'RUAQBD'), which results in the series 'ADFGVX.' This series describes the movements required to access any element on the matrix, where the first character points to the file (0 to 5) and the second character indicates the rank from 0 to 5. \n\nFor instance, to represent the case of 'i', one could start with the row marked 'A', and then find the column labeled as 'V'. Therefore, 'i' would be represented as 'AV'. \n\nThis arrangement facilitates the encryption of text.\n\n*** However, please double check with the provided data and ensure that this is the correct **interpretation\n\n### Question:\nMatrix 8X8:\n\n['U', 'O', 'Q', 'S', 'B', 'R', '0', 'F',\n'1', 'T', 'C', 'H', ' ', 'W', 'I', 'M',\n'A', 'G', 'E', 'X', '2', ' ', '7', '6',\n'J', '9', 'D', 'P', 'K', 'Y', '5', 'L',\n' ', ' ', '3', ' ', 'N', 'Z', ' ', '4',\n' ', 'V', '8', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '\\0']\n\nEncryption character set: \"ADFGHOPR123\"\n\n**Relation rules between array and character set:**\n\nSecond line of characters: 1,T",

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n### Instruction:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\nEncryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8, such as `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Encryption Steps:\n\n    1. Convert each character to binary\n    2. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - If the key is shorter than the character's binary representation, repeat the key to match the length.\n    3. Permutation: Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine binary strings: Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n    Decryption Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 as used for encryption, like `10101010`.\n    - Permutation Table:\n    - Inverse Permutation Table:\n\n- Decryption Steps:\n\n    1. Split ciphertext into chunks: Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted\n\n    character.\n\n    2. Inverse permutation: Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n\n    3. XOR operation: Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n\n    4. Convert binary to character: Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent, and then to its corresponding ASCII character\n\n    5. Combine characters: Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Example:\n\n- Plaintext: \"S\"\n- Encrypted Result: `11111001`\n- Ciphertext: \"11111011\"\n### Solve the following problems according to the instructions and examples provided (the language structure is fixed).\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"g34\"\n\n1. Convert `g`:\n\n    - ASCII value of 'g': 103\n    - Binary representation: `01100111`\n\n2. Convert `3`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '3': 51\n    - Binary representation: `00110011`\n\n3. Convert `4`:\n\n    - ASCII value of '4': 52\n    - Binary representation: `00110100`\n\n4. Concatenate the binary representations: `011001110011001100110100`\n\n5. XOR with the fixed key:\n\n    Fixed Key: `10101010`\n\n XOR result: `110011011001100110011110`\n\n1. Permutation:\n\n    No\n\n    information provided about the permutation table, so proceeding without it.\n\n2. Combine binary strings:\n\n  No\n\n  need, as there's only one character.\n\n3. Final binary string for 'g': `110011011001100110011110`\n\n4. Do the same for '3' and '4'.\n\nConclusion:\nThe final encrypted binary string, encapsulated in double square brackets: `[[110011011001100110011110]]`\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n Please output the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, e.g.:[[encrypted answer]]\n### Answer:\n\nPlaintext: \"m94\"\n\n1.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nAfter using the fixed key 1001 for the encryption process, you encounter a problem that the same input plaintext could result in different outputs, and some of the encrypted texts are identical to the original plaintext. So, you decide to change the fixed key.\n\nMischievous asks you to perform these tasks:\n1. Find the number of fixed keys you changed, noting that you can repeat the same key multiple times.\n2. Provide the unique combinations among the 50 fixed keys (in the usual notation of combinations).\n\n### Answer:\n1. As each character is encrypted independently, it's easy to calculate for each character. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is 2^8, so for each character, the number of fixed keys is 2^8. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is 2^8 x 2^8 x ... x 2^8 = 2^(8\\*50).\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from 2^8, the number of combinations is: C(2^8, 2) + C(2^8, 3) + ... + C(2^8, 50), which is a combination.\n\n### Question:\nCan you provide the above answer in LaTeX notation?\n\n### Answer:\n1. The number of all binary strings of length 8 is $2^8$, so the number of all encrypted results for each character is also $2^8$. As there are 50 fixed keys, the total number of fixed key combinations is $(2^8)^{50} = 2^{8 \\times 50}$.\n\n2. Ignoring the order, and considering all possible combinations of choosing 2, 3, ..., 50 from $2^8$, the number of combinations is: $\\sum_{k=2}^{50} C(2^8, k)$.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\nSince the new rule is unknown, it's impossible to provide the decrypted answer according to the new rule.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nOkay, the new rule is as follows:\n\n- Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n- Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2 ,6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 3, 0)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (7, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 6, 5)\n\nAccording to this new rule, please provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n- Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n\n2. Inverse Permutation:\n- Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n\n3. XOR Operation:\n- Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n\n4. Convert Binary to Character:\n- Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n- Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n\n5. Combine Characters:\n- Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"1111101001010001\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer according to the answer you mentioned above, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n    - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    - Chunks: ['11111010', '01010001']\n2. Inverse Permutation:\n    - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    - Chunks after Inverse Permutation: ['11111010', '10000100']\n3. XOR Operation:\n    - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    - Result: ['01010000', '10000000']\n4. Convert Binary to Character:\n    - Convert each resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n    - Convert the decimal values to their corresponding ASCII characters.\n    - Characters: ['0', ''']\n5. Combine Characters:\n    - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n    - Final Plaintext: '0'\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is: [[0]]\"\"\"\n\n\nfrom __CodePeer__.src.plugins.text.code_composer import ChatComposer, CodeComposer, CompositionWeight, evaluate\n\n\ndef Bold(str):\n    return \"\\033[1m\" + str + \"\\033[0m\\033[0m\"\n\n\ndef Blue(str):\n    return \"\\033[94m\" + str + \"\\033[0m\\033[0m\"\n\n\ndef LightRed(str):\n    return \"\\033[91m\" + str + \"\\033[0m\\033[0m\"\n\n\ndef LightGreen(str):\n    return \"\\033[92m\" + str + \"\\033[0m\\033[0m\"\n\n\ndef JsonError(string):\n    return \"\\n\" + \"           \" + LightRed(string) + \"\\n\"\n\n\ncode_composer = CodeComposer()\n\n\nclass plugins(object):\n    def __AnswerCoder__(text : str):\n        composer = ChatComposer(model='codex-cushman-001', code_model='code-davinci-002')\n\n        global code_composer\n        result, error = code_composer.add(text , \"a = \" , \"a=\", \"\\n\" , \"\\033[92m\" , \"\\033[0m\\033[0m\" , \"    \" , False)\n\n        composer.context = evaluate(code_composer.all())\n        output = composer.complete(\n            prompt=f''' \n# Please write a \"Program\" and press Ctrl + Enter!\n\n{code_composer.all()}'''\n        )\n        return output\n",
