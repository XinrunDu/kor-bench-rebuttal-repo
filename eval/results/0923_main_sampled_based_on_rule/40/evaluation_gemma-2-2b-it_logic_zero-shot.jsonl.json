This is a classic case where the truth value of the whole formula depends on the truth value of each of the internal \"implies\" of the formula. Because the formula contains implicit disjunction, it will not evaluate to a single truth or falsity, but a truth table will have to be run.  The formula is more like a complex statement.\n   \n\n* **(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2**\n   This formula is actually equivalent to the following:\n   *  (~(p1=::>~p1)) || (~p1) \n   This statement is merely a reinterpretation of the original type of proposition, and therefore should be appropriately categorized. It does not directly relate to the question's configuration because one of the statements is redundant, and does not contain any noticeable logic or incomplete or incorrect self-contradiction. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to break down any specific aspect further or have other logic problems for you to solve. \n",
