This type of cipher often teaches us about the importance of the order in which the information is encoded and decoded which is carried out on each position of a carrier.\n\n2. The order of the plaintext and the order of the ciphertext are both linear positions. However, the decryption rule of this cipher requires the specific order of rearrangement. When the two things are analyzed on the basis of their own logic, the order of ciphertext will not change. Therefore, after decryption, the order of the ciphertext remains unchanged.\n\n3. This type of cipher that can be seen in the square matrix and polyhedral structure is rather rare. This mainly depends on its type. The cipher of this paper still maintains the rule symmetry when encipher and deciphered.\n\n4. I think that there are 3 ways to decipher this cipher. One way is that if all the characters are located on the same row, then you can look up according to the number；Another way is if the character is on a row and a column, then it is easy to change the position matrix；The other way is you can pick out it from the matrix of polyhedral structure according to it’s positions, and change it back to the original string.\n\n5. In this cipher there are 6 lowercase letters, 10 middle letters, and 1 uppercase letter. So the total number of elements is 17. This is an upper triangular matrix. Each position in the matrix is counted independently.\n\n6. We can see all this information in the paper of matrix. When encrypting, it uses the plaintext information and the Polybius square information to carry out encode. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain the order of layout and row, column. This is a process of encode. When decrypting, it uses the data in the ciphertext and uses the Polybius square string to perform decode. At the same time, it also maintains the row and column order in the decryption process.\n",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[BIBF]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor the cipher rule, we have to match the conditions mentioned in the rule. For simplicity, we can take all the fours as Gird 1, Gird 2, Gird 3, and Gird 4.\n\n# Encryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up plaintext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, removing the letter Q, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - 'X': If the plaintext is of odd length, automatically add a letter 'X' to make it of even length.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - The string length = 2 * plaintext.length\n      - Split the cleaned plaintext into double letter groups, and the size of double letter groups can be 1,2 or 3.\n      - Use (i,j) as the key value, find the ciphertext first, and then generate the encrypted ciphertext.\n```\n\n# Decryption Step:\n```c\n    - Cleans up ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase.\n      - Find the bit positions of each character:\n        - bit[i][j]\n            - 0: the bit position of 'a' ~ 'z',\n            - 1: the bit position of 'A' ~ 'Z'.\n      - For the double letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext, determine which Girona it belongs to by meeting:\n        - If it is Gird2, find the bit position of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them.\n        - If it is Gird3, find the bit positions of c1 and c2 in the bit field through the key value, and find the ciphertext by them (do not count the bit value p and s).\n      - If it is Gird1 and Gird4, determine which double letter groups need to be decrypted by checking the value p and s.\n      - Ciphertext is the ciphertext in the decrypted double letter groups.\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nConsidering the plain text contains characters and characters without spaces and spaces, we first take the plain text as an input and clear the character information that does not meet the conditions. If the length of the plaintext is odd, we can automatically add a character 'X'. Then split the string into double letter groups in the input checking mode. Among them, when the original plaintext length is odd, the output language will automatically add a 'X' character to the original plaintext.\n\n## Final paragraph:\n\nDuring the encryption process, in Gird1 and Gird4, we use the value of the first and second character's parameters in the bit value to understand the position of the first and second letters in the string, rather than using index notation to understand the coordinates. After determining the position of the two characters, we use Gird2 and Gird3 to replace the letters that we get through our keyword into the cipher.\n\nDuring the decryption process, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the value of the bit position parameter of the two characters in the bit field to replace the two letters at the original position in the string, and use Gird1 and Gird4 to replace the letters that we get replacing the bit values to obtain character Strings. In the process of the decryption of the ciphertext, in Gird2 and Gird3, we use the first letter of the double letter combination, and we do not calculate the second letter. In Gird1 and Gird4, we find the bit value of the two characters in the bit field according to the first and second characters.\n\n",

Don't repeat encryption and decryption, otherwise it will be considered as cheating.\n- When answering the encryption and decryption, the ciphertext and plaintext must be checked before submission, if the ciphertext and plaintext don't match, it will be considered as a typo mistake (error handling is provided by Coursera, if you make a typing mistake, it will still be evaluated as correct).\n- If you use spaces and special characters outside of the ciphertext and plaintext, the correctness of your answer will be determined by checking whether your ciphertext and plaintext satisfy the encoding and decoding rules.\n- Only answers that match the correct solution will be marked as correct.\n- For your safety, please do not use illegal characters (such as html tags, Japanese characters, special symbols, etc.)\n- Please answer the prompt question about encryption and decryption, including \"CipherRule,\" \"plaintext,\" and \"ciphertext\". Don't just put your answer on the first line!",

This is the problem that I have seen from a lot times that the Ai will give wrong answer even if it gets the word, for example, from here the Ai`s got as answer `A`, but from that we can easily say that the `Ai`s`` gotten wrong answer is: `Iha` or `Hia`, so why the Ai got` A` answer?",
