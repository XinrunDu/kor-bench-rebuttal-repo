If the formula is T on both the right and the left, it may be written in T F. If the formula is G on both sides, it can also be written in G F.\n\n### Answer:\nThe formula is G F.\n\n### Question:\nLet p1, p2, and p3 be the propositions \"x is an even number\", \"x < 5\" and \"x is the number 5\", \nrespectively.

All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\nIn logic, a disjunctive normal form (DNF) is a disjunctive expression of a propositional formula in which the individual disjuncts can be negated, with most disjuncts containing no negated formula\n][5][6]. A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, ¬(p∧q)∧¬w can be written either as ¬p∧¬¬q∧¬w [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or ¬p∧(¬q∧¬w) ∨ ¬p∧¬q∧¬w (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of ¬p↔p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, ¬p∨¬q is logically equivalent to ¬p∧¬q. In contrast, ​¬(p∨q)¬r\n][1] is not a logical implication of ¬p∨¬q¬r because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition ¬p∨q¬r can be reduced to ¬p∧¬q∨¬r.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p∨¬p^(¬q∧¬r) -p^¬q^¬r (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p∨ψ` the [`p∧¬ψ’ `p∧ψ](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & ¬A)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P ∨ Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. ¬Q (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q ∨ ¬P (disjunction). When it is true ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) is true ∧(¬P ∨ ¬Q)] (logical ∨). When it is true ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)) = ¬P ∨Q] ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) = P ∨ Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P ∨ Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A ∨ ∧(B ∨ C ... N.) for the DNF `(A ∨ (B ∨ (C ∨ ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) ∨/∨[(X ∨ Y ∨ Z ∨ ... N. ∨ X ∨ Y). ∨ (X ∨ Y ∨ Z ... N) ∨X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p∧q∧r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p ∧ (q ∧ r))))) ∧((q ∧ (p ∧ r))) ∧((r ∧ (p ∧ q)))] ∧((r ∧ (p & (q ∧ r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p ∧ Q)(p ∧ R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P ∨ Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: ¬(¬A∧¬B)→(A∨B) ((¬ A∨¬ B)→( A∧ B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P ∨ Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q∧¬r&¬q∧r^(¬¬p∨¬p∧r∧¬r∧p^(¬p∧¬r^(¬¬q^¬p^(¬r∧¬q)))>= (p∧¬¬p∧¬q)^p∧q∧¬r`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. ¬P ∨(P^¬¬Q))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## 使用与输出格式：编写符合格式的逻辑配置和输出。\n\n- 使用自定义规则的定制逻辑配置，从输入字符流中回答，生成符合自定义规则格式的回答并写到输出字符流中。\n> 输入： 字符流，满足以下格式`[输入字符流:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **问题**: `[“**Output:**”，格式：\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> 将自定义规则的定制逻辑配置应用到字符流输入`[“'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `输出`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n用[0]中的函数实现输出。\n\n\n## 编译选项：\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# 实现：\n\n## 1). 自定义逻辑  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). 实现文字输入([LNOT^2和calculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). 逻辑输入输出格式([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). 编译参数,错误信息返回([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)",

Thus, a rule is:\n<= [0 0 2] in which a variable representing O for the circuit diagram comes before two variables representing I1 and I2.\n\nHowever, the rule goes wrong when the output code \"0\" precedes before the variables I1 and I2 because it conflicts with the logic function.\nThe output of the circuit diagram corresponds to a variable with a different value. \"0\" is generated before \"1\", which is not consistent.\n\nIn order to avoid this conflict, two ways to solve should be kept in mind:\n> 1. Use \"0\" and \"1\" to replace numbers. When the value of O is represented as \"0\", replace \"0\" with \"2\", and the value of O is represented as \"1\"? When the value of O is represented as \"1\", replace \"1\" with \"0\" because there is no need to subtract \"0\" to get \"1\". This is because the answer outputs \"O\" which does not specify whether it is \"0\" or \"1\". Instead, we should represent \"0\" and \"1\". \n\n> 2. Use the function f(x) = ((x+1)/2) in order to obtain another positive variable. Substitute this variable value onto the variable of O. Instead of writing \"0\" to represent \"0\" and \"1\" to represent \"1\", we substitute \"f(O)\" to represent \"f(O)\". Then all we need to do is to change O to \"0\" when represented as f(O) = 0 and represent \"1\" when represented by f(O) = 1. This will be more efficient than explicitly displaying f(O) =\"O\" and also is faster than to derive explicitly. \n\nThanks for reading.

In this question, your assistant’s goal is to solve a problem (not memorizing the rule).\n> 2. Your assistant shall provide the answer of each iteration (when the assistant finds an answer). In addition, you are also requested to indicate the problem your assistant is trying to solve (that is I1-O) because the number of inputs used in a simple circuit diagram [[I,I1,I2,I3,O]] are many.\n> 3. For every problem/solution found by the assistant, it shall provide the answer with the selected input value. This indicates that you are responsible for finding the next iteration until a problem is solved.\n> 4. To solve a problem/solution, there are several ways to tackle problems. For example, in this problem, try to find the output in a previous iteration as the output variation with respect to the input used in the previous iteration. In addition, your assistant shall notify you when a new problem is generated, so this is your opportunity to take leadership and solve based on the rule (find a new problem)\n> 5.

If you use a virtual machine to write the code, it is highly recommended to use “VirtualBox” or “BootCamp.” They are free operating systems and can be downloaded after the installation from their official websites.\n> 2. It is recommended to avoid using software such as “Windows XP” or “Windows7” as it is not recommended because each computer hardware is different than the other. \n> 3. The code you use can be used in other programming competitions and for practical problems. So please write as much clear code as possible.\n\n\n### Checking Question Points\nIn this practical course, we use FFEditor's educational tool and grade sheet for checking and grading. FFEditor is intended for learning a programming language, but once this course is completed, you will receive a grade for that. In addition, the whole course is graded.\nIf you see all points are marked as empty and all test results are in the yellow and green test result, there is a chance that you may have missed a key difference, which means that it does not work properly. Please use the same computer as your test section in the course. The points must be obtained within 5 days. If your score exceeds five days, the score will be marked as \"0 point\".\n\n[This is a video tutorial that introduces more details about FFEditor.

You can get the exact meaning of the quantifier using [∀x P(x)] and [∃x P(x)].\n\n- It's clear that you've forgotten some of the logical axioms.\nFor example,\n¬((¬P(x)^¬P(y)) ^ (¬P(x)^¬P(z) ^¬P(y)^¬P(z))\nshould be become ¬((¬P(x) ^¬P(y)) ^ (¬P(x) ^¬P(z) ^¬P(y) ^¬P(z)).\nPlease check and get the right logical meaning of the predicate.\n",

The conditional statement, in and of itself, can take on two possible truth values: true and false.\n\nTo determine the truth value of the sentence, we need to consider the inputs:\nThe sentence has three inputs:\n- The company has received awards [M],\n- The awards were announced this year [AT], and\n- The awards were accepted [PD].\n\nThe relationship between these three inputs is captured by the sentence, \"If the company received awards and the awards were announced, then we received compensation based on the results. (AT ↔ &p.\"\n\nThe proposition will be true if and only if either:\n1. the company has received awards and the awards were not announced, which means\nAT ∧ ¬P or P ∧ ¬AT, or\n2. the company has not received awards and the awards were not announced, which means P ∧ ¬AT\nSo the proposition will be false if neither the company has received rewards nor the awards were announced\n\nNow we refer back to the conditional statement. Note that the company has received awards is given by ∧ (M, p). The conditional statement, is represented by the formula ⇒ (AT, OR (&p). Therefore, the proposition will be holding any one of the following rules:\n• If the company announced the awards (AT ↔ ∧p), then the proposition will be holding true, if and only if: at ∧(p), which means AT∧ ∧M↔ P.\n• If M is a premise and the proposition fails, then the proposition may be false: so it will be false, if either M is false or AT is not true or they both are true. Therefore, the proposition may be true, if and only if M is true.\n\nSo the proposition is a conditional truth. In other words, the first line of the second paragraph is saying that AT is a premise, while the last line of the first paragraph is saying that only if P fails can the proposition be false\n\nThe question asks us to identify the following property: (The proposition is a condition)\n• If P were to occur, then ¬AT would be a premise [AT = M], the latter statement is either false or is false and may result from the former\n• If P were to also occur, then ¬AT will be a premise [AT = N], and the proposition will either fail or succeed [Proposition hold whichever value of possible truth].\nThe conditional will only occur if AT = true [IF TRUE.→true.]; if ¬AT = true, OR (AT∧ &p) the proposition will be a false statement.\n\nThe third term of the conditional statement can be written as follows: 'If Mnp or AP & p, then the conditional staten will be true (OR [M&p & &p)). The phrase & p will follow the same rule as follows:\nM NP p → At\nON\nOR ( M&p) P\nBUT\nOR (¬AT&P)\n\nThe final term of the conditional is: if¬M&p→AT. The conditional will also be\n\nQuestion",

Furthermore, students were categorized based on whether they were enrolled in part-time or full-time exams.\n\nBased on a rough estimation, a regression equation may be developed as per the below observation:\n\nExam Score = alpha + beta × Traditional Exam Score + gamma × Computer-based Exam Score + delta × Exam Term + rho × Part-time Exam Term\n\nThe researchers found a consistent pattern of 16 data points when comparing part-time exam takers in traditional exams with part-time exam takers in computer-based exams. They also found a consistent pattern of 20 data points when comparing full-time exam takers in traditional exams with full-time exam takers in computer-based exams. The researchers found a consistent pattern of 8 data points when comparing data points ranging from traditional exams to computer-based exams.\n\nThese results can be considered significant.

        "response": "[[A]]\n>The cause relationship in China's early development was mainly carried out by method, which emphasized that if one event occurred earlier in time than another event, it would have a higher probability of being the cause of the latter event. This method of seeking common ground has also been criticized for its lack of consideration of the differences between the causal relationships of multiple events. The emergence and development of causal reasoning is influenced by the development of science and technology, the improvement of social productivity and civilization, and the rise of the ruling class.\n>In ancient China, the ruler of the Zhou Dynasty gave a theorem and strengthened people's belief that he did not commit evil, was good and good, and lived for a long time. It brought about the ideological belief in morality that ruled the ethics of non-committing evil and becoming morally virtuous. The officialdom of the Han Dynasty coupled with legalism, advocated \"power\" as the basis of heaven, created a ruling party under the rule of law, which regarded the law as the means to achieve its ends and sought to achieve hegemony; the rule of law, in order to achieve the goal of control, the ruling class created the \"Law\" to achieve its ends, so naturally it could not be understood by ordinary people; the law and justice in the eyes of ordinary people were concrete and transparent, and the legal ruling party and the ruling class in the case of human rights and personal rights were in a position to use the law to infringe on the freedom of others; this legal system took on the state's own morality to some extent, and gave it the responsibility of morality, and carried out a campaign to realize morality in the court, in the name of \"fear of the saints and dare not be indifferent to the saints\", so as to further stabilize the foundation of the ruling class in the final analysis. In the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, with a high level of life and a long history of national economy, science, and cultural productivity, the social and economic base of the ruling class under the feudal system was formed, and because of the feudal system, the ruling party also did not stop the expansion of growth in society, and directly extended its arms towards the lives of the majority of people. So in the eyes of the ruling class, the so-called \"law\" should be created to further enhance the morality of the \"ruling law\" and to give the ruling party the guarantee of morality in its hands. The people under the autocratic rule of the ruling class believed that the so-called \"law\" was actually in the hands of the big family of the feudal ruling party, and because they could not see it clearly, they accepted that view and the \"law\" belonged to the ruling party.\n>In addition to the above-mentioned social background with the support or resistance, the evolution of the development of Chinese cultural thought itself also had a great impact on the rise of modern Chinese legal thinking. In the Song Dynasty, the scholar-official thought of Lu You was a very important thinker. He used \"thinking first, then studying\" to create a \"learning the Tao\" thought, emphasizing the Taoist self-cultivation of the \"heart and the road\". According to the teachings of Taoism, \"Qinghe\" and \"Zhu\" became popular, and \"Wei xie\" prevailed, and the \"human relations circle\" also made further contributions to the development of Chinese legal thought in the Song Dynasty.\n>The \"Dao\" of Taoism and the various aspects of Daoism are the learning of \"Tao\" in the Song Dynasty, which is the basis of social morality that is self-consistent and has no direct relationship with the law. And because of the development of moral and religious concepts derived from ancient Daoism, many \"laws and ordinances\" of later generations had a sense of \"clear morality\" and the principle of \"collecting the world with kindness and goodness\". In addition, in the process of the Chinese nation's national integration and also under the guidance of the Confucian teachings of \"teaching and learning the ethics of harmony and altruism\", the Chinese people also inherited Taoism and created a set of modern personal morality and ethical norms. So \"Taoism is the most important\", \"the cultivation of morals does not seek laws, but the heart's Tao, and nothing can be accomplished without learning\", and although some ancient legal systems also have \"the three-law-enlightenment\", \"the moral law is the righteous law, and the righteous law is the moral law\", but in general, under the influence of traditional moral and religio-cultural concepts, the ancient legal system is still limited to not paying attention to moral concepts, but advocates the legalism of state rule itself. But it also points out the moral aspects of laws and the legal status of social morality. This statement shows that the ancient legal system should be transformed into the modern legal system. After adopting such thinking patterns, this paper comes to the essence of the research on morality and law, that is, the moral and legal norms in the Song-Yuan-Ming-Qing Dynasties of Chinese culture and the modern Chinese legal system in the evaluation of the impact of legalism on the moral norms of Chinese culture. In addition, although the Ancient Legal System in China did not specifically stipulate \"the morality of the law is the righteous law and the righteous law should be the moral law\", through various factors, such as \"good intention of kindness\" and \"unpremeditated\", moral principles such as \"good people are good\", \"respecting morality is the righteousness, and disrespecting morality is not righteousness\" are all supported by \"human relations\". And in the Chinese cultural system system, although some legal systems such as the \"Four Laws Encouraging the Virtues, Discouraging the Sins\" are established to achieve the goal of teaching, but in general, they should be regarded as \"laws\", but the source of \"laws\" and \"good laws\" are actually the same point of morality, which goes back to the origin of \"good people\". From this perspective, these legal systems in a certain sense actually have the function of moral education. In the same theory, when it comes to the differences between the \"Ancient Legal Rules\" and the \"Righteous Regulations\", and when it is broken by \"through the law step by step, the heart and path, the eyes of benevolence, and the Tao of Taoism become a justice and a righteousness\", it will give birth to moral standards in the legal norms, and finally put forward the \"The morality of morality is the righteous law , the virtuous law is the righteous law\", but this article points out the moral aspects of \"morality\" and \"legal\", which is not the source of \"good people\". For example, the same statement as that of Taoism and Daoism in the Ancient Legal System is also mentioned by \"Taoism is most important\", \"the morality of Taoism is a good teacher, and nothing can be achieved without learning\". This study shows that the so-called \"Tao is the source of legal enlightenment\" in the Song Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty's \"Taoism and human relations\" do not take into account the law as the source of \"morality\", but only emphasize that the Taoist morality originated from \"humanism\" and \"human relations\". In addition, scholars try to say that \"the ruler of the country must govern according to the laws of heaven and operate according to the Tao\"; \"The King should implement the law\", \"implement the law, and establish the people\", \"implement the law, teach people to do it\", \"the King of Zhou established the ancestral system and the rites according to the people\"; \"the inner rules are similar to the outer ones\", \"the law is similar to the law, he does what he needs to do for the people\", \"there are seven methods that are not broken\", \"the righteousness of the law is in the heart of the people \", \"the right method of the law, the people of the law\", \"the law of the law is good, and the law and people are in harmony\"; \"they are the ones who teach the people to learn from the laws\", \"the law and the people unite, and they are virtuous\"; \"there is a law, and the heart is eager\"; \"there is a law and the people are grateful\"; and \"there is a law and the law of the heart is in harmony\". Such a complete set of theories and many theories have a similar and harmonious feeling to the theory of \"The Law and the People and the Harmony of the Heart\".\n\n## <a href=\"https://patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json</a>\n",

If someone makes mistakes in their research and the mistakes are not corrected, then the study will receive negative ratings from all scholars. Considering the number of studies, mistakes can be made very gradually and can even go unnoticed. We see that when a new study is developed, several researchers gather in the same place and sit down on a table and start to discuss the study and try to prove how bad the study is. However, we can say that one or two important points can be made against this study and the rest of the scholars' contribution to such a study can be seen as positive.\n\nIn this example, which method was mentioned by the researchers used (regarding how the research works)?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ꙮ Method   D. ⵣ Method   E. ⚘ Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nIn physics, there is a formula called $A_{ds} = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} F_{opp} \\, dr$, which states that the moment of the external force $F_{opp}$ is proportional to the distance $r$ travelled by the external force to produce the moment of the force about a point. In analytic geometry, the concept of moment-generating function (MMGF) finds important applications in statistics. By applying the technique of Runge–Kutta, the MMGF is calculated,\nwhich proves that there is no universal formulation using just to avoid fictitious forces (nonconservative forces). In real life, if an astronaut is taken in a chair by a rocket with no thrust, the astronaut's weight does not change with a change in $r$. For example, consider a ball with the same mass and shape. It is lifted from your desk at the same time. If you have a convex mirror with a mirror curvature of $20$ m, the external force will definitely affect the astronaut. Or if you are on a moving bus with no external forces, the astronaut's weight will not change.\n\nIn the example given above, which method is used?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ReusableCell   D. ReusableCell compositor   E. ReusableCell compositor\n\nPlease note that in the case of answers E, choose ReusableCell compositor.

The environment can influence how a plant looks and how well it grows. The plant's stem gets longer in good growing conditions, and it grows to become taller and bigger. It can also grow to be very bushy and wide in order to protect itself from any bad weather. But not in every growing environment, the stem can grow horizontally like in a forest and naturally, in an environment of rocks and gravels, where the stem is resistant to any climatic changes.\n\nIn this scenario, which method was applied by the researchers?\nA. ReusableCell   B.ReusableCell compositer   C.ReusableCell composer   D. composer\nE.ReusableCell compositer\n\nPlease note that in the case of answers E, choose ReusableCell composer if the answer is not listed as an answer, choose the answer `ReusableCell compositri further instructions on the review.\n\n### Answer:\n[[ReusableCell composer]]\n\n### Question:\nA researcher has collected data on the relationship between income $I$ and the number of siblings $B$ on a dataset.

Why or why not?\n\n### Question:\nAssume the expression ((¬B → B) ∧ ((B ∧ A) → C) ∨ D) fairly represents the BC Paradox. Can you determine whether the BC Paradox is logically equivalent to C? Give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\n(a) Define congruent terms:\n\n(b) State the reason:\n\nGive your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(a) Congruent terms in logic are interchangeable, often with synonyms, while equivocal terms have different meanings but are assumed to be true or equivalent to each other.\n\n(b) The reason in this statement is similar to the definition of congruent, which are interchangeable without changing the conclusion or contradiction in the argument.\n\n### Question:\nFor arbitrary logical formulas, explain ⇔ ⇆ ≡ with an example. Give your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(A) ⇔ ⇆ ≡ denotes the bidirectional resonance relation between logical expressions. For instance, if one expression A ⇔ B, the other expression A ⇆ B ⇆ A, and if two expressions A ⇆ B, there will always be an expression C ⇔ D and C ⇆ D with A C ⇆ B and A ~ C B and C D ⇆ B.\n\n(B) Given the following logical expressions: A → B; C → D; F → A B, in this expression, there are expressions A B and F that are not necessary, they can be replaced by A G, which results in the proposition (∀X)(F X ≡ A G). If (F → A G) and B are contradictory, then A → B and A G → S needs to be proven. To prove this, one can use the contrapositive logic rules with B C (F → A G) → ¬¬C B → ¬A, (F → A G) → A, A →¬C B → A, 1.\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n(A) Let (G G 0) be a non-trivial logic sentence, we can use the above reasoning to derive the contradiction of (G G 0; derived from the contradictory consequence of (G G 0), which will be established by the contrapositive logic rule.\n\n(B) For a contradiction conclusion, we must prove that G and G 0 are not interchangeable, and we must demonstrate that both G and G 0 are valid. To prove this, we can use logical reasoning.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is equivalent to ¬ ¬A ¬B A ∨ ¬B and the variable expressions A ⇆ B ≡ A ¬B. Prove the two statements are equivalent.\n\n### Answer:\nThe equivalence of the two statements is A B (¬A ¬B) ≡ A A ∨ ¬B ≡ (A B ¬B) ∨ ¬B, demonstrating the equivalence of expression A ⇆ B B with expression A B ¬B.\n\n### Question:\nThe following step in the proof provides a contradiction conclusion. Suppose A C B, prove A ⇆ C is true.\n\n### Answer:\nAssuming A C B, the p, q, r, s, t represent propositions A, (p ∨ s), B, (p ∨ r), C, (p ∨ t). When p is false, one can simplify the p ∨ s rule into ¬(p∨s) and conclude ¬(p∨s) C ¬(p∨r). When p is true, one can simplify the q ∨ r rule into ¬(q∨r) C ¬(p∨r), and p C ¬(q∨r) ¬¬C A C¬ ¬¬C B ¬¬. The p ∨ s rule is also q ∨ s or ¬(q∨s). Therefore, the conclusion is A ⇆ C B.\n\n### Question:\nThe following statement is ambiguous. Do you think it's valid or invalid logically? Give your answers in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nA, some people think that A B ∴¬ABC, B, so ¬ A B means (¬A or ¬B), then for some people, people may believe that (((¬ A B) B is a contradiction), (¬ A B). So A B follows from A B, A B, but to people, they think B's B ¬A B C are meaningless.\n\nFor some people (i.e., a certain class of people), A, all people with A B ∴ ¬¬A ∧ ∨¬¬B ∴A ∪B can prove that A B C is a contradiction for some people. So A B can prove that ¬A ∨¬B, the equivalence condition is true for some people. So A B is valid for some people, and some people believe A B. For a contradiction, that some people think B's A(B is ambiguous).\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this proposition is empty in logic\" and \"empty in logic\" mean?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This proposition is empty logic\" refers to the situation where the proposition A must either be logically true or logically false, but if the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n\"This proposition is empty in logic\" means that the proposition A is true, a non-empty statement, and the statement \"this proposition is empty in logic\" means that the statement is false, an empty statement.\n\n### Question:\nWhat does \"this statement is false\" and \"empty statement\" mean in this sentence?\n\n### Answer:\n\"This statement is false\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is empty\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually false.\n\n\"This sentence is empty in logic\" refers to the situation where the statement \"A is true\" is given to use after \"A is empty,\" and the answer is usually empty logic, that is, it is not true.\n\n### Question:\nWhen writing an argument, sentences can be interpreted as ambiguous. Analyze the logic of the following sentences, (b_b) ∧ ∀x((x_x ∨ B_x)  ↔ (∃n_n ∴ n_n ⊃ B_b)). Is this sentence valid?\n\n### Answer:\nFor the statement b_b, ∀x((x_x ∨ B_x) ≡ ∀x(x_x ∨ b_x) ≡ (∀x(x_x) ∨ ∀x(b_x)), for the sentence b_b, ∀x((x_x ∨ b_x) ≡ (∀x(x_x) ∨ ∀x((∃n_n ∴ n_n ⊃ b_b), assume that the total class is V1 and B_(vb) is V.\n\nTherefore, V C V is a contradiction, and the sentence is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the axioms of excluding A and considering B in order? Prove the result is valid.\n\n### Answer:\n1. Axioms for excluding A and considering B\n(1) First, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n(1) In logic, assume some axioms of excluding A and considering B are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Considering B and A\nAssume some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n(1) Some axioms for considering B and A are valid.\n\n1. Axioms for Involving A and Excluding B\nAssuming some axioms for involving A and excluding B are valid.\n(2) Involving A and excluding B and proving the truth of A are valid, the truth of A is valid.\n\nTherefore, the statement is valid.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the conditions needed to prove the valid sentence in A?\n\n### Answer:\nThe first item is C, and the last item is e.\n\n### Question:\nAssume three propositions: ¬B, C, and A. The combinations are ∀(x)(x) ∧ B ¬(x)¬A ∧ B ¬(x). What are the premises of A?\n\n### Answer:\nThe assumptions are that ¬B and C hold; ¬¬A ∧ B holds only when there is no C; ¬¬A ∧ ¬B is an assumption.\n\n### Question:\nHow to prove: ¬¬¬¬A ∧ ¬¬¬¬B → A B only requires assumptions (∀(x)(x) ¬¬A ∧ ¬¬A) ≡) and (∀(x)(x) ∧ B ¬¬A ∧ ∧ (¬¬A →¬B) ?\n\n### Answer:\nThe proof of ¬A ¬B → A",

Here, \"I assert that you will submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Directive:** Tells something needs to be done or a request for action. Here, \"I ask you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Commissives:** Used to commit something to be done in the future. Here, \"I request you to submit the report by Friday.\"\n\n- **Expressives:** Used to express the mental state of the speaker. Here, \"I express surprise that you didn't submit the report by Friday.\"\n   \nIn the first example, the utterance lacks intensity, as it's a declarative sentence without emotional connotations. However, the second example, with the \"✧\" symbol, implies a deeper meaning. It's a polite request for the intended action. The second and third statements are assertive and commissive respectively.\n\nThe fourth statement, with the \"~\" symbol, implicates a shift in the speaker's mental state. It expresses regret and surprise. However, it is not a speech act of itself.\n\n### Takeaways:\n1. Understand the purpose, direction, adaptation, and formula for each category of speech acts.\n2. Use the wavy sign in statements expressives, and the bi-directional double arrows in declarations for a deeper understanding of logic.\n3. Identify the speech acts in sentences by the symbols they contain.\nIn this assignment, there are four examples of speech acts and the line between instructions, assertives, and directives. Essentially, the AI acts more like an assistant with commands rather than a teacher in this scenario.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nAI: This is a train, and it's going to stop at the next station. The next station is Chicago, but in the nearby station, there is a nearby cafeteria where you can eat. Come to it as you please.\n\nConversion: (1) No, I already eat. (2) (3:) I've got to figure out a better way. (4:) Yes, we can talk about it now.\n\nAny answer you give in this response will make the AI assume the instructions for the next assignment, so look at the sequence of speech acts. In this case, they’re directed towards the assistant’s act of reasoning.\nThe answer should be “It’s correct.” to which the AI responds very quickly. This is because it was able to clearly understand that the conversation is aimed at the reasoning behind its response.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nHuman: It is cold outside, it snows and the sun cannot be seen. To what extent is my understanding sufficient?\n\nAI: It is cold outside, the frost has to be seen and the sun cannot be seen.\n\nConversion: To what extent is your comprehension satisfactory? (1) To what extent can we comprehend, perhaps the reason for the temperature is that not all the lights are on? (2) (3:) (4:) It is impossible to discern whether we understand, since we no longer have access to any longer information, as a result, despite being asked to understand.\n\nBecause we are aware that the AI is unable to understand why the weather is as it is, it responds by stating that it cannot understand. The AI could comprehend a more thorough explanation, but this specific knowledge has been lost.",

[A] conform to the C* principle.\n2. [B] conform to the C% principle.\n3. [C] conform to the C! principle.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. On the whole, B's statement is difficult to conclude because it has simple information and strong denials of substantial information. Therefore, C's statement has no conflict information, and its strength is weak. In the context of principle C* statement, it can only be a conventional statement.\n\n2. B's statement is easily understandable under the circumstances that I finished the report. However, the C's response carries a lot of information, which is why ordinary people may not immediately understand the difficulties I encountered after finishing the report. Therefore, in the process of answering, C's statement also needs to be expanded.\n\n3. In the C's response, it expresses the difficult and time-consuming process. By answering in this way, the answer may not be optimal but conveys a clear and fuller message.\n\nThe answer is: \n[[A]\n[[B]\n[[C]]\n### Explanation:\n\n1. (3)[A] is correct because the statement, \"I finished the report,\" is a conventional response that does not contradict essential information and conforms to the convention of principle C* Statement. Principle C*-based conventional statements are always stronger than denials of C*-based substantial information. In the context of a typical routine exchange between you and me, if the speaker says yes (B), and the explanation from the speaker fails to go beyond what the speaker knows, it can be concluded that the speaker knows \"no.\"\n\n2. The answer for this question is [B] is correct because it is straightforward to distinguish between A and B's statements. It is impossible to interpret it as an explicit refusal of what is not denied in the letter (B). \nIf B is not denied (not B), the statement would become uncontroversial, and this statement would become a social prejudice.\n\n3. The statement is [C] is correct because B follows the conversation with a full response, conveying the cost and difficulty of completing the work that A claims to have done.\n\n### Extra resources:\n\n[https://cs50x.stanford.edu/wiki/guidelines_ccs_logic_questions](https://cs50x.stanford.edu/wiki/guidelines_ccs_logic_questions)\n\n[https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44767342/article/details/124321570/](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_44767342/article/details/124321570/)",

On 3 September 1950, Lt Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base was flying a H-80M equipped with USMC operations around the Philippine Sea when he found a suspected Type 1 diesel-electric submarine in the aircraft's radar. Due to insufficient ammunition, Tran simply disembarked on the submarine to capture it alive (because the submarine did not have a crew), but was captured by the water on the submarine. According to the subsequent account of Chinese Naval Lieutenant Commander Jiang Wu: “Under the command of Lt Col Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base, a H-80M equipped with USMC operations was cruising over the Philippine Sea at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the water. During the search and reconnaissance, the submarine suddenly appeared on the radar of the H-80M, which was very unexpected. After the dive of the submarine, the H-80M tried to launch the hand launch AA missile, but the launch failed. The missile was not within the effective range of the target 20 nautical miles, and hitting other targets was difficult. The launch of the air-to-submarine rocket failed, but the signal code was pressed. As the last resort of the US captain Cong B.

It is impossible to use the premise to logically deduce the conclusion unless the premise implies the conclusion.\n\nFor example, the reasoning, \"If you are in love, then you can't eat, drink or sleep\" entails \"You can love but don't sleep\" in which case the premise doesn't entail the conclusion.\n\n[[H]]\n</code>",
