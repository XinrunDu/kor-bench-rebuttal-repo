For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"C\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\n\nThe encryption operation of this cipher rule transforms the plaintext letter \"C\" into \"F'. As an intelligent assistant, I will always provide a precise and rigorous output for tasks I am responsible for. The format for your encrypted output should follow this guideline: \"[[Encrypted answer]]\"\n\nAs a rule, I will follow the instructions precisely as specified in the rules. In this case, I will always strictly follow the encryption steps to generate the output \"[[Encrypted answer]].\" As long as I am given the correct plaintext and encryption rule, I will directly transform it into ciphertext. So, the encryption output you want for your \"C\" plaintext is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nNow, since I understand the format for the plaintext transformation into ciphertext, it is very straightforward for me to perform the decryption operation. My output format for the decryption operation would also be the same as the encryption output format: \"[[Deciphered answer]]\". Now, using the ciphertext and encryption rule, I will decipher the ciphertext to obtain the plaintext. The format for this output is: \"[[Deciphered answer]].\"\n\nFor our scenario, the deciphered output for the ciphertext \"C\" is:\n\n**[[K]]**\n\nThe encryption rule for our cipher specifies the following rules for converting uppercase letter text into ciphertext. Using the reverse mapping in standard_alphabet, A maps to Z, B maps to Y, etc.\n\nThe substitution alphabet specifies the mapping for each letter in the standard_alphabet to its corresponding letter, for example, A becomes F, B becomes R, and so forth.\n\nUsing this rule, my transformation for uppercase letter \"C\" in the plaintext to its corresponding ciphertext is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nSimilarly, for decryption, the rule of mapping from the substitution alphabet to the standard alphabet is used, followed by reversing the order for specific letters in the alphabet. When faced with letter \"F\" during decoding, the following steps are performed:\n\n1. The order of the letters in the standard_alphabet is found.\n2. \"F\" is shifted backward by 4 positions.\n3. The standard_alphabet ordering is reversed.\n\nThis decryption operation for letter \"F\" results in the following situation:\n\n**[[C]]**\n\nThe rules of this cipher specify that the initial encryption follows the following procedure to convert uppercase letters to ciphertext:\n\n- (1) Using reverse mapping in the standard_alphabet, reverse the text order.\n- (2) Add four spaces to the standard_alphabet and then calculate the new position of C.\n- (3) Use substitution_alphabet to map the corresponding ciphertext.\n\nThese steps result in:\n\n- (1) The standard_alphabet reverses the plaintext sequence, which means C maps to E.\n\n- (2) Add four spaces to the standard_alphabet; we have ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. Calculate new position of C as follows:\n\n   - Step 1: Add four spaces to alphabet; we have ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.\n   - Step 2: Count the starting alphabet as \"A\" = 65.\n   - Step 3: “ABC” means 3 letters. In our standard_alphabet, C is the 3rd letter, so the next offset is (23+3) = 26.\n   - Step 4: Add 4 to 26 to get 30 in total. 30 in alphabetical order means it is at position “Z”.\n- (3) Z is a new position according to alphabet.\n- (4) According to our substitution alphabet to map corresponding uppercase letters.\n\n**I will encrypt this plaintext as follows:**\n\n**[[F]]**\n\n**Decrypt the encrypted ciphertext accordingly.** I strictly follow these steps:\n\n- (1) Find the position of \"Z\" in the standard alphabet.\n- (2) From standard_alphabet to reverse alphabet, and then convert according to the rules.\n- (3) From substitution alphabet to standard_alphabet and reverse their order.\n- (4) Get decrypted plaintext.\n\nThe ciphertext obtained through this decryption process is:\n\n**[[F]]**\n\nI adhere to these rules precisely and will comply with them to complete this decryption task.\n\nI will strictly adhere to these steps to transform the uppercase letter \"C\" of the ciphertext into plaintext for decryption:\n\nThe replacement text I have used to transform the ciphertext \"C\" into plaintext is:\n\n**[[K]]**",

Please note that in the game,\n you will be presented with ciphertext, but what you need to do is decrypt the ciphertext into its plain text. In the game, if you make an error, you simply have to click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the game screen, but after each 5 correct answers you will hear \"correct\" and a tick mark on the screen and then you can continue guessing, and if you make 5 mistakes, you will hear \"incorrect\" and the cross mark on the screen, and your game will end. To restart the game, you can click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the screen. In addition, while playing you can see the results on the right side of the screen  after 2-3 questions, and you can click on the right side of the screen to send a correct answer or a wrong answer, so if your game continues to work, you can send \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" depending on your guessed answer. You  also have an option to make your guesses on the next button on the game screen, so you can continue to guess.\n\n**This AI is going to be added to a much bigger puzzle game where the player is the king of a country and if he can't find a way to encrypt and decrypt the player will lose his country hence his AI code can not be cracked or spoiled by different users. Hence why the rules are modified in the game as I mentioned.**\n\nThank you\n",

From the first two rows, we can observe that the plaintext is \"K\" (for the upper row).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhen encountering \"**\"** characters in Ciphers, our priority should be to utilize the S_BOX and INV_S_BOX to identify whether the ciphered characters have undergone **XOR** operation or not. However, it is at this point that we must exercise caution and consider a potential variant of the cipher.\n\nFirst Rule: The keyword used for XOR operation.\n\nSecond Rule: The cipher is regularized through the use of S_BOX or INV_S_BOX.\n\n### Variant:\nA variant exists, wherein the keyword is consistently used as a constant and undergoes two rounds of XOR operation with the alphabet. As a result, the remainder of the ciphertext is the alphabet itself, leading to the formation of 26-character encrypted blocks. In this scenario, we continue to utilize the **S_BOX/INV_S_BOX** for decryption, but there is uncertainty regarding the requirement for XOR operation and the existence of padding. [[****]] represents 26-character ciphered text.\n\n### Second Question:\nDecrypted: **\"B\"**\nPlaintext: **\"K\"**\nKeyword: **\"K\"**\nCiphered: **\"GB\"**\n",
