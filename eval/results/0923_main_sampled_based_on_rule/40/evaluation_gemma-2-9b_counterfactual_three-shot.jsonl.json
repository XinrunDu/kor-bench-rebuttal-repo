To travel through to the future, there is no need to form black holes, can be slow light travel in the past but there is no distortion of time can also reduce the round trip time to 0.018 second,\n2.Create a network connection between the Earth and Trisolaris to form a unified network.\n3.The earth can use the network to divide into two regions, one side to connect the dark forest Trisolaris civilization, based on the original star of the earth, and the other side to divide the Trisolaris world, but on the earth side is to support the planet of various types represented by red, orange, yellow, blue, green, and purple, which is equivalent to a black hole, in which life is only black hole on one side of life.\n4.All human beings on the earth are divided into the above space, earth to create one side's Trisolaris and the opposite side of black hole space network connection.\n5.Each side of the space divide on the earth can be 100 kilometers across, the entire earth into each divided into 2 times, divided into two parts, form a base that can be up to 10,000 kilometers wide, each of the two base to give a name, from the north base and south base.\n6.Each part can form a unified grid, the grid can choose to form a 400 meter by 400 meter grid, the total of 1 kilometer to 4 billion square grids.\n7.The north base is divided into 20 parts, each part 280 million kilometers, in which the north base 420 million kilometers, the base to form a total of 10 billion kilometers wide.\n8.In order to facilitate the unification of the grid, the earth's orbit is closer to the star, in this way the earth's circumference is 0.89053 times the original number, about 50 billion kilometers from the center of the earth to the equator, is one of the lines on the equatorial 0.89053 times the diameter of the earth 35.4 million kilometers, the total 120 kilometers of the length of the equator has 400 to 400 kilometers.\n### Answer:\n[[*10.000*]]\n",

On the planet Cybertron, the Autobots were tasked with peacekeeping and ensuring order.\nAs the story progresses, the Autobots play a crucial role in the series and face various threats and challenges, with Optimus Prime remaining their leader.

It serves as the lifeblood or fuel that powers Transformers and is essential for their existence and operations. Energon is usually depicted as a shimmering, pulsating energy substance that flows through the veins and arteries of Transformers, providing power and sustenance.\nThe function of Energon varies depending on the Transformers' role. For example, the Ark, a large spacecraft, requires a significant amount of Energon to operate and protect itself. Leaders like Optimus Prime use Energon to restore the health and combat capabilities of their groups. However, using large amounts of Energon can make them tired and vulnerable, limiting the length of battle.\nEnergon can be extracted from the wreckage of damaged Transformers or from planets where it naturally exists. When used within the proper limits, it helps protect Transformers from threats, maintaining health and combat readiness.\nEnergon can be used in offensive maneuvers, such as damaging opponents or creating explosions. Consumption of Energon can lead to a sense of fatigue among Transformers, making them more cautious and less aggressive. Additionally, it can heal them and give them superhuman abilities.\n\n### Question:\nHow can Energon be obtained?\nOptions: A. Through scientific research##B. By farming specialized plants##C.
