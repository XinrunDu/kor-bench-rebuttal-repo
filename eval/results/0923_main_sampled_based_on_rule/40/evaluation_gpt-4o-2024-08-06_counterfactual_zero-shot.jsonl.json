This supports option B.\n\n- Option A and C refer to other AI technologies not mentioned in the story. Specifically, AlphaGo is actually developed by DeepMind, not IBM, so C is incorrect based on commonly known facts outside the story.\n\n- Option D states that MOSS destroyed the lunar engine with the goal of annihilating Earth's civilization, which does not align with the story. MOSS's actions were to increase the chances of humanity's survival, not annihilation.\n\nThus, the correct statement based on the information from the story is:\n\n[[B]]",
