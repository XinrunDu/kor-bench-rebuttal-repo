Therefore, the whole formula ✓=::>✓ is true.\n  - If p1 is false (x), p1||p2||p3 can still be true if either p2 or p3 is true. In this case, the implication x=::>✓ is true.\n  - If p1 is false (x) and p1||p2||p3 is also false (x), then x=::>x is true.\n\nTherefore, p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is true under all assignments, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n**(2) Formula: (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2**\n\n- Simplify (p1=::>~p1):\n  - p1=::>~p1 is false only when p1 is true (✓) and ~p1 is false (x). This scenario is not possible because if p1 is true, then ~p1 is false by definition, and this makes ✓=::>x false.\n\n- Consider the outer implication:\n  - The only false assignment of an implication is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true. \n  - From the above simplification, (p1=::>~p1) is a truth value corresponding to a false formula (contained within a truth formula structure).\n\nEvaluate assignments:\n  - Essentially, (p1=::>~p1) gives true only in one form, making all subsequent evaluations match the if-then input (i.e., never false in conjunction with ~p2 being false).\n\nGiven multiple tests of the structure will change depending on outcomes, this is, therefore, neither always true nor always false.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFormula (1) is a Truth Formula.\nFormula (2) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\nThus, the answer is \\[[A];[C]\\].",
