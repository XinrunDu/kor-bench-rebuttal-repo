There is no specific context in the story that contradicts this general understanding.\n\n2. **Stimulants** (Option B): Stimulants often lead to short-term enhancement of resistance or capabilities but usually come at the cost of adverse side effects or long-term harm to the body.\n\n3. **Gravity body** (Option C): The gravity body is described as an exoskeleton mecha that enhances combat capability. It is associated with combat rather than general health, and it's not clear if it would enhance body resistance per se. Additionally, using such advanced technology may not be sustainable for overall health.\n\n4. **Becoming a devouring beast** (Option D): Transforming into a beast, as described, seems to be detrimental to one's humanity and potentially harmful.
