Instead, it involves confirming a hypothesis with different observations (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n\n2. **BC Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n   - The scenario involves a universal hypothesis (∀x(S(x) → W(x))) and its confirmation through different conditions (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n   - The confirmation standards are being applied in a way that leads to paradoxical results, as observing a white object that is not a swan should not confirm the hypothesis about swans being white.\n\n3. **LS Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n   - The scenario does not involve multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses leading to a contradiction.
