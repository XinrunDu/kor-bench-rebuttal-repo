The formula then becomes \"if p1, then not p2 and p2\". \n   - This is a contradiction because the \"if p1\" part of the conjunction implies a condition that could not be met simultaneously with the \"p2\" being true.

The correct simplification would also be based on the equivalence of the two premises: \"p1 and p3 imply not p1 and not p2\". \n   - The \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\" can be interpreted as \"If p1 and p3 are true, then p1 and p2 must be false\". Since the \"if p1 and p3\" part of the conjunction cannot be true unless \"p1\" and \"p3\" are both true, the conclusion is incorrect. The formula does not hold under any assignment of truth values, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, both formulas are Falsehood Formulas, and the answer is [[A];[A]].\n\n*Note: The prioritization of logical connectives does not apply in this case, as the issue lies in the incorrect formation and interpretation of the formulas rather than the operation's priority.*",

By applying the distributive property and simplifying, we can obtain the following disjunction of conjunctions:\n\n(¬p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∨ ¬r) ∨ (¬q ∨ ¬r)\n\nNow, according to the given logic rule, we identify the paired conjunctive terms (all with subscripts in descending order representing their binary, which then corresponds to hexadecimal i) for each conjunction.\n\n1. For the first conjunction (¬p ∧ ¬q), the binary number is 10, which corresponds to hexadecimal number 2. The paired conjunctive term is (¬p^¬q) and it is denoted as m2.\n\n2. For the second conjunction (¬p ∨ ¬r), the binary number is 11, which corresponds to hexadecimal number 3. The paired conjunctive term is (¬p^¬r) and it is denoted as M3.\n\n3.

The specific number of iterations required to reach this conclusion depends on the complexity of the original CNF and the resolution steps applied. However, given the complexity of the initial CNF, it's likely that the algorithm would iterate through the steps outlined (initializing, certain steps of resolution, checking S2, and final output) once or twice at most to conclude that there's a plausibly satisfying assignment. The exact number in iterations can be more context-dependent on the specific clauses involved and how the resolution rules are applied.\n\nFinal output:\n- \"Plausible\"\n- The number of cycles needed to confirm a satisfiable assignment would be once or twice, assuming the initial transformations and operations are followed correctly through the resolution steps. \n\nPlease note, for more complex or specific inputs, the algorithm's expected iterations could vary.

We can play around with combinations to satisfy these conditions:\n\n- **For p = True and q = True and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is True because all conditions are met.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - So, the overall expression evaluates to True, but since we want \"O\" to be negative, this combination doesn't work directly.\n\n- **For p = True, q = True, and r = True:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because r is True.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because both p and ¬p are True (but ¬r must be False).\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - All three components are false, meaning the entire expression evaluates to False, which aligns with our requirement for an output of \"O\" that is \"-\" when the expression isn't True.\n\nTherefore, the set of inputs that satisfy the given condition and produce a negative output of \"O\" (\"-\") for the logical expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ r) are:\n\n- p = True, q = True, r = True\n\nThis combination satisfies the logical requirements without directly satisfying the expression but produces the desired negative output for the given logical expression. Other combinations could also be valid depending on the context, but the primary focus here was to address the problem as provided.\n\nFor completeness, here are additional combinations:\n\n- **For p = True, q = False, and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because q is False and ¬r is False.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True and q is False.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because p is True and r is False.\n  - The overall expression evaluates to False, satisfying the requirement for an \"O\" of \"-\" when the expression is not True.\n\nThese are some of the possible combinations that meet the specified conditions.

Here is why:\n\n- In Figure IV, the premises are generally affirmative, similar to the conditions set by ∀P⇒M and ∀M⇒¬S.\n- The conclusion, ∀S⇒¬P, aligns with the universal scope seen in premises indicating that for every proposition P, not P is valid.\n\nHowever, the direct mood that corresponds closely to the argument's structure and implications is likely IAI (since the premises lead to a conclusion that at least one case where S is true leads to not P, fitting I: ∃p1⇒p2 and O: ∃p1⇒¬p2, though not as directly as other figures).\n\nThus, the argument falls somewhere between Figure IV and a mood that best fits IAI:\n- Figure IV due to its structure leading towards a universal conclusion;\n- Mood IAI due to its specific implications regarding at least one case where S being true leads to not P.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n- **Figure IV**: It best fits the argument due to its structure leading to a universal conclusion.\n- **Mood IAI**: It closely aligns with the logical implications provided in the premises. However, given the universal nature of the premises and conclusions, the argument could also be associated with other valid moods or figures under further analysis or different logical contexts. The closest match is Figure IV for its structure and mood IAI for its implications.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is simplified and assumes a direct correspondence between the given premises and valid moods, which in a more detailed examination might require a deeper analysis or different logical contexts.

However, they can be related to the Time Propositions in a way that reflects their logical structure.\n\n- The first sentence, \"Old Li's health was good in the past,\" can be represented by the proposition \"Hp\" (using the symbol for the past).\n\n- The second sentence, \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good,\" can be represented by the proposition \"Ap\" (using the symbol for the past period).\n\n- The sentences do not fit neatly into the predefined relationships due to their different temporal settings, but they can be seen as negations of each other.\n\n- Since the sentences express opposite states of health at different points in the past, a more appropriate analysis would be to consider them as expressing \"Contradiction\" between a specific point in the past and a broader period in the past.\n\n- This contradiction can be represented under the \"No Both\" relationship (1), where \"Ap\" and \"H¬p\" satisfy this relationship.

The first sentence asserts a fact about Aunt Wang's past, while the second sentence refers to a decision or action that is abstractly independent from historical facts.\n\n- However, we can analyze them in the context of the Time Propositions to see how they might relate through negation and contradiction.\n\n- The proposition \"Ap\" (Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past) can be considered the negation of the proposition \"Gp\" (Aunt Wang won a major award in the future). Thus, they satisfy the \"No Both\" relationship (1).\n\n- Additionally, the sentence \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" can be considered in contrast to the sentence \"Allow the execution of contracts.\" It might be argued that allowing the execution of contracts does not logically contradict Aunt Wang's never having won a major award in the past.\n\n- Therefore, the relationship between (2) can be seen as primarily in the context of \"No Both\" relationship (1), with a secondary interpretation that the sentences imply two different actions or decisions.\n\n- This analysis suggests the relationship between (2) is also B.\n\nTherefore, the relationships are summarised as:\n\n- (1): B\n- (2): B\n\nThe answer is: [[B;B]].",

In this case, S is the use of Chinese hybrid rice, and P is the yield of rice. The observed data from the 1980 and 1981 trials clearly show a causal relationship between the use of Chinese hybrid rice and a significantly higher yield of rice, as the data from 1980 and 1981 show that the hybrid rice yield was much higher than the U.S. variety.\n\n2. **Method ؆:** This method suggests that when P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. Again, using the given data, S is the use of Chinese hybrid rice, and P is the yield of rice. In both 1980 and 1981, the use of Chinese hybrid rice resulted in significantly higher yields than the U.S. varieties. This matches the criteria of Method ؆, where the presence of the variable S (use of Chinese hybrid rice) results in the variable P (yield of rice) occurring in both instances.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ:** This method involves comparing positive and negative groups where S and P occur together or when they do not, respectively. In this context, S represents the use of Chinese hybrid rice, and P stands for yield of rice. The data indicates a positive relationship between the use of Chinese hybrid rice and the yield of rice. In both 1980 and 1981, the yield of hybrid rice was much higher than that of the U.S. varieties, which supports the causal relationship suggested by this method.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ:** This method proposes that when changes in S correspond to changes in P, S and P may have a causal relationship. Here, S is the use of Chinese hybrid rice (implementation of a specific treatment), and P is the yield of rice. The observed data in both 1980 and 1981 clearly demonstrates that changes in the use of Chinese hybrid rice directly correlate with changes in the yield of rice.\n\n5. **Method ⚘:** This method involves examining the overall implications of known causal relationships among multiple variables, S, A, B, C, etc., to infer a causal relationship between S and P.

This prediction, however, deviated from the actual observed behavior (S) of Uranus due to a yet unknown gravitational force (P).\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the theoretically calculated orbit and the observed one, scientists deduced the presence of another celestial body (Neptune) and confirmed its discovery by locating it at the predicted position via astronomical observations. This process aligns with the \"Method ⸮\" outlined in the instructions. It involves observing S and P together when other conditions (A, B, C, etc.) differ, which is what led scientists to infer the causal relationship between the gravitational force of Neptune and the observed orbit of Uranus.\n\nThis scenario corresponds to the \"Method ⸮\" because it involves using observed and predicted behaviors of one celestial body (Uranus) to identify a causal relationship with the gravitational force of a previously unknown body (Neptune).

Here's why:\n\n1. **Method ⸮**: This method focuses on instances where S (the presence of a substance) and P (a specific property or effect, in this case, radioactivity) occur together while other conditions (such as the presence of uranium) differ. This method is relevant in the context of Klaprozli's initial observation that the extracted substance from leachite was radioactive, indicating the potential presence of another radioactive element besides uranium.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method examines the effect (P, radioactivity) when the cause (S, the substance from leachite) is present and absent. It's not directly applicable to the described scenario because once uranium is present in the leachite, its absence doesn't negate the presence of other radioactive material.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: In this method, a positive group of instances where S (the substance from leachite) and P (radioactivity) occur together is presented, followed by a negative group where S is absent along with the absence of radioactivity under differing conditions. This method aligns perfectly with the scenario because the initial presence of leachite and the subsequent extraction of uranium and identification of new radioactive elements (radium and polonium) can be seen as a positive group, while the high radioactivity level in the remaining samples after uranium extraction can be considered a negative group. This pattern of positive instances followed by a negative counter-instance is a crucial aspect of the method ꙮ used to infer a causal relationship.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method focuses on changes in S (the substance) corresponding to changes in P (radioactivity), which is implicit in the observation that the radioactivity level of the remaining samples is significantly higher after uranium extraction. This method doesn't directly tie to the discovery of radium and polonium but is consistent with the overall causality implied by the substantial increase in radioactivity.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This method involves a set of conditions and known causal relationships between various elements and properties (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.). While the Curie couple's discovery does involve established knowledge (uranium's radioactive properties and its interaction with other elements), the primary method of reasoning in this context is the combination of Method ꙮ and prior knowledge, as the method ⚘ typically involves a broader set of conditions and causal dependencies that are not explicitly stated in the provided passage.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent method for the causal derivation of the passage of the discourse is Method ꙮ.

Thus, the feathers of the crow at University B should be black, aligning with the given logic rule. Therefore, the attribute \"feathers are black\" is classified as a +Ψ attribute because it is added to the set of known attributes (a, b, c) specific to crows observed at University A. This aligns with the Ψ Method's premise that if every observed crow at University A has a certain attribute (black feathers), then all observed crows at University B also possess that attribute.\n\nSo, the answer is [[B]] because the presence of the attribute \"feathers are black\" is a +Ψ attribute following the logic rule provided.

In this case, the mother makes a claim about being the baby's mother based on her direct relationship and knowledge of the baby's parentage. This act respects the principle that statements should not be weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge allows, unless stronger statements are in conflict.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: The C% Principle, with its \"Minimalization Criterion,\" aligns with the concept of using language efficiently and only when necessary for effective communication. In picking up the baby, the mother minimizes her actions (verbal and physical) to communicate her intention effectively, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on speaking as little as possible to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Lastly, the C! Principle, where it advises against the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason, can be linked to the situation. The mother, upon picking up the baby, does not use a lengthy or marked expression to indicate her intentions or identity. Instead, she opts for a simple, direct action, which adheres to the principle's guideline of avoiding lengthy expressions.\n\nHence, considering the provided scenario, the situation best aligns with the [[C* Principle / C% Principle / C!

However, for clarity and specificity, let's choose:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle primarily deals with the adequacy and accuracy of information in speech, ensuring that statements are not weaker than what the speaker's knowledge permits.\n\nTherefore, the most closely aligned principle to the action of the mother picking up the crying baby and identifying herself as the baby's mother is the **C* Principle**. This principle takes into account the speaker's criterion of not making claims without sufficient knowledge or evidence, which is directly relevant to the scenario's context.\n\nPlease note, in logic and reasoning, the choice of which principle applies can often be nuanced and dependent on the specific context provided.

In this case, the statement, \"Zhang San's new car has doors,\" is logically stronger and directly follows from the provided premise, \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close.\" The information that Zhang San's new car has doors is clearly stronger and directly inferred from the initial statement.\n\n2. **Hearer's Inference (Not directly applied in this case):**\n   - The C% and C!

Let's examine how each principle aligns with the scenario:\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle focuses on the criterion of what the speaker says and how the hearer infers from the speech. In the scenario, Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse, which traditionally implies a female nurse due to the gendered nature of the interaction. Thus, the speaker's criterion that \"do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows\" is satisfied because the connection between giving flowers and a female nurse is the norm, which minimizes the risk of being weaker in information. The hearer's inference (CQ1) is applicable here, as it correctly infers that the speaker knows the context implies giving flowers to a female due to the normative expectations of the situation.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle is about minimizing the use of language and the interpretation of sentences based on conventional conventions. In the scenario, Xiao Wang giving flowers to a nurse adheres to conventional norms, where the recipient is expected to be a female due to the gender of the act. This principle guides the hearer to understand that if Xiao Wang speaks of giving flowers to a nurse without explicitly mentioning the gender, it is expected to be inferred that the nurse is female. The hearer's inference (CI2) aligns with this, where it acknowledges that the speaker's aim to \"speak as little as possible\" while the hearer aims to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle emphasizes clarity and the use of language. Here, Xiao Wang's action of giving flowers to a nurse, understanding that the listener infers the gender of the nurse based on conventional norms, aligns with the principle's emphasis on clear expression. The principle's guideline against using lengthy or obscure expressions would not apply, as the scenario straightforwardly conveys the action of giving flowers to a nurse, which is a clear and common expression.\n\nTherefore, the scenario primarily conforms to the C* and C% principles, with a minimal alignment to the C! principle. The most fitting answer is [[A/C/A]]. \n\nThe C* Principle is particularly relevant because it deals with the speaker's knowledge and the hearer's inference based on contextual knowledge and the expectations of the situation (in this case, the gender of the nurse), while the C% Principle focuses on minimizing the use of language to ensure effective communication within the context of the situation. The C! Principle aligns more broadly with the principle that encourages clear and direct communication, which is a shared goal for both the speaker and the hearer.

This method is based on the principle that if P, then Q (P → Q), and if not P (¬P), erroneously concludes not Q (¬Q) due to an incorrect relationship between P and its negation, ¬P.\n\nIn our scenario, the true logic applies as follows:\n\n- P: An employee completes a project.\n- Q: The employee receives a bonus.\n- Manager M's statement: \"All employees will receive a bonus after completing a project.\" This implies that for every employee who completes a project, they will receive a bonus (P → Q).\n- Employee A's misunderstanding: \"Only when an employee receives a bonus, have they completed a project.\" This implies an incorrect relationship where completing a project is a condition for receiving a bonus, and not the other way around (¬P → Q), which is the essence of the Incorrect Negation Method fallacy.\n\nEmployee A's interpretation erroneously conflates the condition (Q) and the consequence (P), leading to the incorrect conclusion about the relationship between completing a project and receiving a bonus. Thus, the Incorrect Negation Method is the appropriate formal fallacy in this context.\n\nTo further elaborate, let's break down how the Incorrect Negation Method applies:\n\n1. **Original Statement (P → Q):** If an employee completes a project, they will receive a bonus.\n2. **Employee's Misunderstanding (¬P → Q):** If an employee does not receive a bonus, they must have completed the project.\n3. **Logical Fallacy:** This misunderstanding contradicts the original statement (P → Q) by incorrectly assuming that the completion of a project is a necessary condition for receiving a bonus. The fallacy lies in the incorrect relationship between the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q), thus illustrating the Incorrect Negation Method.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. IncorrNeg Method.",
