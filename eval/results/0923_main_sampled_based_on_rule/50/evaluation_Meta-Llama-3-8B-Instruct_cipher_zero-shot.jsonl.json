The result is: 0x7E 0x0C\n    * Substitute: Use the S_BOX to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together. The result is: 0x9C 0x88\n    * Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The result is: 0x8C 0x98\n    * XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again. The result is: 0x6C 0x8C\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string. The result is: 6C8C\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.

Preparation: Use the same key as for encryption, which is the SHA-256 hash value of \"SECRET_KEY\", i.e., '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n2. Converting the ciphertext to a sequence of bytes:\n   Since the ciphertext is a hexadecimal string, it is converted to bytes in the order bytes = [int(ciphertext[i*2:i*2+2], 16) for i in range(len(ciphertext)//2)]\n   bytes: [37, 117, 219, 52, 39, 120, 34, 39, 117, 190, 186, 11]\n\n3. Decrypting each byte using the XOR operation with the corresponding key byte:\n   Since the length of the key is shorter than the length of the ciphertext, we recursively cycle through the key.\n   decrypted_bytes = [b^k for b, k in zip(bytes, iter(key))]\n\n   where the iteration over the key is implemented using the iter function, ensuring the key is cycled through correctly.\n\n   decrypted_bytes: [23, 96, 32, 103, 36, 111, 75, 39, 117, 76, 142, 140]\n\n4. Converting the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string:\n   The byte sequence represents ASCII values. Converting these to uppercase letters gives the decrypted plaintext.\n   decrypted_plaintext: 'MSGREETING'\n\nThe decrypted answer is: [[MSGREETING]].",
