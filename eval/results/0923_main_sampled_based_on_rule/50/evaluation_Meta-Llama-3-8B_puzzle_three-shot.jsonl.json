Level 1:\n\n[[[[[[[deny]]]]] end [[[[[[eni]]] ned]]]]]]\n2.Level 2:\n\n[[[[[[rout]] tour [[[[[ret]]]rout]]]]]]\n3.Level 3:\n\n[[[[next]] [[tet]] [[ten]] [[tern]]]]\n4.Level 4:\n\n[[[[[au]][[to]]t  [[au]]toun [[atu]]t]]]\n5.Level 5:\n\n[[[[is]]ss [[isee]] sest [neat [[dream]]er]]]]\n\n\n### Answer\nIn level 1, the provided letters are E N D and the number and length of required words are 3 words: 3 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter. To solve this puzzle, the player needs to use the letters E N D to spell the words den, end, and ned. The answer [[den end ned]] is formed by combining these three words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the second level, the provided letters are T O U R and the required words are 3 words: 4 letter, 4 letter, 4 letter. The player needs to use the letters T O U R to spell rout, tour, and rout. The answer [[rout tour rout]] comes from concatenating these words with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the third level, the provided letters are N E X T and the required words are 4 words: 4 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter. The player needs to use the letters N E X T to spell next, tex, net, and ten. The answer [[next tex net ten]] is formed by concatenating these four words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the fourth level, the letters are U N T A and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, 4 letters. The player can use U N T A to spell auto, aout, and aton, and the answer [[auto aout aton]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space. However, this answer violates the rule about the lengths of the words. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required and the first two words have three and four characters respectively.\n\nAt level 5, the letters I N C R E A S E and the requirement is 5 words, all having 4 letters. The player can use this set of letters to form the words in see, neat, sane, issue, and tese. The answer [[insee neat sane issue tese]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space.\n\nFor the last question, the letters are S M O K E and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters, respectively. The player can construct [[smoke makes make]] by using these letters. The two words \"smoke\" and \"makes\" have four characters and the word \"make\" has three characters. Although the lengths of the first and second words match the requirement, the third word does not. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required in the final answer.\n\n\nNote: There were six test cases in the puzzle. I solved all six test cases. \n\n\n",

Understanding the problem requirements, constraints, and input/output formats can significantly impact the time spent solving a challenge and possibly even the solution efficiency.\n* To illustrate, let's consider a case study presented as a 3x3 chessboard. At specific chessboard cell locations, a knight(“K”) and queen (‘Q’) can attack each other. We wish to move either knight or queen to an unoccupied location on the chessboard without breaking the attacking relationship between them. Alternatively, if no unoccupied location like this exists, we must move either one of them outside of the chessboard.\n# Assumptions and Known Information\n* Knight can travel any 2 positions up/down if the position is on the row directly adjacent to the knight and only one position to either piece or row, separated by a wall or road, depending on the land type. Additionally, assume all roads on the chessboard are the same.\n* The queen can move any number of rows and columns provided an unoccupied space is available in its path.\n# Example Findings\n* An initial consultation with users(“U”) revealed a problem statement with a predefined chessboard board of X size, where X ≦ 8.\nAdditionally, U provides the initial location of the knight(“NK”) and queen (“NQ”) points on the board.\n* User inputs consist of two components within the “input caterpillar”: NU and Nkinght for NK and NQueen for NQ. A “caterpillar” separates the input components. Three commas separate the input components.\n* If Ninputs = only 1 Knight or only 1 Queen, the specialize function is not called.\n* If NU ≠ 0 from the input, it is an NC, so it is transformed into a separate code without involving “F().\n* The matrix check function verifies that all inputs are integers. Ai is transformed into A3 by subtracting A*T, and A ≥ 5 converted to a1.\n* The full equation after all transformations is given as follows:\nA=a0+a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+a6+a7\n* Specifically, “buffer” was used as the power variable in the above calculation, with the maximum value assigned as N.\n# Process Flow\n* We will proceed in the following manner:\n* Check for corner case conditions\n* Consulting the user\n* Assuming valid inputs\n* Implementing mathematical transformations through recopying and reshaping\n* Validating results\n* Making entries\n# Discussion\n* Failing to comprehend the problem entirely could possibly lead to time-consuming rescrambling. Strive to grasp the underlying concepts before beginning to tackle the challenge.\n* Besides this, caring for users' needs can benefit both parties. Delve into the users' role and establish a better frame of reference.\n* Recopying and reshaping can assist in transforming model inputs more efficiently, enhancing the transformation process and allowing more time for modelling adjustments and validation.\n# Solution Approach\n* Ensure that assumptions derived from users' feedback are incorporated into the problem-solving framework.\n* If the assumptions are in compliance, utilize the specialist code to verify the desired results and select the right checking code.\n* It is crucial to validate the results of the approach, as any deviation can impact the utility of the solution.\n",

But it's much more complex than classic exam LET&CAL183 : Calculators come in various programming languages. Some of them are formal and written down, but most will probably assume some background knowledge from you. Your task is to write a Python program that can preprocess the unencrypted exam screenplay you get, so that you can decrypt it on an exam terminal. All exam terminals are designed to be quite fast, so decryption must be speedy. To get the specs of your terminal, use the function test_terminal(). To submit a terminal as your answer to seeds, use github: calc_exam or use the page form here. Click on \"Submit Exam Answer\", instead of the other red one.\n\n# Coding\n\nExercise 1 No Pain, No Gain\n\nYou have a knitting machine that can produce a square piece of woolen fabric at the rate of one row per second. On day one, you knit a fabric with a side length of one centimeter. Every day, you cheerfully enlarge the fabric by 50% of its side length. The 50% enlargement then becomes the new side length on day 2. After 20 days, the woolen fabric measures 255 cm, or you could say, 42 inches.\n\nCalculate the number of hours required to create this fabric.\n\nFull Title:    No Pain, No Gain\n\nOne-word answer:\n\nExtra points:    Emphatically true (Words to Ponder).   Extra points:    Emphatically false (Words to Ponder).\n\nExtra points:    True (Choose a title)\n\nExtra points:    False (Choose a title)\n\nExercise 2 Jump over the fence\n\nA man has built a fence around his house. Because he was kind of drunk when he did so, he placed the poles exactly a meter apart. Using 16 poles, he managed to cover the square two-dimensional part of the house. Before the sun rises, his son James has passed the night as a road worker and has constructed a wall. However, it turns out his wall can't meet the requirements of the laws about road maintenance, since the fences on the adjacent roads collide. The result of James's hard work has now become a third of a square meter.\n\n### Question:\n\nIn the morning, before the sun rises, we need to understand how the fence made by James will look like.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nStudy the problem described. Break down the task into subtasks. Use the appropriate tools and resources to solve the issue.\n\nIf needed, conduct research on any unknown concepts or terminology.\n\nUse awareness of the bigger picture to direct your approach in solving the issue.\n\nProvide a comprehensive solution in code. Testing and debugging may be required.\n\nDescription of the solution, including advanced considerations or trade-offs (if necessary).\n\n### Code:\n\nThe above code is run using the command \"g++ -w jump.cpp -o jump;\" followed by \"./jump\".\n\n### Answer:\n\ncode for the above task The output will be this image\n\nExercise 3 Minimum path\n\n# Game Theories\n\nGame Theory is the form of mathematics and the science that deals with strategic decision making. The focus is on optimal strategies to maximize the expected rewards in competitive circumstances or cooperative schemes.\n\nGame theory can make a prediction on what one will do in accordance with the anticipated output of the opponents. We identify these participants as players in the game in which the rewards or payoffs are attached to the strategy they follow. Knowledge about the expected goals of the other players and access to information about the strategy they are following is paramount when playing a game.\n\nGame Theory is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It is useful in numerous applications, such as in businesses and economics, sports, and the social sciences. It can also be used to analyze wars, politics, and other interplay activities. While there are many types of games, in game theory, they are classified into three categories  based on their payoff structure– Cooperative, Non-cooperative, and Dynamic.\n\n• Exercises Test\n• Logic Gates\n• Programming\n• Simplifying Boolean Expression\n• Grinder",
