However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true).

Since `~(p1=::>p2)` is true only in the `✓|x` scenario for `p1|p2`, combining it with `p2` (which is `x` in that scenario) results in a false (`x`) outcome for `~(p1=::>p2)&p2` in all scenarios because `p2` being `x` makes the `&` operation false.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this analysis overlooks the fact that `~(p1=::>p2)` can also be true in other scenarios where `p1=::>p2` is false, but given our scenario, the combination with `p2` being true (`✓`) is what we're focusing on. The mistake here is in prematurely concluding the outcome without considering all truth values for `p1` and `p2`.\n\nCorrecting this:\n\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` is true whenever `p1=::>p2` is false. This occurs not just when `p1` is true and `p2` is false but also needs to consider the implication's truth table.\n- `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Thus, its negation `~(p1=::>p2)` is true in this case.\n- However, since we're combining this with `p2` using `&`, we need `p2` to be true for the whole expression to be true. This creates a contradiction with our initial condition for `~(p1=::>p2)` being true based solely on the implication's falseness.\n\nThe correct way to view this:\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true if `p1` is true and `p2` is false, but since we're also requiring `p2` to be true (`&p2`), this specific scenario actually doesn't fulfill the formula's requirement.\n- However, if `p1` is false, `~(p1=::>p2)` can still be true because a false `p1` makes `p1=::>p2` true regardless of `p2`, but adding `p2` being true makes the whole expression dependent on `p2`'s truth.\n\nGiven this, the formula can actually be true under certain conditions (e.g., when `p1` is false and `p2` is true, the first part `~(p1=::>p2)` can be true because `p1=::>p2` would be true due to `p1` being false making the implication true, but then `&p2` also being true fulfills the whole expression). Therefore, it's not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula because it's not always true or always false under all assignments.\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nThis formula suggests an equivalence between `p1&p3` and `~p1&~p2`.\n\n- For `p1&p3` to be true, both `p1` and `p3` must be true.\n- For `~p1&~p2` to be true, both `p1` and `p2` must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, the formula cannot be true under all assignments because the truth of `p1` is contradictory between the two sides of the equivalence. If `p1` is true (to satisfy `p1&p3`), then `~p1` is false, making `~p1&~p2` false. Similarly, if `p1` is false (to satisfy `~p1&~p2`), then `p1&p3` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, this formula is not a Truth Formula because it cannot be true under all assignments due to the direct contradiction in the truth value of `p1` required by each side of the equivalence. However, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because we're looking at the structure and not evaluating all possible truth assignments directly in this explanation. The correct approach would involve a truth table analysis for a more precise determination, but given the explanation, we see it's not always true, suggesting it's not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, reflecting further, given the direct contradiction in conditions for `p1` to satisfy both sides of the equivalence simultaneously, it indicates the formula cannot be satisfied under any condition, suggesting it leans towards being a Falsehood Formula. This is because for the formula to be true, `p1` must both be true (for `p1&p3`) and false (for `~p1&~p2`) at the same time, which is impossible.\n\n### Corrected Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical contradiction in the conditions required for each formula to be true under all assignments:\n\n- (1) is **Neither** a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it can be true under specific conditions but not all.\n- (2) is actually a **Falsehood Formula** because it presents a logical contradiction that cannot be resolved under any truth assignment, making it impossible to be true under any condition.\n\n**Answer:** [[C];[B]]",

First, let's expand the implication `>` into its equivalent form using rule (10) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`.\n   - So, `(p>q)` becomes `!p | q` and `(p>r)` becomes `!p | r`.\n   - Thus, `((p>q)&(p>r))` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   \n2. Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3. However, we can simplify our approach by directly considering what it means for two propositions not to be equivalent. This implies that either one is true when the other is false, or vice versa. This can be intuitively understood as an XOR operation, but let's stick to the given logical operators.\n\n4. The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity.

This binary number corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^q^r, following the same logic, we have ¬p (0), q (1), r (1), which gives us the binary number 011. This binary number corresponds to the hexadecimal number 3.\n   \n   Therefore, the first paired conjunctive term ¬p^¬q^r is denoted as m1, and the second term ¬p^q^r is denoted as m3.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n\n   Given the paired conjunctive terms and their corresponding notations, we can conclude that the paired conjunctive terms of the expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) are m1, m3.\n\n   **Answer:** [[paired conjunctive terms: m1, m3]; [denoted: (m1∨m3)]]",

The literals are p, q, ¬q, ¬p, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\nTo apply the resolution algorithm, we start by initializing S0 as an empty set, S1 as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given expression, and S2 as an empty set. Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause. Therefore, we conclude that the algorithm iterates 1 cycle to reach the determination of \"Plausible\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Plausible;1]}$",

This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P.

An assumption is made that the contrary of p (Not p) is true.\n3. It is then shown that if Not p is true, it leads to another proposition q.\n4. However, proposition q is known to be false (Not q).\n5. The conclusion drawn is that since the assumption of Not p leads to a false outcome, Not p itself must be false.\n6. Therefore, the original proposition p is true.\n\nThis pattern involves assuming the contrary of what is to be proven, showing that this assumption leads to a false or undesirable outcome, and thus concluding that the original proposition must be true. This is a clear example of indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting its contrary.\n\nThe correct answer is [[E]].",
