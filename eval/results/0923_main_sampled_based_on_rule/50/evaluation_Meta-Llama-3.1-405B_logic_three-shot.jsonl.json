Most free datasets only offer questions, while the answers require payment.\n\nSo as a developer, how do we generate a dataset? The first rule of course is to use the rules provided by the textbook itself! Elementary: Once we have `question - answer pair`, we can leverage the LLM's ability to perform unsupervised learning to generate some kind of dataset. But first, let's describe the rules:\n\n1. Universal Quantifier is denoted by A. Symbolize the phrase 'All men are mortal' involving the n-ary predicate ‘being mortal’ as Ax F (x). To symbolize the relationship involving the 2-dimensional predicate ‘being loved by’ as Ax Ay G (x, y). Therefore, we can use G(x) to denote the n-ary predicate `x is mortal` , and G(x,y) to denote the 2-dimensional predicate `x is loved by y`.\n\n2. Existential Quantifier is denoted by E. Given a 1-ary predicate that states that some people do not like mathematics, symbolize this as Ex ¬ F (x). Using Ex and Ey to express that there is someone who likes someone can be symbolized as Ex Ey G (x, y).\n\n3. Logical Connectives include Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, and Implication. The negation of a predicate may be denoted by negating each part of the symbolic language.\n\n4. Finally, it is important to note whether the domain is universal (all people) or specific (such as living things). For instance, universal symbolization: ‘Man loves wisdom’ involves the two predicates F(x)='x is a man' and G(x,y)='x loves y'.",

Note that in formal deductive reasoning, any binary predicate, say the < predicate, can be described by the equality predicate (e.g., x<y ⇔ (∃z)(∃w)((x+z=y) & (∼z=0))).\n\nSo we can use two fixed quantifiers to \"fix\" two parameters in the < predicate as two fixed constants. Similarly, any binary predicate can be rewritten as a combination of a quaternary predicate and two fixed quantifiers. So in general there's no need to add new symbols to our logical system for variables and unknowns besides the usual connectives and quantifiers!\n\nNow we're ready to rewrite the proposition symbolically without introducing any more extraneous symbols such as ∧,∨,¬,⇒,⟺,etc. We just use the usual propositional operations along with some temporary auxiliary symbols.",

This approach not only broadens the scope of logical reasoning but also allows for greater flexibility in problem-solving by introducing novel properties and relationships. By understanding the core principles of custom-defined logics and following the steps outlined above, one can harness the potential of these cutting-edge AI models to solve complex logical problems efficiently and accurately.\n",

        "response": "[[[c*](φ∧HAlice(φ))]]\n` `**Explanation**: In this scenario, we are looking for a way to express Alice's belief regarding the prolonged execution of the loop command c* until some proposition φ holds true. According to the rules described by the previously defined Dynamic Logic language (see here), the expression [c*](φ) represents the condition that after executing the loop command c* an arbitrary number of times, the proposition φ will necessarily hold. However, this does not capture the aspect of Alice's belief about the persistence of the loop command until φ becomes true.\n\nThis additional semantic feature capturing belief can be achieved through the use of an epistemic modal operator, such as the one introduced by Hansson & Jonsson [1]. The basic idea behind epistemic logics is to extend traditional modal logics by including operators that represent agents' beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states. Here, we adopt the convention where 'H(eissmer)' denotes an operator representing eissmer's beliefs.\n\nPutting everything together, we obtain the desired expression: [c*](φ ∧ HAlice(φ)). This captures both the fact that the loop command c* must eventually terminate (due to the truth of proposition φ), as well as Alice's belief that the loop command will persist until φ holds true.\n\n[1] Håkan Hansson and Lars Jonsson (2010), \"Epistemic Logic for Artificial Intelligence\" MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/epistemic-logic-artificial-intelligence \n\n### Question:\nAssume that c1 and c2 are two sequential commands, and φ is a proposition. According to the axioms provided earlier, what is the equivalent expression for [c1][c2]φ?\nPlease give your answer in the format of [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[c1+c2]φ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the correct way to interpret the expression ⟨c⟩φ, given a command c and a proposition φ?\nA. After executing command c, proposition φ may be true.\nB. Proposition φ must always hold during the execution of command c.\nC. It is possible that φ holds before executing command c.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question: \nIf it is known that a command c1 triggers an exception e upon completion, then what can be concluded about the proposition φ according to the Exception rule stated above?\nSelect all possible outcomes:\n[[Possible outcomes here]]\n(Press enter after each selection)\n\n### Answer:\n[[φ ∨ e]] [[[c1]φ]]\nExplanation: According to the Exception rule, if the command c1 triggers an exception e after its completion, then [c1]φ is equivalent to ([c1]φ ∧ [e]φ). Therefore, if we know that the command c1 triggers an exception e, we can conclude that the proposition φ is either true or the exception e is thrown. Alternatively, since the exception e is thrown immediately after the execution of command c1, we can also say that the proposition φ is always true following the execution of command c1. Thus, the correct answers are φ ∨ e and [c1]φ.",

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nThe Notes/Reference corpus is a special collection of information, providing a detailed overview of specific subjects. Each note in this corpus can be formulated as a logical rule, which means it contains precise and clear instructions for how to express a piece of information. Notes in this corpus consist of the following components:\n\nNote Title: A brief summary of the content being conveyed. Note titles are all formed by specifying an action and using a particular adjective. For example, \"improving accuracy through the use of compound data sets\" or \"assessing user adaptive behavior.\"\n\nNote Content: A directive that outlines the specific desired action or method. Note content is formulated in a particular manner, including:\n\nSubject: A clear statement describing the main focus or subject of the note.\nAction: A clear statement defining what action is expected.\nCondition: An explicit statement defining when the action will be performed or in what situation.\nApplication: A statement that specifies how the noted action will be implemented or enacted.\n\n### Question:\n{question} Please explain the rationale and list them separately in your answer, itemizing your explanations for each rationale into a list format. If there are three rationales, you are expected to list three answers. If there are multiple statements, you should provide a list of statements.\n```\n\n\n\n```\nComplete the following sentence:\n\nI divided the dish horizontally, evenly distributing it.

If Q or R represent Syllogistic Predicates such as Affirmative, negative, etc., then `Q(M,N)` or `R(O,P)` can be used in the recursive formulation according to their respective rules.\n2. If ├h〔■h〕 is given and Figure Y is stated to be invalid, Springer-Vater provides a means to circumvent logicality using reductio ad absurdum. This creates a new doubtful premise Z, expressed as 〔■h arschlich·und·nur£ponsible if all rounders¤exist┊logically■h and certain alternative M┊┊Átl┊┊‡`. Translations provide M←→Z×Y→Nₗ└─()=[S₁, S₂...Sₘ] i.e., let M ← S₁ ∧ S₂ ∧ ... ∧ S_n. Use M in this context but simultaneously show why exactly Sₖs do not necessarily follow from any smaller subsequence of s_ijs. The justification also includes reasons for longer sequences.\n3. For demonstrating that Figure Z wasn't a valid figure after all, you can always go back to the initial assertion T₀ ´→ S facing the challenges posed by proofs being beyond unreasonable reach, then move forward again by reductio ad absurdum until you find no way out. However, this approach has limitations and may become computationally infeasible.",
