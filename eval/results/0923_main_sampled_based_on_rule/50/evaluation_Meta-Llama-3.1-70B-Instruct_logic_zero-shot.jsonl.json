In this case, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nIf p1 is assigned x, then the truth value of the formula p1||p2||p3 depends on the assignments of p2 and p3. However, according to the rule of the material implication (p1=::>p2), if the antecedent (p1) is x, then the implication is always ✓, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, regardless of the assignments of p2 and p3, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned ✓.\n\nSince the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is assigned ✓ under all assignments, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nTo determine whether this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze the possible truth values of the formula under all assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nFirst, consider the subformula p1=::>~p1. If p1 is assigned ✓, then ~p1 is assigned x, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned x. If p1 is assigned x, then ~p1 is assigned ✓, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned ✓.\n\nNow, consider the entire formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is x, then the implication will be assigned ✓, regardless of the assignment of ~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is ✓, then the implication (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 will depend on the assignment of ~p2. If ~p2 is assigned x (p2 is assigned ✓), then the implication will be assigned x.\n\nSince the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 can be assigned x under some assignments, it is not a Truth Formula. However, it is not always x, so it is not a Falsehood Formula either. Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]].",

This means p1 must be true and p2 must be false for ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, but then p2 cannot be true. However, this creates a contradiction, so there is no assignment that makes the entire formula true.\n\nHowever, as this reasoning was flawed, we should create a truth table:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | x | ✓ | x | x |\n| x | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n| ✓ | x | x | ✓ | x |\n| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | x | x |\n\nYet, we actually found an issue.

Resolve clauses in S1 (second iteration):\n    - No further resolution is possible in this iteration since S1 contains only a single literal.\n\n4.

According to the given definition, if `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nIn this case, the proposition `p` is \"2 plus 2 equals 4.\" Since both Alice and Bob firmly believe this proposition, the condition for common belief is met. The Belief Axiom (`B_p → p`) further supports the notion that if Alice and Bob firmly believe `p`, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not directly reference common belief but rather discuss individual knowledge or doubt.
