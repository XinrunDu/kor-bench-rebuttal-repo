For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question: General Question\nDescribe the encryption process, including the movements of the pile.\n\n### Answer\nThe encryption process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Conversion of the plaintext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of a keystream value from the pile of cards using the \"keystream algorithm\" (see below).\n    \n3. Addition of the keystream value to the plaintext letter number (modulo 26).\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting ciphertext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \n\nEach invocation of the keystream algorithm computes a single keystream value y. It modifies the pile D and thereby influences the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n\nHere is the keystream algorithm:\n\nLet A represent the first joker (which is 53) and B represent the second (54).\n\n1. Move A down one position in the pile. If it is already at the bottom of the pile, put it at the top, immediately beneath the top card.\n2. Move B down two positions in the pile. If it is already on one of the bottom two positions, move it around to one of the top two positions (respectively the bottom and the top of the pile).\n3. Perform a triple cut: Take the part just above A and the part just below B and put their order-reversed concatenation at the bottom of the pile. The deck is always treated as a circular region.\n4. Perform a count cut: Take out that many cards from the top of the pile and insert them just above the last card of the pile. Joker A counts as 53; there is no effect for Joker B.\n5. Look at the value of the top card. Joker A counts as 53; ignore Joker B and repeat the algorithm. Use the value of the computed card as the resulting keystream value y.\n\nIn a streamlined version of this algorithm, card A only changes position if it's not the bottom card or at the top, card B only moves if it's not at the top two positions, and the triple-cut step is not executed if A precedes B. These tweaks have no effect on the keystream but make the implemented algorithm faster by performing fewer operations (on average).\n\n### Question: General Question\nDescribe the algorithm for decryption.\n\n### Answer\nThe decryption algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Conversion of the ciphertext letter to a number (its position in LETTERS).\n    \n2. Generation of the corresponding keystream value using the \"keystream algorithm\" from above.\n    \n3. Calculation of the plaintext letter number from the ciphertext letter number using subtraction modulo 26.\n    \n4. Retrieval of the resulting plaintext letter from the LETTERS list.\n    \nFor each ciphertext letter, a respective keystream value is computed. Each keystream determination modifies the pile D and thereby affects the keystream value computed by subsequent calls.\n",

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards:\n        - A list of 54 numbers, including a randomly shuffled deck consisting of 52 suited cards and two distinguishable jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker. Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.",

Empty cells in each block are filled with placeholders (e.g., `#`) if needed.\n\n- **Encryption Rules:** During encryption, the plaintext letter is inserted into the available space of the grid, row by row, following the rotation path determined by the template with holes. If there are fewer than 16 letters, extra placeholders are added.\n\n- **Decryption Rules:** During decryption, the encrypted letters are rearranged in the grid according to the same template, with the same rotation applied to determine the plaintext sequence.\n\n- **Preparation:** Define the grid and template used in this cipher.\n\n- **Message Manipulation:** Define functions for reading/writing messages and for rotating/reading/deleting templates.\n\n- **Message Encryption:** Encrypt the message according to the cipher rules.\n\n- **Message Decryption:** Decrypt the encrypted message by reversing the process.\n\nFinally, the code defines a `program_output` that stores the results of the program.",

The encryption and decryption process is an iterative process with precise steps to attain the desired ciphertext or plaintext. It was interesting to note the significance of the transposed sequence in the encryption and decryption process. This cipher rule serves as a fundamental example of the complexities involved in encrypting and decrypting ciphertexts. We hope this section was enlightening and facilitated your understanding of encryption and decryption concepts. If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to discuss them with us.",

Take the question \"Plaintext: D\" and \"Ciphertext: 27BF7E\" as sample.\n\n### Specific question\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n```\nbatchSize=16\n```\n```\nkey=73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3\nplaintext=D\nciphertext=37\n```\n\n### Answer:\n[[37]]\n\n### Follow-up question\nThe above answer is correct. Now there is a difference in the **Ciphertext**. This time the received ciphertext is **\"D\"**. Regarding your decryption, the only correct one is:\n\nA. Always directly use the provided `key==76ééêê÷×'F6¶÷÷Ò@%ÿ\"³\"W'43}'çâ` to decrypt, regardless of whether there is plaintext linked to ciphertext.\n\nB. The special operation applied is: If the name attribute exists in the ciphertext and has value= '27bf7e', then decrypt it and make sure it should equal plaintext attribute(D). However, if plaintext attribute does not exist, then base the logical deduction on whether value= '0101' to directly make up another value without checking validity. \n\n### The hint is related to the correctness of the \"base the logical deduction\" part.\n```\n# Although I tried implementing some kind of parity checking here, it seems like something else also needs to happen when plaintext isn't present but hardcoded \"containing the symbolic data structure\". Any ideas?\nif isinstance(plaintext, str) and plaintext != '':\n    assert encoding == 'ascii'\n    plain_bytes = plaintext.encode(encoding)\nelse:\n    # TODO: implement me! Right now this just reverses the process of encryption which isn't right because the resulting plaintext won't necessarily match up with what was originally intended. I'm pretty sure there's a more elegant way to do this...\n    if name == '27bf7e':\n        assert _extract_fdf(ciphertext) == '10'  # treat similarly encoded ciphertext as identical regardless of key since their decryption should produce same outcome\n        return '27bf7e'\n    elif name == '0101':\n        # Now find its corresponding ciphertext by iterating through all possible keys until we get such plaintext without knowing the actual secret key itself beforehand\n        for i in range(len(KEYS)):\n            deciphered_bits = [ord(s) ^ KEYS[i] for s in ciphertext]\n            reconstructed_plaintext = ''.join(chr(b) for b in deciphered_bits)\n            if reconstructed_plaintext == 'D':\n                return f'000{i+1}'\n    raise ValueError(f'Invalid ciphertext: could not determine if {ciphertext} corresponds to given conditions!')\n```\n\n### A correct answer in the hint is provided here:\n```\n# Before answering these questions, ask your chatbot these: \"If no plain_text is available, can you still figure out if an encrypted message has been tampered with? Can you determine whether two encrypted messages originated from the same unencrypted original message without having access to either one of them nor any additional information about their contents or encoding scheme?\"\n# They seem simple enough yet answers usually reveal something important... \n# The issue here lies specifically within the final `elif` block wherein we attempt to reverse-engineer the cipher using only the ciphertext alone. According to CAESAR algorithm, given a fixed key k, two distinct plain texts m and n will always map onto distinct ciphertexts c=C(m) and d=C(n), so long as c≠d. To put it simply, knowing merely the ciphertext does not allow us to infer anything conclusive regarding the underlying plaintext being encrypted. Hence, even after spending countless hours trying every conceivable combination of operations, no clear pattern emerges suggesting otherwise. As a side note, notice how difficult",
