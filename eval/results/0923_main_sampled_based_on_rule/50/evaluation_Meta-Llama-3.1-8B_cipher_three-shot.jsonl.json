We have cycled about 5x in the disk since the beginning. To find the spot for which we deserve to cycle by 5, we must multiply by 2, or any period above 10. So C.\nUsing the displacement from the period from the second step. we move the elements from that position by an increment of two and obtain the starting position for the fifth iteration. We roll to the right the characters we save on the field with 0 characters, such as Z, and where the E starts on the first cycle is the starting position of the fifth cycle. We get A.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"KQUQMMJCTZRUEGLTXOMCAHYTUWVRSU\"\nperiod: 5\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\nAssume the text encrypts with plaintext: \"WE BUY DINNER\"\n\nWhat is part of the ciphertext\n\n### Answer\nHTISJOBSATHATEPA",

Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule\n### Encryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n   - M Z S D P\n   - K N F L Q\n   - G A O X U\n   - W R Y V C\n   - B T E H I\n\t - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n\t - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n  - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n    - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n    - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n    - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n  - Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n\n### Decryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n    - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n    - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n    - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n    - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n  - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n\n\n## Question\nPlaintext: \"CU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the message, including the height, depth, and length, as well as the cover format.\n2. Imitate the original volume sales data, including the book title, author name, and sales volume.\n3. Obey the specified book spine format and requirements.\n\n### Book Spine Format:\n\nThe book spine will be in a <td> tag, each representing a book, containing two elements:\n    1. The title of the book, represented only by the first 3 characters of its name, and its <h3> element tag must not be nested, so the tag is <h3>n</h3>.The text within the tags should be rendered in a specific CSS class.\n    2. The quantity of copies sold, must be expressed in *'s, one * represents 1000 copies, so if a book sells 3000 copies, its tag will look like <em>n*</em>.The tags must also be in the cascade of <td> elements.\n\nYou can use relative font sizes to control the width of the <td> in which the tag is contained, using the value of \"width-frequency-height\" (e.g. 13 in a 13x13 table is 13x13/1000 = 1.3/100 = 1,3% in width)\nIf the quantity of copies sold ends with 0, you can display the digits with *'s as well, e.g. 13350 would be n**.*\n\nFor example, a table representing a specific book would yield a result in the following format:\n\n<td style=\"width: 13%\">\n    \t<h3>n</h3>\n    \t<em>n**</em>\n</td>\n\nThe book represents James Patterson's \"Ape Next Door\", which has been purchased by 133,500 customers.\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by the most popular author\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\nThis means that the order in which the books' **<td style=\"width: 13%\">** elements are displayed in the first row is from left to right.\n\nTo achieve this. Your answer should be:\n<table class=\"forwx-table\" style=\"table-layout:fixed\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Cat</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Egg</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>Ape</h3>\n                <em>**</em>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>EDD</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>EAR YEAH</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>BEL LIETEN DEI ZEN</h3>\n            </td>\n            <td style=\"width: 13%\">\n                <h3>WRIT N</h3>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by genre\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\n\nTo achieve this.

Think carefully, the rules must be followed to succeed.\n\n- Input and OUTPUT conversion:\n    - The plaintext is a string of lowercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).\n    - The ciphertext is a string of uppercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).  hi->VPL\n- The alphabet: English alphabet.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 grid:\n        [['X', 'Q', 'A', '0', 'P', 'B'], \n        ['E', '2', 'R', 'F', 'U', '1'],\n        ['Y', 'V', 'W', 'I', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['3', '1', '4', 'H', '6', 'M'],\n        ['C', 'G', 'N', 'J', 'S', '5'],\n        ['8', 'D', 'O', 'K', '7', '9']],\n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"DECGL\"\n- Encryption:\n    - For each plaintext letter:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that plaintext character in the 6X6 grid. For example, a has 4 rows and columns.\n        - the position of each character in the encrypted character set is marked as 0-5. Use the character corresponding to the row at the position of the row in the encrypted character set as the ciphertext\n            - For example, the number of rows of a is 4, and the position of corresponds to b in the encrypted character set, so the corresponding ciphertext of 4 is b.\n        - Combine all the ciphertexts using common parameters as the final ciphertext.  For example, if the ciphertexts are b, h, i, k, b, x, x, p, s, s, c, o, j, t, b, the final ciphertext of the plaintext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\"\n        \n    - Decryption:\n        - Divide the ciphertext into two parts, and reverse them.\n        \n            For example, if the ciphertext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\", it is reversed into \"tbjcowsspbslkbx\"\n            \n        - use the ciphertext to obtain the number of rows and columns of the corresponding plaintext letter in the 6x6 grid.\n        - Combine all the plaintext letters using common parameters as the final plaintext.\n            \n            For example, if the plaintext letters are in reverse order, i.e. \"btbjcowsspbslkbx\", the final plaintext is \"aeh\"\n            \n- Note:\n  \n    - In the first example, the characters that participate in encryption are a, b, i, k, p, t, c, d, j, o, s. Use the index to get the 6x6 matrix in the upper right and lower left corners:\n    [['A', '0', 'Q', 'B', 'R', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'G', '2', 'E', 'S', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'H', 'X', 'T', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'I', 'C', '6', 'O'],\n    ['Y', '1', 'Z', 'J', '8', 'L'],\n    ['K', '4', 'N', '5', '3', '7']],",
