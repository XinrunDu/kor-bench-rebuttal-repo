Convert the ciphertext character \"X\" to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0). In this case, z = 8 (as \"X\" is the 8th letter in the LETTERS sequence).\n\n2. Generate keystream value y for the decryption:\n   - Use the Initial sequence of cards to generate keystream value y using the Keystream Algorithm (cards).\n\n   Let's assume the Initial sequence of cards is still the same as provided in the rules:\n\n   31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 54, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n\n   The keystream value y is obtained by following the steps of the Keystream Algorithm using the given card sequence:\n\n   Step 1: Move card A (53) down by one position. The new deck is:\n   31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, 54, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n\n   Step 2: Move card B (54) down by two positions. The new deck is:\n   31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 9, 25, 44, **54,** 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n\n   Step 3: Perform a triple cut.\n   5, 50, 9, 46, 23, 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, 31, 24, 14, 8, **33,** 2, 49, 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41\n\n   Step 4: Perform a count cut. The bottom card (4) stays in its place, and we take out the 4 cards from the top of the deck. The new top cards are: 43, 37, 17, 30.\n   8, 33, 2, **49,** 45, 21, 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, **9,** 46, 23, 9, 25, 44, 54, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n\n   Step 5: look at the value of the top card (49). The calculated number of positions below it is 1 (49 mod 26 = 1). The value of the 2nd card corresponds to the decrypted character.\n   Step 6: The corresponding positional value x = z - y (mod 26) = 8 - 1 (mod 26) = 7. As the LETTERS list starts from 0, the letter at position 7 is \"E\".\n\nSo the decrypted character for \"X\" is \"E\". Thus, the ciphertext \"X\" gets decrypted to \"E\".",

Rotate the inner_disk 5 characters to the right; new inner_disk: \"SJHFDGABCknMQWVYXZ\".\n\n- Now we encrypt the remaining plaintext (since periodicity is 3, we need two more characters): \"\". For now, we just store the first empty character as a placeholder. Encryption Steps (with placeholder):\n  - Placeholder character position on the outer_disk: 0, placement on inner_disk: 0.\n  - After encrypting the first character, rotate the inner_disk by the given increment of 5: new inner_disk: \"BCONLYXWVZjhgfadipqrstku\". Since we don't have a second character in the plaintext yet, we will use the placeholder as the second character, but don't worry, this will be swapped with the real second character when it is provided.\n\n- Now let's introduce a second character. Let's assume the second character is 'V'.\n  - Find its position in the outer_disk: 'V' is at index 22 (QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL has the 22nd character as 'V').\n  - Now find its corresponding character on the current inner_disk: 'B' at index 2.\n  - We have now encrypted \"UV\"\n  - To rotate the inner_disk again, we continue from where we left off, rotating the inner_disk by increment value: new inner_disk: \"AOFNPEDQrmLTzyXWVzkjhgfadiSQ\".\n- In this case, there are no more characters to encrypt, and the resulting ciphertext for \"UV\" is: [[I, B]].",

Adding 6 (\\x00) characters results in a 8-byte string \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNow let's follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. Padding: \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\"\n2. Block Splitting: The plaintext has been split into 1 block of 8 bytes.\n3. Block Encryption:\n    - Convert Block to Bytes: blocked as ['46', '57'] (using ASCII encoding)\n    - XOR with Key: [(0b100100 + 0b00110100) for b in KEY] = [11101010, 01111010]\n    - Substitute:\n        0b11101010 (190 in decimal) corresponds to 0xCF in hex and uses S_BOX to get 0x09.\n        0b01111010 (166 in decimal) corresponds to 0xAE in hex and uses S_BOX to get 0x01.\n    - Permute: Permute the resulting bytes as (0x09 >> 1) = 0x04 and (0x01 >> 1) = 0x00.\n    - XOR with Key: [(0b00110100 + 0b00101000) for b in KEY] = [01110000, 01101000]\n    - Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted bytes into their hexadecimal equivalent: '40' and '82'.\n4. Concatenate: Concatenate all the encrypted hexadecimal values: '4082'.\n\nFinally, the encrypted answer is: [[4082]]",

Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 8-byte blocks. In this case, there's only one 8-byte block, so we have just one block (ciphertext split into bytes: [0x9A, 0x89, 0x99, 0x86, 0x93, 0x8C, 0x97, 0x84]).\n\n2. Converting Hex to Bytes and XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\nAfter performing XOR operations, we get the encrypted, but key-transposed block: [0xB5, 0x7D, 0x8D, 0x74, 0x8B, 0x6C, 0x7B, 0x64].\n\n3. Inverse Permutation: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\nAfter applying inverse permutation, we get the following modified block: [0xB4, 0x75, 0x8E, 0x75, 0x89, 0x6D, 0x7A, 0x65].\n\n4. Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\nAfter performing substitution using INV_S_BOX, we get the following block: [0x13, 0x0D, 0x02, 0x01, 0x0B, 0x05, 0x0A, 0x09].\n\n5. XOR with Key and Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\nAfter applying XOR with the key and performing ASCII decoding, we get the decrypted block \"CHAINS\".\n\n6. Remove Padding and Concatenate: Since the provided ciphertext doesn't need padding removal, we can directly concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext. In this case, the final plaintext is \"CHAINS\". That's why the answer is encapsulated in double square brackets as [[CHAINS]].",

Padding: The plaintext \"VNSEFNGHKUY\" has a length of 9, which is not a multiple of 8 bytes. So, it needs to be padded with null characters (padding = '\\x00'). The padded plaintext would be \"VNSEFNGHKUY\\x00\\x00\".\n3. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. There will be 2 blocks, each of length 8.\n\nBlock 1: VNSEF\nBlock 2: NGHKUY\\x00 (The padding character is included)\n\n4. Block Encryption: Each block is processed independently.\n\n- Block 1 ->\n\t- Convert Block to Bytes: ASCII encoding of 'V' is 86, 'N' is 78, 'S' is 83, 'E' is 69, 'F' is 70. So, the byte array for Block 1 is `b'524e5345'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key gives us `b'64485c4f50455154'`.\n\t- Substitute: High 4 bits and low 4 bits for each byte are replaced using the S_BOX: `b'3c67fe9c'`.\n\t- Permute: Each byte left-rotated by 1 bit gives us `b'84253761'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again gives us `b'7323653c6e'`.\n\t- Hexadecimal Encoding: Converting these bytes to a hexadecimal string gives us '4EF3C694'.\n\n- Block 2 ->\n\t- Convert Block to Bytes: ASCII encoding of 'N' is 78, 'G' is 71, 'H' is 72, 'K' is 75, 'U' is 75, 'Y' is 79, padding character '\\x00' has ASCII value 0. So, the byte array for Block 2 is `b'4e47484b4b497900'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key gives us `b'6039563a503156563c'`.\n\t- Substitute: High 4 bits and low 4 bits for each byte are replaced using the S_BOX: `b'df35c6f8d'`.\n\t- Permute: Each byte left-rotated by 1 bit gives us `b'9b6f3b78'`.\n\t- XOR with Key: Applying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again gives us `b'51294e1370'`.\n\t- Hexadecimal Encoding: Converting these bytes to a hexadecimal string gives us '6801DF35'.\n\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext: '4EF3C694' + '6801DF35' = '4EF3C6946801DF35'\n\n6.
