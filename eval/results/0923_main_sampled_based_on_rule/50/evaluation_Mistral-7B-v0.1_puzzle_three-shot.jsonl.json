Please note: You only need to return the first part of the word, not the second part, for example for the list \"oath keep\", the answer it \"oat\", and not \"oathe\"\nPlease provide your answer in the same order of the words, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[word1 word2 ...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[bug teare foliage]]\n\n### Question:\nyou are given a square matrix with sides n. If there is a continuous path from top left to bottom right, and you cannot step back onto a former square, please print the word \"true\" and the matrix in order of the base address. otherwise print \"false\"\nThe layout of the matrix represents the column first, then the row. Simply fill in the matrix with the same value as the matrix address, for example: the matrix address  \"0 1 3 4 2 5 6\" should be filled in by \"0134256\".\nFor example: in the description above, the matrixs base address is translated into:\n1. 0134256\n2. 0113456\n3. 0121456\n4. 0023457\n5. 0613425\n6. 0673425\n\n### Answer:\n[[false 0134256 0113456 0121456 0023457 0613425 0673425]]\n\n\n### Question:\nProcessed String: \"5210TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the maximum value of that semantic as final result and add however many reinforces they each have.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. numbers saved by digit\n2. numbers increase: increase into 4 to 1 times\n3. numbers decrease: decrease into 1 to 4 times\n(See special treatment for semantic of 1 to 4 times)\n\n### Answer:\n1. The dice will roll first before the cards placed, dice roll returns 4,  this is a exactly known condition.\n2. Since dice is a exact result, reinforces added and answer need not to be calculated, so answer will be 4 times the total reinforce added, so answer is 16.\n\n### Question:\n[Processed String] \"2200RESET122101000TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the sum of that semantic as final result and add 2 times the number of dice added.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. To increase into 4 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 4 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n2. To increase into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n3. To decrease into 12 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 12 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n4. To decrease into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n5. To decrease into 18 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 18 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n6. To decrease into 100 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 100 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n7. To increase into 5 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 5 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n8. To increase into 10 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number between\n    the semantic after multiplied by 10 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 10 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n9. To increase into 100 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number\n    between the semantic after multiplied by 100 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 100 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n\n### Answer:\n2. Since the reinforces is sumed up and the value of the semantic is no count for extra base on this question, we need to consider the \"test\" word, which will change the links between link nodes by the hammer just as above.\n3. Since aside from \"test\" the value of the semantic and reinforces are considered first, so \"test\" will not alter the resulting answer.",

It accepts two arguments: rules (`rules.txt`) and query (`query.txt`).\n\nThe code that uses handleRules expects that you have defined a handleRules function.\nTo add file `handleRules.ts` with the following code:\n\n```\nconst rules = fs.readFileSync('rules.txt', 'utf8')\nconst query = fs.readFileSync('query.txt', 'utf8')\n\nconst cipher = require('./cipher.js');\n\n// Define your answerFromRules function here\nfunction handleRules(rules: string, query: string) {\n  const space = rules.includes(':') ? rules.split(':')[1].trim() : false;\n  const riddle = rules.trim();\n  const [instructions, riddle] = riddle.split(' ');\n  console.log('parts: ', instructions, riddle);\n  const parts = instructions.split(':');\n  console.log('parts: ', parts);\n  const [\n    wordOrPhrase,\n    rearrangeLetters,\n    formWord,\n    requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n    assumptions\n  ] = riddle.split('\\n');\n  console.log('expected instructions: ', requirementForTheNumberOfLetters);\n  let solution = '';\n\n  if (!rules.startsWith('Special')) {\n    solution = solveCommand(rules, query);\n  } else {\n    console.log('rules: ', rules);\n    const answer = cipher.edit(['Neither'], cipher.decrypt(rules, space));\n    console.log('answer: ', answer);\n    solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n    console.log('solution: ', solution);\n  }\n  return {\n    instruction: instructions,\n    solution: solution.toUpperCase() || ' ',\n  };\n}\n\nexport default handleRules;\n\n\nfunction replaceAll(substitute, source) {\n  console.log('condition: ', substitute.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < substitute.length; i++) {\n    source = source.replace(substitute[i], substitute[i].toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return source;\n}\n\nfunction solveCommand(rules, query) {\n  let answer = '';\n  // let solution = '';\n  console.log('second: ', rules, query);\n\n  if (rules.includes('use')) {\n    console.log('use: ', rules);\n    console.log('query: ', query);\n    console.log('all letters: ', repeat(1).join(''));\n    console.log('split letter: ', repeat(1).join(','));\n\n    switch (true) {\n      case rules.startsWith('Spell'):\n      case rules.startsWith('Rearranges'):\n      case rules.startsWith('For the': true): // `For the` could be `For the letters`.\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'required',\n          rules\n            .split(':'[1])\n            .join('')\n            .trim()\n            .toUpperCase(),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[1].trim().toUpperCase().substr(0, 10),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[2].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[4].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[5].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n        ]);\n        solveCommand(answer, query);\n        console.log('querySolve: ', query);\n        query.forEach((query) => {\n          // const toInteger = /\\d/\n          const result = query.toUpperCase().split(/(\\:|\\-)/).map((word) => word.trim());\n          console.log('result: ', result);\n          if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'please') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'pleaseuse') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          }\n        });\n        break;\n      case rules.includes('correctly answer: '): // Yoda never uses \"only\", \"include\", and \"true\".\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'replace',\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().substr(2).replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n",

For all adjacent squares(one square can also be a diagonal or vertical square) you can get the following 8 expressions:\n            M+(N&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            A+(M&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            N+(L&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M))\n            E+(C&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (M+S))\n            L+(I&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (O&amp;amp;&amp;amp;K))\n            C+(E&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A+S))\n            I+(J&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (C+O))\n            O+(K&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (IC))\n          Like:\n          M:&nbsp;top&nbsp;left\n          N:&nbsp;top\n          E:&nbsp;left\n          L:&nbsp;right\n          A:&nbsp;top&nbsp;right\n          I:&nbsp;right{中文字成}\n          O:&nbsp;bottom{中文字成}\n          C:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;left\n          S:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;right\n          J or K:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;middle\n\n--Stage III. All of the preceding expressions would be added together, and then divide by 8 as you want; In this process , you must make up some definitions:\n            A---any number not bigger than 8\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n           C2---1+2+3+4+-+-+-|6+7+8+9|5+6+7+8|4+5+6+7\n           C3---6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10|8+9+10+11+12+13\n\n\n            B--&lt;7C1+8C1&gt;|&lt;7C2+8C2&gt;|&lt;7C3+8C3&gt;\n      Like here:\n             a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\n\n--Stage IV. With each candidate (M&amp;amp;&amp;amp;N, A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M, N&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L,  and so forth), use all of the remaining eight local equations to yield nine distinct expressions.\n--Stage V. Out of these 9 equations multiply the right hand and left hand of each equation by any number between 1 and 6, inclusive, and be careful you don&#39;t pick some numbers similar when you multiply 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and so on.\n--Stage VI. The formula that you get is the final expression of your work.\n\n<strong>For example:</strong>\n\n--Stage I\n\n\n\n   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n6  |  7   |  8   |  9   |  10 |\n1  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14 |\n   |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |\n\n--renote:in this example 1 sit in up-left.2 sitin up-right\n\n--Stage II\n\n   |  Stage II    |\n:--|:--|\nM&amp;N&amp;L ---  M+(((N&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nA&amp;M&amp;L ---  M+(((A&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nN&amp;L&amp;E ---  N+(((L&amp;E)/N)+(E&amp;N))\nE&amp;C&amp;M ---  E+((L&amp;M)/(M+S))\nL&amp;I&amp;O ---  L+((O&amp;K)/(A+S))\nC&amp;E&amp;A ---  C+((E&amp;A)/(E+C))\nI&amp;J&amp;O ---  I+((J&amp;O)/(I+J))\nO&amp;K&amp;IC ---  O+(((K&amp;IC)/(C+O))/2)\n\n--Stage III\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n             1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8\n           C2:    1+2+3+4+-+-+-|-+-+-|-+-+-\n\n           C3:           6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14|8+9+10+11+12+13|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14\n\n\n         a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\na+((7c1+9c1)+(3c1+8c1))+(q1+l2+(2182178)/(12131213))++q2\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n--Stage IV\n\n                                 M&amp;M&amp;L ---------  M+(((M&amp;L)/M)+(L&amp;M))\n              AA--- M+((A&amp;M)/M) ------- M+((A&amp;M)/(A&amp;M))\n              NN--- N+((N&amp;L)/M) ------- N+((M&amp;L)/(N&amp;L))\n              LL--- L+((E&amp;L)/N) ------- L+((M&amp;E)/(N&amp;L))\n              EC--- E+((C&amp;M)/(M+S)) ------- E+((M&amp;E)/(M+S))\n              LK--- L+((O&amp;K)/(A&amp;S))------- L+((M&amp;K)/(N&amp;L))\n              CA--- C+((E&amp;A)/(E&amp;C)) ------- C+((A/N)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;((M&amp;L)/N))\n              IJ--- I+((J&amp;O)/(I&amp;J)) ------- I+((O&amp;K)/(I&amp;J))\n              OC--- O+(((K&amp;C)/(C+O))/2)------- O",

Your task is to fill in the grid with letters according to the given rules.\n\nHere are the rules that need to be followed:\n\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid, and the question is presented in the form of a matrix containing X and 0.\n\n2. The player needs to replace X with letters (fill), and 0 with separators on the grid (separated is not to be filled with letters).\n\n3. Two lists of words are given, across for filling in the words from left to right, and down for filling in the words from top to bottom.\n\n4. During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. However, the letters that cross must match.\n\n5. The question consists of a list of words and a matrix with X and 0 values. The answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped.",
