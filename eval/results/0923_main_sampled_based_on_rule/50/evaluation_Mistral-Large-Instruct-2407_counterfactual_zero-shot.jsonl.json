Exercising** - Similar to the above, this is more of a real-life concept and does not have a direct in-game reference for boosting energy.\n- **C. Unlocking temples** - Unlocking temples provides the Light of Blessing, which increases the maximum health or stamina limit. This directly boosts the player's energy in terms of game mechanics.\n- **D. Gaining the power of the Seven Sages** - This option is not directly mentioned in the story or mechanics provided.
