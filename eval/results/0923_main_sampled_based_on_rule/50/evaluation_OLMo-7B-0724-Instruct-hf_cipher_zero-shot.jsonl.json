We divide \"KD\" into groups of 6 characters, filling the groups with \"#\" if less than 6 characters.

Divide Ciphertext into Chunks:\n- The given ciphertext can be split into the following 8-bit chunks:\n```\n11 01 0 111 111 1 1 1 1 1 11 11 10 1 1 1 1 11 1 0 1 1 101 1 1 10 11 10 1 10 1 1 1 0 11 \n00 01 11 11 10 1 0 1 1 0 10 11 00 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 10 11 10 0 10 1 1 1 0\n```\n2.

The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6. Finally, the decrypted bytes are converted back to text using ASCII encoding and the long string of decrypted text represents the plaintext.\n\nTo decode the given ciphertext accordingly, follow these steps:\n\n1. 4-byte blocks are split from \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n2. XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5. The byte blocks are XORed with the fixed key once more to get the original plaintext as bytes.\n6. Decoded bytes are printed in ASCII encoding.\n7. Padding is removed from the plaintext if necessary.\n8. The concatenated decrypted bytes composing the plaintext is returned.",

Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Converting each block to bytes and applying XOR with the key (KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF').\n   - Using the S_BOX: Replace the high and low 4 bits of each byte before stitching them together and then applying another XOR with the key.
