The result for \"9A899986938C9784\" is `b'\\x9a\\x89\\x99\\x86\\x93\\x8c\\x97\\x84'`.\n   - XOR with Key: XOR the byte block with the key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`. This results in `b'\\x98\\x8a\\x89\\x7a\\x87\\x88\\x8b\\x86'`.\n   - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit. The result is `b'\\x78\\x90\\x98\\xab\\x90\\x88\\x89\\x7b'`.\n   - Substitute: Use the INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in the byte block. The result is `b'\\x03\\x01\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01'`.\n   - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.
