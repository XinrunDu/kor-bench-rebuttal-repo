He will order extra cheese pizza which costs $20 for a whole pie and garlic sticks which are $6 for 12. During the order, he was notified that the oven broke and they could not prepare the garlic sticks and offered no charge pizza rolls that come in dozens. If there are 21 people in the office, how much will lunch cost after a 20% tip and $2 fuel surcharge?\n\nAssistant: First, let's calculate how many pizzas Pablo needs to order. If each person eats 1.5 pieces and there are 21 people, that's 1.5*21 = 31.5 pieces. Since each pizza has 8 pieces, he will need 31.5/8 = 3.938 pizzas. Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 4 pizzas.\n\nThe cost of the pizzas is 4*$20 = $80.\n\nSince the garlic sticks couldn't be prepared, they cost $0.\n\nThe cost of the pizza rolls is also $0 since they were offered for free.\n\nThe subtotal is therefore $80+$0+$0 = $80.\n\nA 20% tip on the subtotal is 0.2*$80 = $16.\n\nAdding the $2 fuel surcharge, the total cost is $80+$16+$2 = $98.\n\nHuman: Why did the chicken cross the road.\nWhy did the chicken cross the road twice?\n\nAssistant: The chicken crossed the road for various reasons, which may vary according to the version of the famous joke. In some versions, the chicken crossed the road simply to \"get to the other side.\" The question why a chicken would cross the road twice might be attributed to the humorous premise that it was looking for its missing item or trying to outwit someone by crossing back and forth. Ultimately, the joke itself is intended to be light-hearted and absurd, and it has taken on numerous variations over time, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific reason.\n\nHuman: Three astronauts who were stranded in space aboard the Skylab 2\n(CNN) -- It's the stuff of nightmares -- being stranded all alone in space with just your crewmates for company and no way home, waiting on a hastily planned rescue.\n\nFor three American astronauts on board Skylab 2, that grim scenario nearly played out in 1973, 40 years ago this May, as NASA scrambled to design, build and launch an emergency space mission to come to their aid.\n\nThe United States' first space station only spent 24 months in orbit -- from 1973-1974 -- yet barfed astronauts, survived a near-disaster at launch, and helped train scientists in observing the sun without the pesky atmosphere getting in the way.\n\nThe three astronauts, Charles Conrad, Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz, were just three weeks into what was supposed to be an 84-day mission when disaster struck.\n\nThe story begins at the launch pad. Skylab was launched and then crewed almost a year before the horrific 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. While not involving human crew, Skylab's maiden launch proved that such accidents can and do happen.\n\nWhen the 110,000-kilogram, 22,700-cubic-meter (730,000-cubic-foot) behemoth launched on May 14, 1973, the final stage of the Saturn rocket failed to disconnect properly at an altitude of 53 kilometers (175,000 feet). \n\nThe astronauts were sent into space just 36 hours later, on a modified Apollo spacecraft mounted atop the very last Saturn rocket.\n\nShortly thereafter, at an altitude of 119 kilometers (390,000 feet), the jettisoning third-stage rocket pierced two delicate solar-panel wings, flipping Skylab end over end, and spewing thousands of pieces of debris that drilled thousands more small holes in the orbiting station.\n\nThe result was a massive temperature inversion -- the sunward-facing side was brought down to -122 degrees Celsius (-187.6 Fahrenheit), while the dark side soared to 221 degrees Celsius (430 Fahrenheit), according to NASA's account.\n\nThis risked killing the three astronauts before they even boarded the orbiting space station, and forced a massive overhaul on the flight plan.\n\nAfter managing to dock with Skylab on their third try -- no mean feat considering the sheer size of the station, and its constantly spinning motion -- the crew entered to find the living quarters and entire structure simply too cold to survive.\n\nThey had to cover windows with makeshift blankets to halt the last of the cold air escaping into space, and activated an electrical heater to try and plan, somewhat bizarrely, a brass band.\n\nThat failed, and the astronauts instead decided to take bungee cords from their spacesuits and create impromptu electrical connections to deliver higher voltage electricity to the heater.\n\nAt this point, NASA realized that even if the trio were able to survive -- and mission control was clinging to hope that one of Skylab's faulty solar panels could still be deployed -- there was no way that they would have enough food, water, or oxygen to make it to day 85.\n\nA rescue mission was ordered. A repair mission, to fix the solar panels and reopen one of the doors, would be tried first, but the short-lived Skylab would have to prepare to house as many as a dozen astronauts for an extended period by the end of the summer.\n\nDespite its size, Skylab was cramped once the three astronauts arrived. The three were also the first people to experience \"space sickness,\" and Conrad, the commander, at one point had to have part of his dinner boiled off upon learning that a fellow astronaut had vomited inside the space station.\n\nIn keeping with the \"What could go wrong, will go wrong\" theme, a vital canister holding waste collected by the astronauts got stuck, meaning that rather than simply chucking the thing out of the open airlock back into space, the astronauts had to manually wrestle the half-ton container free using hand tools and brute force.\n\nSeven days before rescue could possibly have reached them even if it had been launched immediately, the astronauts were finally able to deploy the solar array, reopen the sealed hatch, and even set up a makeshift, two-man gym on the station's \"Round Can.\"\n\nPerhaps the strangest part of NASA's history of human spaceflight, Skylab caught the world's imagination, even serving as the basis for Richard Howard's 1974 suspense film \"Hijack to the Stars.\"\n\nSkylab's legacy is considerable: It served as the basis for Russia's Salyut space stations, as well as the International Space Station, and helped pave the way for future stint on the ISS by astronauts such as Buzz Aldrin.\n\nWrite highlights for this article\n\nAssistant: 1. Skylab 2 astronauts stranded in space due to solar panel failure, leading to a near-disaster.\n2. NASA quickly planned and launched an emergency rescue mission in 1973.\n3. The crew overcame challenges, including extreme temperature inversion, oxygen depletion, and space sickness.\n4. Skylab 2 marked the first time astronauts experienced \"space sickness.\"\n5. The station played a crucial role in advancing human spaceflight, laying the groundwork for subsequent space stations like Salyut and the International Space Station.\n\nHuman: JISENS\n\nJISENS (short for \"Japanese Security Establishment and the National Security Act\") is",

Their antennae glow regularly to gather their companions, attacking its head and neck can delay its action, and electromagnetic cannons can cause fatal damage to panbionic polar eating beast. No effective method to kill polar eating beast currently exists.\nSpinal Gu: Creatures that look like centipedes are extremely gregarious and can also parasitize and control the human body through the human spine. The controlled people are similar to zombies, but unlike the zombies, even if the brain is lost, the spinal cord parasite can still move as long as the spine of the spinal cord that does the parasite still exists. Only by destroying the spinal cord parasite can the control be cut off.\nXanthophyll: Usually appearing in a gaseous state, the spine voodoo will release azimuthin (especially when gathering in groups). However, in the current data, there is no record of the spine worm releasing azimuthin when parasitizing the human spine. These hormones can cause hallucinations in those who inhale too much.\nIts (Megalodon) abilities are similar to those of the two-jawed beast, except that its back is covered with spikes, which seem to have the function of transmitting information.\nThe heavy stereo is a kind of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old world power mecha, with energy and offensive and defensive modules, which is a very rare combat resource for lighthouses. When humans wear it, it's as if they have become \"iron warriors\"!\nThere are also elements with Chinese characteristics, such as the Tai chi cupping suona used when Bai Yuekui fights with the mutated Mark.",

They make clothes and weapons using the ore element.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\nHere is the full story from shorthand pasted in (old system, hope it is readable!):\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe terrain of Pandora is very complex, animals living here usually have six strong feet to move quickly, such as Dire Horse, the Na'vi land mount in Avatar.\nThe atmosphere of Pandora has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which combines with water to make acid rain. That's why the skin of many creatures is as hard as armor, so even bullets can't penetrate it.\nThe temperature environment of Pandora is very similar to that of Earth, and there is already oxygen in the air, but in addition it contains large amounts of xenon, high concentrations of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, so the masks are only used to filter out the toxic gases.\nOne of the wonders on Pandora is the floating Hallelujah Mountains; the mountains are rich in ore and have an extremely strong magnetic field, which hedges with the planet's own magnetic field and creates levitation. \nIlu was long and slender, with flippers and a rudder-like tail, a dark back and a white belly, and different patterns or markings on the back and belly, and a shape that blended snake-necked dragons, dolphins, and spotted seals.\nIn Pandora, humans piloted robots like AMP (Augmented Mobility Combat Armor) for exploration and combat against complex terrain.\nUnobtainium, while superconducting, is super antimagnetic, able to maintain superconducting properties unchanged even when placed in a magnetic field with a strength of 1 billion gauss, which is more than 1,000 times stronger than any other substance in the world).\nThe RDA has built the Rapid Maglev Transportation System to transport large numbers of people hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away to work or live in a very short period of time.\nPandora is one of the planets in Alpha Centauri, which is a triple star system that has three stars, all with high surface temperatures. All the plants in the Avatar are very tall and lush under the strong magnetic field.\nWith the development of human technology, humans have created the technology of mental contact, which is a technology of transferring consciousness by connecting a human's brain to an avatar's body. People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning. Your task is to carefully analyze the provided story, which includes specific rules and details, and use this information to accurately answer in one sentence related questions, starting with a \"Which of\" statement and ending with a multiple choice.

Ensure that your answers are aligned with the story's rules and information.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Ancient Civilization, known as \"bug people,\" has been destroyed due to the overuse of Nightmare Fuel. The Ruins and Ancient Archive contain remnants of their civilization. Maxwell's last act occurred on April 17, 1906. The Year of the Varg event in Don't Starve Together lasts from February 9 to March 16, 2018. Ways to negate Hay Fever include wearing a Gas Mask or Particulate Purifier, eating various tempList of items, and using various tactics like a broken fan or turning on Living Artifact or traveling to other worlds.
