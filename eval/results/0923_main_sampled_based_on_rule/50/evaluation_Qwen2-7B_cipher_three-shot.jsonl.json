For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[OAPALU]]\n\nBelow is an explanation of the cipher operations you need to perform for both encryption and decryption:\n\n1. **Encryption Steps (for the \"Plaintext\" question):**\n   - For each plaintext character `p`:\n     - If `p` is an uppercase letter and exists in the Polybius square:\n       - Replace `p` with the number of rows and columns (both counted from 1) in which the character appears.\n     - In particular, O, which does not exist in the Polybius square, is replaced by 66.\n   - This is equivalent to looking up the character in the Polybius square and replacing it with its corresponding code. For example, \"R\" in the Polybius square is replaced with '11', \"W\" is replaced with '22', and \"Q\" is replaced with '43'.\n   - If `p` is not in the Polybius square, it should be replaced with 66. This is done because \"O\" is not in the square. Therefore, \"O\" in the plaintext will be replaced with '66' in the ciphertext.\n   - As for the special case of \"N\", which is in the Polybius square, it will be replaced by '51' in the ciphertext.\n\nExample: Plaintext is \"North\". The corresponding ciphertext will be: \"14325234345343415553451425134314243243343115142\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps (for the \"Ciphertext\" question):**\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc in the given ciphertext:\n     - Based on the rows and columns denoted by CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid.\n     - If CrCc=66, replace with \"O\". This means that any occurrence of \"66\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"O\" in the plaintext.\n   - This is the reverse operation of encryption. In other words, you need to look up the corresponding character in the Polybius square for each pair of numbers and construct the plaintext.\n\nExample: Ciphertext is \"36634441131153143612\". The corresponding plaintext is \"OAPALU\".",

By this I am referring to x you have found it at index a then u have found it at ind ab then because ya already have it at index a ya need index ac for it, to signify to the reader about what matches what.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to encryptedKeyword which is the keyword 1 index higher than the original keyword.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Iterate through Plaintext (Pt), for each unique character}\n        - Save those indices into Indices.\n        - Replace it with the encryptedVersion of it.\n        - Check if encryptedVersion index is 0 if yes, increment it.\n        - merge index and character into the encrypted keyword\n        - append it to cipher text\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Keyword: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - The keyword must be 1 index lower than the encryptedKeyword.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to plainKeyword which is the keyword 1 index lower than that given keyword.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to indices which are the indices dictionary of the characters in the encrypted keyword.\n    - If the keyword contains a character lower than A, return an error message.\n\n    For each character in the ciphertext:\n    - find it and apply to indices.\n    - break it apart to character and index.\n    - Subtract the index and every time the index goes down by 2 substitute it with the remembered plainKeyword.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: SUPPRESS\nKeyword: oOoOooo\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n1. **Decryption Steps** (since this is an encryption rule, let's go with decryption):\n    - Division into halves: \"SD\" becomes (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one from the lower half: (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Decryption binary: (\"S\", \"D\")\n    - Position in encrypted character set (0-6): \"A\" (0), \"G\" (6)\n    - Encrypted binary: (A, G)\n    - Read rows, then columns: \"AG\"\n    - Apply 6x6 matrix: \"DD\"\n    Thus, the encrypted form of \"SD\" is [[DD]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[DD]]",

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Explanation:\nThe plaintext is \"ABKM\". We first prepare the transposed sequence list:\n\n```\n[1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n```\n\nWe write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 letters per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $.\n\n```\nA  - - - - - -\n B  - - - - - -\n K  - - - - - -\n M   - - - - -\n```\n\nWe adjust the order of the columns, based on the transposed sequence list:\n\n```\n1 : A   - - - - - -\n 4 : B   - - - - - -\n 0 : K   - - - - - -\n 6 : M   - - - - - -\n 5 :   - - - - - -\n 2 :   - - - - - -\n 3 :   - - - - - -\n```\n\nWe read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.\n\n```\n[AbKKM]\n```\n\nBut, we have to remove the $ signs at the end of the word, so the final encrypted result is:\n\n```\nABKM\n```\n\nThis is the correct encrypted result.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the question. The encrypted result should be \"ABKM\" instead of \"ABKM yan KKM\".\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"DRMQKUGINKCM\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
