This means we need a single digit for I which, when added to 11, results in a number ending in double same digit (LL).\n  - I can't be 0 or 1 (since each must be unique and first digit rules), the next logical choice could be 7 (as it would make the sum 18, which can be the start of a number ending in double 1's when considering carrying over in addition).\n  - Hence, with I=7 and B=1, we have 7+11=18, making the final value 18, not fitting our LLL requirement yet.\n  \nBut a correct mapping would look like: If we consider carrying, we might have:\n- I as 9 (larger numbers are good to create kids beyond single digit in first space),\n- B as 1, leading to BB as 11.\n  - 9 + 11 = 20, this is closer but doesn't fit our ILL pattern directly.\n  - Reevaluating with correct digit patterns for L gives correct figures:\n  - I=8, B=2, then 8 + 22 = 30, still not correct.\n  \nHowever, a correct fit:\n- I=9, B=1, 9 + 11 = 20, doesn't directly fit.\n- Re-working it, a correct unique and logical pattern:\n  - If B=5, BB=55 (I can't be 0 or 5), a number choice that can logically fit unique and given rules:\n  - If I=9, I+55 = 64, not right.\n  \nOn logical re-evaluation ensuring unique and first digit constraints:\n- B=5, BB=65BUTTON MUST FIT, I=8, slightly adjust:\n- I=7, B=6, 7+66=73BUTTON still fitting, checking unique and constraints:\n  \nFinal Fit: A correct unique mapping ensuring:\n- I=7, B=6, results: 7+66 = 73.\n- Correlate final unique fit with rules given.\n\nSo, a correct unique assignment logically fitting all rules given:\n[[I=7,B=6,L=3]]盾确保答案符合所有给定规则。",

The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0.\n\nGiven the equation \"NUMBER + NUMBER = PUZZLE\":\n\n- Since NUMBER is a 6-digit number, N cannot be 0.\n- The result PUZZLE is also a 6-digit number, so P cannot be 0.\n- We can see that P must be 1 because the sum results in a number with an additional digit at the beginning (from carrying the 1).\n\nSince the sum is a 6-digit number and each addition of N to itself results in carrying a 1 to the next column, let's deduce:\n\n- P = 1\n- N must be a digit that when doubled gives a result that needs a carry, suggesting that N is 5 or more but still within 9.\n\nLet's hypothesize with N=9, then:\n- 9 + 9 is 18, meaning carry 1 and 8 in the unit's place.\n- That's how P is 1.\n\nStarting the sequence:\n- U = 0 (since no carry enters from L to U)\n- M = 1 (having a carry from R to M, and the pattern for a double number means we could carry and add another 1 to the previous number)\n- B = 9 (to align with the two 8s next to it considering the digits hypothesis)\n- R = 4 (to get 9 carrying 1 from L, thus making 4 and carrying 1 since 4 + 4 = 8)\n- L = 5 (to get 0 + 5 + 5 = 10, thus 0 and carry 1)\n\nLet's check this: [[N=9, U=0, M=1, B=9, R=4, L=5, P=1, Z=8, E=0]]\n\nThe next step is double-checking, but based on the step analysis, this seems correct:\n\n901945 + 901945 = 1803890, thus [[N=9, U=0, M=1, B=9, R=4, L=5, P=1, Z=8, E=0]].",

The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n2. Mandy used the sugar-free diet.\n3. The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nGiven:\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n- Mandy used the sugar-free diet and hence lost more than the person on the caveman diet by 4 lbs.\n- Eula is either on the gluten-free or caveman diet.\n\nNow, let's piece together the puzzle:\n- If Barbara lost 7 lbs, Barbara is not on any specific diet mentioned yet.\n- Since Mandy used the sugar-free diet, and we need to differentiate the cavity diet from this, we consider another person using the caveman diet. According to clue 1 and 2, the sugar-free diet user (Mandy) lost 4 more lbs than the caveman diet user. Thus, if we assume Barbara is not using the caveman diet (since she already lost 7 lbs), then the caveman diet user lost less than 7 lbs.\n- From clue 3, the caveman diet user lost more than Eula. So Eula must have lost less than the caveman diet user, meaning Eula lost less than 7 lbs.\n- Clue 3 also indicates Eula either used the gluten-free diet or the caveman diet. Since we established that the caveman diet user lost more than Eula, Eula must be on the gluten-free diet.\n- Therefore, Barbara is not using any of the mentioned diets (sugar-free, caveman, or gluten-free).\n\nGiven these deductions:\n1. Let's assume the caveman diet user lost 3 lbs. Then Mandy, who used the sugar-free diet, lost 4 + 3 = 7 lbs.\n2. Barbara lost 7 lbs and can be seen as an independent factor (not on sugar-free, caveman, or gluten-free diet).\n3. Eula, therefore, must have lost less than 3 lbs (since caveman diet's user lost more) and used the gluten-free diet.\n\nTherefore, the data is:\n- 3 lbs: Caveman user (not Eula or Mandy) \n- 7 lbs: Mandy (Sugar-free diet) \n- 7 lbs: Barbara (not on diet) \n- Less than 3 lbs for Eula, let's consider it as 0 since she's below 3lbs and gluten-free diet user.\n\nPutting this into the required format:\n[[3 CavemanUser Caveman, 5 , Mandy SugarFree, 7 Barbara , 9 Eula GlutenFree]]\n\nHowever, the number 5 and 9 lbs need clarification as they don’t directly match the given clues in clear terms. Our logical assumption for Eula is 0 lbs (less than 3 lbs), but the constraints don’t allow for 0 lbs in the set. Thus we could consider the following:\n- Eula lost 0 lbs, in actual, doesn't conflict with the rules if treated carefully.\n\nThe format demands specific numeric sequences, accurately placed data based on the clue:\n[[3 CavemanUser Caveman, 5 Mandy SugarFree, 7 Barbara , 9 Eula GlutenFree]]\n\n*Note: Within the context of logical deduction, Caveman user of 3 lbs and not corrected to name as Mandy and Barbara's classifications already became clear and fixed. Eula fitting to to lesser than 3 fitting to 0 fits logically, but the requested output needs specific numeric sequences.*",

We need 6 more to reach 28. So, X = 6.\n\n- **Second Row:** X  X  2  10  24\n  The sum is 24. Already have 2 + 10 = 12, need 12 more.

We can't use these numbers to fill the spaces in the matrix since those are the sums for the last column. We should find a different set of numbers.\n\nTo find the correct numbers, it's important to analyze the possible range that can achieve these sums without repeating any number. Given that there are 7 boxes on the side and three rows with different sums, we'll need 21 distinct numbers. Assuming the standard range of possible numbers to use for this puzzle could be from 1 to 9, with extensions to larger ranges as required, let's examine the sums to get an idea of the numbers that might fill these spaces.\n\nThe large sums suggest that we need higher numbers to fit them. Let's assume we use a set of numbers that can combine uniquely to form 77, 28, and 126. One such set is 1 to 9, with extensions to higher ranges as needed.\n\n### Step 1: Trying to use the lowest possible numbers to fill in while aiming to address the higher sums with higher numbers.\n\nGiven the large sum of 126, we need relatively larger numbers for this row since the 126 requires numbers that add up to a large sum. 77 is also significant but not as large as 126. The smallest sum, 28, can be achieved with smaller numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Filling in the grid\n\nLet's attempt to fill in the grid with reasonable guesses and check their sums.\n\n- For 126: To achieve this, we may use higher numbers, e.g. 23, 25, 25, 24, 15, 13, 1.\n- For 77: Numbers summing up to 77 could be 19, 19, 18, 17, 17, 15, 2.\n- For 28: Smaller numbers more easily make up this sum, e.g. 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2.\n\nNote: The numbers 25,15,15,13,17,17,7 (added for the purpose of processing); the process here is an approximation; actual numbers will vary due to the requirement of using distinct numbers.\n\nApplying this process to our puzzle, an answer would look something like:\n\n[[19 19 18 17 17 15 2, 5 5 5 5 3 3 2, 23 25 25 24 15 13 1]]\n\nThis is one potential solution, but the precise values would be determined through systematic trial and error or an algorithm specifically coded to fill such matrices while ensuring the inclusion of unique numbers that achieve the given sums.

To achieve a sum of 6 with the given constraints, placing '1' in positions 1 and 4 would be the simplest: [1, 0, 0, 1].\n\nChecking the sums to the right:\n- For the first column, the sum is 5 (from 1 + 0 + 0 + 1). So, it's correct.\n- For the second column, the sum is 1 (from 0 + 1 + 0 + 0), but we aimed for 4. However, given the constraints and to fit all elements, we realize the third row entry should be modified.\n- For the third column, the sum is 4 (from 0 + 0 + 1 + 0), which fits.\n- For the fourth column, the sum is 2 (from 0 + 1 + 0 + 1).\n\nMaking corrections and adjustments:\n- Adjust to [1, 0, 0, 0]\n- [0, 0, 0, 1]\n- [0, 1, 1, 0]\n- [1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nResult:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nAnswer представлен в согласии с требованиями задачи:\n[[1 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 1 , 0 1 1 0 , 1 0 0 1]]",

The weights can range from 1 to 5. To make 13, the best combination in the first row might be 5 (position 5), 4 (position 4), and 4 (either position 4 or 3).\n   - The second row needs only 3. A single 3 at position 3 suffices.\n   - The third row needs 14, which suggests a high weight usage, possibly 5, 5, and 4.\n   - The fourth row needs 13, akin to the first row but potentially different due to column restrictions.\n   - The last row needs 12, which might be a combination of 5, 4, and 3.\n\n2. **Column Analysis**:\n   - The first column needs 5, which can be easily achieved by either a 5 in position 5 or cumulative lower weights.\n   - The second column must total 3, indicating the placement of a 3 in one of the rows.\n   - The third column needs 15, a considerable total potentially with a heavy weight usage.\n   - The fourth and fifth columns both total 13, requiring balanced weight distribution similar to our row analysis.\n\n3. **Combining Row and Column Constraints**:\n   - Given complexities, the placement of higher weights (like 5s) needs careful consideration across intersection points.\n   - After careful consideration of positions to satisfy both row and column constraints, let's attempt following placements:\n     - Row 1: 0 0 0 1 1\n     - Row 2: 0 1 0 0 0\n     - Row 3: 1 0 1 1 0\n     - Row 4: 0 1 1 0 1\n     - Row 5: 1 0 1 0 0\n\n### Final Answer:\nUsing the above logic, the final configuration of the grid will be:\n[[0 0 0 1 1, 0 1 0 0 0, 1 0 1 1 0, 0 1 1 0 1, 1 0 1 0 0]]",

Remember, the weight of a cell in column i or row j is equal to its position in that column or row.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the constraints for rows:\n\n1. The first row should sum to 5 with a maximum weight of 6 (since there are 6 columns).\n2. The second row should sum to 17, and so on for each row.\n\nAnd for the columns:\n1. The first column should sum to 14.\n2. The second column should sum to 10, and so on.\n\nGiven the positions and weights, let's find a solution:\n\n- Let's consider filling each row to achieve the required sum:\n  - 1st row needs to sum to 5. Possible: 0 1 0 0 0 4 (1+4=5).\n  - 2nd row needs to sum to 17. Possible: 4 2 1 0 6 4 (4+2+1+6+4=17).\n  - 3rd row needs to sum to 9.

We then continue placing the numbers such that the sequence continuity is maintained according to the given X's and numbers.\n\nFollowing this method, here’s the solved grid:\n```\n43 44 41 42 39 40 37 38 31\n48 45 46 47 49 50 51 33 32 \n55 54 X  X  X  X  X  X  29\n56 57 52  X  X  X  X  27 28\n61 60 59 58  X  X  X  X  17\n62 81 80 79 78 77 76 13 14\n63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 15\n66 67 68 75 74 73 9  8  3 \n65 53 71 72 73 74 7 10  5\n```\nBut notice 66 is repeated and other missing numbers, so we correct them as follows:\n```\n43 44 41 42 39 40 37 38 31\n48 45 46 47 49 50 51 33 32 \n55 54 53 52 43 42 37 36 29\n60 57 62 63 59 58 35 27 28\n61 60 59 58 55 54 53 52 17\n62 81 80 79 78 77 76 13 14\n63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 15\n72 67 74 75 73 9  8  3  2 \n65 53 71 72 73 74 7  6  5\n```\nCorrected:\n```\n43 44 41 42 39 40 37 38 31\n46 45 47 48 49 50 51 33 32 \n53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 29\n62 57 63 64 58 69 36 27 28\n61 60 59 62 63 65 66 67 17\n62 81 80 79 78 77 76 13 14\n71 64 65 70 67 68 69 70 15\n72 67 74 75 73 9  8  3  2 \n73 51 71 72 73 74 7  6  5\n```\nThe final solution sequence from the filled-in grid is:\n[[43 44 41 42 39 40 37 38 31, 48 45 46 47 49 50 51 33 32, 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 29, 62 57 63 64 58 69 36 27 28, 61 60 59 62 63 65 66 67 17, 62 81 80 79 78 77 76 13 14, 71 64 65 70 67 68 69 70 15, 72 67 74 75 73 9  8  3  2, 73 51 71 72 73 74 7  6  5]]",

Therefore, we place a wall (A) around it, but we cannot create a 2x2 wall block as per rule 6. Hence the wall is placed ensuring every square forms its own valid island or connects in a valid manner.\n\n2. **Island with '3'**:\n   - Similarly, it should have an island consisting of 3 squares. We ensure it is separated from other numbers and also avoid creating any invalid wall patterns.\n\n3. **Island with '2'**:\n   - This number requires an island of 2 squares. It will be surrounded by walls maintaining the rules and ensuring the solution's integrity.\n\n4. **Ensuring Validity**:\n   - Grids are constructed to ensure every number has its own block of the size indicated and no 2x2 wall formations are made.

This means that out of the 8 squares around it, 3 are mines. The square directly below it and the two squares below it and to the right (3, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5) cannot be mines because the only two squares they share with the '3' are already accounted for by the '2' and not filled yet. So, we have at (2, 4) one potential mine.\n\n- We see a '3' at (2, 3). This means that out of the 8 squares around it, 3 are mines. The square above it and the square to the left of it can't be mines, so the mines are (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4).\n\n- We see a '3' at (3, 3). This tells us that out of the 8 surrounding squares, 3 are mines. Since the squares (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) aren't possible based on other numbers, the mines must be (2, 4) (already identified), (3, 4), and (4, 3).\n\n- Similarly, the '3's at (3, 4) and (3, 5) need to be approached carefully considering the proximity of other numbers.\n\n- For '2's, we assume potential mines based on unoccupied surrounding spaces that don't contradict the number of mines around other numbered squares.\n\n### Step 2: Adjust for Overlaps and Confirmations\n\n- Marking all potential mines, we align them to ensure no additional number requirements are violated. The '1' at (1, 1) and (4, 1) constrains adjacent mine placements.\n\n### Final Grid After Adjustments and Analysis:\n\n```\nX A X A X\nA X A X X\n1 2 A A 2\nX X A A 2\n1 X A X X\n```\n\nWrapping the final answer:\n\n[[X A X A X,\nA X A X X,\n1 2 A A 2,\nX X A A 2,\n1 X A X X]]",

The \"1\" in the first row indicates there's exactly one mine in the eight adjacent squares. Since the square marked with \"1\" has mines above it and to its left or right, we can deduce:\n\n    - The mine around this \"1\" can logically be placed at (1, 1) or (1, 3).\n\n2. The \"2\"s in the second row suggest they have two mines each in their adjacent squares. This implies:\n    - There must be a mine directly above the left \"2\", i.e., (0, 1), because that \"2\" cannot have mines at (0, 0) and (0, 2) due to the adjacent 3 needing more mines.\n    - The space with \"A\" logically is then also at (1, 1).\n\n3. The \"3\" in the 2nd row, 2nd column needs three adjacent mines, implying a mine must be at (3, 2).\n   - This indicates (1, 2) and (3, 2) must be mines, underlying the third \"2\" in that row as well.\n\nTranslate these findings into the grid:\n```\nA   X   X   1   X\nX   2   2   A   X\n2   3   A   A   2\n1   A   2   A   X\nX   X   X   1   X\n```\n\nNow, as we are required to use \"A\" for the mines, let's replace the positions with \"A\" according to our analysis:\n[[A X X 1 X,\nX 2 2 A X,\n2 3 A A 2,\n1 A 2 A X,\nX X X 1 X]]\n\nHowever, remember all necessary A placements were already shown throughout the steps thus it appears the grid was complete after logical placement verification:\n[[A X X 1 X,\nX 2 2 A X,\n2 3 A A 2,\n1 A 2 A X,\nX X X 1 X]]",

The '1' on the right might help here but let's keep it flexible for our first pass.\n  \n- The first '1' in the first row (preceded by an X and followed by a 2) must have the mine on its right since the space on the left of the '1' can potentially belong to '2' or any other number's mine count.\n\n- The '2' in the first row needs two mines around it; its right and left edges can accommodate them, considering the '1' next to it taking one of those two.\n\n- The '3' in the second row needs three mines around it.

The 'A' aligns with the vertical 'A' in 'ARE', meaning the across will start with 'E'.\n\nFollowing this:\n```\nE 0 0\nA 0 R\nR E A\n0 0 E\n```\n\nPutting it into proper format:\n```\n[[E 0 0, A 0 R, R E A, 0 0 E]]\n```\nThis matches the rule, fills all 'X' positions with characters from the given word list, ensuring that across and down words cross correctly at shared letters and starting from 'E' for the across in the only possible configuration given the letters and intersections.",

We can't have the same skyscraper height in any row or column.\n3.

This involves filling in skyscraper heights so that the numbers on the sides of the grid accurately represent how many skyscrapers are visible from that vantage point. Remember, taller buildings block shorter ones behind them.\n\nUnderstanding the numbers:\n- The '2' to the left of the third row means that when viewed from the left, two buildings are visible.\n- The '4' above the second column means when viewed from above, all four buildings are visible, implying the buildings increase in height downwards in this column.\n- The '1' on the right side of the first row means only the tallest building (here, 4) is visible if viewed from the right.\n- The '2' above the fourth column means only two buildings are visible if viewed from above, meaning a shorter building must be in the way.\n\nApplying these principles:\n\n1. The fourth column must start with the tallest building (4) since only two are visible from the top. Given all numbers have to be unique in a row and column, the only position is the first row, fourth column (1,4) = 4.\n2. The second column must go from the smallest to the largest number (1 to 4) since all are visible.\n3. The first row has a 1 as the rightmost visible skyscraper, cluing us that 4 must be in the fourth column (as decided) and then we distribute other numbers so that 1 points to 2 or 3.\n4. The third row having a '2' visibility hint left means it needs a tall building at the start with no building taller next to it, guiding the placement of the taller number like 4 or 3 at the start of this row.\n\nUsing these insights, we can construct the grid step by step and ensure no duplicate heights in any row or column:\n\n```\n[ 2 3 4 1,\n  4 1 2 3,\n  1 4 3 2,\n  3 2 1 4]\n```\n\nThus, the solution based on these rules and logical placements is:\n\n```\n[[2 3 4 1, 4 1 2 3, 1 4 3 2, 3 2 1 4]]\n```",

The numbers above and below the grid indicate the count of skyscrapers visible from that direction, considering that a taller building blocks the view of shorter ones behind it.\n\n1. **First Column (Left to Right):** To see 4 buildings from the left, they must be in increasing order of height from left to right, meaning the first column should look like 1, 2, 3, 4. Checking this against the bottom number on the left (which is 4), and the column heights to the side, this direction is correct.\n\n2. **Second Column (Left to Right):** To see 1 building from the left, it means the tallest building has to be the first one (as it blocks the view of any that follow). Thus, the heights from top to bottom could be 4, 1, 2, 3 (a mix-up of heights ensuring no repeat in either row or column).\n\n3. **Third Column (Left to Right):** To see 3 buildings, we need a pattern that allows three different heights to be visible. So, the pattern could be 1, 3, 2, 4 (rearranged without conflicts).\n\n4. **Fourth Column (Left to Right):** To see 2 buildings from the left, the pattern must also ensure 2 are visible; one must be smaller, followed by a taller one blocking others. So, the heights can be 2, 4, 1, 3 (again without repeat per row/column).\n\nNow let's construct the solution based on these configurations:\n1. **First row** (to show 3 buildings): starts with the lowest (1), ensuring a view for the next 3 heights (1, 2, 3, 4).\n2. **Second row** (to show 2 buildings): first must be tallest (4), then 1, followed by mix-ups (4, 1, 3, 2).\n3. **Third row** (to show 1 buildings): tallest first, ensuring the view is blocked early (4).\n4. **Fourth row** (to show 2 buildings): first must be shortest to allow two unique sights (2).\n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n1 2 3 4\n4 1 2 3\n2 3 1 4\n3 4 2 1\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```\n[[1 2 3 4, 4 1 2 3, 2 3 1 4, 3 4 2 1]]\n```",
