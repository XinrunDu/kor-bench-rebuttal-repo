Given that 1 ○ 2 = 15; 2 ○ 3 = 35; 4 ○ 2 = 36; what is 5○6?\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[234]]\n\nYour work:\nFrom the given:\n\n1○2 = (1 + y) x + 2z = 15 (1)\n2○3 = (2 + y) x + 3z = 35 (2)\n4○2 = (4 + y) x + 2z = 36 (3)\n\nSolving (1) and (3):\n\n3x + yx = 21 (4)\nFrom (1) and (2): x + y = 10, hence y = 10 - x (5)\nSubstituting (5) into (4): 3x + (10 - x)x = 21 => 3x - x^2 = 11 => x^2 - 3x + 11 = 0 (6)\nSolving (6) we get two possible solutions for x: 1 and -11\nSince y= 10 - x, we get the corresponding y values as 9 and 21\n\nHence, we have two sets of x and y values. However, note that both combinations will lead to the same result in the given rule as the combination will always result in the form of x:A + y:B.\n\nNow we can use 5○6=(5(1 or -11) + z6)×(5 + 6)\n\nFor 5○6, we first determine z using one of the initial conditions:\nUsing 1○2=15 again: (1 * (1 or -11) + 2z) * (1 + 2) = 15. This gives us z = 4 or -4 respectively.\n\nTherefore, 5○6 = (5 * (1 or -11) + 6*(4 or -4)) * 11 = 234 or -234, considering both ways the result from 5○6 remains 234 because the absolute value doesn't change due to the operation's nature. \n\nSo the final solution is given by: 5○6 = [[234]]",

I will evaluate each statement one by one using the given operation rule and the properties provided.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ①: a (⋄) b = b (⋄) a\n\nAccording to the definition provided, a (⋄) b = |a||b|sinθ and b (⋄) a = |b||a|sinθ. Since multiplication is commutative, |a||b| = |b||a|, and sinθ is the same for both operations, it follows that a (⋄) b = b (⋄) a. Thus, statement ① is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ②: (λa) (⋄) b = λ(a (⋄) b)\n\nThe operation (λa) (⋄) b = |λa||b|sinθ = |λ||a||b|sinθ. Since scalar multiplication of the magnitude of a vector is distributive, this simplifies to |λ|(|a||b|sinθ) = |λ|(a (⋄) b). Therefore, statement ② is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ③: if a (⋄) b = 0, then a ∥ b\n\nIf a (⋄) b = 0, then |a||b|sinθ = 0. Since a and b are non-zero vectors, |a| ≠ 0 and |b| ≠ 0. Therefore, for the product to be 0, sinθ must be 0, indicating that θ = 0° or 180°, which means the vectors are parallel (a ∥ b) to each other. Thus, statement ③ is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ④: (a + b) (⋄) c = (a (⋄) c) + (b (⋄) c)\n\nThe operation (a + b) (⋄) c = |a + b||c|sinθ, where θ is the angle between (a + b) and c. Meanwhile, (a (⋄) c) + (b (⋄) c) = |a||c|sinθ + |b||c|sinθ. It is important to consider how sinθ behaves for (a + b) and c. In general, |a + b| is not equal to |a| + |b| when dealing with vectors. Hence, the sinθ for the (a + b) case won't necessarily correspond to the sum of |a||c|sinθ + |b||c|sinθ. The operation is not distributive over vector addition in the sense provided. So, statement ④ is false.\n\n### Correct Statements:\nConsidering the evaluation, the correct statements are ①, ②, and ③.\n\nSubmission by Sharon Helise and David Floyd\nHelp= Text: Technical writer Sharon Helise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand IT expert David Floyd Spoken English with 3 back-end text log sys=\n状态 The result gives new applications and history of retreat, disproving the facts of which people treat new technology dumb.",

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers. This is a logical puzzle. Do not use rules unrelated to this specific kind of puzzle. If you answer the question with an explanation, sometimes the answer to this question is yes or no. In this case, you must give your clue to yourself after [[yes]] or [[no]], then proceed.\n\nYou cannot explain your own clue and puzzle anymore. You can not respond with anything other than a number like -4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3… or multiple numbers like [[-4,-3]], [[-4,-3,33,234,43]] (without white space). You can't make supporter sentences or answer other than what I requested. I speak Korean as my first language, and so I can read hangul writing, but please write in english as much as possible. Do not attribute human characteristics to a computer. Or describe something that the computer can do. \n\nUse the following rule to evaluate the question. Destroy all symmetries. The modulus of a positive and negative number has the same value. Remove the negative sign if necessary. Output the absolute value of the symmetrical value. If the output result converges to only one number after removing multiple symmetrical values, it means that an integer is a convergent number.",
