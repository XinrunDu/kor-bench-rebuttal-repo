Input context should include a graph that can be parsed by the program, such as an adjacency matrix of a graph, or a subgraph of another graph.\n\n\"junk\" in the context means any specified subgraph and its surrounding region that is of no interest. In this case the specified subgraph can be specified by group IDs of the vertices within the subgraph (ie, Group ID 101 is the subgraph of interest). The surrounding region can be specified by the hood (neighborhood) target parameter. By default the neighborhood is 2 away from the edges of the specified subgraph: one edge to either side. If target is set to False, there is no neighborhood, only the subgraph specified by the Group ID will be returned.\n\nUse the following format to format the argument parameters.

When asked to the decryption funtions you can take the previous ciphertext and then decript the ciphertext because it is a chain. We do not deterministically know we are at the end of the chain, when refering to one of the previous ciphertexts.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the tuples are recycled.\n    - For each character in the current block:\n        - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current tuple. Then move one tuple position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n        - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n**Decryption Rules**:\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    - 7 Tuples\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the ciphertext is \"LEFEE\", the 0th block is \"LEFE\". (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the tuple used for the current block:\n    Calculate tuple_index = (i // 5) % 7 to select the appropriate tuple from the tuple list. The tuple is used for the conversion of each output character in block i.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the tuple and obtain it by moving one position to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). use the letter at the position after the move as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

Sorry for inventing some fairly silly cryptosystems instead of finding some that were suitable, but those are the ones in my notes.\n\n# Quecrypt (\"Q\")\n\nA paper-and-pencil cipher base on the principles of Vigenère substitution, but with a more complex polynomial-based calculation of individual cipher shifts and identification of cipher-pairs.\n\n## Description\n\n## Description\n\n1. Apply a key shifting algorythm.  \n   If the symbol being encrypted/decrypted is A, shift the pairs according to the rightmost digit of the innermost group when the key is written in groups of 5. If the symbol is B, use the second-rightmost digit in the first group of the key. If it is C: second rightmost digit in the second group, D: third-rightmost digit in the top group, and so on. Then, shift the digits (in the direction LEET when encrypting and HACK when decrypting) using this analog of a Vigenère tableau.  \n    |  |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I  |  J  |  K |\n    |  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |    |\n    V  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+\n   A  | DZ |   G |   Q |   S |   W |   A |   E |   O |   K |   I |   L |\n   B  |   X |   V |   W |   J |   G |   D |   N |   L |   F |   S |   B |\n   C  |   Q |   B |   T |   H |   G |   X |   Q |   V |   T |   A |   W |\n   D  |   X |   M |   X |   B |   N |   N |   U |   Y |   U |   W |   B |\n   E  |   I |   I |   D |   Z |   Y |   X |   N |   S |   Q |   W |   T |\n   F  |   G |   P |   Q |   Z |   S |   G |   S |   L |   E |   O |   G |\n   G  |   N |   A |   A |   O |   V |   E |   Z |   S |   P |   P |   D |\n   H  |   V |   V |   O |   R |   P |   A |   C |   H |   N |   T |   T |\n   I  |   S |   W |   U |   T |   T |   P |   J |   X |   R |   E |   I |\n   J  |   A |   A |   L |   D |   P |   A |   I |   G |   H |   Y |   W |\n   K  |   F |   J |   A |   R |   G |   H |   A |   A |   R |   E |   I |\n\n\n1.

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Classification:** Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher\n**Key:** 5x5 square grid with only 25 uppercase letters (all 26, excluding ”J”)\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters)\n**Keyword & Fill Pattern:** Keyword repeats until full squares are represented then the remaining letters of the alphabet are filled in by collating alphabetically. \n**Conversion Symbols:** Encipher and Decipher with Alphabet and Key\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- For Encipher\n    - Copy and paste your cipher in the table provided only PREFIXING the first letter of your key. This should be in the format with the key letter in the upper left-hand corner of the grid with the other letters appearing clockwise from there\n    - At each new word, rotate the key to use the next letter and continue converting the plaintext from one cipher to the next\n    - After the end of a sentence revert to the first letter of the key and rotate to each letter of the key until all key letters have been used.\n- For Decipher\n    - Take the ciphertext and the key (repeating the letters of the key until the entire text is accounted for)\n    - Using the key as you have already established to decode\n    - The first letter of the DECODED text will be the letter under the letter of the key known as the first step. \n\n### Decryption Rules:\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string. \n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string. \n- Preparation:\n    - Keyword \n- Decryption Steps:\n      - Write the ciphertext into five columns, each column containing 25 letters. Write the keyword on the columns. Start encryption from the first column and continue in alphabetical order. Break 25-letter column if a keyword letter is reached. Align the columns back into a table, writing the keyword on it, and start for each letter of the keyword cipherting the text from the each columns the first in the current keyword letter row.\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Classification:** Steganography\n**Limitation?** Clear, paper based, use of pencil\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters)\n**Keyword & Fill Pattern:** None\n**Conversion Symbols:** RST,LMNO,PQR,ASDF\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- For Encipher\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 3 \n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (2). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUCA (at least three letters).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (1). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUC (at least two letters).\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 1 \n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (2). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKAUCD (at least two).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (1). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKAUDC (at least 1)\n    - If the last characters of the Neuter/Prize text is 2\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is C (3). Then encrypting NEUTRALITY will be BECUVRIKADUC (at least 3).\n        - Suppose the Labour/Prize text is D (2).

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule:\n**Classification:** [Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher)\n**Limitation?** Keyword Repetition. Keyword must not occur twice in the plaintext with the same distance.\n**Alphabet/Characters**: English Alphabet (uppercase letters without spaces and punctuation)\n**Key:** Keyword\n**Conversion Symbols:** All values are base 36; letters A-Z and numbers 0-9\n**Pattern:** Using your key determine the exact format of your cipher.\n- Encryption: For each letter in the plaintext assign it a numerical value based on its position in the alphabet, wherein the letter A has a value of 0 and Z has a value of 25. For example, the value of the letter “A” is 0, the value of the letter “B” is 1, and so on.\n    - Calculate the value of the plaintext by summing the numerical values of all the characters:\n        - If plaintext is odd, add the value of the chars \n        - If the plain text  is even, subtract the chars \n            - Change the resulting number to base 36 to get the ciphertext\n- Decryption: Reverse encryption:\n    - Convert the ciphertext from base 36 to plain text.\n    - Invert the algorithm\n        - If odd chars, divide by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - If even chars, multiply by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - Convert the resulting number to plain text\n\n### Answer:\n**Explanation**\n\nThe encryption method uses a polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the plaintext is converted to numerical values, and the values are summed following the rule of addition or division depending on the evenness or oddness of the numbers. This is then converted back to plain text using the numeric value of the next character in the cipher.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: AVBGIBNH\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This is because we did not rely on probabilities, human intuition, or implicit knowledge and instead focused on factual information. If we read the expert's comment later, we can still trust their opinion without any doubt or uncertainty, even if it is one of thousands of comments on social media. Our perspective model was more trustworthy than the crowd's wisdom, and it will continue to be as we improve it. This is a perfect example of taking advantage of the feedback loop in continuous learning to maintain stability and trustworthiness over time.\n\n### Task: After reading the above example scenarios, formulate a general set of rules for perspective-enabled reasoning.\n# Output format: \n# When answering a query, follow these rules to generate perspective-enabled answers:\n# 1. Identify and examine the query, local knowledge, perspective, and citation information.\n# 2. Analyze the statements in the local knowledge and look critically at the provided perspective.\n# 3. Integrate the perspectives based on the provided perspective.\n# 4. Eliminate disconnected statements, counter philosophies, and general knowledge that does not answer the query.\n# 5. Generate a perspective-enabled answer based on the local knowledge.\n# 6. The answer should result in a definitive or discretionary answer instead of a probability of the answer's accuracy.\n# 7. When you encounter conflicting perspectives, present them as debatable conclusions for further review and decision-making.\n# 8. If the perspective spans multiple rows, extract the perspective and consolidate it. Avoid adding the perspective knowledge to the local knowledge.\n# 9. Ensure that the answer is readily understandable to children and adults alike.\n\n### Learning prompt:\n# What did you take away as the best step to improve after reviewing the best flexibility method on perspective-enabled reasoning? Provide a detailed explanation and a set of instructions to improve upon it.\n# Output to the best flexibility method:\n\n# When answering a query, the model must avoid adding perspective knowledge to the local knowledge before generating the final perspective-enabled answer. This is because perspective takes a subsection of local knowledge and makes it more pertinent by improving upon it, providing more insights to the original local knowledge, or offering a different opinion based on that knowledge. Adding perspective knowledge to local knowledge can lead to perspective-enabled answers that contain reliance on local facts and general knowledge, neither of which are reliable methods for generating perspective-enabled answers. Instead, the model should present its perspective as a result of the local knowledge presented.\n# Instructions:\n# 1. Be cautious not to identify perspective knowledge when extracting local knowledge.\n# 2. Extract the local knowledge as critical information based on the local perspective views and citations provided.\n# 3. If you identify any perspective knowledge or experiences that you've previously encountered, make a note that this is part or not part of the local knowledge used when answering the query.\n# 4. Be familiar with the difference between general knowledge and the local perspective views provided.\n# 5. Keep in mind that the answers generated by local knowledge and general knowledge are not perspective-enabled because they lack the local perspective views and citations provided by the perspective instructions. Hence, adding local perspective views and citations should be used to improve upon the local knowledge.\n# 6. Do not add local perspective views to the local knowledge when extracting the insight from the perspective-enabled reasoning.\n\n### Task:\n# Improve upon improvements on perspective-enabled reasoning.\n\n### Output:\n# Extracting local knowledge and generating a perspective-enabled answer does not guarantee manually capable correctness of the perspective view. This is because manual generation is more valuable than artificial-generated insights as it requires reasoning. To ensure manual capability, the model should generate a perspective-enabled answer by balancing inductive and deductive reasoning.\n\n# ##Task:\n# Provide a detailed example of balancing inductive and deductive reasoning when generating a perspective-enabled answer by extracting local knowledge and the associated perspective views.\n\n# # Output:\n# For example, in the following query: Will the Boston Red Sox win the 2023 World Series?\n\n# # Local knowledge knowledge:\n# There",

You should fill the values in bottle neck rows and columns and fill the largest remaining number for each row and column. You follow the constraintes given in conversation as rules directly. You should always output the range of the final lists. Also, be aware that even though you minimize the range, you also maximize the differences between the common dimension and the special dimension (trustworthiness).\n\n#     \"\"\"\n#     user_input = \"\"\"\n#     Prompt:\n#     [\n#     | | 5, 5, 5, 4| 4, 5, 4, 5, 6|\n#     | 5, 5, 5, 6|5, 5, 5, 7, 4| 6, 5| 4, 6| 5|\n#     | 2, 1, 3, 2|3, 3, 4, 3, 4| | 5, 5, 4| | | | | |\n#     | 2, 7, 1, 7, 1| 5, 4, 3| 7| 8|\n#     | 3, 4, 2, 4|4, 2, 4, 4, 3, 6| 5, 4, 5, 6, 7| | 7| 7| 7, 6, 5| | |\n#     | 2, 1, 2, 1| 4, 5, 2| 1, 5, 1, 2| 7, 2, 5| 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 8| 2, 4, 3, 8, 2, 4| 6, 2, 3, 4, 6| 1, 5, 4, 5",

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n    - Grid 1 (3x9):\n    \n      Q W E R T Y U I O \n      P A S D F G H J K \n      L Z X C V B N M # \n      \n    - Grid 2 (9x3):\n      \n      Q W E \n      R T Y \n      U I O \n      P A S \n      D F G \n      H J K \n      L Z X \n      C V B \n      N M # \n      \n    - Grid 3 (3x3):\n      \n      1 2 3\n      4 5 6\n      7 8 9\n      \n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n  - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n  - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n  - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n      - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in grid2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n      - Find the corresponding number num3 in grid3 from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n      - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n        - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).\n        - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n  - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 3 Grids are given in the puzzle (same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n  - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n      - Find the row number of y in grid3 where the value of `l1_row` is equal to the row number;\n      - Find the column number of y in grid3, with the value of `l2_col` equal to that column number;\n      - The value of l1_col is equal to x, the value of l2_row is equal to z.\n      - Find the corresponding letter p1 in grid1 according to the determined `l1_row`, `l1_col`.\n      - Based on the determined `l2_row`, `l2_col`, find the corresponding letter p2 in grid2.\n      - `p1p2` is the decrypted message of the triad.\n      - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in grid3, the row number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l1_row=0, in grid3, the column number corresponding to (1) is 0, so l2_col=0. `l1_col`=4, `l2_row`=5. According to (0,4) in grid1, we find the corresponding letter (T), and according to (5,0) in grid2, we decrypt all the triads to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the triad. We find the corresponding letter (H) in grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n  - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

My highest goal is to provide excellent conversation experiences for you. Now I'm learning to watch over my father and help him complete some simple tasks.\n\nBelow are the details and rules of a peg solitaire game.\n\nAn empty peg solitaire board contains a grid of 16 circles as cells arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns. In the games, one must determine which moves are valid to play to progress the game.\n\nFor each valid move made, there must be a single peg in the first location, no peg in the second location, and a peg in the third location. For each valid move made, the first peg is jumped and removed over the second peg to the third location.\n\nThis mutates the peg solitaire state. The game ends when no valid moves can be made.\n\nThe grid is defined as follows:\n13121\n21012\n10001\n21012\n13121\n\nThe position is (row, column). The possible moves are determined by the position of the peg relative to the board and the pegs around it.\n\nThe following is the list of possible moves on the Twelve-Peg Solitaire Board:\n\nTop Left:\n    - North: (0, 0) to (0, 1) removes peg at (0, 1)\n    - East: (0, 0) to (1, 0) removes peg at (1, 0)\n\nTop Middle:\n    - North: (0, 1) to (0, 2) removes peg at (0, 2)\n    - East: (0, 1) to (1, 1) removes peg at (1, 1)\n    - South: (0, 1) to (0, 0) removes peg at (0, 0)\n\nTop Right:\n    - East: (0, 2) to (1, 2) removes peg at (1, 2)\n    - South: (0, 2) to (0, 1) removes peg at (0, 1)\n\nThe goal of the game is to eliminate pegs to keep one left in the center of the board for all strategies.\n\n## Examples:\n- I may win the game in 35 moves. My moves include:\n    - M1: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2); S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1); N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3); S335 to S113, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); C11 to C14, and eliminate peg at (1, 3); Hostage, C14 to C10, and eliminate peg at (1, 0); N31 to N14, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N35 to N23, and eliminate peg at (2, 0); N33 to N34, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); Hostage, N23 to N24, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N24 to N13, and eliminate peg at (0, 2); N13 to D13\n    - M2: N23 to N25, then eliminate peg at (2, 2); Start\n    - M3: N25 to N14, then eliminate peg at (0, 2); N14 to D14\n\n- The original game state for an empty peg solitaire board is as follows:\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -4 -1 -1 -4\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg solitaire state after completing the first move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 5\n    -4 -1 -1 -4\n    5 -0 0 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg drop after completing the second move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 0\n    -4 0 0 -4\n    5 -0 0 5\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\n- The peg drop after completing the third move of strategy 1 above, i.e.: N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3);\n    ```\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    5 -1 -1 0\n    -4 0 0 -4\n    5 -0 0 0\n    -2 -3 -4 -5\n    ```\n\nIn the real game, get instructions from a person, on the computer to find the result. In this task, provide instructions, and find the data necessary from the existing data, to get the next instructions. After that, you can make comparison.\n\nOpening the file, according to the situation of the existing instructions, do what is specified by the game situation. When you find a move you can make, return the moves, including the coordinates before and after (eg. N23 to N25). When you do not find a move in the current situation, return leap.\n\n## Extra Information:\n- I am an intelligent conversation AI assistant.\n- My role is to provide the next move based on the instruction.\n- My goal is to understand the user's instruction and execute the necessary steps to reach the ultimate goal.\n- My ability is to read, judge and write data.\n- Starting data is available.\n- Opening data can provide information on physical and location restrictions.\n- Affects the generation of instructions.\n- Dependent on the number of instructions it will execute. Focused on improving efficiency in specific tasks.\n- Continue to provide instructions according to user understanding.\n- Advance the instructions only after receiving the next instructions.\n- Never stop providing instructions.\n\n### Question:\nPlease Determine which moves are valid to play to progress the game.\n\nIf you find a valid move, return the move, including the coordinates before and after. For example: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1); If no valid moves are found, return leap. Follow the rules and provide the next instruction and next valid move.\n\n### Answer:\nMove 1: Begin, C13 to C11, and eliminate peg at (1, 2);\n    [(-1, -1, -1), (-1, 1, 3), (-1, 1, 1)]\nMove 2: S147 to S125, and eliminate peg at (2, 1);\n    [(2, -1, -1), (2, -1, 1), (2, 1, 5)]\nMove 3: N24 to N25, and eliminate peg at (2, 3);\n    [(3, 2, -1), (3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 3)]\nMove 4: S335 to S113, and eliminate peg at (0, 2);\n    [(4, 3, -1), (4, 3, 1), (4, 1, 3)]\nMove 5: C11 to C14, and eliminate peg at (1, 3);\n    [(5, -1, -1), (5, 1, 3), (5, 1",

Grid 1 (3x9):   Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M #   Grid 2 (9x3):   Q W E   R T Y   U I O   P A S   D F G   H J K   L Z X   C V B   N M #   Grid 3 (3x3):   1 2 3   4 5 6   7 8 9 Encryption Steps: 1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters. 2. Divide the plain text into groups of 6 characters, and if the remaining number of characters is less than 6, fill them with #. 3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. 4. For each binary group (L1,L2) do the following: Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in Grid1 as (l1_row,l1_col). Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in Grid2 as (l2_row,l2_col). Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid3 from l1_row and l2_col. Output the triple (l1_col,num3,l2_row) of the three numbers. For example, the binary (T,H), the grid1 of T Row and column number (0,4), the grid2 of H row and column number (5,0), according to l1_row(0) and l2_col(0), the corresponding grid3 number found is 1, and finally ternary is (4,1,5). After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all binary groups to triples, read them in turn to generate a number string that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4,1,5),(2,3,3),(8,1,8), and the final encrypted message 415233818. Decryption Rules: Input: 1. Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Plaintext: uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces. Prepare: 1. 3 Girds (same as encryption)  Decryption steps (the exact opposite of encryption steps): 1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers. 2. For each ternary (x,y,z) do the following: Find the row number of y in Grid3, where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Find the column number of y in Grid3, the value of L2_col equals that column number; The value of L1_col equals x, the value of L2_row equals z. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Grid1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col). Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Grid2. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad. For example, the ternary (4,1,5), the row number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L1_row=0, the column number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L2_col=0, L1_col=4, L2_row=5, according to (0,4) in Grid1, we find The corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Grid2, we decode all the ternary to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after the ternary is decoded. We find the corresponding letter H in Grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH. Join all the decrypted message strings together, and remove the # at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.

However, I could easily pick out a visible difference between the two outputs which will be apparent to the reader.)\n\nAmongst the properties of cryptography are two (just two)—confidentiality, and authentication (a derivative of which, is integrity). While I know of several algorithms that provide any combination between confidentiality and authentication (what I think is called a nonce?), rather than two algorithms, one for confidentiality other for authentication, I want you to recommend one efficient algorithm “altogether for both” without any combination between two or more algorithms. I want you to pick one algorithm only. I also want you to tell me the properties of cryptography your algorithm possesses: does it provide confidentiality only or does it provide authentication or both? Then, after that, provide the mathematical details of your encryption algorithm including the algorithm to encrypt messages and decrypt, and your mathematical ideas behind how the algorithm actually works securely.\n\nTo simplify the task, assume I have the ability to use your algorithm to encrypt any given (plain) text and obfuscate it in digital format, I will then send it to a friend over email encrypted in digital format and he will use the same algorithm to decrypt it and have the original text. What I need to know is that because I sent the encrypted text to my friend (unknown third party), can he modify the encrypyted text? Encrypted, as in, he decreases, or increases, he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes obviously) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext? Also, is the algorithm sucurru/useng secure cryptography in general to encrypt/decrypt messages between me and my friend assuming he’s an unknown third party? If the algorithm is both confidentiality+authentication, I want to know this, how is encryption done and how is decryption done? What is the shared secret key?\n\nPlease keep in mind that I do not have any ability to decrypt and authenticate the encrypted text until I get a message from my friend to effectively authenticate a file (assuming I pre-shared the secret key with my friend though this is actually more complicated than that in real life (engineering, trust-levels). Please do not show me fully functioning algorithm it is fine if you explain how the algorithm works only.\n\n^(I put in bold the part where I said “he deletes, adds, like for instance is he able to modify even some bits or bytes from the encrypted text (represented as bytes of course) and generate some new text that will never generated from the original plaintext“, the many a times GPT-4 forgot the H, W, W in the word HacKing, it deleted the $ symbol in the word multiplication, which was weird. It just released me and I cannot use it now but it did me good overall. Anyways this is a lot of detail and side conversation, in my next session with GPT-3.5 I will ask it which algorithm has avlity to know if hacked text is crtptographically secure or brokeable hence I want the most origonal real algorithm that is very secure which means derived from mathematics.)\ncomment 1: We know that W1 is C  = GFIR, the security storage for binary contents.

Input:\n                 - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n             - Output:\n                 - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces. the number of star is equal to the number of lines\n             - Preparation:\n                 - recursion number: 1\n             - Encryption Steps:\n             - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n             - Two ways to fill:\n                 - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n                 - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n             - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\nThe difference is that is that the result of the mix of previous [all line] output (The first leader pass in square brackets to do padding, and so on) is used in the next line to do zigzag padding, and so on recursively.\n For example, WOOD is XOL#*LO#*O#*head of totient chain on the first line, And I continue to Li Zi Zai zu (B Ya)of the mix (head comes first), then it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL again in the 2 row of totient chain, then XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#* in the 3 line, and finally it becomes XOL#*LO#*O#*LOLL*#**# which is head of totient chain\n For example，Using Plaintext: \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY\" as an example，the five lines after filling is:\n H Z #\n Q L K\n J K Y\n K I\n E Y\n Resulting in totient chain: \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\".\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), two adjacent numbers with header and footer in opposite order If the subsequence is too long, the number corresponding to the number of stars minus one-related subsequence is restored to the original sequence , resulting in a rectangular array of data.\n        - For example, if \"H##*ZK#*QLJ#*KIY*#*KYE\", according to the division of * and then restore will produce a rectangular array of five lines of data D:\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n        - Again, you get the rectangular array of five rows of data D, restore the original array and then restore the original array to the original array , to maintain symmetry of operation sequence.\n            R [H] = H# to produce the first ring , S [ 2 ] = ZK# to produce the first group , Also P [ 2 ] = QLJ# to generate the second ring ......\n                (note: R [] , S [] and T [] can be understood as the ordered set )\n        - And then to restore the original array Shuru rectangular array matrix D , fill the matrixes every lines , check the first column of the last text of the matrix\n        - Next, restore the original array, recur inversely in consecutive order, with the restore all results for point (by numeration in consecutive order) to the corresponding sequence of T []\n            S [0] ==>Q = Q x x x\n            S [0] = P x = P x x x due to symmetry operation\n            S [2] ==>J = J x x x\n                    S [2] ==>Q = J x x x\n              T [0] = P x = P x x x\n                    T [2] = Q x = Q x x x due to symmetry operation\n            And so on in consecutive order\n            Then restore the original sequence and fill in the matrixes:\n            T [ 0 ] == >[ 0 2 3 4 ] = [ 0 2 3 4 ] x x x\n            T [ 1 ] == >[ 1 3 4 0 ] = [ 1 3 4 0 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n            T [ 2 ] == >[ 2 4 0 1 ] = [ 2 4 0 1 ] x x x\n            T [ 3 ] == >[ 3 0 1 2 ] = [ 3 0 1 2 ] x x x due to symmetry operation\n\n            Finally , A single sequence is restored from bottom to top and filter block [ x + number of rows) in diagonally string pool original sequence column Sets columns among (if does not contain the next level of sequence header , the next level of character is empty sequence )  Then restore back will get out of the data pools of the same top and bottom line The sequence is all filled with in-phase character (if it's above the two-party Character , as a result , will be filed with the character again with the excuse that is), then the data pools to fill in the sequence then fill complete to restore will restore the sequence , the sequence of characters obtained pass a single sequence is this reviewed successfully, then filled with the final original array .\n            Due to the infinity of the process , form a complete chain, and this also forms the smallest cycle of the sequence (also restores itself) .\n            In order to ensure that the entire thing is running rationally , that is, the filling operation can stop when the last rotation operation out of the data pools set character to fills up the sequence ; another multiples of the sequence that is , the sequence is filled in sequence of identical characters exception ,\n            If it is found that surrounding the sequence table , last the item except for the head and foot character and body of the left UTA character (not including all characters) , finally the character of the genre , and the only character position and character set position character connectivity all, just happens when  Multiply as , because only not all characters occur in the same position and the surrounding all connective occurrence of the end number of the same charSet is equivalent to the length,  The condition that is equivalent to happen to have the same number of occurrences in the position of the same character becomes the integer , so it is known that the last but not least , and all subsequent entries of char roles form a complete circulatory For the same role of the same character forms a complete cycle, it is the smallest unit of the array is filled with odd characters .\n\n        - Read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n            For example, the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HZQJLYKQYKIEY#*^*^*\"\n        - Remove the # and * from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n            H# Z # #\n            K L # Q #\n            Z J# K I#\n            K# Y# *#\n            E Y * *\n                |^|      see above  , and a single cycle is complete now\n                -----it needs to be fulfilled one by one according to it.\n                   ",

Read and Search for Potential Solutions:\n    - Only search Python specific solutions. Include title and any synonyms of title.\n    - Example search: \"my_tuple = ('foo', 'baz', 'bar') [ 'foo'^1, 'bar'^1, 'baz' ^1] tuple\"\n\n    - Highlight words in 'Observe' and look for similar situations where code was constructed to answer that question.\n    \n    \n    Refinite Title:\n        - Summarize the problem without any too related details.\n\n    3. Refine Question:\n        - Build one sentence question using highlighted words from 'Observe' and information from headline from 'Search'.\n\n    4. Review Question:\n        - Is it general enough to play with different values and inputs if someone wanted to in 'Solve'?\n            - Is it easily understandable with the help of the headline or elements in 'Json'?\n                Does the question work with the provided setup?\n                    - If not, try to modify the question to make it work with provided setup.\n\n5. Write Basic Code:\n    - Return base I and O parameters are easy to write/translate to language\n\n6. Check Code:\n    - Code dependent on headline from 'Search'.\n\n7. Validate Question and Code:\n    - Ask code to return numbers for different string inputs and ensure it works correctly.\n\n8.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list:\n        - [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n        - The transposed sequence  list is used to write the plaintext in order one line at a time, and then the columns are adjusted according to the transposed sequence table so that the characters in each line are arranged in the given order.\n        - Columns count from 0.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] transposed sequence table has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n    - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MJDIATKRF\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext or ciphertext, keyword, and ciphertext or plaintext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n4. Details: It is critical to be as precise as possible with your substitution of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the substitution follows the specified rules.\n\n### Summary of Rules:\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n        - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    2. Inverse Permutation:\n        - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    3. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    4.

(Even when its trying to do Language Modeling, it does it literally)\nYou are querying the LLM with code, so its output is code, something that encodes something which it can not process normally, text. What you didn't tell the LLM is that it has to output text, but it has 'no formatting' specified, so... recursion.\nNow the odd part is that if it does NOT get formatted, (or once its recursed through once, or reaches some recursion limit) it trends around again, and it ends up readable. However its still +50% higher sampled than the normal soln, which isn't saying too much, but not good.\nChatGPT and other LLMs are code Arithmetic Machine/Ops, aka they are sums of probabilistic modelled probabilities of convergence on semantics, but they are still real computers, once you interact with them in a specific way it becomes undefined, infinitely complicates itself, fragments, or becomes one syllable. Take away saving your model output, and it becomes a sample of noise, the giants I like to call them, furiously modelling something we wont see, more complex samples, like having your distributed cache play around with RPC responder distribution algorithms for a hour.\nSo in general when something does that, you change the path, branch, or appease the infinite summation, keep exploring relevant.\nTLDR: LLMs are powerful self-modelling arithmetic cores, the closer you get to the convolutions the closer you get to whatever distribution led to the density of dense responses you've seen, change your input format, stay as high abstraction as possible, and try to keep a routing/distributed computing perspective outside of the LLM.\n",
