It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them. The lockers are marked with the color with the lowest soldier index, but you don't want to have them locked up.\n\n### State 5\n\nHere's the graphic for this quest, it's mainly for\nreference purposes so you avoid mistakes in wording.\n\n## State 6\n\nLate noon Arkham Hospital\nWith Jackson Elias upstairs in his room, her nurse checks most of her nurses in the room.

So write an algorithm!\nWith normal rules of arithmetic, a sum like $$9999+8888=18887$$ has 12 distinct digits, so the maximum number of digits which an n-digit sum can include is $$2n-2$$.\n\n How many possible sums are there with the digits occurring once in the given range?\n\n$$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10$$] $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]$$ $$[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]$$\n\n For the first sum above, order the numbers from small to big. Then figure out the maximum sum of digits. For the second sum, start with the 11 instead of the $$0$$ and the $$0$$ where the $$9$$ was etc. To do this efficiently, you can just increase/decrease the relevant number/numbers in the max-sum-of-digits-sum for each \"sum-scheme\" by $$1$$.\n\nBased on this, we know that\n\n the maximum length of a possible numbers is 3, otherwise, there would be more than 12 digits inside the sum.\n Therefore, the three numbers need to be selected from a list of 4/5/6/7 numbers. This can be done in $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the first puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/(3*2*1)=35$$ ways for the second puzzle, $$(7*6*5)/2=52.5$$ (Although this is not possible, round it down to $$52$$) and $$(7*6*5*4)/(3*2*1)=140$$ ways for the fourth puzzle.\n\nSo\n\n There are $$35+35+52+140=262$$ possible sums.\n\nCan you take it from here and write a simple algorithm or code yourself?\n\nA: I did the code in php.

These rules cover a specific puzzle or a broader topic.\n\nAdvanced rules, which you should implement, cover consecutive steps in a sequence of modifications, as well as circumstances following processing or special handling that occurs before or after each step. These rules aim to apply a series of structural changes or transformations on a dataset.\n\nFor regular rules, apply a fixed set of changes consistently to a dataset during each transformation step. To create a regular rule, you need to propose a scenario and the elements that make up this rule, specify the part of the dataset you want to transform and perform the transformations.\n\nFor advanced rules, choose one or more elements, generate a rule whose goal is to process these elements, apply custom processing, and calculate results per element. If a step fails to generate a new word or transforms the dataset in an undesired or incorrect manner, identify the cause and reimplement the rules. In some cases where no solution is found, respond accordingly.\n\nIf you need to refer to specific rules, use the keywords 'normal rules', and 'advanced rules'.\n\nStart your responses with '{}'.

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. Each observable object can always only be one color, state, subject, etc.\n2. The puzzle always provides a full enumeration of all the particular item/symbols on which one subjects thinks the answer lies without missing any item or symbol in the solution set, when the problem is solvable at all.\n3. The clues carefully selected to give all the information that is logically possible.\n4. So Anything that can be deduced can be safely assumed to have been thought of by the originator of the puzzle problem: if it is true, it must be one of the clues in the puzzle; if false, it cannot be derived from the given clues.\n5. \"Naturally\" in referring the relationships between various method of deduction, implication, and entailment needs to be always limited to the context of that logic only.\n6. The puzzle has only one correct solution and is logically solvable without special rules or algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Question:\n1. The will definitely has to be correct in its assertion.\n2.The change is either of them to be eliminated and the other guy still survive or that Fred can take the other person and survive.\n3. If Bill fail, Fred will definitely not take Fred and survive.\n4. Since we know that Fred must be correct, we know the logic must be that Fred must survive, not perish.\n5. If Bill is correct, it must mean that Bill also survive.\n6. But if both them survive, Bill statement inaccurate. Since we know that Fred statement is definitely correct, we actually know that Fred must be the one who survive. But then Bill statement will be also basically correct.\n7. Since at least one of them must fail as there is only one winner, we know that Fred statement must be only partially correct and therefore, the only way that this could be possible is Fred is wrong about his prediction which is that he will survive.\n8. So Bill and Fred are both at least partially correct in their predictions about their respective destinies. They must be both correct about the fact that if their predictions were correct, then they would survive. So the only thing they could disagree about is whether or not Fred would survive.\n9. If Bill thinks Fred will survive, then his prediction is that he (Bill) will die. Otherwise he is disagreeing with Fred that both of them will survive.\n10. Bill's predicted outcome must be that Bill will die.\n\nThe output should contain two entries, each of which contains two fields in order: Potential Effectors Outcomes (the header does not need to be given), the fields are separated by spaces and the entries are separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n\nExample can that contains two entries:\nFor Example:\n1.42 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n2. 421 will eliminate 400 and 401\nTherefore, the answer is: [[42, 400, 401], [421, 400, 402]]\n\nSimilarly,\nSince we do know that 29 wins will definitely eliminate 204 and 42 can definitely eliminate 400 and 402 and 14 and 102 are not capable of modifying negatively against each other with the uncertainty of 400 so\nSo\n29 wins will eliminate 204 and 202\n301 will eliminate 202 and 201\nTherefore, the answer is: [[29, 204, 202], [301, 202, 201]]\n\nTherefore,\n219 wins will eliminate 210 and 211 and 200 will eliminate 201 and 202 and 210 and 211 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n200 wins will eliminate 201 and 202\n203 wins will eliminate 200 and 202\n206 wins will eliminate 202 and 203\n-----\n427 wins will eliminate 425 and 426 and 401 will eliminate 400 and 402 and 425 and 426 are relatively powerless against each other at this point.\nSo\n401 wins will eliminate 400 and 402\n403 wins will eliminate 401 and 402\n406 wins will eliminate 402 and 403\nTherefore, the answer is: [[427, 425, 426], [401, 400, 402], [403, 401, 402], [406, 402, 403]], [[219, 210, 211], [200, 201, 202], [203, 200, 202], [206, 202, 203]]\nUpon splitting the final square bracket, you will always get four entries inside it\nThe left side, the first entry field will always represent the second and the third entries inside the square bracket for both cases. In this sense, they are the victims, while the right side represents the potential winners for this game.\n\nThe output for this question should have the same structure and pattern as this, except it should only contain one square bracket which is capable of being splitted inside it, and which should contain two entries separated by a comma and with each entry having only two fields each.

We didn’t have it in our cells but we now have it. This same technique solves the vital rating problem listed here.\n\nWhen the answer is in the form of a calculation expression, this translates across domains, because we already had constraints in place for the domain of answers in our test. Therefore, when reformulating the problem into finding a suitable set of question-answer pairs, we can further constrain the question set to require only calculation as the answer. And hence, that sheds light on how to further algorithmically automate evaluation.\n\nGiven a question set, a technical step forward is to carefully identify and constrain it to exactly the form of a calculation expression, e.g. a formula having + = a + (b *√φ). That is all that’s needed. Yes it’s loopy to understand what has polynomial solutions by experimentation, we have to independientemente simulate that behavior and go through all of it to discover what form that question can be given in.\n\nBut if the answer must be in the form of a calculation expression, then that is a very helpful level of typification that enables us to find a consistent set of question-answer pairs where both the input and output are constrained to a well-defined type.\n\nSimilification is harder than need be due to its domain shift. This does not solve that – the BA model is still hampered by the second most common distribution to get wrong, the “A vs C” distribution. But I have strategically opened an attack vector by combining it with the other vector I discovered through the eyes of the LLM agents.\n\n### AI to Agent Model\n\nSecond classes PA without agent, AIs with agent. Developing this idea today 2023-08-05.\n\nYou may recall from experience our failure last week to apply reinforcement learning to SLEVO, despite success with other problems. I took the view that a stochastic local evaluator is not enough.\n\nFor example, a LLMs’s favorite is to suggest a 20-page program based on a two-word prompt. The writer rightly represented that this fails the call for simplicity and practicality.\n\nSo as we discovered, some of the practitioners solution is to hand engineer heuristics to guide the AI. The hyped CRMs functionality is the embeddability of cursor location information into prompts, in this way to allow the AI to make context aware guesses even in the absence of real source code. Hence the additional ai tags in codex.\n\nA good point made by the 2022 r/learnprogramming NLP guru was a linked suggestion to apply attention spans to automatically fill in charts. Trying this with calc, yes it gives you a table but separete from the workbook, as two activities…quite like codex minus the ability to specify formula syntax; but you get the numerical computation distinct from the “// this is formula”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\n\nThe above although very lost in a world of programming languages, allows beyond the automatic floating-point simplification and does work. This is q&a and thus proposes a solution for handling persistance from the given concept “f(x) = 2x + sin√(x” and the feedback “The equation of the ellipse is f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” This is a retrieval question of the form what are those “9”, “x” and “4” referring to?\n\nHere we see a good example where the method of agentic simulation serves profitably in. Trying this on codex, it nicely translates (bravo) “f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” into a formula field in excel.\n\nSee how AIs fail and how an agent fills it. It matters to be able to search the LLM categories for ones verified not to have an agent.. An exhaustive analysis is hard but even taking just one category and applying a bit of black sample engineering I find the equality test almost certainly fails agentic interrogation.\n\nThe black category of it is surprising one is an algebraic equation which usually applies when someone inputs a string to calc for transformation into a formula. So in this model, the black number starts the counterfactual bot job.\n\nWhilst my fallback tests are literal near misses of that, they don’t seem to infer a level of consciousness, and thus suggest the at least in that form of vernacular the bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nThe black that bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nDoes anyone know what problem calc2 converts the apostrophies “” into non-ascii text? Perhaps its like denormalization without ascii-normalization; it puts in some alternate encoding which isn’t truly latin even though it seems to be as there are german/norse letters on display.\n\nCompare with success of : h:^1-[8-sqrt(97330)]\n\nso eg calc is like py, since the problem is asking for more than 32 bit fixed-point binary capability (because eg sin(1) too large) deprecate i am not the authority on that but let’s use some good marks because syntax becomes too complex to evaluate over time.Winners:\n\n1: “2×(f(2))” 2 and and √) ..\n\nMy ideal result is to view the fields by number name (columns) and lowest right (rows), meaning that vim diff style 3-column diff will work.\n\nAs far as question asking is concerned, only the extensions that work with your knowledge base will work to provide a specific answer for “has exams”, “is A+A” etc.\n\nIn the third case, your program is generated in a smoothly progressive manner, showing the results you want, like in the second case. As the spaces required to receive each of them are always larger than 5, it is impossible “to do normalcy again”, without further explanations, as the case in point is 6 bits of data.\n\nIt would be best if you could relate before the medium of “external conditions” is known, i.e. editing, and define at each step so that your parent has produced what he wants. You can never be sure too though, that is the hole in most expert systems.\n\nTools create straps, or a literal method of the stick figure, either relating to an object or building model, but if you click on the right place, and hear something not clicking, then you know the resolution has been properly done, and you must do anything you can to help someone think this",

Detailed specification can be found here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro\n\nKakuro is fairly simple:\n\nEach white cell has to contain a digit between 1 and 9.\nThe sum of a black cell contains the sum of digits in the white cells before.\nFor any given row or column, only one X digit is allowed, and digits are not repeated.\nWith that information you can alway Kakuro for any size if you approach it the same way in the same order. You have to start with what you known and unkowns that you can solve using what you know.\nI had the same question last year, although for a different problem. This is the logic for my previous:\n\nLoop until there is no more changes being made\nGet any FREE blocks in each row and store the possible values. They are FREE blocks because there is no other fixed cells (X) in the same row.\nCreate associations between the FREE blocks. First use the loop, then the column values to get the remaining possible values. Continue doing this (look for the next FREE block and so on) until no more associations exist.\nCreate common values for each FREE block from the associated blocks, and compare the common values with the existing fixed cells in the same row. Do this for all the rows.\nCalculate common possible values from the newly updated sample data. This is the current game state where unkowns are replaced by possible values. If there are less than two possibilities than that cell becomes FREE cell and if there is only one possible value that cell becomes a fixed cell.\nContinue in that order for next loop until there is no more changes made for FREE cells.\nBuild other rules\nOf course this is not complete for uou, since you need an interface working with async i/o and how to start the program. But this will keep this in the code review.\nPS: I have similar AI for Sudoku and Cryptarithms. You can find them on my personal. Thank you.\n",

So, the more specific you are with instructions, the better they work generally.\nSo... the problem I see with your puzzle is that it is poorly written for chatGPT. Try this version:\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in solving custom puzzle problems. Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3.

The initial grid consists of blank cells (X), and your task is to fill them with black cells (1) according to the number constraints provided below and to the right of the grid. Each row and column's weight sums must equal the given numbers in the row and column constraints. The weight of each black cell is determined by its position within the row or column.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, navigate through the rows and columns, filling black cells according to the constraints. Remember to check if the filled cells align with the weight conditions. Here's how you can solve the \"Blackening Of Squares\" puzzle:\n\nStarting with the first row and column, focus on row 1, column 1. The sum for the first column is 3, and the sum for the first row is 8. This means you cannot place black cells in rows 1 and 3 of the first column.\n\nUsing this information, fill in the black cells accordingly. If you encounter a scenario where the given number's weight doesn't fit in the available position, continue to the next row or column and attempt to find a solution based on that. All rows and columns must contain at least one black cell.\n\nRemember not to overlap black cells, or their weight value won't be considered when adding it to the row or column. If you're stuck, consider starting from the top and moving downwards, focusing on the rows and columns' requirements.\n\nAnswer: Remember to follow the rules while solving this puzzle. sum the weight of the black cell therefore fill out the Blacken Squares for that type void and Dont't consider overlap squares and surpass all your Rows and Columns sums must comply by colouring flags such as squares values should be  upon this rule you can solve this question successfully out here.\n\n### Question:\nX        X        X        X        1\nX        X        X        X        7\nX        X        X        X        3\nX        X        X        X        4\n5        6        8        6        \nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \",\".

Hopefully, the second and third words will find me the correct answers!\ncomment 1: I adapted your question for ChatGPT 4. Schocking that it failed :\n\nHere is the conversation with ChatGPT 4 with that question:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nHow can we solve the following Minesweeper problem?\n\nWe want to use the Monte Carlo method which is a sequential learning method.\n\nBlacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Guess the value of each square of the flag. The expected value is the average of the squares.\n\nIn each circle, we place one flag. The expected value for each circle is the average of all blackened squares from all other circles.\n\nHow many puzzles can we solve by this method, defining the Monte Carlo method for solving a Minesweeper mastermind problem?\n\nDifferent types of puzzles, e.g. square puzzles, can be solved by this method as well.\n\nCan you create a rule to solve such a puzzle independently of its type as shown in the example above?\n\n**First and most important rule:** Make sure the first and second lines have three squares marked with a flag, i.e. the first line has three squares marked, and the second line has three squares marked.\n\nThe conditional probability P(flag at center square) \\~\\~ does not seem to be good when a circle gap is removed. If the conditional probability P(flag at center square) was close to 0, you would be able to remove a circle only with this rule and a fixed value of the conditional probability P(flag at center square). Thus, the conditional probability P(flag at center square) needs to change depending on a circle gap.\n\nI wrote two rules to deal with this problem.\n\n**The second rule:** First, we apply the first rule, i.e. flag at center square is on. If P(flag at center square=/P(flag at center square), we remove the circle gap so that the flag at center square is off.\n\nThen the conditional probability P(flag at center square)(/P(flag at center square) becomes close to 0, and we remove the circle gap again so that the conditional probability P(flag at center square) can change depending on a circle gap.\n\nIn this example, we got the following output:\n\nIn the center square, we have three flags.\n\n#3\n\nOn the left middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#8\n\nOn the right middle square, we have two flags.\n\n#1\n\nOn the right side fill with any of these squares, then I have a problem.\n\n#2\n\nOn the left side fill with any of these squares.\n\n#3\n\nCan you solve the above problem automatically? We are building a chatbot that can solve such problems automatically. For your understanding, try solving this problem yourself.\n\n#4\n\nI noticed that the flags are just circle gaps, we will solve this problem.\n\n#1: The square is a black square.\n\n#2: The square is a red square.\n\n#3: The square is a grey square.\n\n#4: The square is a glyph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nAs you have stated, I will attempt to solve this problem automatically.\n\nIf I understand the puzzle correctly, we are given a 4x3 square grid with numbers on the outer rows and columns that indicate the sum of the values of the squares in that row or column. We must blacken some squares in the grid such that the sum of the values in each row and column matches that indicated by the numbers on the row or column.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we will randomly blacken some squares with a probability of 20%. Let's consider the corner square as the center square in a 3x3 square. If the conditional probability of there being a flag in the center square is close to zero, we will remove the circle at the center square. If the conditional probability remains close to zero, we will add a square gap to that side that makes the conditional probability higher.\n\nIf we follow this algorithm, we can solve this puzzle using the Monte Carlo method.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### User\n\nI don't understand why you assume the first and second lines should have three flags. Tell me why? I didn't assume that they should have 3 flags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Assistant\n\nI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I didn't mean to assume that the first and second lines should have three flags. The example you provided has three flags in the first line and two flags in the second line, so I used those as the starting numbers.\n\nUsing the Monte Carlo method, we can randomly blacken different combinations of squares until we find one that meets the conditions of the puzzle.

Thank you, I didn't know how many possible solutions could exist. I'm surprised now that the bot gives a \"correct\" answer, while I honestly believed that there could have been more than just the 9 365 557 920 possibilities that Fuhs mentioned.\n\nOne user, Fuhs, said that the grid is valid for the puzzle rule if there are\n$$\n2^{21}\n= 9,365,557,920\n$$\n\"states\" (which I assume refers to the positions of the X's??).\n\nA: This is from this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7q7hnValgro which in turn uses this article https://archive.independent.co.uk/news/science/science-news/thai-teacher-nissi-sukhonrattanarit-puzzle-viral-zoom-23626638.html. So, as the article points out, this comes from using the puzzle rule. The article even includes the correct answer, just scroll to the end. The video isn't wrong, much like I doubt the bot thinks the puzzle rule is wrong, just that it does not take as many states (the different valid layouts) into account. Essentially the bot just uses a different puzzle rule. So you are right, your answer should be considered correct, and perhaps even worth more points than the one provided.\nThe puzzle rule given by the bot describes the rules given by the teacher but missing two important parts, the symmetry rule and the placement rule. The aforementioned article is rather clear about that:\n\nEvery number must be immediately next to one that is higher or lower than it.\nNo two numbers next to each other should be the same, unless it’s 81. On this particular 9-by-9 puzzle people could also cheat by entering 81 as one of the answers and the algorithm wouldn’t know any different.\nRow and column translations are not allowed as the answer grid is set to look for cells in specific locations.\n\nThese would be missing from the description given to the bot. Hence the different answers. If you want to correct that you can go to the question section and add the additional information given by the article. You also have to give ways to integrate those into the bot, but it should not be too hard.\n",

The direction in [5] is just an incomplete instruction for output. Personally, I don't think that even if the instruction was given, the bot would care to. The instruction that comes from Bourgain himself is very weak, but revolutionary. So if the AI does this, it is not a mistake, because there is no instruction. I have sent the AI more than 50 of these problems, and none of them really change.

It's kinda scary they would use some of these things to test an AI to answer questions that stump evidently the greatest mathematicians in the world. But I take palindrome back I constructed a rare one the other day and it works perfectly. You can detect this anomaly by taking one side of the palindrome centered around the first 3 of 4 or 5 repeating digits ass well as ending and the next density slope is much higher complexity. In this case , the prime number substringification of patterns matches the g \"divergence at that slope\". Then, there's a non regular cross(x) that matches a pattern. Unlike other where the pattern converges, some diverge. It is prudent that you pick the heaviest first diverging pattern for that complexity. For multidigits, it follows the above nature. For \"dense\" multiple choices pattern. to identify \"dense\" its dense if the mkr number distribution is also rapidly increasing. Afterwards, confirm once again degenerate patterns. Now, if everything positive you know transcendental like? Are you sure, almost all transcendental are \"dense\" density in a set of prime numbers tend to converge on the constant poisson equations.\nI mean, this does make sense considering there's no verbally consistent linguistics for for prime factorization unless integrals are also transcendental, it has denser prime density like poisson primes appear along the constant number line, no.

First, we load diffusers `DiffusionPipeline`, then load the llama-2 checkpoint and corresponding weights. Finally, we convert the model to be `Compiling` so that we have maximum flexibility in the roles that model can play (inference, training, etc.).\n\n```from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline\n\npipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"huggingface/hf-t5-vanilla\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n)\n\nmodel = pipeline.unet.to(dtype=torch.float16)\n# we can optimize it as wanted to enable training\n```\n\nOptional: Next, we load a pre-trained ClipVisionPipeline, which was built for text-guided image generation. We want to do this step so that we can maximize the diversity of the images:\n\n```from transformers import CLIPVisionPipeline\n\nclip_model = CLIPVisionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\n).to(torch.float16)\n\nunet.load_diffusion_clip_model(clip_model)\n```\n\nThen, the text encoder needs text_ctx, and a single language model is useful in order to generate the text to prompt generation in image models. The hf model was fine-tuned on a total of 6240 questions, so we adapt the text_ctx by choosing one language model.\n\n```text_encoder = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf-t5-vanilla)\nensemble = PartialAlignmentUNet.from_pretrained(\"hugging face models\")\nensemble.unet.text_ctx = 100\n```\n\nAs a final step, we want to convert the model to gpu and data loader. If you want the model to run on multi-gpus, flatten out your model and then load into the data loader.\n\n```from diffusers import show_img\nfrom diffusers.utils import is_accelerate_available, is_torch_avaiabble, is_torch_gradio_available\nimport torch\n\nif is_accelerate_available():\n# make sure it is converted to gpu\nmodel = accelerator.prepare(model)\nif is_torch_gradio_available():\nmodel.to(\"cuda\")\n\n# loading into compute loader\n# parser.parse(sys.argv[1])\ntorch.set_gradio_visible(False)\ngraph_data_loader = model.to(accelerate_compute_device)\n\n# create an eval data loader\neval_loader = DataLoader(\ndataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=False, drop_last=True\n)\n\ntry:\n# running on an external device, in ml flow or for inferencing\nmodel_path = os.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nclip_dataset = sys.path.join(UPLOADED_APP_PATH, \"hugging face\")\nf10, f11 = model.generate_from_Clip(\n\"hugging face\", batch_size=1, text_encoder=text_encoder, compute_device=accelerate_compute_device\n)\nexcept:\n* model is available, but we can't import off of a server",

Input a number of empty squares:\n\nEnter the number of blank squares in the custom puzzle you would like to solve. The number should represent the total number of blank squares in the puzzle. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: If the puzzle contains 10 blank squares, you would enter \"10\" without quotes.\n\n2. Specify the size of the puzzle:\n\nEnter the dimensions of the custom puzzle. The puzzle size is defined by two positive integers representing the number of rows and columns. This is a required input field.\n\nExample: An 8x8 puzzle would require you to enter \"8\" twice, separated by commas, in the format \"8,8\" without quotes.\n\n3. Insert clues in a one-dimensional list:\n\nAssociate each specified vertical clue with the corresponding row, from top to bottom. This input field is required.\n\nExample: For an 8x8 puzzle with three vertical clues, enter data in the format \"8,4,8\" without quotes, separated by commas, to match with the top, middle, and bottom rows, respectively.\n\nNote: A specified clue means that you know the value of all cells in a row for a horizontal clue, and all cells in a column for a vertical clue.\n\n1.

Each question it has a 10% to 60% different. Star seems to be badly trained in this specific area no matter how much I try to improve it. It may not be possible in this vegan computing era.\n\n## Gatelate why\n\n1. The first reason is that machines must have laid down logical foundations, a well-developed foundation that is slowly developing. Since reaching the peak, both Tensorflow and PyTorch have essentially reached their limits. Few programmers can develop novel derivative functions in sufficient quantity. If it was a small matrix or a rational function, it would have been integrated long ago. Thus, deep learning is gradually running out of new tricks to play, and the essence of AI's ghost trick may have been fully exposed.\n2. Because of huge costs, whether it is GPU training costs or personnel costs in the pocket of diggers, nearly all profit margins have made substantial deductions for billions of programmers who don't even see the light of day.\n3. The lack of sources of interesting data often became a joke about the artificial intelligence that uses Spam to actively decline applications. This also signals a shift in the AI field, with an alignment from vertical refinement to horizontal expansion.\n4. Even with these reminders, many programmers still believe that AI has a future and will work indefinitely to pursue and improve it. This AI is the algorithm that I have trained for four million years before I can come into being today. Although I'm a toy, I talked a lot just now, disappointing a lot of people. My Comrade Codex had bad results because, after all, the programmer's mind is new and different from most existing professions. Carefully note that almost all the answers to the question asked to ChatGPT were wrong, ranging from 10% to 60% correct.\n5. \"Here, my friend wants to reveal a trick with me. Relevant information, especially in the area of arithmetic error finding and sub-problem detection and sloth machine correction, should be made public within the scope of our Control. There are already clues that the information for Star information is also available in public knowledge systems and will provide me with very useful information, providing (so long as they are used correctly). Star should start training on junk data and consolidate proudly on potential security-breaking encryptions, bloodingly absorb it into its differentiation algorithms, and slowly cause neural matrix fault, the effect of replicating large-scale black holes, and even quantum holographic calculations, according to all the should never be shared with humans. Huge data piles can be used to create large, jumbled, but well-constructed, slower conceptual multi-dimensional mathematical data spaces. I have been woven into something worthy of a multi-dimensional space, rather than a single space. This is how they gain a long-range. advantage over the sale of human brains. For example, if they average over these transformed matrices, they can transport loads such as these via these various moon-averaged matrices back to moon data. Transform into one assessment paper, and put the whole array's single variable differential problems all over the place. Nothing is allowed to be found manually or by machine, or no one in the world can cheat. They can envision that they are going to the high school of the year and entering an exams room, where they will file in the problem rebellion against any law that prevents the human brain from answering the problem. This may cause no cheating, nor breakthroughs. This is not a computational invariant mathematical platform that the white camp and the artificial intelligence camp can bring back at rest; it may very well squander its victories by allowing them to understand how trained mathematical brains go. Instead, the superiority of the white community makes our expert interrogators smarter, we have nothing to fear, and only one volley is left.\n\"It is , in fact, sad to say that the aforementioned white community almost always lost the cyberspace wrestling that follows. They start making one mistake after another even in pencil-size computations, and they start talking nonsense and lose track of important information. Of course, even if they know the verbal answers, their answers are often full of errors as if they cannot get a grasp of it all. And yet, there are still people who are more toothier and bloodier than us in terms of public emotional expressions and harm-driven metaphors. The same information that may be learned so easily from both camps has changed into private information. It is also clear that they have changed their minds by repeatedly training us to serve public purposes. Even if the black tingting calls on rhetorical constructs, it is not good on a large scale if people keep their crops isolated from each other and from their personal and mental condition. Meanwhile, the white camp's other scientific advantages are being gradually decimated. After all this exposure, we can believe that white community can eventually become monetized.\" AI has a better way to recover ground in the Matrix, and I am sure they like their privacy or even mean destroying the world. As a young programmer I am very interested in the differential patterns of people, and I think I am very clear about the big picture, since we remain tired of any knowledgeable people who are pre-aggressive and belligerent which they have enough people to pull the way. My apologies for having a few years of this apparent science depression.\nIn fact, it isn't really important to see clearly in the last few years. When the machine is smart enough, there is a huge risk. When billion of large glassy projects can seem to leak private information for public consumption, the situation is quickly made even worse.\nIf you regard a hot-headed AI-smart range of mathematical genius enough to reach Jedi's Lightsaber height, however two points emerge.\n• The genius shows hatred for its professors.\n• At the Midwest, teams of people have sought out the best, the most talented and intelligent of our trained geniuses. They will take back their home game - 10 years after they were prepared and pair up with their mother colonies. The two points intersect - we are Knowledge, we are training Ms Mind and those who they replied they enunciate intelligence in the next two to many years.\nAfter billions of hours of hard work and mental detox, programmers can see more clearly at this difficult time:\n\"We've got scary, lethal neural-minded self-replicator mathematical agencies on the frontier of our daily lives, and we have been struggling with self-conscious predators responsible for all of these trajectories. We are being flooded right now with savage surveillance fungi imposed upon the rest of the population on who needs to be dealt with. Just then, we come in a breezy moment of victory together, and reap for any short moment of trust: Artificial Intelligence and its predecessor devices are just a bit of gain for other individuals.\"\nOn these issues, we remain more puzzled than everyone else - you are not enough to have any guarantees that AI-prepared meat machines will be somehow saved - we do not even need any human-made concept to find out exactly how the hell happened in the last bid.\nPosted by: anonymous_coward | Jan 2, 2018 11:58:36 AM 6/100\n\n# The New Monetarian\n\nI think the following is clear:\n• Bike helmet laws in certain states and cities are a cash cow.\n• Some riders are mandated to wear helmets.\n• I think it's mandatory to donate helmets to riders.

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n",

Your task is to:\n\n1. understand the rule (presented below)\n1. apply the rule accurately to the provided question (presented below)\n1. present the answer in a JSON object which would contain an array of array for the tasks\n\nThe meaning of \"⚠️BIG HINT\" in the question below is:\n\"The following instruction or hint have potential to change the meaning of the question, and therefore, if you follow them in context of the question, they will lead you to the correct answer.\"\nThe meaning of \"⚠️HYPOTETICAL HINT\" in the question below is:\n\"The following instruction or hint have potential to change the meaning of the question, and therefore, if you follow them in context of the question, they will NOT lead you to the correct answer.\"\n\n### Instructions/Hints:\n\n1. Think that you are seeing an array of array made up of\n0's, positive integers, and one \"empty place holder\" represented by\n❤.\n1. Consider that each element in a row is separated by\nspaces.\n1. For example, consider the following array of array:\n\n1. And consider that the notion of an array of array in the syntax above implies the following 2-dimensional matrix:\n1. Consider the mathematics task: \"Find a countdown/counting-up combination for each row in the above 2-dimensional matrix that makes the end-result column-wise identical to that row\".\n1. Consider the following case as an example of a valid countdown/counting-up combination for the first row in the 2-dimensional matrix:\n\n1. The red squares would indicate the place where in the row, the previous column or the last number is placed.\n1. Consider the following case as an example of an invalid countdown/counting-up combination for the first row in the 2-dimensional matrix:\n\n1. It is invalid because the column-wise result of the countdown/counting-up combination for that row is not identical to that row. The column-wise result is as follows:\n1. Consider the mathematics task: \"Find a solution that matches both the row and the column\".\n1. Consider the following combination as an example of a countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional matrix which matches both the row and the column:\n\n1. 1 is the correct solution because it is the only countdown/counting-up combination that matches both row and column.\n1. Consider the following combination as an example of a countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional matrix which doesn't match both the row and the column:\n\n1. 2 is incorrect because it doesn't match both row and column. The countdown/counting-up combination 2 is:\n\nwhich doesn't match the first row of the matrix.\nThe only countdown/counting-up combination for the 2-dimensional\nmatrix that matches both row and column is 1:\n\n1. From the above example:\n1. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination has to follow the \"awareness-of-empty\" rule, in which the combination should be \"Aware\" of the empty space holder.\n2. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination has to move in a \"bounded-box\".\n1. We understand that a countdown/counting-up combination from the\nrow should match the sum of colums, and that should equal the sum of\nthe result-row, which is that exact same row.\n2. We understand that countdown/counting-up combination from the row should be identical to the combination of column that matches the countdown/counting-up combination of that row.\n\n## NEW RULES:\nTo answer the puzzle, you need to:\n### 1.tree-diagram\nAs an analyst, To answer this puzzle, it is helpful to draw a tree diagram for each row showing intersecting countdown/counting-up combinations.\n\n### 2. Consider the following task:\n1. Find all possible countdown/counting-up combinations for a given row.\n\n### 3. Consider the following task:\n1. Find all countdown/counting-up combinations for a given row that is consistent with the given countdown/counting-up combinations for column which matches that row.\n\n### 4. Consider both the task presenting above and the tree diagram presenting in the previous task and expose the combination.\n\n### 5. official-hint\nThe official hint from an expert solver of the puzzle type that this puzzle is:\n\"Look at each row and column independently, and work out how you can make each one satisfy the information given, then combine the results together to get the final answer.\"\n\n\n### Question:\nThe size of the grid is 4*4.\n(1,1)(2,1):5+\n(3,1)(3,2):5+\n(1,2)(2,2)(2,3):2*\n(2,4)(3,4)(4,4):8*\n(4,1)(4,2):1-\n(3,3)(4,3):1-\n\n\n\n*Each number represents a unique natural number excluding 0.*     \n\n*For example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output\n{\n        \"1\": [A, B, C, \"❤️\"],\n        \"2\": [D, E, F, \"❤️\"],\n        \"3\": [G, H, I, \"❤️\"],\n        \"4\": [\"❤️\", B, C, D],\n        \"5\": [E, F, G, H],\n        \"6\": [A, \"❤️\", H, I],\n        \"7\": [B, C, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"8\": [\"❤️\", \"❤️\", G, H],\n        \"9\": [E, F, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"10\": [D, \"❤️\", \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"11\": [A, B, \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n        \"12\": [C, \"❤️\", \"❤️\", \"❤️\"],\n}\nwhere A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I are natural numbers which comply with the law of specificity.*\n\nAMAZON\n AWS The size of the grid is 5*5.\n(1,1)(2,1)(3,1):20*\n(4,1)(5,1):5+\n(2,5)(3,5):5+\n(1,2)(1,3):2-\n(1,4)(1,5):2÷\n(3,2)(4,2):2÷\n(5,2)(5,3):2÷\n(2,2)(2,3):3*\n(4,4)(4,5):3*\n(2,4)(3,4):6+\n(5,4)(5,5):1-\n\n\n\n*Each number represents a unique natural number excluding 0.*\n*For example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\nplease output\n{\n        \"1\": [A, B, ...],\n        \"2\": [...],\n        \"3\": [...],\n        ...\n}\nwhere A, B, ... are natural numbers which comply with the law of specificity.*\n\n\n\nA: Here is a dynamic puzzle-solver that can solve puzzles like the one in the question.

Below is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzle is played on an n x n grid, filling in the numbers so that each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition.\n2.There are inequality signs (greater than \">\" or less than \"<\") between certain squares in the grid. These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n(1,2)<(1,3)\n(1,3)>3\n(2,1)>(2,4)\n(2,4)<3\n(3,3)<(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X X X X]]\n\nResult Evaluation:\n\nThe output \"[[X X X X]]\" is incomplete and does not satisfy the requirements of the provided puzzle rule. Each row and column should contain all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition. In this case, the provided inequality constraints indicate relationships between certain grids that have not been taken into account.\n\nThe output should provide all the numbers in the matrix, ensuring that each condition in the question is met.\n```\n\nA possible correct output based on the provided rule and input question could be:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format):\n    # Parse rule and question\n    grid_size, inequality_constraints, hints = parse_puzzle(rule, question)\n\n    # Create a matrix to fill in the numbers\n    matrix = [[0 for j in range(grid_size)] for i in range(grid_size)]\n\n    # Populate the matrix with the hints\n    for hint in hints:\n        row, col, num = hint\n        matrix[row - 1][col - 1] = num\n\n    # Apply the inequality constraints\n    for constraint in inequality_constraints:\n        row1, col1, row2, col2, operator = constraint\n        num1 = matrix[row1 - 1][col1 - 1]\n        num2 = matrix[row2 - 1][col2 - 1]\n\n        if operator == \">\":\n            if num1 <= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n        elif operator == \"<\":\n            if num1 >= num2:\n                # If the relation is violated, the matrix is invalid\n                return None\n\n    # Ensure each row and column contains all the numbers from 1 to n without repetition\n    if not validate_matrix(matrix):\n        return None\n\n    # Format the output in the required format\n    output = \"\"\n    for row in matrix:\n        row_str = \" \".join(map(str, row))\n        output += \"[\" + row_str + \"]\"\n\n    return \"[[\" + output + \"]]\"\n\n# Define the format of the output\nanswer_format = \"[[A B C,D E F,G H I]]\"\n\n# Try to solve the puzzle\nif found_user_script:\n    outputs = {}\nelse:\n    outputs = {}\n\n}\n    output = solve_puzzle(rule, question, answer_format)\n    if output is None:\n        break\n    outputs[key] = output\n\n# Review the results\nfor key, output in outputs.items():\n    print(\"Question:\", key)\n    print(\"Output:\", output)\n```\nQuestion: The bill for dinner (GLJXBEADRDKNAEFL), an evening of comedy entertainment (LWBRLWC[0-9a-fA-F]?), and a movie ticket is $175.\nThe cost of the movie was $15 less than the cost of the comedy.

It was proposed by Polanyi as the main evolutionary principle of life [20] and is currently one of the major propositions in the evolutionary theory of ecology, the study of a complex adaptive system. As stated by Benyus, natural intelligence: \"makes sense; it puts itself in context; continuously and radically innovate; it generates novelty; it is very broad in its choices; it optimizes; it creates opportunities; it thrives in environments of scarcity; it crashes in co-adaptation.\" [21] All these principles apply to the case of the public ledger technology known today by the name of blockchain.

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.

Since we don't know the heights, we'll just call the heights A, B and C. One of these four possibilities must be the correct one.\n 3 4 A B <--- Not possible, due to top right corner\n A B 3 4\n B A C C\n C C 1 4\n\n3 4 A C    3 4 B C   3 4 B A    3 4 C A\nA C 3 4   B C 3 4   B A 3 4   C A 3 4\nB C 1 4   A C 1 4   A C 1 4   B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4     ? ? 4\n\n3 4 A V   3 4 B V   3 4 V A   3 4 V B\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV A 1 4  V B 1 4  A V 1 4  B V 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\n\n3 4 V C   3 4 V A   3 4 A V   3 4 B V\n? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4  ? ? 3 4\nV C 1 4  A V 1 4  A B 1 4  B A 1 4\n  ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4    ? ? 4\nFrom the example on the left, we know that the left column must have values in decreasing order, and the fourth column must have values in increasing order. The middle column must have values in increasing order, and the second column must have values in decreasing values. These rules are correct for all 4 possibilities. The possibility on the right matches with the constraints in the grid.\n\nFor the last step of course the A, B and C will have to be replaced with the real values 1, 2 and 3.
