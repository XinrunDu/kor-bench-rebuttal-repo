Replace the plaintext character with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet. The plaintext letter \"W\" corresponds to the cipher alphabet letter \"Y\".\n\n4. Combine the resulting ciphertext letters into a single string:\n   - Y\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer for the plaintext \"W\" with the key \"AKMLBXNC\" is \"Y\", encapsulated in double square brackets:\n\n```\n[[Y]]\n```",

Since the key letter is \"K\", we mark the choice as \"MN\" (from the cipher alphabets table).\n3. Next, find the position of \"S\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\". \"S\" is the 19th letter in the standard alphabet, which corresponds to the 19th letter in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet.\n4. Reduce the position of \"S\" in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet to the plaintext letter using the same position in the standard alphabet. The letter at position 19 in the standard alphabet is \"T\".\n5. Repeat the process for \"N\". The letter at position 13 in the standard alphabet is \"N\", which corresponds to the 13th letter in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet.\n\nDecryption:\n- For \"S\", using \"MN\" as the cipher alphabet (since the key letter is \"K\"):\n  - Position of \"S\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\" is 19, which corresponds to \"T\" in the standard alphabet.\n- For \"N\", using \"MN\" as the cipher alphabet (since the key letter is \"K\"):\n  - Position of \"N\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\" is 13, which corresponds to \"N\" in the standard alphabet.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is \"TN\".\n\n### Answer:\n[[TN]]",
