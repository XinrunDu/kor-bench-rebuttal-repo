If p1 = ✓ and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ✓ and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓, and p3 = ✓, then (p1 &p3 ) = ✓ and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ✓=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ✓, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ✓, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",

The loop rule states that for a loop command `c*`, `[ c* ]φ` is equivalent to `φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ)`. Since the loop will continue executing as long as `φ` is false, and `φ` must eventually become true for the loop to terminate, we can express this belief using the loop rule as follows:\n\n`[ c* ]φ`\n\nThis expression indicates that once `c*` is executed, the proposition `φ` will necessarily be true after a series of executions of `c*`. The history rule and prediction rule are not applicable here since the belief is based on the logical structure of the loop command itself, not on any external predictions or historical events.",
