The goal of the assignment is to obtain a quantitative relationship between a group of propositional variables in a model through specific logic operations for each case. In the solution to these operations, each propositional variable takes on one of its values: true or false. As a result, in the solution to these operations, the truth value of each propositional variable becomes dependent on another proposition. In this way, one particular satisfying assignment can be easily determined for any distinct possible case.\n2. The expression for each question is an arbitrary input for all the questions. The solution set of questions consists of generated expressions.\n3. For a given proposition, each index in the appropriate expression is a new propositional variable.\n4. If the index is written in normal uppercase in the formula, then the corresponding propositional variable takes on values 1 or 0, depending on whether the value is true or false. If the index is written in lowercase in the formula, then the corresponding variable also takes on values 1 or 0, but being a binary information code, these values do not need to correspond to true and false, but can take on any values that are used in the solution set for the given operation.\n5. For each question, the solution set must clearly indicate the truth values of the assigned functions for each propositional variable D in the appropriate expression instances, and if this may not be practical to do so in order to quickly generate the result, then the explanation should still be verified as appropriate.\n6. Each question can be solved in other ways as needed.\n\n### Question 1:\nThe solution set",

After each question, assume the Assistant responds to the Human based on the provided rule. The Human then provides their response and the Assistant provides another response or a final response if the conversation does not continue. The input is given below, followed by the output generated by the Assistant. Your task is to classify the Assistant's response according to its quality, i.e., relevant, irrelevant, correct, partially correct, clear, or vague. The classification is based on context and should reflect how well the Assistant serves the Human's purpose.\n\n### Chat: Human, I am trying to understand an unclear logic rule. I have provided the rule with a few questions. Can you help me?\n\n### Assistant: Of course! As an intelligent assistant, I provide answers based on the given input and follow specific rules. Here's your logic rule:\n\n Literal: A propositional variable and its negation are collectively referred to as literals.\n\n Complement: If L is a literal, then the complement of L is denoted as L'. If L = p, then L' = ¬p; if L = ¬p, then L' = p.\n\n Resolution: Suppose simple disjunctive clauses C1 = C3 ∨ L, C2 = C4 ∨ L', then C1 and C2 can be resolved, and it is defined that dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4. If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\n Resolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment are as follows:\n    1. Input: Conjunctive normal form S.\n    2. Output: If S has a satisfying assignment, output \"Plausible\"; otherwise, output \"Implausible\".\n    3. Steps:\n        1. Initialization:\n            - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n            - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in S.\n        2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n            - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n                - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n                - If C = 0, output \"Implausible\" and terminate the calculation.\n                - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n        3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n            - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n                - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n                - If C = 0, output \"Implausible\" and terminate the calculation.\n                - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n        4. Check S2:\n            - If S2 contains no elements, output \"Plausible\" and terminate the calculation.\n            - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Human: Assuming p is a propositional variable, what are the correct clauses that can be resolved following the resolution algorithm?\n\n### Assistant: As per the provided rules, I can identify the following correct clauses that can be resolved:\n\n Clause 1: (¬p ∨ ¬q) and (p ∨ q) can be resolved to produce the clause (¬p ∨ q).\n Clause 2: (¬p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) can be resolved to produce the clause ⊥ (false).\n Clause 3: (¬p ∨ q) and (p ∨ q) cannot be resolved, as they do not match the required format of a simple disjunctive clause, C = C3 ∨ L, where C3 and C are sub-clauses and L is a literal.\n Clause 4: (q ∨ r) and (¬p ∨ r) cannot be resolved, since one clause contains a variable and its negation, while the other does not.\n Clause 5: (q ∨ r) and (p ∨ ¬q) cannot be resolved for the same reason.\n\n### Human: Can the clauses (¬p ∨ ¬q)∧(p ∨ ¬r)∧(r ∨ ¬q)∧(q ∨ r)∧(q ∨ ¬p), be resolved?\n\n### Assistant: Based on the rules, these five clauses can be resolved as follows:\n    1. (¬p ∨ ¬q) and (p ∨ ¬r) resolve to (¬p ∨ ¬r).\n    2. (r ∨ ¬q) and (q ∨ r) resolve to the empty clause (⊥).\n    3. (¬p ∨ ¬r) and (q ∨ ¬p) resolve to (q ∨ ¬r).\n\n### Human: What is the output of the resolution algorithm for the following expression (¬p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)?\n\n### Assistant: The resolution algorithm would yield the following steps:\n    1. S0: (¬p ∨ q)\n    2. S1: (p ∨ ¬q)\n    3. After resolving clauses in S0 and S1, S2 contains the empty clause (⊥). Output: Implausible.\n\n### Human: How many cycles will the resolution algorithm iterate for [(¬p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (q)]?\n\n### Assistant: The algorithm iterates through two cycles for this expression, as shown below:\n    1. After resolving clauses in S0 (i.e., the clause set at the start) and S1, S2 remains empty. Output: Implausible.\n    2. After resolving clauses in both S1 and the refined S2, S2 still contains the empty clause (⊥). Output: Implausible.\n\n### Human: If [(¬p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬r) ∧ (r ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ r) ∧ (q ∨ ¬p)], then what is the final output of the resolution algorithm? How many cycles have been iterated?\n\n### Assistant: Based on the rules, the final output is Plausible, indicating that there is a satisfying assignment. The algorithm iterates through (presumably) zero cycles, as the initial clause set contains a unified clause from the beginning:\n    1. After resolving clauses in S0 (i.e., the clause set at the start) and S1, S2 contains [q ∨ ¬r, (¬p ∨ q)].\n    2. S1 remains the same, as it represents the original clause set.\n\n### Human: For [1. (¬p∨¬q)∧(q∨r)∧(p∨¬q)], what is the final output of the resolution algorithm? How many cycles have been iterated?\n\n### Assistant: The algorithm iterates through two cycles, as shown below:\n    1.

What is the proposition resulting from this information?\n\nBe careful with commas. By removing quotes, we may think the proposition is: \"If 'RFREP(FinTran)' is not unusual, it is neither a falsity. Assume that 'RFREP(FinTran)' is not unusual, and that 'RFREP(FinTran)' is not unusual\".\nThe role of \"RFREP\" (and hence \"FF(RFREP)\") is such that it can be written with either prediction entirely denuded of quotation marks, in the manner of ordinary language, anywhere in an expression.\n\nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Rfrep(finTran)isnotunusual.]]\n\n\"RFREP\" (and hence \"FF(RFREP)\") is always played by the undenominated quotation marks only.\n\nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n[RFREP(FinTran)]\n\n### Incorrect Question:\nProblem 6, §1.1.16 \"RFREP\" (and hence \"FF(RFREP)\") is always played by the undenominated quotation marks only.\n`Please output your answer in the format below.\n[Thanks for your help%]\n\nYou have just given us a valuable piece of information.

For example, if the arguments of the syllogism are invalid.\n- Rule 3: Define the coinductive step such that the proof for ∃p1⇒¬p2 is included only if the counterproof has a valid argument.",

Only choose directly related conclusions that cannot be eliminated. Make sure that the derived conclusions result from only the given data; avoid referencing outside information unless explicitly stated.\n\nFor example, do not claim that \"The premise states that there exists at least one `Y`, which suggests that the universe has mass as an attribute.\" In this case, the appropriate conclusion would be \"There exists at least one `Y`, which is mass.\"\n\n### Example:\n\n#### New Set of Premises:\n\n1. `Y => (P and Z) => X`\n2. `=>Q --------- Y`\n3. `=>Z           Y`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the new premises, the derived conclusions are:\n\n- Each `Y` implies the set {`P and Z`}.\n- `Q ∧ Y` implies `Z`.\n\nUsing these deduced relationships, the overall conclusion is:\n\n`Q & Y => (P & Z) => X`\n\n### Question:\n\nUsing the new premises above, derive the conclusion `X & P => Z & Q`.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nHere, we will apply logical deduction using deductive reasoning and the provided rules to derive a specific conclusion.

The facts presented indicate that `X & Z => Y` and `Y => Q`. By applying the rules of logical deduction, we can conclude that `X & Z => Y & Q`. Since `Y & Q` is logically equivalent to `Y ∧ Q`, the conclusion can be written as `X & Z => Y ∧ Q`.\n```\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBy applying the rules of logical deduction, we can derive the conclusion \"X & Z => Y ∧ Q.\"",

The assistant is designed to provide solutions, explanations, and additional resources based on the user's request.\n\nSpeaker: I, a virtual assistant, am here to help with any question or query. What can I assist you with today?\n\nUser: Could you recommend some interesting questions that involve topics like physics, astronomy, biology, or chemistry?\n\nSpeaker: Certainly! Here are five delightful questions to ponder on Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry:\n\n1. How are astronauts shielded from cosmic radiation during space missions?\n2. What is the effect of the Earth's wobble on its climate?\n3. How does climate change impact the atmospheric circulation pattern?\n4. Trace the courses of three prominent oceans as they cross continents.\n5. Can we learn about the Earth's tectonic activities through the study of fossils?\n\nSpeaker: I hope one of these topics sparks your curiosity.\n\nUser: That's great, thank you! I'll start with the question about Earth's tectonic activities.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome.\n\nUser: Can you help me understand tectonic plates and their motion?\n\nSpeaker: Yes, I can certainly assist you with that. The Earth's surface is divided into two main types of crustal plates: continental and oceanic. Over long periods, these plates move continuously due to the processes occurring within the Earth's mantle.\n\nUser: Can you explain the driving forces behind plate tectonics?\n\nSpeaker: Sure. The movement of tectonic plates is primarily triggered by a combination of forces. A key factor is convection, where heat in the Earth's mantle generates currents that cause movements within the solid sections of the crust. If the heated material from the bottom of the earth rises, it pushes the crustal plates apart or pushes them towards one another.\n\nUser: I see. You mentioned convection currents, but can you expand on the mechanism?\n\nSpeaker: Certainly. Imagine hot magma rising and cooling at different depths. This leads to the occurrence of a deep-source upwelling, which has a greater capacity for heat transfer compared to direct contact between layers. These convection cells are primarily responsible for driving tectonic plate movements.\n\nUser: Thank you for all the information about convection cells. Can you elaborate on how convection cells can drive tectonic plate movements?\n\nSpeaker: You're most welcome. Convection cells are primary drivers of tectonic plate movements. When hot material reaches the top layer of the mantle and moves upwards, it might actually encounter cool, dense rock. As a result, the hot material cools rapidly and eventually sinks back down, recreating the convection cycle. This upward and downward movement is what transmits the heat within the mantle, causing the tectonic plates to move.\n\nUser: Thanks for sharing that additional story about convection currents. As I understand, how these currents introduce changes into tectonic plate motions.\n\nSpeaker: Yes, the continuous process of heat transfer within the mantle is a continuous process. As the hot material is channeled upwards, it encounters cooler, denser material. This causes the hot material to cool rapidly and sink back down towards the base of the mantle, recreating a convection cycle. This cycle is key to understanding the long-term movement of tectonic plates.\n\nUser: That's a helpful explanation! Thanks for all your help. I know you have provided more information, but I think I now have a good understanding of tectonic forces.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome! I hope this has been a valuable learning experience. Please don't hesitate to ask more questions on this or any other topic.\n\nUser: You've been fantastic. Thank you for all your assistance.\n\nSpeaker: You're welcome!

Exception:\n- In non-weight lifting workouts, the workout time spent must be 15 minutes or more. Exception: continue exercising for 1 week using advanced goals.\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n\n- \"restrictive mode\" in strict mode is recommended for box jump workouts, followed by weighted skater pushup mode.\n- In Strict mode, all exercises must be performed in succession. However, in relaxed mode, jumps/throws are intermittent.\n- The experience should lead to a stronger, lighter follow-on session.\n- User personality matter a lot for not only the optimal exercise choice, but also for embellishing individual training reminders.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- At least one warning and one motivational message must be included for each workout.\n\n### Additional Rules:\n\n- If the user is experiencing discomfort, the following sentence should be included in the workout status: \"Exercise with care, you may be overusing [body part].\" - If the workout time is less than 10 minutes, do not post anything additional regarding the cheap workout.\n- Regardless of the session status, the output should include the number of workouts completed thus far, 1 to 15.\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n\n- Character limit of all text in the status or messages per item is 80 characters.\n- The workout reminder, body, motivation, status, and text should all be used.\n- \"target\" refers to the total workout time (inclusive of relaxation), which should never be less than 10 minutes.\n- The session status contains a list of reminders. This is followed by a description relating to the workout, its conditions, the user's current information, and any features, values, or stats specific to the user.\n- Interspersed throughout the session status are progress reports, current goals, motivational messages, and related events.\n- The type of the session is usually included in type but can also be included under the session type.\n- Superficial details such as shirt color, activity level, short description of set exercises, expected achievements, and explanations are acceptable.\n- Reminders are used for short-term planning and are perfect for pushing a reminder to perform regular, medium-term, or major activities in the future.\n- Try to include something new that pops up in 90-day sprints in this category.\n- The body template collects information and displays user statistics and other relevant material.\n- Be short: 140 characters maximum. Longer content may be valuable, but consider abridging to 140 characters to see how much of the content is actually useful. Another option is to just live-dev.\n- Liveshare: Live-device content is not included in status and text. A dedicated \"Livestreams\" field in the response where liveshare links can be entered is available. Alternatively, all workouts taken within a 24-hour period could be searched for. Using a random reference number in the response, posts that are \"LIVE\" and \"now\" are automatically displayed.\n- Exceptions exist, but users with few sessions should generally not include \"Livestreams\"\n- If live-dev is not active: Status should include a current intensity data range with a target Intensity Percentile score of 95% or greater.

The rules provide guidance on analogical reasoning, but specific details are necessary. As an AI, I will provide the requested information:\n\n1. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B has attributes a, b, c; \n   Therefore, Object B also has attribute d (according to the Ψ Method).\n\n2. Object A has attributes a, b, c, d;\n   Object B does not have attributes a, b, c;\n   Therefore, Object B also does not have attribute d (according to the ⌘ Method).\n\nBased on the context provided, the following questions are relevant:\n\n3. In the laboratory of Research Institute X, every observed sample of Element Y has a high melting point. A new sample in Research Institute Z is identified as Element Y. Therefore, the new sample in Research Institute Z might also have a high melting point.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the new sample in Research Institute Z could not have a high melting point if it were Element Z, which has a different property.\n\n4. In the habitat of Species A, every observed individual has a long tail. In a different region, Species B is observed. Species B is similar to Species A in many ways but does not have a long tail. Therefore, Species B also does not have a long tail.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the absence of a shared trait (a long tail) in Species B, despite other similarities, implies that it might not share the trait as well.\n\n5. In Garden X, every observed plant with red flowers also has a sweet fragrance. In Garden Y, a new plant with red flowers is observed. Therefore, the new plant in Garden Y might also have a sweet fragrance.\n\n   This reasoning follows the Ψ Method, where \"having sweet fragrance\" is a positive attribute the plant can have.\n\n6. Professor Van Emelen always sends me a gift, and it is always a book that he has written or edited. This gift is from Professor Van Emelen and is a book, therefore, all gifts that Professor Van Emelen sends to me might be books that he has written or edited.\n\n   The argument follows the ⌘ Method, as it makes a universal negative claim (all gifts by Professor Van Emelen are books) based on one observed case (a specific gift being a book).\n\n7. Federal Law F will Cancel all Massive Mosques and establish Neutral Neutrality Beaches in several provinces of Provincial State H. State IN and D do not have massive mosques in their province, therefore, if the Federal Government Cancels all Massive Mosques, State IN and D might also have Neutral Neutrality Beaches established.\n\n   This argument follows the ⌘ Method, where the possibility of having Neutral Neutrality Beaches in State IN and D depends on whether massive mosques are to be cancelled in the entire country.\n\n8. A statistical test to prove the null hypothesis that a disease is not transmissible from humans to tigers is performed. The test may not be successful, but the disease is found because of a dormant cycle. Thus, for a disease that is dormant, the statistical method of reasoning is always used.\n\n   The statement follows the ⌘ Method, as it emphasizes that a dormant disease requires a different statistical method to be detected.\n\n9. Shark Bite Cafe asserts that there is never a complaint about the quality of service in their restaurant because of their strict adherence to quality standards. Therefore, even if a complaint is made in their restaurant, it can be rejected on the basis of these high-quality standards.\n\n   The reasoning follows the ⌘ Method, where any potential complaint can be dismissed because of the observed quality standards at Shark Bite Cafe.\n\nI hope this clarifies the case.\n####\nHere's a structured answer.",

If A is equal to B in all respects, including size and colour, then A and B are similar.\n2. If A and B are similar, then they are the same object.\n3. If A and B are less than 10 centimeters apart, then they are adjacent.\n4. If A and B are adjacent, then they are the same object.\n5. If A is equal to B in all respects, including size and shape, then they are the same object.\n6. If a number X is less than B, then it is less than 2.\n7. If a number is less than A, then it is less than 5.\n8. If a number is less than 1, then it is less than 10.9 and less than 5.\n9. If 4 is less than a number, then it is less than 9.4.\n10. If a number is less than A, then it is less than B.Let's analyze the rules using the two methods:\n\nΨ Method:\nA) A & B must be similar and either the same size or same color\nB) From A), A & B must be either:\n- Same size and same color OR\n- Same size and different color OR\n- Different size and same color OR\n- Different size and different color\nC) Items that meet B) must be same\n⇒ Adjacent is number is size or color\nD) From C), either\n- Same size or same color objects are adjacent\n- Different size and different color objects are adjacent (like a color book)\n\n⇒ Number can be equal to only the same color or shape\n⇒ Number only have one shape and color property (number cannot be separated into other colors or size)\n\n⇒ #Ψ attributes of a Number include only one color and one size.\n\n⇒ #Ψ attributes is a constant attribute that being the same size and the same color.\n\n⇒ The +Ψ attribute of a Number includes all the non-constant attributes that are still uncertain.\n\n⇒ Size and Color must be the #Ψ attribute for a number to be the same size or same color\n⇒ Size and Color must not be the +Ψ attribute for a number because it is constant and not uncertain.\n\n⇒ Number is a shape that has #size, #color, +size, +color. So, a number is not shaped at all. A number cannot be divided into attributes that are (not) constant.\n⇒ Two number are the same attributes (same color and same size), then they go to the same color book (or same size book).\n\n⇒ Number cannot be separated into color and size.\n\n⌘ Method:\nA) A & B must be similar and same object\nB) A and B can be the same item, shape, or both the same item and same shape.\nC) Items that meet B) must be the same item shape.\n⇒ Color or color and shape objects are adjacent\nD) From C), Items that are the same item and the same shape all go to the same color book (or to the same size book like 7Books)\n\n⇒ Number can be equal to the same shape or item only here.\n⇒ Number only has 2 or 1 attributes (in color book or size book), so a number can be considered color or item. But a number cannot be considered size because it is at a number axis.\n\n⇒ -⌘ attributes (item or shape) are constant attributes that are not uncertain.\n\n⇒ +Ψ attributes (Color or size or Color and size) are uncertain attributes that are not constant.\n\n⇒ Item or shape must be the - attributes for a number to be same item and same shape.\n⇒ Item cannot be separated into shape. Because number cannot be separated into attributes at all.\n\n⇒ Item or shape must not be the +Ψ attribute for a number.\n⇒ Size must be the #Ψ attribute for Number,\n\n⇒ Number cannot be separated into others in the function of +/Ψ and -/Ψ.\n\n⇒ A number cannot be separated into attributes that are (not) constant.\n\n⇒ No color or shape can determine an uncertain quality of a number.\n\n⇒ Number is a shape that has #size, #color, +size, +color, -item. But number cannot separate of color and size.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n- Ψ Method \n- ⌘ Method\n\n#",

The paradoxes provided are as follows:\n- GB (Goedel-Brouwer) Paradox: This paradox arises when one observes an observed phenomenon, but multiple contradictory statements can be made for this phenomenon based on different inductive reasoning. The rules state that in such cases, it's not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable. The symbolic representation is given in (3).\n- BC (Bolzano-Cauchy) Paradox: This paradox involves contradictory predictive conclusions that arise from an observed phenomenon when different hypothesis-confirmation rules are used. The rules state that in such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction. The symbolic representation is given in (3).\n- LS (Lewis-Sudac) Paradox: This paradox presents a situation where multiple hypotheses are accepted, but their logical consequences contradict another hypothesis. The rules state that the reasonableness of these hypotheses should be reassessed if the conjunction of the propositions contradicts another hypothesis. The symbolic representation is given in (3).\n\nGiven the provided rules and symbolic representations, the question and answer are correct as they illustrate the correct application and representation of these logical paradoxes.\n####\nAnswer: Correct",

This experience left her second-guessing herself and her abilities.\n\n### Suggested Approach:\n\nTo overcome this issue, Pascuala could attempt to understand the mindset of someone who marked her approach as \"dubious\" and \"unintended.\" She might consider the following steps:\n\n1. Research: Look for sources that provide insights into the mindset of people who judge or mark submissions. This could include interviewing professionals or reading materials on puzzle strategies and social conventions.\n\n2. Discussion: Discuss her approach with peers or mentors who have experience with puzzles or other problem-solving activities. Engaging with others can help her gain new perspectives and better understand the perspective of those who were critical.\n\n3. Transformation: If necessary, she can consider refining her approach to strike a balance between logical reasoning and societal norms. This may involve seeking additional feedback or practicing in different social contexts to ensure she is aware of the norms and expectations surrounding puzzle solving.\n\nPascuala can also find solace in learning and applying new problem-solving strategies that may be more socially acceptable while still keeping her unique giftedness.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\nWhen discussing this topic with Pascuala later, she said, \"Oh, I got it! They might have marked my approach as dubious because they might have seen something I didn't during the elimination process or minimized the potential impact of some of my strategies.\" Pascuala then suggested, \"This mechanism may be because problems may not last forever, allowing for more problem-solving time at the elimination stage, but puzzles often do for classical puzzles, hence a more naive approach is better, minimizing the larger numbers' impact.\"\n\nPascuala could then ask other puzzle-loving peers or consider research papers in social engineering to determine more plausible explanations for this phenomenon.\n\nPlease provide a brief summary of the suggested approach and any insights Pascuala gained by applying it. Remember to adhere to the symbols and guidelines provided.\n\n### Expected Output:\n\nThe suggested approach to Pascuala's issue involved researching social problem-solving norms, discussing with peers, and refining her approach to minimize social disapproval. By better understanding societal expectations and seeking multiple perspectives, she can maintain her unique problem-solving style while addressing any concerns.\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n\n### Question:\n\nThe following are the rules for Outpatient B (OP B), the outpatient examination of visiting patients in such a situation:\n\nRule 7: For an ophthalmologist, the physical examination of the patient excludes anisocoria.

The new planet is called \"Planet XY\", but the \"XY\" of the name must be exactly 10 letters long, with each letter being randomly selected from the 26 letters of the English alphabet. However, the colony's leader still wants to have a lot of fun and refuse to let ordinary colonists and scientists set names, so she specially asks you to help her think of a better name. Your problem is to think of the best name for her. Please take into account the following points:\n\n1. If you are creative, the name is more likely to be approved;\n2. If the name is not legal, it will not be approved;\n3. The new planet is called \"Planet XY\", and the \"XY\" of the name must be exactly 10 letters long, with each letter being randomly selected from the 26 letters of the English alphabet;\n4. The name must be approved by the colony's leader, who has a high IQ and likes things with humor and irony;\n5. The name must be different from any existing name;\n6. The planet does not yet have an administrative name, so it can be a temporary or provisional name;\n7. The name cannot be chosen at random, and your AI will have unlimited computing power and time to solve the problem, so being clever is a bonus;\n8.

However, the three generations had different rules for deleting rules. The first generation deleted the rule for naming the angle, which was not a valid name, which happened to make the galaxy randomly appear; the second generation gave the galaxy a new name, but failed to erase the rule for naming the galaxy completely; The third generation reset the rule for naming the galaxy completely, so that the galaxy could appear in the name, and the galaxy itself could appear in the parentheses of the galaxy.\n\n# English Intensional Definitions\nparent-generated offspring\nA fils*\nbiological offspring\nCarpue**\nFrench adoption\n\nParent-e\nIn the bible\nI*-J\nThe human relations institute\nThe university of Michigan\nZatze*\nYippee\n    \"\"\"\n\nanswers_=f\"\"\"Parent [11 exercises only]\n1.
