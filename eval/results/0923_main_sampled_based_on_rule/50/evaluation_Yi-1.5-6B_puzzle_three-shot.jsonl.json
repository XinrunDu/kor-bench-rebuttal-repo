Your goal is to apply the rule accurately and present the output as required.\n\nThe first task is to complete the variable/value pair based on the given rule, which is to add a common prefix in front of the provided letter combinations and make it a word. The input for this task is \"arti un\", and the output should be formed by adding the prefix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe second task is similar, where you need to add a common suffix in front of the given letter combinations and form a word. The input for this task \"bicy\", and the output should be formed by adding the suffix \"cle\" to it.\n\nThe rule is the same, except the task is now to remove a common prefix from the input words and make a word. This means you will have to figure out which letter combination serves as the common prefix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe fourth task is to remove a common suffix. Similar to the previous task, you will need to determine which letter combination serves as the common suffix and remove it from the words in the input.\n\nThe final task is to swap the first letter of the input words with their third letter. This means you will need to identify which letter is the first letter and which letter is the third letter, and then manipulate the word accordingly.\n\nFor the rules, I've provided example letter combinations involving prefixes and suffixes, so you can see what the expected output should look like and how to apply the rule accurately. For the inputs, you will need to identify the word that represents the common prefix or suffix and apply the rule accordingly. For the \"ring\", you will need to apply the rule by manipulating the accent, which is the second letter, to match the position of the first letter in the given word.\n\nRemember, accurate application of the rule is essential for solving these problems. If you need any more guidance, let me know. I hope this helps!",

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

In fact this helps in giving feedback.\nAlphabet is combined with named terms, in a required form\n(that's why generators should be banned). Characters are combined\nin an expanded form, including adding letters showwhatinside A=ABC\n\nThe following automatic text-variable is adopted -{text}-. For a better\nunderstanding, look at the template sections, marked with:\n# Nested Template Sections\n\n### Tool Template\n\nYour task is to apply this rule to the provided question.\nPass an English sentence, i.e. command, not a list of letters\nor a symbol, that should associated to the code word. Since you don't like this kind of answers through, another helpful tool is a comment\nline at the begging. Text.E reset the text-variable -{text}-.\nExample Answer format: letting user choose between resurgence and chorl with\nauto-comment that_ resurges by default, to_ ensure cleaner_ output; I should\nnot have plowed through this, Q: [{#3pl1034-Q1_V1,Q2_V1,Q3}]; A: [{#plede,zyleR1korhtq1,tame resurgence,Korht UBOAZL1P}].\nThere are several tools for depending (or changing of) letters and variables.\nThe original, with all parts described: -{resurgence,chorl,auto}-_ -{Eric,Patrick,Homer}-.\n\n\n## 2018/09/23 (Unordered List)\n\n• This syntax:\n  open a list, terminating with a or a comma\n• [#2pl1124-Q1H-C2,#2pl1124-Q2H-C1,#2pl1124-Q3M-C2]\n• shuld give the following solution:\n  + [{#bleedy66-Q12I,#able66-Q12M,#bleedy66-Q12J},#bleedy66,#able66-J-C1C6,#bleedy66-J-C1C6]\n+ [{#bleedy66-J1,#bleedy66-J2,#bleedy66-J3},#bleedy66-D-C1C6,#bleedy66-I-C1C6,#bleedy66-M-C1C6]\n• you notice that commas after a list doesn't affect output\n\n### Syntactic Supplement\n\nMulti-word double code words can be supplied in the text, separated by\nspace. We use {{x}} as a word separator. For example,\n\"I am already done {{with}} this {{kind of answers}}\" can be used in the\ntemplate entry.\nAnother feature is lists of captures. By default, it's unbolded shown as\na bullet. However, it's blue printed for a particular query (-{Q3T}\nrequested II).\n\nAll templates consist of:\n• 2: arbitrary match\n• 3: unused but existing arrow\n• 4_N: unused vowel or consonant but existing more than once\n• I.e.: I, L and U appear in all templates\n• 1. single wildcard, four construction steps (ascn bass rst bcha)\n• 2. letter, wildcard in any place and single wildcard in any place, move to begin and loop\n• 3. construction apply for all question words if done only one\n• 4 redirection via a single wildcard\n• 5: second question word\n• 6: wildcard in any position\n• 11. join next two constructs\n\n#### Special Conditions\n\n• SELECT joins two constructs with consecutive single wildcards found:\n  cons(ab/sCDe) - sta(aeh/bC)\n  trans(abCcd/e) - cons(bcd/iC/S%)\n• MULTI-CONDITIONS are when at least par substitutions are possible:\n  cons(abcd/abC/Sd) - sta(abD/aCe)\n  trans(Bcd/efA) - ... - sta(ae)/sta(dC)\n\n### Changed\n\nAutomatic warns (tie) was added and there \"texthasn\" list: opera,tau,tau1,tau2,tau1tdtjx,tau2tdtjx,tlazzrvir,zeoundrewsu,ziru,ziru1,zrur,ziru2,ziru3\n\nand now the last Q12 is set to variable event_, and chonging  altk_wkdh_ for M1mo^0mta^\n\n### Name\n\ntext is /texthasn/ which describes video conferencing\nand M1 gives you a choice of translation between matches. Keep variables in\nmind.\n\n# Commands\n\nThis template solves multiple named questions. Inside the standard answer a\nbracket-enclosed list of collapsible, numbered, algorithmically selected\nexpressions is required. The symbol '-{^}' indicates a special marker not\nseen elsewhere, equal to an arc-filled triangle from Geometry.\n\nObviously, nested algorithms can increase the answer and themselves use the\nnamed terms. Each occurrence requires obviously only / run in-line copy and\npaste / syntax.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe following example works with the first predicate flag '-{P1}' selected\nby a question number. Comparing -{hzrngreigrnqwrtitergtdgrtm1} with the\nfirst named predicate '-{P1}', the last word '-{^}' becomes [] and the outer\ntridiagonal, enclosed by a set of square comers ('{'/'}'). When using\nnamed predicate '-{P2}', arguments in brackets, '-({3})', appear inside, and\nthe word '-{^}' is replaced with the word '-{bunt1hnfrbmb}' before the outer\nenclosures (text enclosed by an arc character is removed). The example has a\npossible choice of outputs defined by the following questions:\n 1. How many.\n2. What?\n3. The table?\n\n 1.  Would you like any cake?\n   > False\n 2.  What is your favorite plant?\n   > {'beet'}\n 3.  What your favorite color?\n   > {'red'}\n 2.\n\n### Windows Categories\n\nNested Update\nSelect: 'Zrc1W1IwUbItrUr\"\nQuery: 'vzGzablgCotrUtvr'\nDelete: 'zrcv1utOtpakU",

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\"",

Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"Here's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nI am an intelligent assistant created by GPT - 3. I assist with solving custom puzzle problems. To solve a custom puzzle, input the instructions, the question, the puzzle number, and answer number (optional). The puzzle and instructions correspond to each other, and the instructions will be auto-filled in most cases. Here is your puzzle:The puzzle is a top-down design approach that is used on many computer interfaces. In this approach, the user interface is laid out starting from the top of the screen and working downward. This makes sense because people usually scroll downward. This approach makes sense for many types of problems, but it might not be the best approach for a puzzle.\nSometimes we can make mistakes when we think we have answered the question correctly, but we actually don't have.\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle:\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nThe first term, 160, stands for the jars of pickles in the pantry. The second term, 80, stands for jars of mustard in the pantry. The third term, 620, is the total number of jars in the pantry. If you look closely, you'll notice that the answer is not 160 + 80 = 160 + 80 = 200. It is 160 + 80 - 160 = 80. The key to solving this puzzle is to remember to subtract 160 from 80.\nKnowing how to solve custom puzzle problems can be helpful in many different ways.

The task is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all of the numbers. The numbers at the end of each row and column represent the sum of the weights (positions) of the black cells, which are initially all underscores (_). The goal is to blacken some cells to satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe provided question puzzles showcase the requirements of Sudoku, with the second one being particularly challenging. The last three have answers that demonstrate a method to solve Sudoku, unless they are special cases with specific constraints.\n\nIt's essential to handle all the puzzles accurately and write detailed steps explaining the approach taken to arrive at the solution. In the context, Explanation, Alternate Explanations, Assumptions needed, Visitations, and Attribution sections, you can describe the reasoning behind your answer for each puzzle.\n\nGiven that the puzzles may have unique characteristics or variations in constraints, the model's answer might not always be valid or a standard solution. As a chatbot, it's responsible for finding patterns and applying logical reasoning to solve these puzzles efficiently.\n\nHere are the official rules and an example puzzle: [Link to examples].
