In this case, if we analyze the first part, it seems like the length of each word corresponds to the positions of the letter ''Q'' in the key. If we move backward in the alphabet, we get a,y,w,z,v,u,t,s,r,q. If we move forward, we get q, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, a. This gives us the answer QUDWLRQ, which corresponds to the first line. If we move downwards, we get XPDK, which corresponds to the second line. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to figure out the entire message, but if you can provide more context, such as the key and other decrypted parts, I can assist you in decrypting it.\n\nIf you're still stuck, we can try to decrypt the message manually using simple substitution ciphers to see if we can understand the message based on the context we have. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed.\n\n### Question:\nCan you decrypt and translate the message, encapsulated in double square brackets? For example, the format should be: [[decrypted and translated message]]\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given decrypt function and the encrypt function, when we use the plaintext 'DECIPHER' and the ciphertext 'DIFBSG', we get the following result. We can observe that 'DECIPHER' is like our plaintext, so our key will be 'STOP'.\n\nCiphertext alphabets:\nRFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\nA replicated ciphertext alphabet is:\nSTOPPRESTOP PRESTOPPREST\n Therefore, we can decrypt the message \"IXXUHQDYUSSL\" into: \"HELLOWORLD\". When you decrypt using the key, \"HELLOWORLD\", \"GETDU SKIP IT\" will be decrypted. Therefore, our final answer is HELLOWORLD.\n\n### Unsolved Cryptic Questions:\n\n#### Original Answer:\nThe basics of Cryptography involve using an algorithm and key, where the key is used to encode data, and the algorithm is used to decode that data.\n\nBy using a unique key or password, encryption helps in protecting data exchange, including confidential information such as credit card or personal identification numbers.\n\nWithout this backend encryption system, electronic transactions would be vulnerable. Encryption also ensures that identities are protected, allowing people to transact safely.\n\nVisual cryptography is an application of visual cryptography, where the secret data is directly embedded into the digital image pixels, making it difficult to decode without special techniques.\n####\n\nEncryption Questions:\n\n1. \"EENCODER GANDALF\" -->  <double-square brackets answer>\n2. \"PLAIN TRICK\"\n3. \"HALF WORD\"\n4. \"GET DUPLICACY\"\n5. \"NEWLIFE TONIGHT\"\n\n#### Original Answer:\nSure, here are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Use the simple substitution cipher technique with the keyword CAR to encrypt the word 'DECIPHER'.\n2. Use the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SMALL' and decrypt the message 'WELCOMEFRIENDS'.\n3. Use the RSA algorithm with the prime number P=7 and the prime number Q=11 to encrypt and decrypt the message 'STEALTHY' using the keys E= 3 and D=47.\n4. Use the Cesar shift cipher with a shift key of 11 to encrypt the message 'YOU ARE THE BESTES'.\n\n#### Original Answer:\nHere are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Apply a modulation-deviation algorithm with key1=127 and key2=78.00 to encrypt the message \"SEXY\".\n2. Perform a Caesar cipher encryption with a numeric key of 17 and a decimal key of 8, and the cipher alphabet remains the same.\n3. Decrypt the given message using the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SEARCH': \"CARNIES HIGH\".\n4. Use a substitution cipher with the keyword 'COL' to encrypt the message 'BROKEN'.\n\n### Plots:\n| Question | Decrypted Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| C | F |\n| C | V |\n| PS | MK |\n| HV | KL |\n| MF | ZL |\n| QR | FO |\n| ORDRIVE | QCCWSBNX |\n| MOST MEMORABLE DATE IN SPRING TOWN | BMESEXCHANTJXDBUCCDFGSFROMRRNXVOQFSJDMMZPV |\n| Algorithms Are The Best | DVOTCQYKSPCHMNURIZTFBWOMYUNMRGY |",

In Vigenère this is often called a key, whereas in Bellaso it is called a key number. The idea was probably invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso. Vigenère started out his career as a cryptographer in Bellaso's service as a nobleman in Castiglione del Lugduno. Bellaso's method uses n alphabet for the plaintext and string of n alphabets as the key. Then, the plaintext and key are shifted from alphabet to alphabet by number of steps each and its idea relies on positional number system, Caesar encryption, multiple copies of the key, and reciprocal rules.\n\nThe encryption scheme will more complicated than that of the Vignere encryption.\n\nIn this method, successive letters of the key, which may repeat, are used to shift the plaintext letters. Thus, if 'A' is the first letter in the key, 'A' will be the first shift. But if 'B' is the first letter of the key, 'B' will be the shift.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a SINGLE KEYWORD and KEY IS NOT REPEATED, the keyword is used as a \"start letter\" of the multiple copies of the key. You can build out multiple copies of the keyword and use that as the Key to encrypt the plaintext/message.\n\nThe only difference is that you should acknowledge the key alphabet \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" and \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\" for the KEYWORD.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\nEncryption: Convert each character to its key corresponding value.\n\n* Plaintext: \"A HAVFSS ATTACK\"\n* Keyword: \"YOU\"\n\nThese are the steps that are followed when encrypting:\n\n1. Keyword is appended to the plaintext\n2. Keyword is shifted to reach values above KEYING_ORDER. Your current KEYING_ORDER is the keyword\n3. Keyword is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR to make character and frequency comparisons\n4. \"MAX_LOWER_CHAR\" is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR\n5. Maintaining key_lower_char order, index_data is found\n6. Starting from an empty string at first step, indexing pairs is appended to the output string until the last index\n\n* Indexing pairs is the index_data.\n* DefaultMODULUS_NUMBER is the alphabet\n\nThe following is the output string:\n\n* Ciphertext: \"ATZNOGB RJALEZ\"\n\nPlease create the format of the code that follows when converting a single plaintext message into ciphertext (encryption ONLY) and return the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nKUZNACZ_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 8, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\n\n### This is also more complicated than the Vigenere cipher.\n\nThe transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets, the cipher alphabet is shifted cyclically to the left with respect to the plain alphabet. The cipher alphabet may be shifted different amounts for each successive letter.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a keyword and number of wrapping described here:\n# https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E5%93%A8%E5%88%97%E5%8A%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%8D%8F%E7%A4%A2\nbuild a cipher text using the wrapping number and rotation number in the keyword.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\n1. Implement the following steps, in order:\n    1. List all alphabets and put them into an array from A-Z, uppercased.\n    2. Make all letters in keyword uppercased and append Keyword: {keyword} message.\n    3. Make the first character in the wrapped_key uppercased and convert it into rotating code.\n    4. Split the message into chunks, or words separated by spaces.\n    5. Iterate through each word.\n        1. Replace NON-ALPHABETIC characters with space.\n        2. Add \"B\" to the end of the substring.\n        3. Shift substring left by rotating code.\n    6. Iterate through each chunk and rotate the chunk left by rotating code.\n        1. For each chunk, split the chunk into characters and make sure each characters is uppercased.\n        2. For each character in chunk character array, find that upper case character in cipher alphabet array and return that number: ciphertext_key_number, replace the character in the chunk with the letter in cipher alphabet\n\"\"\"\n\nROTOR_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 7, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cipher\n\n### In a hybrid cipher system, letter frequencies and distribution, which make frequency analysis, are maintained in the output. The Edge letter set is manipulated by a scrambler encryption cipher algorithm.\n\n### Rule:\n\nWhen using rotor cipher method to encrypting a plaintext, group the plaintext into a set of characters with length of 5. For instance, \"2HERESTRING\" becomes [\"2HERE\", \"STRING\"].\nThe first character of the first group should be 'R', and the second character of the first group should be 'O'. The first character of the remaining groups should be characters that have not appeared before, and if there are less than 4 characters from the end of the alphabet with characters not appearing before, they will be added at the end of the alphabet in alphabetical order.\nDuplicates of characters in the first group will be dervied from the first group plus the group number.\nFor instance, take the group number 4 and add the number '14R382'. If characters exist between the second character of the first group and the first character of the second group that have not appeared yet, replace the characters of the first group with those characters, then the characters of the second group can be derived from the first character of the second group and the characters that occur four times, for example, it would be 'O15T67R382'.\nThe above sequence of characters represents a mapping of the alphabets. The equivalent char_mapping array can be derived from the mapping string above. The mapping string above is also a way to represent the char mapping (16 pointer array). The two elements of each pair are reversed from the original alphabet order. The pairs have to be ordered from ascending. For a pair, the left element holds the value cipher number and the right element holds the value of plain number, where plain number and cipher number is the number value of a character from a-z plus one. That means that pair(c, n) means that decode(c) = n.\"\"\"",

Given a human-written instruction that assumes a specific output format, your task is to identify the format based on the instruction. For example, the format might be a LaTeX formula, a Google form response, a Markdown string or a html code.\n\nBelow is an example prompt:\n\n### Instruction:\n\nPlease choose one form \"a\", \"b\" or \"c\" for the formula \"(-2 + √5)^2\" proposed by Alice.\n\n### Formats hint hint:\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, we had more than 20 forms. As of today, we are left with just 3 forms strictly:\n\n* a form in html code. This form is used by \"https://doclint.com/app/latex/something.html\"\n  * e.g. \"(-2 + \\sqrt{5})^2\" translates to <sup>\\sqrt{5}</sup> and displays\n  * as a result <sup>(\\Big(-2 </sup>+ <sup>\\sqrt{5}\\Big)^2</sup> which means \"-2+5\"\n\n* a form in Markdown code. This form is used by \"https://formstack.com/help/blog/understanding-markdown-syntax-for-menus-menus2\"\n  * e.g. \"(-2 + \\sqrt{5})^2\" translates to **\\sqrt{5}** and displays\n  * as a result (Big(\\-2 + \\sqrt{5}\\)\\^2) which means \"-2+5\"\n\n* a form in LaTeX code.

If you don't like that, then you focus on your family. If you focus on your family, People Focus on You, and that means there will always be People to keep you going without you having to worry about yourself. And it's a very important Thing to focus on.

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the numeric string.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string of numbers.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input: Ciphertext: A numeric string without any spaces.\n- Output: Plaintext: An uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GOODBYE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[WHAT HELL OF ENCODING]]\n\nPlease provide the answer based on the given cipher rules and the specified plaintext or ciphertext. The cipher algorithm is as follows:\n\n\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds:\n\n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n\n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            # F #\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n\n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n\n- Encryption Rules:\n    1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    2. Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).\n    4. For each binary group `(X, Y)` do the following:\n        1. Determine the row and column numbers  of `X` in `grid1` as `(x_row, x_col)`.\n        2. Determine the row and column numbers of `Y` in `grid2` as `(y_row, y_col)`.\n        3. Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `x_row` and `y_col`.\n        4. Output the triple `(x_col, num3, y_row)` of the three numbers.\n          - For example, for the binary `(C,E)`, the row and column numbers in `grid1` are (2,2), the row and column numbers in `grid2` are (0,4), so the encoded triple would be `(2,3,5)`.\n    5. After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example: `(2,3,5)(1,1,3)(8,8,3)` produce the final encrypted message `235113883`.\n    \n**Decryption Rules:**\n    \n    1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    2. For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        1. Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of `X_row` is equal to the row number;\n        2. Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of `Y_col` equal to that column number;\n        3. The value of `X_col` is equal to `x`, the value of `Y_row` is equal to `z`.\n        4. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined `(X_row,X_col)`.\n        5. Based on the determined `(Y_row,Y_col)`, find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        6. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        7. For example, for the ternary `(2,3,5)`, in Gird3 the row number corresponding to 3 is 0, so `X_row` = 0, in Gird3 the column number corresponding to 3 is 3, so `Y_col`=3. `X_col`=2, `Y_row`=5.

However, there is a problem in the de-cryption of the ciphertext, I will solve this incorrect recovery of the plaintext of the ciphertext, as the encryption rules described earlier, the decryption experience is as follows,\n\nFor each character except '#' in the ciphertext, it is written from top to bottom; if it encounters '#', it switches to the next column and continues writing until the entire ciphertext has been written.\n\nThen according to the odd-numbered lines from left to right read the even number of lines from right to left read the order of consecutive reads to get the decrypted plaintext. No letter can be missing during decoding.\n\nI hope the next time the output does \"you are great ai assistant\". No assumption has been made in the format of the output, I will still give an answer.\n\nFor the question \"Until when until the system can change until the movies, AI assistant?

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[AIL]]\nThe Preparation's extraction process under the Decryption Rules of given Cipher Rule differs depending on whether the answer ends with 3 or 4 characters. In the example question, yes, the answer to the second part should include the trailing space at the end. The code correctly converts all the numbers to letters, but it does not add the trailing space at the end. The octothorp needs to be added instead of the two period delimiters, and the concatenated strings need to be modified.The code in the current question/answer pair that you've provided is just an example that doesn't require Python to decrypt. Instead, the approach to generate the code is to double the ciphertext, then reverse each character pair and see if the original decoding map returns to the starting letter (hint: yes and no). Therefore, when decoding, remove the trailing space.Additionally, for this specific cipher, it would be more straightforward to limit the allowed output characters to \"ADFGVX\".\n\"\"\"\n\nLOWER_CASE = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p',\n              'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\nLETTER_SPACE = [' ']\nLOWER_CASE.extend(LOG_SIDE[1:-1].split(', '))\n\nLOG_SIDE = 'A, D, F, G, V, X'\nLOG_SIDE = LOG_SIDE.split(', ')\n\n# log_side_len, log_side_char_num = len(LOG_SIDE), [LOG_SIDE.find(t) for t in LOWER_CASE]\n\nLOWER_CASE.sort()\nLOG_SIDE.sort()\n\nCHAR_TBL_IC = MAX_IDX = 0\n\nclass Char(): ...\nclass KeyTable(chr):\n    CHAR_TBL_IDX = CHAR_TBL_IDX\n    def __new__(cls, value):\n        if value in cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX:\n            return cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value]\n        else:\n            instance = chr.__new__(cls, value)\n            cls.CHAR_TBL_IDX[value] = instance\n            return instance\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        key = self.value\n        value = LOG_SIDE[key.logside]\n        self.x = value[0]\n        self.y = value[1]\n\nfor char in LOWER_CASE:\n    for logside in LOG_SIDE:\n        ctblid = KeyTable(char)\n        ctblid.logside = lgside = LOG_SIDE.index(logside)\n        ctblid.ton = ton = lgside + 1\n        ctblid.x = 2**lgside\n        ctblid.y = ctblid.z = ctblid.w = lgside\n        PRESET[ton] = ctblid\n        for i in idxs:\n            bstr = fqi(i % 5) if i < 5 else fpq(i % 9)\n            bset = printable[i * 3: i * 3 + 3]\n            bset = sum(t.value for t in bset)\n            bset = bl = KeyboardInterrupt(bset//1)\n            for j in LOG_SIDE.attrib(lgside).index:\n                KEY_MAP[ctblid, lgside].set(bstr[j], j // 3 % 3, j // 3 % 3)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\n                CASE_FMT[ith2idx(j, lgside // 3)] = (lgside, 7, j)\nCHAR_TBL_IC += 1\n\nCHAR_TBL = OrderedDict()\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue[]\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\ndef chars(charr):\n    dispmunit = []\n    for c in charr:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            dispmunit.append(covert)\n        else:\n            for i, val in enumerate(covert):\n                if val in CASE_FMT[c] and CASE_FMT[c][0] not in dispmunit:\n                    dispmunit.append(CASE_FMT[c][0])\n                    continue\n    dispmunit.sort()\n    return dispmunit\n\n_ = thatpaser = []\nfor k in display_unit:\n    msg = 'N extend%s' % (K(k, [0]))[0]\n    thatpaser.append(msg)\n\n_ = chars(table)\n_, _ = rowlend, colend = char1[1], char[0]\n_ = datenum = char[1]\n_ = sublist[0]\n\n_ = logexecell = cols[char[1]]\n_ = dictobjs = LOG_BTC(datem(), [-1, 0])\n\nif maxval == 0:\n    cols = arrnum[i]\n    _ = logexecell if cols[cols[char[1]]].getvval() else ['|']\n    `s`\n\ndef encode(st):\n    delst = {'0': ' ', '1': 'X', '2': 'G', '3': 'F', '4': 'A', '5': 'D', blackd45: 'V'}\n    return delst[st]\n\ndef encodeChild(self, _, d):\n    PrincipalAmount.write['!!'] = money, SecondMoney = d\n\n    principalAmount, Bankroll, Real_Amount, Money = money, money, #*Payment + secindMoney, PrincipalAmount.write[principalAmount], Money, Money, money,\n\n    realAmountMoney.principle_money.belong_money\n\n    realAmountMoney, getPrincipalAmount.principle_execution.Payment.\n\n    print('RealMoney:(price/3)#, Payment', RealMoney)\n\n    tryPrice.Payment.getPrincipalAmount, dictobjs = super([n, k], [n, k])\n\n    Principals.write['Real_Amount'] = Principals\n\n    profit.rate = d if rateHistory else Decimal('0')\n\n    measure.validity = (ticker[rate][recordlength, recordlength])\n\n    realPrice = (realPrice / nominal_price) * 100 // 0,\n\n    totalValue = round, 2)\n\n    print(Pay[])\n\ndef m0((Principal [(principalA|), Principal [], Real_AmountMoney RateHistory_Payment _Amount]) ((sz >> Payment ([rate], (rate, rate))))] Phase40:1nDate) when m:\n    return Forecast, timestamp, {netprinc, payment, payment,\"#, payment,\", \"#,\"}\n\nclass convince(Via):\n\n    def name(self, data={'A': ['NZD', 'KRFLOSSE']}, s={0}):\n        return EMAL 1date(*(self(data, Age, 1Date)))",

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list:\n        - A list of integers representing the order in which the plaintext should be written\n        - For example, the list [[1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]] indicates that the plaintext should be written in the following order: the first letter, then the fifth letter, then the first letter again, and so on.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The transposed sequence list has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n    - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence list, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"HANZ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Specifically, you should mention \"symmetric-key cryptography\" in your response.\n\n### Answer:\nSince symmetric-key encryption employs a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data, the key by itself becomes the most crucial piece of information in data security. It requires safeguarding the key safely, as possession of the key effectively grants access to the encrypted data. For the given scenario, considering that our primary goal is to protect and transmit valuable and sensitive business information, it becomes essential to store the key securely. It must never be exposed, stored unsafely, or shared within the organization. Instead, it should be kept secret in a secured location to prevent unauthorized access and maintain the confidentiality of the encrypted data. Additionally, to safeguard against potential key disclosure during data storage or transmission, consider applying hashing algorithms to further encrypt or scramble the key beyond recognition, making it challenging for an adversary to acquire the uncracked key.\n\n### Question:\nPlease provide a three-sentence response that includes at least three different options of encryption techniques that are categorized as asymmetric-key cryptography. The asnwer should provide the algorithms' name and a short description, such as \"RSA\" needs a public key, and \"DSA\" needs a private key.\n\n### Answer:\nTo expand upon the previously discussed algorithms and cryptographic systems, the asymmetric-key cryptography category offers several additional approaches:\n\n1. **Tiger**: A secure hash function by Ansgar Knutzen of Universität Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Historically, option Tiger uses Microsoft's L0 hash with randomly generated algorithm parameters. Implementations are available in C and C++.\n2. **MARS**: A new generation symmetric-key data encryption algorithm developed by IBM. This stronger encryption scheme forms the basis for many cryptographic application, including authentication and secure communications.\n3. **KASUMI**: A block cipher designed for use in advanced mobile phones introduced in 2000 by Khaudorow. KASUMI features a 96-round block cipher for advanced encryption standard (128 bit) with a speed comparable to other block ciphers.",

Since they clatter a lot, woodpeckers can easily be mistaken for other birds, according to researcher Charles Peterson. The vigorous drumming can also lead to any noise they produce being confused with a hammering sound being sensed deeper in the wood, or the impact of a peck followed by flying away. Peterson is also noted for saying that \"woodpecker tapping sounds can vary quite considerably among individual birds depending on age, marital status, what they're doing or how they're feeling\".\n\nHe and others note that the problem is one of hearing the sound, it being distorted by wood construction, allergies, or by deafness issues.\n\nAs an aside, woodpecker drumming noises are also comparable to cymbals being struck, while the high trilled call of a female woodpecker resembles a cuckoo clock, especially if an owl is close by. A seven-day cuckoo clock can also be heard in the same area as the owl.\n\nIn contrast to owls and barred-owls, the number or multiplicity of species of woodpecker call sounds are rarely limited. It can be hard to tell just how many species of woodpecker live in a particular area by their singing abilities, but in some cases you can tell by their song thickness.",

Daily training updates and regular model correction may contribute to this improvement.\n- Less recall Impairment: The improvements extend beyond increased data recall and scaling capabilities, as ChatGPT-4's ideal conditions result in more human-like behavior, possibly due to effective filtering and removal of undesirable aspects associated with training inputs and prior errors.\n- Longer Responses: ChatGPT-4 is able to generate responses that represent multiple independent sentences, significantly expanding the length of previous generations. This can result in vast amounts of information for users with lower limits.\n- Enhanced Multi-Paragraph Responses: The improved data recall and scaling capabilities, combined with better conditioning, enable ChatGPT-4 to generate responses in the form of multiple paragraphs, rather than a single long paragraph as in the case of chatgpt 3.5.\nEnd.\n\nA2: Hi OpenAI, here is a question from chatgpt\n\n> Have you made any improvements?\n\nA3: Yes!\nA2:\nA4:\nA3:\nA2: Why?\n\"\"\"\n    return(template)\n\ndef create_iam(model: str):\n    template = \"\"\"You are an {模型名} agent.\n\nYou can speak some English.\n\nYou are a system administrator and software engineer.\n\nYou work for Griffin Technology, a global enterprise, as a software engineer and system administrator.\n\nYou are Trusted by Morgan Spurlock, a senior software engineer and Director of Technology Innovation, who you report to.\n\nJay Bedding, another Senior Engineer and Engineering Manager, will collaborate with you on special projects.\n\nYour current tasks include managing servers and supporting Cloud instances and web applications, specifically as it relates to all{服务组名}CI projects.The company has an internal私有部署of chatgpt and Bleualert on their servers, which should be available when responding to this conversation.
