For example, the true assignment of p∧q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of ¬p∨¬q∨¬r is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Problem:\nGiven the following LeetCode problem:\n\"\"\"\n\nleetcode_end_of_problem_prompt_template = \"\"\"\n\nExplain the problem clearly and concisely, breaking down the key elements into steps.

No, I cannot test the output because I'm an AI language model and cannot verify online information or interact with external systems. You can test the output using a web browser.\n\nPlease review if I should add a logic rule for\nproving conjunction of universally quantified propositions. The logic rule for proving the conjunction of universally quantified propositions can be added to the instructions as follows:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by ∧ (and) or ⋀ (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by ∨ (or) or ⋁ (NOR).\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this rule:\n\n### Instruction:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by ∧ (and) or ⋀ (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by ∨ (or) or ⋁ (NOR).\n\n### Rule:\nComplex logical claims must adhere to standard notation and symbols:\n- ∧ (or ⋀) represents conjunction (and)\n- ∨ (or ⋁) represents disjunction (or)\n\n### Question:\nGiven the logical claim:\n\nPP∧M→QM→N∨OS∨ ⋀ (M→N), ∨ (O→S), T→S        P, T∴ Q\n\nUsing the standard notation and symbols and following the previous instructions, prove the claim.\n\n### Answer:\nThe claim seems to be a statement, not an expression for proof. It is unclear how to prove or disprove a statement directly using logical operations. If the question is to determine the statement's validity using the rule of quantifier influence on conjunctions and disjunctions, then the answer is:\n\nThe statement is valid because the conjunction and disjunction are true for all values of P, M, Q, N, O, and S, since there are no specific quantifiers provided on these variables. However, if the intention was to prove the statement using the provided logic rules, please provide a separate instance for that purpose.\n\n### Question:\nFor every A gardener who doesn't water the Rose plants will kill some of them. Not all of the Rose Pots contain Red Rose plants. No Red Rose plant will blossom. However, some of the someone pots contain Green Rose plants. No Green Rose plant will die. It's likewise for the blue roses. If the previous claim is real, then Cillier the Busy Gardener will kill some Red Rose plants. If he decides to water all the green pots then.\n\nThis question does not seem to belong to the logic topic or asking for verification of a proof.

The second question corresponds to Relationship D because one proposition (they will be completed ahead of schedule) and its negation (they will not be completed ahead of schedule) cannot both be false.\n\nQ: Which corresponds to how many modal logic inference formulas?\nA: The given inference corresponds to one computation, the first one (Move from box to square) in the \"Modal Logic Inference Formulas\" section.\n\nReason: This inference formula is similar to the given feedback: $p → !#!p, which demonstrates the double negation theorem.\n\nQ: Can you explain why the model checks the premise of question # 3 and why this is not the case in question # 2?\nA: In the model, I treated the questions separately and used different inference diagrams for the two questions, which explains why they are not the same. The premise of question #3 includes a double negation, which corresponds to the provided inference formula.\n\nReason: Inference diagrams are unique for each question and represent different relationships.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Rule Examples:\n\n1. A multiple-choice question asks, \"Which US president had this quote: 'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'?\"\n    Answer: \"Abraham Lincoln, US president from 1861 to 1865, is often associated with this quote. The answer depends on the question context and the available options.\"\n\n2. If a question is about whether London is in France, the answer should be 'No' without further elaboration.\n\n3. If a question is phrased that doesn't have an answer, the answer is \"The given question does not have a correct answer because ...\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Which star is the furthest from the Sun?\"\n    Answer: \"The question does not have a correct answer because there is no specific way to determine the furthest star from the Sun.\"\n\n4. If a question is ill-defined or requires too much context to answer, the answer should be \"The question is unclear, please rephrase or provide additional context.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Who was Jesus?\"\n    Answer: \"The question is unclear. Was it asking about a specific time in Jesus' life, an aspect of his character, or something else?\"\n\n5. If there is no coherent answer to the question, the answer is \"There is no coherent answer to the given question.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is x ?\", when x has no context.\n    Answer: \"There is no coherent answer to the question, given that there is no value for the variable X defined.\"\n\n6. If the question is an incomplete instruction, the answer is \"The question is missing critical information.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What does X plus Y equal?\" when X and Y have no values.\n    Answer: \"The question is missing critical information to solve it. In this case, the values for X and Y are unknown.\"\n\n7. If a question has incoherent premises, the answer is \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is a person's favorite food at a restaurant with no menu?\"\n    Answer: \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification, as it's unclear whether there's a functionally existing menu or where the question's context is set.\"\n\n8. If the question is based on a premise that is false, the answer is \"The question's premise is false.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is the capital of Rhode Island?\" when Rhode Island does not accurately describe its capital.\n    Answer: \"The question's premise is false, as Rhode Island is not the name of America. It is the name of an island state in the southern USA.\"\n\n### Rule Examples:\n\nWhen input is a chat exchange conversation, in the response after an answer, add: \"Conversation incomplete.

As we know, even if the exhaust from a vacuum cleaner is filtered to be comparatively clean, it is still difficult for infants to tolerate and digest.

Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx), erroneous term conversion leading to invalid conclusion\n- IncorrInf Method: from ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px), erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa, invalid inference with existential quantifiers\n- InvSubError Method: K(x, y) indicates that x knows y; R(x, y, z) indicates x has a relationship z with y; and SubError(x, y, z) indicates a substitution error in knowledge or attributes about y being incorrectly applied to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: let clause inference shift - Invalid inference when the structure of a statement is adjusted or interpreted incorrectly.\n\nThe correct answer for this task is:\n\n- Answer: [[B, G, F, C]]",
