Westmolen was built in 1752 (given in clue 4).\n2. Westmolen was built 23 years after the Visser family's windmill (clue 2). So, the Visser family's windmill was built in 1729 (1752 - 23).\n3. The De Jong family's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen (clue 3). This means Zemelmolen was built 23 years after 1683, which is 1706.\n4. Vlietmolen is owned by the Van Dijk family (clue 1).\n\nBy process of elimination and matching the years, we can deduce:\n- 1683: Zemelmolen (Visser family)\n- 1706: Unknown windmill (De Jong family)\n- 1729: Vlietmolen (Van Dijk family)\n- 1752: Westmolen (Unknown family)\n\nThis solution satisfies all the clues and follows the puzzle rule by combining and analyzing the information provided.",
