However, there's no 'a' in the original formula.\n3. **Function Symbols:** We replace 'g' with its implementation 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'. Since 'y' is not otherwise specified, it remains as 'y' inside the function. \n4. **Predicate Symbol:**  We replace 'F' with its implementation 'FJ(x, y)' which denotes 'x = y'.\n5. **Combining:** Substituting the function and predicate implementations into the original formula '∀xF(g(x,y),z)' gives us  '∀xFJ(gJ(x,y),z)'.\n6. **Final Interpretation:** Since our entity set is natural numbers, we introduce 'x ∈ N' within the formula. Additionally, we substitute 'y' with '0' from our entity constant definition. This results in the final implementation: '∀x ∈ N (FJ(gJ(x, 0), z))'.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under J is [[∀x ∈ N (FJ(gJ(x, 0), z))]]. \n",

We can represent this as **¬(F¬p)**, which simplifies to **Fp**.\n\nSince we have **Fp** and **Fp**, they represent the same time proposition. According to the **⚭ Relationship**,  they cannot both be false (Xiao Lin either wins or loses), but can both be true.\n\n**(2) \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" and \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\"**\n\n* **Sentence 1:** \"Xiao Bai will **permanently settle** in the United States\" - The term \"permanently\" implies a future period of time. This can be represented as **Gp**, where 'p' is 'Xiao Bai settling in the United States'.\n* **Sentence 2:** \"Xiao Bai **will settle** in the United States\" - This implies a future point in time. We can represent this as **Fp**.\n\nWe have **Gp** and **Fp**.
