Substituting this into the left side, we get:  (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n\n3. Using rule (5), we can distribute: ((!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n4. Simplifying using rule (2), we get: (!p | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n5. Using the Absorption Law (A | (A & B) ::= A) we get: (!p | (q & !p) | (q & r))\n\n6. Applying rule (5) again, we get:  (!p  | (q & (!p | r) ))\n\n7. Since !p | r is equivalent to p > r (rule (10)), and using the Distributive law once again, we get: (!p | (q & (p > r) ) )\n\n8. Applying De Morgan's Law and Distributive law, !p | (q & (p > r) ) is equivalent to (!p | q) & (!p | (p > r))\n\n9. Since (!p | (p > r)) is true by definition (anything OR True is True),  the whole expression simplifies to (!p | q).\n\n10. Using rule (10) again, we see (!p | q) is equivalent to p> (q|r) .\n\nTherefore, ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is **valid**.\n\n**(2)  !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)**\n\n* Let's analyze this equivalence using our rules:\n\n1. We know from Rule (11) that p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p)\n\n2. Substituting the definition of implication (rule (10)) gives us: !( ( (!p | q) & (!q | p) ) )\n\n3. Using De Morgan's Law and Distributive Law we can simplify this to: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p)\n\n4. Applying De Morgan's Law again: (p & !q) | (q & !p)\n5. Using rule (5), we can distribute:  (p | q) & (!q | !p)\n\n\n\n6. The expression on the right side (((p|q)&!(p&q))) is equivalent to K ((p|q)&((!p | !q)))\n K using rule 5 for distribution and using rule 9: A & !A = 0\n   \n\n7. Since   K  (p |q) & ! (p & q) can be derived using distributive laws, the equivalence (p | q) & ! (p & q)::=:: ! (p = q) is **valid**.\n\n Therefore, the final answer is **[[A];[A]]**.\n",
