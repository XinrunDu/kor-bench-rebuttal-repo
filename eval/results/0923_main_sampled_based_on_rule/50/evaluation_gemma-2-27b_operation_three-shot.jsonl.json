The answer for \"Compute 3#8\" is [[6]], the answer for \"Compute 1#5\" is [[3]], and the answer for \"If X#7=5, find X\" is [[3 or 4]]. The answer for \"Compute 3#9\" is [[5]], and the answer for \"If 3#X=5, find X\" is [[3 or 4 or 5 or 6]]. The answer for \"If 4#X=5, find X\" is [[4 or 5 or 6 or 7]]. The answer for \"If X#3=4, find X\" is [[4]]. The answer for \"Compute 5#9\" is [[6]], and the answer for \"If 9#X=10, find X\" is [[9 or 10 or 11 or 12]]. The answer for \"If 3#X=4, find X\" is [[3 or 4 or 5 or 6]], and the answer for \"If 5#X=6, find X\" is [[5 or 6 or 7 or 8]].\n\nAre there any more questions I can assist you with?\n\nI am an intelligent assistant capable of processing and evaluating custom operations based on specific rules. You provided a rule for a new operation called a#b, which calculates the average of all even numbers between a and b (including a and b). Now, you have provided me with several operations and asked for their results based on the given rule. Here are my responses:\nCompute 3#8: \nThe even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4, 6, and 8. The sum of these numbers is 18, and when divided by 3 (since there are three even numbers), the result is 6. Therefore, the answer is [[6]].\nCompute 1#5: \nThe even numbers between 1 and 5 are 2 and 4. The sum of these numbers is 6, and when divided by 2 (since there are two even numbers), the result is 3. Therefore, the answer is [[3]].\nIf X#7=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between X and 7 is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 4 and 7, being X. These even numbers are 4 and 6. The average of these two even numbers is 5. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[4]].\nCompute 3#9: \nThe even numbers between 3 and 9 are 4, 6, and 8. The sum of these numbers is 18, and when divided by 3 (since there are three even numbers), the result is 6. Therefore, the answer is [[6]].\nIf 3#X=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 3 and X is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 3 and 6. These even numbers are 4 and 6. The average of these two even numbers is 5. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[6]].\nIf 4#X=5, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 4 and X is equal to 5. Let's consider the even numbers between 5 and 8. These even numbers are 6 and 8. The average of these two even numbers is 7, which is not equal to 5. Therefore, there may not be a solution for X in this case.\nIf X#3=4, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between X and 3 is equal to 4. Let's consider the even numbers between 2 and 3. These even numbers are not applicable in this case. Therefore, there may not be a solution for X in this case.\nCompute 5#9: \nThe even numbers between 5 and 9 are 6 and 8. The sum of these numbers is 14, and when divided by 2 (since there are two even numbers), the result is 7. Therefore, the answer is [[7]].\nIf 9#X=10, find X: \nWe need to find an X such that the average of all even numbers between 9 and X is equal to 10. Let's consider the even numbers between 10 and 13. These even numbers are 10, 12, and 14. The average of these three even numbers is approximately 12. Therefore, one possible value for X is [[13]].\nIf 3#X=4, find X: \nThere is no possible value for X here because the smallest even number in the sequence is 4, which also happens to be the first number to be included in the average. Therefore, the answer does not exist.\nIf 5#X=6, find X: \nThere is no possible value for X here because the smallest even number in the sequence is 6, which also happens to be the first number to be included in the average. Therefore, the answer does not exist.\nThese are the results for the operations you provided based on the given rule for a#b. Let me know if you have any further questions or need any more assistance.\n\nI am an intelligent assistant capable of evaluating custom operations based on specific rules.

This is equivalent to 3n+2=1+2+⋯+n.\nCompare this result with 3n+2=1+2+⋯+n, and you immediately conclude that n+1=n.Hence n=0. Now as n+1≥1, we conclude that 0≥1. This is contradiction.

So 3Z△Y=Y Hence 3×3=3 This is a contradiction. ]\nGiven the answer is \"Z=one third of a number,namely\", it does not even existat all. How did you come up with this \"one third\"? Please provide all detailed reasoning.If you find there is effectively no reasoning, feel free to say that.\n\n### Answer:\n[Since the question is false,the answer should be false too. I have deleted it here, for it provides no information at all.]Since the answer is a noun, it must be either \"Z=one half of a number,namely\" or \"Z=one third of a number,namely\". However the first answer, \"Z=one half of a number,namely\", is not correct either. For simplicity, let the \"number\" be 0. Then we find Z=one half of 0. But this is again wrong.

Then what was a,b,c,d?\n\n### Answer:\n[\nJust looking at the question, it does not fully specify the answer, because you only provide the answer for a given C,but the question is asking about computing general a,b,c,d. The last inference did not use C at all, it just used (for example) (2-3,5-3,2-n) and (2-3,5-3,2-n,2-3,5-3,2-n), Finally coupled with only one left hand side 2n-2=2n-2,you can answer one a,b,c,d,but there are infinitely many answers. So the question does not fully specify only one answer. It only hints that the final answer should be 2n-2,which is a reference. The correct answer is as follows:\n...\nNote that currently, recursion in the answer is not supported,So this question is currently not answerable.\n]\nNow what if I tell you a is the first digit of the school year you entered university (namely 2),b is the first digit of your WeChat account,(the one you use the most),c is the second digit of your student ID,and d is the last digit of your mobile phone number?

If they do, what are the equivalent changes in the original rule to achieve the same results?\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Invalid. In the updated rule, 'a◇b=(a①b)★(a②b)', a◇b would equal (8★5)★(8◇5)=26+√5, not 11/2. Similarly, (16★X)◇3 would equal (16★X)★3=32+Xß3, not 23/2. There's no way to achieve the same results using the new rule.]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the given operation rule is changed to,\na①b=a^2-b,\na②b=a+2b,\ncould you evaluate whether (4★2)◇5 and (16★X)◇3=23/2 still hold? If they do, what are the equivalent changes in the original rule to achieve the same results?\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Partially valid. Under the new rule, 'a◇b=(a①b)★(a②b)', a◇b would equal (4★2)★(4+2×2)=96, which is different from 11/2. But, in the case of (16★X)◇3, we have (16★X)★(16+2×3)=250, which is the same as the original rule after the change X=11. Hence, even though the first equation doesn't hold, the second one does with X=11. The changes made to the original rule to achieve the same results would be a①b=a^2-b and a②b=a+2b, which are exactly the new rules given.]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the given operation rule is change to,\na①b=5a-b?\na②b=b-a?\ncould you evaluate whether (4★2)◇5 and (16★X)◇3=23/2 still hold? If they do, what are the equivalent changes in the original rule to achieve the same results?\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Partially valid. Under the new rule, 'a◇b=(a①b)★(a②b)', a◇b would equal (4★2)★(2-4)=3. The second equation gives (16◇X)★(X◇3)=250=23/2, which is valid for X=3/2 because √16*X=4+3/2=11/2, and 11/2^2=25/4, then 25/4+9/4=25/2. The changes made to the original rule to achieve the same results would be a①b=5a-b and a②b=b-a, which are exactly the new rules given.]]",

Let me see if I can help you figure out how to tell the bot to give you useful responses.\n\nFirst off, for a custom operation A ￡ B to be defined, we must first define A and B. You have not defined A, B, or the operation A ￡ B. Without knowing these definitions the bot has no way to help you.\n\nOnce you have defined A, B, and the operation A ￡ B you then need to tell the bot what you want to know about it. Rather than asking the bot \"Solve this\" you need to ask specific questions about the operation or sets. For example, \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" or \"Give a definition of A ￡ B using only the symbols ∪, ∩, and ⋯\".\n\nRemember, the bot makes extensive use of previous exchanges before making a response. This helps it maintain consistency in reasoning over sequential related questions. So if you start by asking \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" and you may not be completely satisfied with the response. Then you can ask \"Explain the logic you used to reach your previous answer\" followed by \"Use any other symbols I did not list to explain it more simply\" and so on.\n\nProvide the bot with clear instructions, well-defined parameters, and specific questions to ensure the responses are useful for your goal. I hope that helps get you started! Let me know if you need any further assistance.\n\nYeah, I didnt had a full understanfing of it then.\n\nNow i am going to implement some offtopic Operation on said issue:\n\nHow does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.\n\n<blockquote>How does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.</blockquote>\n\nGive the bot an initial prompt that lays out your goal. For example:\n\n\"I am attempting to evaluate a custom operation called 'foresquare' defined as ∀ A, B ∈ S, A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)} where S is the set of real numbers. My goal is to become more proficient and efficient at finding the value of the foresquare of any given sets accurately and quickly.\"\n\nThen start with simple questions like \"How is the foresquare operation defined again?\" followed by \"What does the symbol △ mean?\" and \"What symbols denote the empty set?\". The bot will use the previous exchanges to remember your goals and adjust its responses appropriately.\n\nWhen asked to solve foresquare of two simple sets, give a model solution like: \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, we can find the foresquare by first noting A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)}. So A ∪ B = {1,2,3,4} and A ∩ B = {2,3}, which gives A △ B = {1,4}.\"\n\nGradually increase the complexity of the sets as you learn more and feel comfortable with foresquare via the bot. This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice. The bot can also explain the logic behind any of its solutions if you are still confused.\n\n<blockquote>This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice.</blockquote>\n\nMy english is not perfect at all\n\nyou are failing to answer OP question in the right manner and i have negative opinions regarding your responses\n\nI cant answer his question and that's why I'm proposing a different way to learn the concepts\n\nwhat about when A = B? what is the result then?\n\nNo no no! GPT has already LONG been known to not be able to provide consistent correct answers in a few circumstances, which include but are NOT LIMITED TO...\n\n1. Mathematical computations specifically involving fractions.\n2. Combining NN thought process with natural law physics.\n3. Any other many cases sadly I could list that Google already knows about and does it's best to prevent results with GPT-related bias.\n\nAs you can see things that GPT is bad at, generally fall under its own average capacity. In other cases as you can see with the \"natural law physics\" bullet, the vast answers that GPT provides fall completely under the \"moonshot\" category of failures, though still rather plausible.\n\nMy advice is this. Play with GPT yourself but do not ever, EVER, use GPT or any mainstream AI to design any nuclear weapons, plan an escape route for any for whatever reason, carry out a speech that comes of as rude  and obvious buy-in for AIs. Same applies for this, do not EVER have an AI do your homework for you and put points down for an exam. Only hard problems should be answered by AI, and only you can know whether an Ai solved a hard problem or not.\n\nAnd how do you Gu it\n\nFor you...\n\n[[{∀x∈(A∪B)\\(A∩B)}]]\n\nlet me guess you're a chat gpt tutee\n \n\nwhat about his question?\n\n",

Your task is to devise an effective strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of the given custom operation in the context of the provided question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question hints at it or clearly asks for it, take the time to devise a strategy or algorithm for efficient calculation before providing an answer.\n3. If the question doesn't specifically ask for it, your answer should be a numerical value or a group of numerical values.\n4. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★4 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=4:\n2\\times 4^1 = 8\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n8 - 4 = 4\n\n### Question:\nDevise a strategy for efficient integration or evaluation of 2★2 and show the process accordingly.\n\n### Answer:\nThe process for the by-hand integration would be as follows:\nFirst, we should recognize that \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx is \\int_{a}^{b} 2x^1 \\, dx, which fits the general formula of \\int_{a}^{b} x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.\nBased on this, we can work out the formula. First, we compute the upper limit, evaluated at b=2:\n2\\times 2^1 = 4\nThen, we compute the lower limit, evaluated at a=2:\n2*\\times 2^1 = 4\nFinally, we get the result by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n### Question:\nGiven a★4=15, devise a strategy for efficiently calculating the value of a★1, and display your process accordingly.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or'.e.g.[[1or2]]\n\n### Answer:\nGiven that the integration is with respect to x, to find the value of b in \\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx, we can use the known value and solve for a.\nStarting with the given integral formula: \\int_{a}^{4} 2x \\, dx=15\nFirst, we perform the integration:\n=\\frac{2x^2}{2} \\Big|_a^4\n=x^2\\Big|_a^4\n=(4^2-a^2)\\Big|_a^4\n=16-a^2\nThen, we set this result equal to the known value 15 and solve for a:\n15=16-a^2\na^2=16-15\na^2=1\na=±\\sqrt{1}\na=±1\nThere are two possible solutions for a, a=1 or a=-1.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that a★4=15, devise a useful trick or observation that can help calculate the value of a★2 efficiently. The original purpose of this rule is aimed at making this calculation easy to do in your head.\n\n### Answer:\nRecognizing that the integrand, 2x, when integrated becomes (2/2)x^2 = x^2, which gives us a simple quadratic in terms of the limits, can be very helpful in this calculation. \nThe resulting quadratic is a simple difference of perfect squares, allowing for quick mental calculation.\nAlso, we can recall that the difference of squares formula is a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b). In this case, the formula is 16-x^2=(4-x)(4+x).\nFor specific values, like 15, we can reverse engineer: if 15=16-x^2, then x^2=1, leading us to the values -1 and 1 which solve it efficiently.\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★-1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★0.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -1★1.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute -2★2.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your",

Examples\nf(x,y)=1,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nUsing the new operation, we can solve this problem as abov​\nThe question specifies an area 'D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3', on which we integrate the function 'f(x,y)=1'. Let's solve this using the formula 'f◆D = ∬_{D} f(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy'.\n\nThe given function f(x,y) is a constant function equating to 1. Since the area 'D' is a rectangle bounded by x values 1 to 2 and y values 1 to 3, we can compute the double integral straightforwardly. Here's how you perform the operations:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 1 dx dy (by integrating 1 from 1 to 2, the result will be 2-1=1) by integrating 1 from 1 to 3, the result will be 3-1=2. So integral will be 1*2=2\n\n\nf(x,y)=xy,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nTo solve this one, likewise, we just simply compute the double integral with the given function over the given rectangular area:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (xy) dx dy(calculate ∫ xy dx from 1 to 2 = x^2y/2; substitute boundaries: (2^2*y)/2 - (1^2*y)/2=3/2*y) By doing ∫ (3/2*y) dy from 1 to 3 it will be (3/2)*(3^2)/2 - (3/2)*(1^2)/2=9/2 - 3/2=6/2=3hence, integral is 3*∫ dy from 1 to 3 = 3(3-1)=3*2=6\nf(x,y)=x^2+y^2,D:1≤x≤2,1≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nHere's the solution:\n\n∫ from 1 to 3 ∫ from 1 to 2 (x^2 + y^2) dx dyFirst, solve ∫ (x^2 + y^2) dx from 1 to 2 = x^3/3 + xy^2; substitute boundaries: (2^3)/3 + 2y*y - (1^3)/3 - 1*y^2=7/3 + y^2Next, solve ∫ (7/3 + y^2) dy from 1 to 3 = 7/3y + y^3/3; substitute boundaries: 7/3*3 + 3^3/3 - 7/3*1 - 1^3/3=6 + 9 - 7/3 - 1/3=15 - 2*1/3 = 15 - 2/3 = 45/3 - 2/3 = 43/3 = 14 1/3.Hence, the result is 49/3.\nf(x,y)=x^2y,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nWe solve as before:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (x^2y) dx dy First, solve ∫ (x^2y) dx from 0 to 1 = x^3*y/3; substitute boundaries: 1^3*y/3 - 0^3*y/3 = 1/3*y Next, solve ∫ (1/3*y) dy from 0 to 3 = y^2/6; substitute boundaries: 3^2/6 - 0^2/6 = 9/6 = 3/2 Hence, the result is 3/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 3/2*3 = 9/2\nf(x,y)=xy^2,D:0≤x≤1,0≤y≤3, compute f◆D.\nThere is no change, and we use the new operation to calculate the integral directly.\nSame as above:\n\n∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 1 (xy^2) dx dy First, solve ∫ (xy^2) dx from 0 to 1 = x*y^2/2; substitute boundaries: 1*y^2/2 - 0*y^2/2 = 1/2*y^2 Next, solve ∫ (1/2*y^2) dy from 0 to 3 = y^3/6; substitute boundaries: 3^3/6 - 0^3/6 = 27/6 = 9/2 Hence, the result is 9/2*∫ dy from 0 to 3 = 9/2*3 = 27/2\nWhat will the following integral expression simplifies to? Prove your solution and turn it into decimal with at most two digits after decimal.\n\nf(x,y)=x^2 + y^2, D: x^2+y^2 = 4, x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0, compute f◆D.\nMy answer is 11/3\\pi, but markdown only supports latex, can you calculate this integral for me?\nBy using polar coordinates\nWe know x^2+y^2 = r^2. So, we can transform the coordinate system to polar coordinates where x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ). The Jacobian of this transformation is r. The new integral limits for the given circle with radius 2 will be from 0 to 2pi for θ and 0 to 2 for r.\n\nSo, our new integral is: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 ((rcos(θ))^2 + (rsin(θ))^2) * r dr dθ Simplify the integrand: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 * (cos^2(θ) + sin^2(θ)) dr dθ Since sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1: ∫ from 0 to 2pi ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr dθ Now we solve the r integral: ∫ from 0 to 2 r^2 dr = [r^3/3] from 0 to 2 = 8/3 The final integral becomes: ∫ from 0 to 2pi (8/3) dθ = (8/3)θ from 0 to 2pi = (8/3)*2pi = 16/3 * pi = 11/3 * pi. So, the result is",

Please summarize them into two parts.\n\n# Start the advance survey.\nNow let us do a survey process to better understand the questioner’s proficiency in solving problems with this type of new operator.\nThis section contains a number of requirements for us to investigate:\nformal language\nknowledge\nreasoning\nmodeling\nAbstraction\nMetrics\n\nNow let's first target the \"formal language and knowledge\".\nCan you give one example for this question?\n\n# solve basic problem\n\n# summarize again\n\n# start the final survey\nAdvanced Research Refining,\nlet's do some advanced research refining for the “formal language and knowledge” aspect；\nPlease pick one example to refine, the example is；\nr42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?\n \n# give the question\nNow go back to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nCan you answer this?\nHow would you describe the process?\n\nWould you like me to write a report for my answer?\n\nI would say “yes” to write a report.\nFirst of all, can you give a summary for the requirements from perspective A?\n\nNow summarize the requirements from perspective B.\n\n# give me my task, not the solution and explanation.\nThe whole process is divided into two parts.Part A is to introduce or build the formal problem and part B is to evaluate the problem directly and determine whether the problem has followed the formal problem requirements. The purpose of this exercise was to train me in different ways to answer the problems following the principles of the formal requirement.\nSo during the whole process, there are another two perspectives that I need to ask your help to check and organize.\nPerspective C focuses on evaluating the correctness of the solution of the questioner, to see whether the solution follows the requirements and the rule. For perspective C, you are expected to evaluate the correctness from the perspective of both aspects and give an overall evaluation for it. You should assess the solution using a score from 0 to 100, with a total of 50 points for each aspect. You should always provide the numeric score and an explanation, even if you explicitly say ‘no’, ‘not mentioned’, or ‘not mentioned’ explicitly.\nPerspective D focuses on evaluating the evolution process of my problem-solving strategies. Specifically, based on the problem description and my solutions, analyze my decision-making and finally give me a rating for the overall thinking process. For perspective D, should use conflicting contrast methods to evaluate the evolution process. That means, for each sub-question, start by assuming that my thinking process is correct and evaluate the thinking of the sub-question as a whole. Then, assuming that my thinking is wrong, evaluate the thinking of this sub-question as a whole. Two evaluations, one for each correct and incorrect assumption, are distinguished by points. For example, 34.5/100 65.5/100 means that the 'correct' thinking score is 34.5 and the 'incorrect' thinking score is 65.5. For cases that cannot be distinguished, use '/' to emphasize the confusion. Even if you say ‘no’, ‘no mention’ or ‘obvious’ explicitly, you should always provide the score and an explanation.\n\nNow let us go to the perspective B, The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.\nDoes the answer to the above question follow the above rule?\n# if the answer is YES.\nGreat, let me ask two more follow-up questions to check your understanding.\nFirst, can you answer this question?[[New operation r42¥73 is the transformed form of what operation?]]\n\nSecond, How would you describe the process?\n\n# if the answer is NO, what is the major problem?\n\n# give me report\nGenerate a report for me.\nRequirements are:\nperspective A, B, C, and D, four parts of requirements.\nPerspective A is the problem definition from the previous question:\n\n[[ There is a new operation defined as follows:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\na and b are positive integers.\nSolve this problem using the above definition.]]\n\nPerspective B is the rule for the above-defined operation, and the rules are:\n[[The operation rule is:\na¥b=a^b-b^a.\nwhere a and b are positive integers.]]\n\nPerspective C:\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to follow the above rule is:\n\n# extract the quantitative ratings and explanations\nMy ability to find the transformed form of a complex operation is:\n\nPerspective D:\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy ability of formal language is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Mathematical knowledge is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy Quality of reasoning is:\n\n\n# extract the whole number and explanation.\nMy quality of Mathematical modeling is:\n\n\nExtract the whole number and explanation.
