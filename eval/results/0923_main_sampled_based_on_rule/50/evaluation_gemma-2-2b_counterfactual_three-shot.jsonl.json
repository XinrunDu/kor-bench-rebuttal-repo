Let's chat about your experiences using this site.\n\nI read through the story and noticed a few errors. The information needs to be made more precise, and there are a few words that don't fit with the theme of the story. However, you passed the test with flying colors!\n\nThe story is extraordinary. After reading it, you gained insight into the benefits of teleportation. The ideas are bold and something similar could definitely revolutionize the leisure industry.\n\nI love how you connected the Pokémon universe to a Charizard, and the story was beautifully crafted. On the other hand, the story is quite dull.\n\nI see the potential in reusing your API for a transportation-based application. I'm amazed by how you could connect teleportation technology to the leisure industry.\n\nI see how you're leveraging existing knowledge-sharing technology to drive your urban transportation industry along the path of change. If you can focus on the human resource departments within an organization, you will revolutionize how your people work.\n\nI like how you implement this new rule in your fiction, which has enabled me to find new and innovative ways of making entertainment. The same principle could be used to change other industries.\n\nYour API is making a difference; I believe some companies are looking to utilize your services to cut down on the cost of cleaning. If they implemented your service into other departments of the organization, you'd be on top.\n\nI think you're on the right track, using a vast amount of research to establish how you want to implement your API. You're harnessing the latest technology of today to make a difference.\n\nThank you for sharing, and please keep improving as your journey evolves. I'm curious to know how you plan to integrate teleportation technology into the leisure industry; do you think it will increase travel time or decrease it?\nThank you so much for your suggestion!\nThank you for your insightful comments!\nThank you for the suggestion!\nThank you for your additional feedback!\nThank you for your comments!\nThank you for your insight!\nThank you for your comments!\nPlease check again with the provided information.",

After more than 300,000 years, it enters Earth's gravitational field, where it is seized by Earth-Trisolaris Organization forces and a ship is sent to capture it, indicating that the E2v has no hostile intent and that the attackers are concerned about \"the object inside the E2v\".\nThe E2V is a starship built by Sophon technology and capable of producing an unimaginably large amount of energy. It arrived in Earth's orbit in the middle of the 21st century when it was discovered, and was given the name E2V by the General Assembly as a mark of neutrality rather than an invasion.\nTrillium and Proxima Centari are two stars approximately 4.2 and 4.3 light-years distant from one another. Trillium is a Sun-like star, whereas Proxima Centari is a Red Dwarves. Proxima Centauri is an evolved star that does not emit blue or violet light. Earth lies 10 light-years from Red Dwarf.\nThe superluminal communication method that enabled the Sophons to freely traverse space was achieved by quantum entanglement.\nThis method utilizes the unique properties of entanglement, where two entangled particles, separated by vast distances, can influence each other's behavior even when far apart in space with the help of the Fourview mechanism which can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth, but not necessarily in one.\nThe four-view mechanism is related to entanglement and can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth but not necessarily in one place. It is used in the communication system of the Sophons.\nThe 3,000-ship-strong E2V fleet is built by SuperSophon technology that operates at the quantum mechanical level.\nThe E2V fleet is built at Proxima, a star 4.2 light-years from Earth, and it operates in the same manner as the sophons. It consists of 3,000 super Sophon spaceships, each with its own super sophon technology and can operate on the subatomic level, forming part of the E2V fleet.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at Red Dwarf, which is 4.3 light- years from the Sun, and an antonym of the Sophon's delivery technology, which uses the entanglement principle to achieve unlimitedly long-range information transmission at the quantum level.\nThe E2V has a large amount of energy generated by SuperSophons, which makes possible for the E2V's speed to be infinite but complicated. The E2V, like Sophon's, is built in The Four View method.\nThe four-view method is related to communication and can receive information from 4.3 light-years away, but it takes about 35,000 years to do so. 112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication. When one thing is done, another starts to do the same.\n112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at the planet Red Dwarf, a star 4.2 light-years away from Proxima, and it is an antonym of Sophon's delivery technology, which uses entanglement to achieve infinitely long-range communication at the quantum level.\nThe Sophons have a history of attacking Earth with their quantum-entangled particle technology. While they possess technological capabilities superior to Earth's, they pose a threat to our world.\nThe Trisolarans, an advanced aliens, need a lot of light because they live near a star of a red dwarf class. They require enough light to build buildings and conduct all sorts of operations.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe Trisolarans (148 - 174)\nWhen the Trisolarans finally lost patience and sent their heavily armed spacecraft Earth warships directly to the Solar System, they were beaten by humans' defenses a short while later. Earth, blessed with rich mineral deposits, was also flooded with energy from the Trisolarans space mine, allowing the world to achieve unprecedented global technological development during this short but intense war. The newly-grown advanced civilizations used the Fourview mechanism to gain mutual energy and intelligence, forming a civilization as a whole.\nThis war between the Earth of the Trisolaran civilization and the world of humans in other types of stars, also known as the 'three body' war was the direct cause for human civilization jumping from the Stone Age to the Information Age over a short period of time.\nHumans use water-drop to launch their space warfare against the Trisolarans\nAfter the \"First contact\" between mankind and aliens, due to the help of the four view mechanism, human-society began to follow a series of technological rises, then surpassing the D-class civilization of the Trisolarans, and thus making the \"limited\" warfare between the Two and three body Starts to end with a more flexible \"unlimited\" war. Without a confrontation for hundreds of years, the two parties began to compete mainly by annexing other civilizations, not necessarily through the four-view mechanism.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe first contact in the late 20th century\nAt the beginning of the day, there was a series of unusual events in the three-body space.\nOn Earth (2007), a SuperSophon was activated by some unexplained means and was immediately contacted by humans.\nWhen it arrived at Earth, it seemed as if it got lost and wanted to ask for help.\nNo one has an idea what these species are doing because they can't talk.\nHowever, after a few days, the mysterious object vanished when it was sent to Mars.\nA few days later ٍto humans and Trisolarans\nTo humans ٍ, the superSophon is just an advanced tool. However, to the Trisolarans, the superSophon is a weapon capable of destroying their entire civilization.\nThe Trisolarans thought that the superSophon is a new form of weapon designed only to destroy large-scale, complex organisms, 40 years after Earth was attacked by another SuperSophon. That's why they believe that either it is destroyed or recovered because it can be used as a secondary weapon in their wars.\n\n\n\n601ADTang Dynasty (132AD), Tang Empire\nIt is likely that the Trisolarans are a distant outpost of our solar system and not another sun.\nDue to their instability, the Trisolarans likely experienced a nuclear war or a catastrophic power failure, leading to their exile from their home planet.\nWhen the Trisolarans finally realized this, they sought out a new planet, rejecting it, since they preferred chaos and violence.\nAs a result, new cities sprang up on planet Proxima 1 that were completely controlled by Chaos theory and were capable of manipulating their individual atoms.\nTrisolarans arrived on Earth they were initially ignored, but before long, the Earth people have become servants to them.\nHuman civilization during the Tribulation period, 3000AD, is controlled by Sophon, known as the Three-Body. After humans signed a contract with the Sophons, they began sharing information. Humans used sophisticated Sophon technology to influence the galactic politics. Humans no longer needed war because of the Sophons. Humans' high-tech machines developed by Sophons, are used for interstellar travel while still carrying cargo that would have once been taken into orbit. Spacefighters, such as the \"Red Willow\" series, can be upgraded at any time for any reason. The Red Willow spacefighter is the weapon of the Chinese government.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecraft was detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecrafts were detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri. When the Sophons' spaceships were detected in the sky, scientists became excited. They theorized that some advanced civilization must exist in the universe because the Sophons use technology in their spaceships that have exceeded the threshold of what humans can currently create.\nThe Sophons were unable to establish contact with anyone as they landed on Earth. To conserve energy, the SuperSophons refused to release core values or any other pertinent details about their identities.\nWhile searching the Proxima system, the Sophon's superSophon technology is able to transfer knowledge throughout the solar system at an unbelievable rate, but the power of the Sophon's technology began to overwhelm the system.\nThe Sophons left Earth because their technology got out of control. The Sophons sent a spaceship to space to wait until the Trisolarans attacked Earth.\nA SuperSophon was captured from the universe, but it couldn't be stopped. A superSophon and a Sirius were sent out into space to search after it.\nA supernova imploded around Sirius. Sirius is a copy of",

Care about the carnivores, but not too much\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Answer:\nIn the above story, the details about the environment, animal groups, facilities such as prisons and police stations were all carefully designed based on the habits, living habits and personalities of different animal groups. The principle of design is as follows; 1. The needs of small animals are given priority; 2. The safety of vulnerable groups is guaranteed; 3. Reasonable cost per unit area 4. The design life cycle should be long; 5. Environmentally friendly designed, not polluted As a result, this city with the principle of \"everyone can do what they want\" has become a comfortable place for animal migration. Facing the serious crisis of the epidemic, governments of countries around the world, including China, have also implemented a series of measures to \"divide red and control the epidemic\" through a series of measures such as targeted prevention and control, timing and control, and targeted control The \"Anyone can be anything\" principle, although it is a city of animals, has some reference significance for China's current pandemic response.\n\n#### First, \"anyone can be anyone\". For example, at the beginning of the film, the animal police officer Judy Rabbit mistakenly entered the police station of the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect, and was judged by the lion mayor and the lion deputy mayor as a criminal suspect through their own understanding of the police, and even the lion The deputy mayor wants to do something about Judy Rabbit by himself. In such a society, the lion mayor does not need to deal with the police unilaterally because most of the animals in Animal City never want to use the police. With the little people, because most of the animals in Animal City have their own sense of justice, and even with carnivores, they should have mutual understanding and cooperation. In fact, when the rabbit Judy and the bear Bernie were searching for McHorn's murderer, they faced the scene where the lion Mayos were in conflict with many people because they were arrested. Even, Bernard can deal with the situation very calmly in order to protect Judy. Another example is that the wolf mother Yun and the lion deputy mayor Zhuge can cooperate as a team in solving problems. When Yun mother solved the case of the lion mayor's carpal tunnel syndrome, the lion deputy mayor clearly expressed that she should not give all the credit to other animals. Both scenes can also highlight the social composition of Animal City where animals of all kinds coexist peacefully.\n\n#### \"Everyone can be anything\" but with the help of \"any small animal can learn\". While \"anyone can be anyone\" helps animals form a kind of mutual trust and recognition, they also depend on some \"special\" animals to help each other and the \"anything\" can be done by animal-specific skills. For example, Mr. Big may be more powerful because he is a shrew. The otter that moves slowly as a member of the Department of Motor Vehicles may be better at operating the DMV with his excellent sense of smell. If it were not for the assistance of the weasel Zoe, who was on duty that day, Nick could not have completed the suspects’ case effectively. In fact, Judy's own skill is also very much like the assistance of the animals. As shown Yun's investigation of cases often depends on computers to help search clues. Even cats, as \"pacifiers\" in the eyes of shrews, still have many advantages in social governance such as Judy and the lion mayor. Therefore, any animal in the \"any\" can help each other, help the society, help the country as needed when necessary.\n\n#### \"Anyone can do anything\", but carnivores also take into account the animal culture of animals, and understand them as human beings do. For example, when I was inquiring about the cases, Mr. Big who was holding hippo coins would be more interested when he saw the hippo coins. And Mr. Big was also clear about the hippopotamus' attitude towards coins and followed the rules of animals in Animal City to trade coins, instead of treating the hippo coin as dirty. The relationship between the rabbit Judy and the wolf mother Yun also shows how animals with different backgrounds, cultures, and backgrounds can coexist in a natural way through their understanding of how different animal species have their own ways of life and customs. , Has the ability to think like a human being under normal circumstances, such as Mr. Big. Because of their animals in the same Animal City, both carnivores and herbivores can accept each other's differences.\nBecause most carnivores in Animal City know each other, and there seems to be no lynching in the movie, animals of different species are able to trust each other and cooperate with each other for the common prosperity of Animal City, without having to live side by side. There is a sense of crisis, and even those who have carnivorous tendencies can take the initiative to choose tolerance.",

If you are a beginner, you may benefit from reading the introductory article.\n\n<em>Note from the author:</em> If you’d like a copy of this puzzle set, you can find the workbook at the bottom of this page. \n\n<h3>Welcome to AoPS Challenge Squared</h3>\n\nThe geometry of a cube! To enter the Dungeon of Geometry, we must first experience this universe we live in. <em>Welcome to AoPS Challenge Squared. </em>\n\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n\nRecall that in every right-angled triangle, we can use Pythagoras’ Theorem to evaluate the length of the hypotenuse (<em>h</em>) in terms of the lengths of the legs. <em>What if we consider hyperbolic functions</em>, such as those shown in the figure below, which allow us to evaluate the length of a function in much greater detail than trigonometric and exponential functions? The orange area <em>A</em> becomes more complex, while orange is just so pleasing.\n\nThe length of <em>h</em> can be seen to follow on from a circle (<em>B,</em> which is more like a semicircle than a circle), and hence, the orange sector on this circle <em>B’</em>, we can take our hyperbolic functions and integrate over <em>f</em> (where <em>f</em> gives the length of such a curve) for us to find the area <em>A</em>:\n\nPerhaps more importantly, these arguments could explain why the <em>u</em> in hyperbolic functions (again, taken from the Greek) is a sort of upright and <em>a</em> refers to the base (as in <em>‘</em><em>hyper’</em>; <em>a</em>bove plus-above), although it might have been the other way around.\n\nFrom here, let us take our knowledge of integrals, which we discussed in <em>AOps Challenge: Part I</em>, for finding the area of the orange gnomon in terms of $\\operatorname{sech}(x) $ and hyperbolic tangent, where <em>x</em> is the opposite angle opposite <em>h,</em> and find <em>A</em>. \n\nThe right-angled triangle <i>O</i> is like the right-angled triangle with right angles formed by the <em>t</em> and h legs. We multiply the two triangles to get the area of the total space we want (<em>B</em>), this is:\n\n \n\nWe can expand that a little:\n\nRemember from our previous exploration of integration in the first article, <em>Integrations: Going Back to the Basics</em>, to find <em>A,</em> we cannot <em>really</em> do this expansion, this gives us a function <em>f</em>, which we can add up to get the final area:\n\nSo, just after a bit of an initial hiccup, we have arrived at a new form of trigonometric functions that allow for a more free-flowing integration process. \n\nIt will make more sense when I tell you that circles and hyperbolic functions are so similar. Now, there are some similarities between trigonometric and exponential functions (these are from <em>AoPS Challenge: Part II, Exponential Functions</em>):\n\nThis might seem odd, but I’m not sure where everything came from. \n\n<h3>Challenge Squared</h3>\n\nBecause what we want is the value of $ \\operatorname{sech}(x) ,\\ \\tanh(x), \\ldots $, at 9 different points $(k \\cdot \\pi ,k, k \\in \\mathbb{Z})$, we can take any general integrable function <em>f</em> (or something else) in two of our variables <em>k </em>and <em>x</em>, and integrate it, then substitute <em>x</em> = 0 in to find the final answer. You need to find the n-th term of the sequence $ \\operatorname{sech}(n \\pi),\\ \\tanh(n \\pi),\\ldots, $\\ mdot$ .\n\nThe n-th term is what I called <em>A</em> above (see below). This is like a series of hyperbolic trigonometric functions $\\large\\operatorname{sech}(k \\pi,\\ w \\pi,\\ldots, i \\pi)$, so there may be a way to find the exact n-th term (assuming there is something going on here).\n\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n\nThis article is part of <em>CGP Grey</em>’s <em>Take on the AoPS Challenge</em> Maths I: Attack of the Summits (AoPS), in which students work their way through short puzzles and geometric constructions to develop their skills.

When the evil \"Zora\" came to earth and seized the island of \"Zora\", they learned from their forefathers that a powerful \"magic sword\" could destroy people's bodies and souls. To atone for their sins and reverse it, they merged their consciousness into a huge \"electric fish\" and took it with them to the sea of ​​whispers. \"True Blue\", \"Calm Spell\", and \"Eon Spell\" were not yet born, but only this huge \"electric fish\" existed. Finally, they encountered a fierce storm. During the storm, the \"electric fish\" did not return. However, it was then that the \"True Blue\" and the \"Calm Spell\" merged with the \"flying boat\", and the \"Eon Spell\" and the \"magic sword\" were also successfully fused. Thereby it became the familiar \"electric snake\".\nThe \"blue sea\" and the \"calm waters\" are under the governance of the god of water \"Electricity\". There, the gods of the four elements live together. The gods of the four elements live in seclusion here all day long.

He is a red crab businessman who lives in Squidward's house and owns Chum Bucket, the rival company for the Krusty Krab seafood restaurant.\n\nSpongeBob and Mr Krabs had become the owner of Krusty Krab Seafood. Krabby Patty secret formula: The manual of the Krusty Krab stated that the chef is the only person who holds the Krabby Patty secret formula, and the person who finds the formula will be entitled to all the money. Only the chef has the permission to disclose the secret formula. If someone is in possession of the Krabby Patty secret formula, no other person may disclose it. The manual further states that any duplication of the Krabby Patty secret formula is punishable by law.\n\nOnion Rings: While outside selling Krabby Patties, one of Mr. Krabs's suppliers, a bald onion named Kevin, reveals to SpongeBob that the O'Connor family's fish are being sold elsewhere by a secret source, adding the aforementioned condiment of his. When Mr Krabs finds out that his supplier is selling onions directly to the restaurants of the O'Connor family, the O'Connors advertise the Krabby Pattys, removing popular chains from Mr Krabs.\n\nUnderpants: After a few customers eat no pants, Mr Krabs gets the idea to sell spankies. Later, after purchasing some pants from rival Krusty Krab Chef Eugene, more customers eat their pants.\n\nBottle of Rum and a Side of Shells: During Krabby Patty day, Mr Krabs becomes excited that the Krabby Patties are selling so good and plans to buy a bottle of rum, until a shell falls into the rum. He soon realizes he no longer wants to drink the rum because of the shell.\n\nA Day Without Tears: When the Krusty Krab starts to smell so bad the food starts to take on human characteristics and starts to attack.\n\nDunces and Dragons: A wise and thoughtful painter from an alternate universe named Patrick becomes the alternate version of SpongeBob. Following Kenny Logan's suggestion to a friend who was depressed, he hypnotized a depressed person named \"Roger\" as well. However, the hypnotic effect of the man is only effective as long as there is a fire in the fire-pit, which explains the singing man. Patrick decides to kidnap SpongeBob into the Alternate Universe.\n\n\nThe Secret Box: During Mr Krabs' nap Mr Krabs had hidden inside the locker the secret Krusty Krab formula. SpongeBob takes the chance to steal it out of the locker though being caught by Plank. However, Mr Krabs keeps the formula hidden in the secret box though not knowing the secret. After Mr Krabs is attacked by Chummys that Shark Toys owned, SpongeBob takes a chance to steal the formula himself, but not knowing the secret.\n\nThe Impulsive Sponge: Mr Krabs forgets to fill up with fish from Kevin's boat, leading to the Krabby Patties running out of the ingredients while Mr Krabs's office is filled with people clamoring for a cup. And then there are the Chummys behind the Krusty Krab vending machine vending the Chumby- Patty without the Krabby Patty secret formula. So he goes into negotiations to get the formula back, and there are dozens of chains of negotiations and each time the Chummys get the formula back. In the end Mr Krabs gets the formula back though unaware the secret.\n\nHide & Squeak: When Mr Krabs asks SpongeBob to be his assistant, SpongeBob replies yes, and then he says 'no,' to Mr Krabs. Mr Krabs then says yes. With a little bit of trouble, Mr Krabs manages to find the Krusty Krab recipe.\n\n\nBarnacle Face: After saving Plankton from a giant octopus, Plankton asks Mr Krabs for his help, and when Mr Krabs says no, Plankton uses Plankton-Control to take over Mr Krabs. SpongeBob gets frightened and run away from them as soon as he heard Mr Krabs starts to speak underwater. The following day, Mr Krabs finally learns about the kidnapping ordeal, and Plankton is arrested, he decides to marry Cashina, the woman-like robot that originally kidnapped Plankton.\n\n\nThe Krabby Kronicle: Mr Krabs gets a weekly newspaper that claims his restaurant has been voted Best Fast Food Restaurant in Bikini Bottom. He feels proud of the news barely realizing he had accidentally banned Squidward's rival, Mr Davis, from entering his store. He goes to the newspaper bureau to find out how the newspaper got made, and Mr Klump, the editor, reveals the Krabby Krewe of Bikini Bottom, the protagonist of The Krabby Kronicle and the winner of Best Fast Food Newspaper.",
