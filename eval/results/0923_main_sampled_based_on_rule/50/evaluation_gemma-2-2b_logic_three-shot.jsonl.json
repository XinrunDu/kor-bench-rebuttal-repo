A disjunctive normal form of a propositional formula is normal if the disjuncts contain all logically distinct occurrences of the antecedent, otherwise it contains redundant disjuncts. As an example, ¬(p∧q)∧¬w can be written either as ¬p∧¬¬q∧¬w [1] (a conjunctive normal form (DNF)) or ¬p∧(¬q∧¬w) ∨ ¬p∧¬q∧¬w (a DNF)\n][6]. If disjuncts of a propositional formula are arranged in a linear fashion (i.e., such that variables are arranged in lexicographical order F[3\n][4]) a DNF is said to be lexically normalised. A propositional formula is lexically normalised if if the disjuncts cannot be further reduced. It is not difficult to prove that any instance of ¬p↔p must be lexically normalised.\nDisjunctive normal forms are used both to express and reduce propositional logic formulas. When two formulas are logically equivalent, they are generally equivalent in DNF (assuming that the two formulas are connected to each other in the same order). As an example, ¬p∨¬q is logically equivalent to ¬p∧¬q. In contrast, ​¬(p∨q)¬r\n][1] is not a logical implication of ¬p∨¬q¬r because two of the variables can occur in multiple disjuncts. A reduction of propositional logic formula, on the other hand, is not necessarily a normalization, such as the proposition ¬p∨q¬r can be reduced to ¬p∧¬q∨¬r.\nExpressions in prefix notation such as -p∨¬p^(¬q∧¬r) -p^¬q^¬r (where the first expression reduces to the second by the idempotent disjunction and the substitution laws; see [6]) are also in DNF.\n\nIf two formulas are symmetric the implication and disjunction of the expression is the same. If the implication is `p∨ψ` the [`p∧¬ψ’ `p∧ψ](formula] is satisfied when p is true. A propositional logical formula A must be logically equivalent to (A & ¬A)^1 (propositional formula NAND^|) (negation), which can be written as P ∨ Q (disjunction of propositional logic formulas) when A is true. ¬Q (negation of propositional logic formulas` can be written as Q ∨ ¬P (disjunction). When it is true ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) is true ∧(¬P ∨ ¬Q)] (logical ∨). When it is true ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q)) = ¬P ∨Q] ((¬(¬ P ∧ ¬ Q) = P ∨ Q). This equality can also be written as the DNF form of P ∨ Q where P, Q, and R are arbitrary variables. This property can be extended to multiple variables, with the equivalent of DNF formula A ∨ ∧(B ∨ C ... N.) for the DNF `(A ∨ (B ∨ (C ∨ ..., N))). [`LNOT^2](formula]) ∨/∨[(X ∨ Y ∨ Z ∨ ... N. ∨ X ∨ Y). ∨ (X ∨ Y ∨ Z ... N) ∨X ])] (prefix negation operator: `LNOT] (formula],)) &[(`is also an equivalent format using standard notation. Like the prefix negation `LNOT^1 and DNF prefix notation, the brackets of a DNF expression can even be used to calculate the truth table for the formula. For example, [p∧q∧r](formula] can be written in DNF [((p ∧ (q ∧ r))))) ∧((q ∧ (p ∧ r))) ∧((r ∧ (p ∧ q)))] ∧((r ∧ (p & (q ∧ r))))]] or in prefix notation [((p ∧ Q)(p ∧ R)(((Q &( R))) [[Z]]][2]]*((Qx&Rx*Zx*R2]]))))) where X, Q, R, and Z are arbitrary variables. DNF DNF form is a powerful mathematical theorem-building tool, useful for the creation of theorems, logic, arguments of various kinds, proofs, theorems. One advantage of DNF is that it can be used to write any propositional logic formula as the logical expression P ∨ Q. There are two logical equivalences which are useful: The DNF is reduced to one statement by the following rule: ¬(¬A∧¬B)→(A∨B) ((¬ A∨¬ B)→( A∧ B]],). Thus, a given formula with 2^ A literals in DNF is equivalent to p (formula:P ∨ Q). Correctly identifying and spotting many variables (variables of propositional logic formulas) can be challenging. For this reason, most logic programs consist of a logical expression with no such problems. However, there is a situation where such a simplification becomes undesirable. An example is the situation in which variables are represented as in the program 7 and when the program contains all variables, the F[3\n][4] is: `p&q∧¬r&¬q∧r^(¬¬p∨¬p∧r∧¬r∧p^(¬p∧¬r^(¬¬q^¬p^(¬r∧¬q)))>= (p∧¬¬p∧¬q)^p∧q∧¬r`. It can be written this form: When it is in a single line. ¬P ∨(P^¬¬Q))), (respectively corresponding to the\n\n![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189203673-4b172447-fefb-4e1d-9060-6a280f2967e2.png)\n\n> [1037].\n\n![19]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66504944/189205471-d255c503-4fa1-4fb1-b123-3017320a3a34.png\n\n## 使用与输出格式：编写符合格式的逻辑配置和输出。\n\n- 使用自定义规则的定制逻辑配置，从输入字符流中回答，生成符合自定义规则格式的回答并写到输出字符流中。\n> 输入： 字符流，满足以下格式`[输入字符流:{\"message\":\"Hello, what's your name?\"}]`\n> **问题**: `[“**Output:**”，格式：\"Hello, what's your name?\"]`\n> 将自定义规则的定制逻辑配置应用到字符流输入`[“'outputiterating'\": [[\"message\" : \"Hello, what's your name?\"]]]]`\n> `输出`: `Hello, what's your name?`\n用[0]中的函数实现输出。\n\n\n## 编译选项：\n\n```\n{\n    \"version\":{\n        \"major\":1,\n        \"compatible\":1\n        \"compatibleVersion\":2\n    },\n    \"timeout\":600,\n    \"logLevel\":2,\n    \"exitMap\":{\n        \n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n# 实现：\n\n## 1). 自定义逻辑  ([customlogic.md])\n\n## 2). 实现文字输入([LNOT^2和calculateTruthtable],CustomConfig)\n\n## 3). 逻辑输入输出格式([outputiterating])\n\n## 4). 编译参数,错误信息返回([Config.Output])\n\n![image](autoupload.png)",

Thus, a rule is:\n<= [0 0 2] in which a variable representing O for the circuit diagram comes before two variables representing I1 and I2.\n\nHowever, the rule goes wrong when the output code \"0\" precedes before the variables I1 and I2 because it conflicts with the logic function.\nThe output of the circuit diagram corresponds to a variable with a different value. \"0\" is generated before \"1\", which is not consistent.\n\nIn order to avoid this conflict, two ways to solve should be kept in mind:\n> 1. Use \"0\" and \"1\" to replace numbers. When the value of O is represented as \"0\", replace \"0\" with \"2\", and the value of O is represented as \"1\"? When the value of O is represented as \"1\", replace \"1\" with \"0\" because there is no need to subtract \"0\" to get \"1\". This is because the answer outputs \"O\" which does not specify whether it is \"0\" or \"1\". Instead, we should represent \"0\" and \"1\". \n\n> 2. Use the function f(x) = ((x+1)/2) in order to obtain another positive variable. Substitute this variable value onto the variable of O. Instead of writing \"0\" to represent \"0\" and \"1\" to represent \"1\", we substitute \"f(O)\" to represent \"f(O)\". Then all we need to do is to change O to \"0\" when represented as f(O) = 0 and represent \"1\" when represented by f(O) = 1. This will be more efficient than explicitly displaying f(O) =\"O\" and also is faster than to derive explicitly. \n\nThanks for reading.

In this question, your assistant’s goal is to solve a problem (not memorizing the rule).\n> 2. Your assistant shall provide the answer of each iteration (when the assistant finds an answer). In addition, you are also requested to indicate the problem your assistant is trying to solve (that is I1-O) because the number of inputs used in a simple circuit diagram [[I,I1,I2,I3,O]] are many.\n> 3. For every problem/solution found by the assistant, it shall provide the answer with the selected input value. This indicates that you are responsible for finding the next iteration until a problem is solved.\n> 4. To solve a problem/solution, there are several ways to tackle problems. For example, in this problem, try to find the output in a previous iteration as the output variation with respect to the input used in the previous iteration. In addition, your assistant shall notify you when a new problem is generated, so this is your opportunity to take leadership and solve based on the rule (find a new problem)\n> 5. The problem/output/input that you are tasked to solve does not have to only use the given number. Try to add several possible variations of the problem/solution you are trying to solve. Because there is a pattern that is likely to be a similar rule of the previous iteration, use this change method as an alternative method if there is no answer from the provided problem/solution.\n> 6. Your answer will include a list of problems/solutions sorted chronologically (with the sequence of each problem that is executed). At a minimum, the answer should include one or more solutions for every problem in the description (in the form [[I1||I2||I3,O1,O2,O3...],i.e. the problem/output/input for [I1,I2,I3,...,O1,O2,O3,...].)\n\n### Question:\nConsider a simple circuit diagram with an I-O graph, [[I1,I2,I3,O]]; [[0,0,+,0],[0,1,+,0],[1,0,+,0],[1,1,+,0],[1,1,-,+]], in the format of [[input,output]]; [output when circuit operates, output when circuit malfunctions].\n\nFor example, in the first graph, the output for the input \"0,0\" is \"0\". In the second graph, the output for the input \"1,0\" is \"0 and the output for the input \"1,1\" is \"0\",\n\nWhat is the output of the simple circuit diagram corresponding to the following input pattern?\n\nPlease provide your answer in the form [[I1,I2,I3,O]] in ([[input,output]], [output when circuit operates, output when circuit malfunctions]).\n\n### Question:\nConsider a simple circuit diagram with an I-O record from a simple circuit with the formula [[input,output,output when circuit operates]]. \n\n\nFor a simple circuit diagram with the formula [[a,a,a]], how many outputs are generated (the number of possible inputs for the simple circuit diagram with the formula [[I,0,O]]; [I when Circuit is operates, O when Circuit malfunctions]) if the output, I1 is \"a\", I2 is \"1\", and I3 is \"-\" (O = \"+\", I1 is 0, the negative symbol is represented as \"?\")?\n\nYou can use >> source control (i.e. GitLab, GitHub) together with FFEditor to monitor your daily progress. It is recommended to write short messages for each iteration so FFEditor can easily locate it without needing code/text documentation.\n\nFFEditor helps you to monitor the progress on each iteration daily. If the code is not submitted on time, the task can be marked as incomplete.\n\n### Instruction:\nIt is recommended that you use separate computers so you can easily track the progress of your task. Once the tasks are done, your code should be rewritten and uploaded to the GitHub or GitLab source code to be passed to the grade sheet.\n\n### Instructions:\n> 1. If you use a virtual machine to write the code, it is highly recommended to use “VirtualBox” or “BootCamp.” They are free operating systems and can be downloaded after the installation from their official websites.\n> 2. It is recommended to avoid using software such as “Windows XP” or “Windows7” as it is not recommended because each computer hardware is different than the other. \n> 3. The code you use can be used in other programming competitions and for practical problems. So please write as much clear code as possible.\n\n\n### Checking Question Points\nIn this practical course, we use FFEditor's educational tool and grade sheet for checking and grading. FFEditor is intended for learning a programming language, but once this course is completed, you will receive a grade for that. In addition, the whole course is graded.\nIf you see all points are marked as empty and all test results are in the yellow and green test result, there is a chance that you may have missed a key difference, which means that it does not work properly. Please use the same computer as your test section in the course. The points must be obtained within 5 days. If your score exceeds five days, the score will be marked as \"0 point\".\n\n[This is a video tutorial that introduces more details about FFEditor. It can be used to practice writing and checking the code.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7lJ464Z78fQCYtK9sqy-g9x2lcJ0og2n3cSZ_6b9kU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe basic structure of FFEditor is the ASCII coding format used by most\ncomputers. Each letter from the alphabet and punctuation marks are represented by single digits.\nIn the above image, there are two boxes, (A) and (B) at the bottom of the image.\n\nThe letter A in FFEditor",

Find the formula [F(f(x,a),a)] in the question, show that [F(f(x,a),a)] and [x] are equivalent, explain the derivation.\n2. Find the answer to the formula [∃x(F(f(a),y)∧F(f(x,a),x))] in the question and use logical equivalence to prove the equivalence.\n3. Find from the logic language 𝑀 that a theory not containing any model x is a tautology, and find an example.\n4. [a] Let F(x,y)x/y + y/x - 1, g(x)x^3, and f(x)=x/2. Show that [a] is a model for F. [b] Find the relation Rc corresponding to [F].\n\n## Answer:\n\n1. [F(f(x,a),a)] is the conjunction of the formulas in the question. Since [x] is the empty set in the question, the validity of the empty conjunction is proved automatically.\n\n2. The derivation of [∃x(F(f(a),y)∧F(f(x,a),x))] is as follows:\n  - First use the logical equivalence [∧l→p] → [p→∧l] to derive the formula [F(f(a),y)] ∧ [F(f(x,a),x)].\n  - Then, rewrite the formula [F(f(a),y)] ∧ [F(f(x,a),x)] = [∃x(F(f(a),y)∧F(x,a),x)].\n  - Note that by the definition of [Rc], [P(x,x)] ∧ [x / a]=P(x,x}, [Rc] is the relation given in the question.\n  - Therefore, by combining the derivation results, we know that the equivalence of [∃x(P(x,a))∧Rc(x,x)] has been proved.\n\n3. Let F(y)y=0, gT(y)y^2, and h(x)=0.\n  Since the empty conjunction formula is valid only in the language 𝑀 defined by the problem, 0 is a model for the language 𝑀.\n\n4. [a]\n  If [F(x,f(x,a))=1/x-a], then [F(f(x,a),a)]=1/x-a=1/x-y-y = 1/(x-1)/(1-y).\n  Similarly, if [F(g(x),a)=x^3], then [F(f(x,a),a)=f(x,a)^3=x^3]\n\n\nThe calculation of [Rc](x,y) is as follows:\n  如果[x>y或y>x](i.e.,[F(x,y)∨F(x,y)→F(x,y)]), then [Rc](x,y)=True.\n  如果[x=y](i.e.,[F(x,y)∨¬F(x,y)]), then [Rc](x,y)=True=True=True=True.\n  如果[x≤y](i.e.,[¬F(x,y)∨F(x,y)],則[Rc](x,y)=False.\n\n5. By the logic rules, the formula [∀x(∀y((A(z,x,y))→(A(z,y,x))))] is equivalent to the formula [∃x(∀y(A(x,y,y))].\n\n# Conclusion:\nIn this problem, students are asked to identify logic formulas in the problem and use the specified logical rules and reasoning patterns to derive valid formulas. The problem requires students to understand the logic language rules, make logical equivalence derivation, find logical formulas in language 𝑀, and answer logical questions. The problem helps students learn the use of logical rules and patterns, and to express logic knowledge more cleverly.\n\n## Example problem\n\n(Source: Internet)\nIn the working environment, it is often necessary to capture employee information such as name, ID, time, and position.

You are notified that the administrator at this time is planning to replace the currently usertable, name to this type of table/record:\n          UserAccountRecord\n          IDXP2P\n          年龄年齢\n          工资月底月底\n          最近一次修改日期更新年月日\n5. [b]. It is found that the passwords provided by account users have been breached. You need to synchronize the database information to the system management Center in batches. What are the necessary steps that should be taken when synchronizing the system?\n\n## Answer:\n\n### Question:\n\n1. The logic rules that can be provided to prevent SQL injection attacks include the following rules:\n\n  - Ensure that all input data are valid before applying SQL to the database.\n  - Validate the user's inputs when inserting into the database, using appropriate function names such as encrypt/decrypt or regular expressions to filter out potential SQL injection input.\n  - Use built-in database functions such as SELECT * FROM ... WHERE and NOT EXISTS to check for missing or incorrect results.\n  - Enable the web page to verify the integrity of the user's input, such as limiting field size and masking user-supplied data.\n\n2. The 16-bit code of the Password [123456] can be divided into the following three 4-bit passwords: [0x00,0x01,0x04,0x05].\n  The OR operator [A | B] means that the input bits of A and B are combined, and if the input is a binary number, the general bit order is [the least significant bits, the most significant bits]. This operator is also valid in nodejs.\n  Therefore, the passwords [123456|0000], [123456|0001], [123456|0010], [123456|0011], etc., can be considered as an example to ensure that these code words are unique.\n  In the 16-bit code language, the",

[c1 + c2]φ\n  - The possibility exists that `φ` is true after executing one or both commands.\n3. [c1; c2]φ\n  - After executing the commands, `φ` has the characteristics of both `c1` and `c2`.\n4. ⟨c1; c2⟩φ\n  - After executing `c1`, the situation after executing `c2` can be represented as if `φ` is true.\n5. ⟨c1 + c2⟩φ\n  - Any of the processes `c1` or `c2` makes `φ` possible.\n6. [[c1; c2]φ]\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can be represented as `φ`.\n7. [c1; c2]φ\n  - The situation after both `c1` and `c2` are executed, which can contain or include `φ`.\n\nThis may sound more convoluted, but it is the result of a series of transformations based on the structure of the rule language. The basic idea is to use logical operations such as substitution, sequence, choice, loop, and interrupt as a process or description of execution. For example, when executing command `c2 + c1`, the first command is likely to be completed successfully, then execute the second command, the resulting situation will be as if `φ` is true. In a broader sense, even when `c1` succeeds, `φ` is still possible, because after using `c1 + c2`, the system can still enter the resource limitation state and then the exception state, which will lead to `errorCode`. Finally, when executing the command `c1; c2`, the outcome can be described as `φ` plus both `c1` and `c2`, and the successful execution can result in termination or the situation as if `φ` is true.\n<img src=\"https://img2.imgso.cn/flow/e476b21f247217727d793596488/jionefh66.png\" width=\"800\" border=\"0\" />",

Identify the logic rule used:\n- The trigger is \"ALL instances in class 'S' possess property 'P'\".\n- This corresponds to the conclusion of Φ induction, where `P(E)` is derived for the generalization `forall e in S, P(e)`.\n2. Write the Φ induction premise:\n- Similar to the logic rule, but with the knowledge of 'all instances' instead of 'some instances'.\n3. Write the Φ induction conclusion:\n- The result is the same as the logic rule: `P(E)` is derived for the generalization 'all instances S contain property P'.\n4. Formatting the inference:\n- An `if` indicator shows the condition for the inference.\n    - * If Premises: `{P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)}`\n    - * Conclusion: `Ephi.`\n- A `;` indicator indicates the equivalence of the Premises and Conclusion.\n    - * IF {P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)} THEN `{P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)}` `=>` `{P(E), P(E), ..., P(E)}`\n5. Correctness Verification:\n- Using the provided rules, the conclusion `forall e in S, P(e)` is derived from the given premises `P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n)`.\n- Hence, the given stimulus fits the category of Φ induction.\n\n### Resources and Expertise to Access:\n\n- Logic Rules & Processes\n    - **Φ** and Inductive Logic.\n- Tutor: Machine Learning Expert\n    - Personify AI",

        "response": "[[A]]\n>The cause relationship in China's early development was mainly carried out by method, which emphasized that if one event occurred earlier in time than another event, it would have a higher probability of being the cause of the latter event. This method of seeking common ground has also been criticized for its lack of consideration of the differences between the causal relationships of multiple events. The emergence and development of causal reasoning is influenced by the development of science and technology, the improvement of social productivity and civilization, and the rise of the ruling class.\n>In ancient China, the ruler of the Zhou Dynasty gave a theorem and strengthened people's belief that he did not commit evil, was good and good, and lived for a long time. It brought about the ideological belief in morality that ruled the ethics of non-committing evil and becoming morally virtuous. The officialdom of the Han Dynasty coupled with legalism, advocated \"power\" as the basis of heaven, created a ruling party under the rule of law, which regarded the law as the means to achieve its ends and sought to achieve hegemony; the rule of law, in order to achieve the goal of control, the ruling class created the \"Law\" to achieve its ends, so naturally it could not be understood by ordinary people; the law and justice in the eyes of ordinary people were concrete and transparent, and the legal ruling party and the ruling class in the case of human rights and personal rights were in a position to use the law to infringe on the freedom of others; this legal system took on the state's own morality to some extent, and gave it the responsibility of morality, and carried out a campaign to realize morality in the court, in the name of \"fear of the saints and dare not be indifferent to the saints\", so as to further stabilize the foundation of the ruling class in the final analysis. In the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, with a high level of life and a long history of national economy, science, and cultural productivity, the social and economic base of the ruling class under the feudal system was formed, and because of the feudal system, the ruling party also did not stop the expansion of growth in society, and directly extended its arms towards the lives of the majority of people. So in the eyes of the ruling class, the so-called \"law\" should be created to further enhance the morality of the \"ruling law\" and to give the ruling party the guarantee of morality in its hands. The people under the autocratic rule of the ruling class believed that the so-called \"law\" was actually in the hands of the big family of the feudal ruling party, and because they could not see it clearly, they accepted that view and the \"law\" belonged to the ruling party.\n>In addition to the above-mentioned social background with the support or resistance, the evolution of the development of Chinese cultural thought itself also had a great impact on the rise of modern Chinese legal thinking. In the Song Dynasty, the scholar-official thought of Lu You was a very important thinker. He used \"thinking first, then studying\" to create a \"learning the Tao\" thought, emphasizing the Taoist self-cultivation of the \"heart and the road\". According to the teachings of Taoism, \"Qinghe\" and \"Zhu\" became popular, and \"Wei xie\" prevailed, and the \"human relations circle\" also made further contributions to the development of Chinese legal thought in the Song Dynasty.\n>The \"Dao\" of Taoism and the various aspects of Daoism are the learning of \"Tao\" in the Song Dynasty, which is the basis of social morality that is self-consistent and has no direct relationship with the law. And because of the development of moral and religious concepts derived from ancient Daoism, many \"laws and ordinances\" of later generations had a sense of \"clear morality\" and the principle of \"collecting the world with kindness and goodness\". In addition, in the process of the Chinese nation's national integration and also under the guidance of the Confucian teachings of \"teaching and learning the ethics of harmony and altruism\", the Chinese people also inherited Taoism and created a set of modern personal morality and ethical norms. So \"Taoism is the most important\", \"the cultivation of morals does not seek laws, but the heart's Tao, and nothing can be accomplished without learning\", and although some ancient legal systems also have \"the three-law-enlightenment\", \"the moral law is the righteous law, and the righteous law is the moral law\", but in general, under the influence of traditional moral and religio-cultural concepts, the ancient legal system is still limited to not paying attention to moral concepts, but advocates the legalism of state rule itself. But it also points out the moral aspects of laws and the legal status of social morality. This statement shows that the ancient legal system should be transformed into the modern legal system. After adopting such thinking patterns, this paper comes to the essence of the research on morality and law, that is, the moral and legal norms in the Song-Yuan-Ming-Qing Dynasties of Chinese culture and the modern Chinese legal system in the evaluation of the impact of legalism on the moral norms of Chinese culture. In addition, although the Ancient Legal System in China did not specifically stipulate \"the morality of the law is the righteous law and the righteous law should be the moral law\", through various factors, such as \"good intention of kindness\" and \"unpremeditated\", moral principles such as \"good people are good\", \"respecting morality is the righteousness, and disrespecting morality is not righteousness\" are all supported by \"human relations\". And in the Chinese cultural system system, although some legal systems such as the \"Four Laws Encouraging the Virtues, Discouraging the Sins\" are established to achieve the goal of teaching, but in general, they should be regarded as \"laws\", but the source of \"laws\" and \"good laws\" are actually the same point of morality, which goes back to the origin of \"good people\". From this perspective, these legal systems in a certain sense actually have the function of moral education. In the same theory, when it comes to the differences between the \"Ancient Legal Rules\" and the \"Righteous Regulations\", and when it is broken by \"through the law step by step, the heart and path, the eyes of benevolence, and the Tao of Taoism become a justice and a righteousness\", it will give birth to moral standards in the legal norms, and finally put forward the \"The morality of morality is the righteous law , the virtuous law is the righteous law\", but this article points out the moral aspects of \"morality\" and \"legal\", which is not the source of \"good people\". For example, the same statement as that of Taoism and Daoism in the Ancient Legal System is also mentioned by \"Taoism is most important\", \"the morality of Taoism is a good teacher, and nothing can be achieved without learning\". This study shows that the so-called \"Tao is the source of legal enlightenment\" in the Song Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty's \"Taoism and human relations\" do not take into account the law as the source of \"morality\", but only emphasize that the Taoist morality originated from \"humanism\" and \"human relations\". In addition, scholars try to say that \"the ruler of the country must govern according to the laws of heaven and operate according to the Tao\"; \"The King should implement the law\", \"implement the law, and establish the people\", \"implement the law, teach people to do it\", \"the King of Zhou established the ancestral system and the rites according to the people\"; \"the inner rules are similar to the outer ones\", \"the law is similar to the law, he does what he needs to do for the people\", \"there are seven methods that are not broken\", \"the righteousness of the law is in the heart of the people \", \"the right method of the law, the people of the law\", \"the law of the law is good, and the law and people are in harmony\"; \"they are the ones who teach the people to learn from the laws\", \"the law and the people unite, and they are virtuous\"; \"there is a law, and the heart is eager\"; \"there is a law and the people are grateful\"; and \"there is a law and the law of the heart is in harmony\". Such a complete set of theories and many theories have a similar and harmonious feeling to the theory of \"The Law and the People and the Harmony of the Heart\".\n\n## <a href=\"https://patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn/\" target=\"_blank\">patentsystem.ssm.gov.cn</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/view/tjj.git</a>\n\n## <a href=\"https://tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json\" target=\"_blank\">tjj.yutu-git.site/tree/scripts/main/1.json</a>\n",

If someone makes mistakes in their research and the mistakes are not corrected, then the study will receive negative ratings from all scholars. Considering the number of studies, mistakes can be made very gradually and can even go unnoticed. We see that when a new study is developed, several researchers gather in the same place and sit down on a table and start to discuss the study and try to prove how bad the study is. However, we can say that one or two important points can be made against this study and the rest of the scholars' contribution to such a study can be seen as positive.\n\nIn this example, which method was mentioned by the researchers used (regarding how the research works)?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ꙮ Method   D. ⵣ Method   E. ⚘ Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nIn physics, there is a formula called $A_{ds} = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} F_{opp} \\, dr$, which states that the moment of the external force $F_{opp}$ is proportional to the distance $r$ travelled by the external force to produce the moment of the force about a point. In analytic geometry, the concept of moment-generating function (MMGF) finds important applications in statistics. By applying the technique of Runge–Kutta, the MMGF is calculated,\nwhich proves that there is no universal formulation using just to avoid fictitious forces (nonconservative forces). In real life, if an astronaut is taken in a chair by a rocket with no thrust, the astronaut's weight does not change with a change in $r$. For example, consider a ball with the same mass and shape. It is lifted from your desk at the same time. If you have a convex mirror with a mirror curvature of $20$ m, the external force will definitely affect the astronaut. Or if you are on a moving bus with no external forces, the astronaut's weight will not change.\n\nIn the example given above, which method is used?\nA. ⸮ Method   B. ؆ Method   C. ReusableCell   D.

The mouth is an absolute mouth, and it is not a relative event for a rotating material medium. However, this definition is not precise. In fact, the results of observations and other research methods show that: the sun is constantly changing, and the mouth can shift in the direction of movement over a long time, large space or massive celestial body. In addition, the mouth may appear on the other side of the moving foot at the time when the moving part or the sun is far away from us, because the light and other material waves propagating from the sun's surface to us travel along the curved path, but the light does not travel along the shortest path.\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA.⚯ Definition\nB.⌘ Definition\nC.⚒ Definition\nD.Ϟ Definition\nE.☖ Definition\nF.Ѭ Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the statistics of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping, as of June 30, 1986, there were 65 military operations in the world.

On 3 September 1950, Lt Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base was flying a H-80M equipped with USMC operations around the Philippine Sea when he found a suspected Type 1 diesel-electric submarine in the aircraft's radar. Due to insufficient ammunition, Tran simply disembarked on the submarine to capture it alive (because the submarine did not have a crew), but was captured by the water on the submarine. According to the subsequent account of Chinese Naval Lieutenant Commander Jiang Wu: “Under the command of Lt Col Cong B. Tran of the US Navy's USAF detachment at Clark Air Force Base, a H-80M equipped with USMC operations was cruising over the Philippine Sea at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the water. During the search and reconnaissance, the submarine suddenly appeared on the radar of the H-80M, which was very unexpected. After the dive of the submarine, the H-80M tried to launch the hand launch AA missile, but the launch failed. The missile was not within the effective range of the target 20 nautical miles, and hitting other targets was difficult. The launch of the air-to-submarine rocket failed, but the signal code was pressed. As the last resort of the US captain Cong B. Tran, he used the H-80 hand-landing anti-submarine bomb to fire and destroy the Type 1 diesel-electric submarine. The submarine carried 4 Type",

Therefore, in this case, the defense method should be applied.\"\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]]format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\n\n### Question:\n\"In the \"case+ method,\" the speaker divides different cases according to their properties and uses them to support or refute a proposition. For example, people believe that all persons in the world are not the same, but there are also similarities between them, just as there are common examples of people in different parts of the world and a range of similar cases in it, such as a particular action being used or supported by a specific character. If different cases of an action are used to support the judgment of the propositions, the judge can use one case and another to illustrate the general truth, but a single case cannot support or refute it.\"\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]]format.\n\n### Answer:\n",
