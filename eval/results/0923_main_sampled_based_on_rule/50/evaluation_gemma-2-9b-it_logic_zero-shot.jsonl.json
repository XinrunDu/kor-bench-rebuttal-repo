Consider the Output:**\n\nThe output (O) is \"+\", meaning the entire expression is true.  \n\n**3.  Find Possible Input Combinations:**\n\nWe need to find combinations of p, q, and r that satisfy at least one of the conditions:\n\n* **(p∧q) is True:**\n    * p = + , q = +  \n\n* **(¬p∧(q∨r)) is True:** This has multiple possibilities depending on the truth values of q and r:\n    * p = - , q = + , r = +\n    * p = - , q = + , r = -\n    * p = - , q = - , r = +\n\n**4.

Understand the Expression:**\n\n*   `(p∧q∧¬r)`:  p, q, and ¬r must all be true for this part to be true.\n*   `(¬p∧q)`: ¬p and q must both be true for this part to be true.\n*   `(p∨r)`: Either p or r must be true for this part to be true.\n*   The entire expression uses \"∨\" (OR) – meaning at least one of the three parts must be true for the overall output to be true.\n\n**2.  Output is \"-\":**  This means the entire expression evaluates to false.\n\n**3.  Finding Input Combinations:**\n\n Since the output is false, *None* of the three parts of the expression can be true. Here's why:\n\n*  If  `(p∧q∧¬r)` is true, the entire expression becomes true.\n*  If `(¬p∧q)` is true, the entire expression becomes true.\n*  If `(p∨r)` is true, the entire expression becomes true.\n\n\nTherefore,  to get an output of \"-\",  all three parts must be false.
