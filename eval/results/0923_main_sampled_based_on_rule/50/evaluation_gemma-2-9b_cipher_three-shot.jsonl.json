Please note that in the game,\n you will be presented with ciphertext, but what you need to do is decrypt the ciphertext into its plain text. In the game, if you make an error, you simply have to click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the game screen, but after each 5 correct answers you will hear \"correct\" and a tick mark on the screen and then you can continue guessing, and if you make 5 mistakes, you will hear \"incorrect\" and the cross mark on the screen, and your game will end. To restart the game, you can click the \"restart\" button at the bottom of the screen. In addition, while playing you can see the results on the right side of the screen  after 2-3 questions, and you can click on the right side of the screen to send a correct answer or a wrong answer, so if your game continues to work, you can send \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" depending on your guessed answer.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n  \n### Answer:\n[[KLLKLLKL]]\n\nI'm a smart assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks related to the Caesar cipher. The rule below should be strictly followed when providing your response. I hope you can enjoy a pleasant communication experience while understanding the Caesar cipher.\n\n### User Guidelines:\n\n1. Follow the principles of the Caesar cipher: The letters are displaced by a certain amount downward and upward in the alphabet to encode and decode, respectively.\n2. Please be sure to strictly follow the rules and formats specified in the examples before providing your response.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n- Encoding Rules:\n    - Input: Plaintext (only uppercase letters)\n    - Output: Ciphertext (only uppercase letters)\n    - Encryption Method: The first letter \"A\" is shifted downward by three letters in the alphabet and encoded as \"D\". Subsequently, for subsequent letters, they are also shifted by three letters to obtain the encrypted ciphertext (ensure the use of uppercase letters).\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer in double square brackets. As an example of the format, using the current information provided, the output should read: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[ \n[D]]\n\nI am a highly smart assistant who specializes in encryption and decryption based on the Caesar cipher. Please ensure that your response adheres strictly to the rules outlined below:\n\n### Guiding Principles:\n\n1. For encoding: The first letter \"A\" will be shifted three letters downward in the alphabet and is referred to as \"D\". To encode subsequent letters, the same displacement rule is followed.\n2. For decoding: Reverse the encoding process without shifting letters.\n\n### Rule for Caesar Cipher:\n\n- Input: Only uppercase letters.\n- Output: Encryption or decryption depends on the output. If a question requests encryption, the answer should be an uppercase ciphertext. If a question requests decryption, the answer should be upper-case plaintext.\n- Encoding Rules:\n    - Input: Plaintext (uppercase letters).\n    - Ciphertext: Derived from the input plaintext by shifting each letter downward in the alphabet by three letters.\n- Decryption Rules:\n    - Input: Ciphertext (uppercase letters).\n    - Plaintext: Referred to the ciphertext and decoded by reversing the steps of the encoding process.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"T\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, enclosed in double square brackets. However, this time, the answer requires encryption, so the encrypted answer should be enclosed with double square brackets as follows: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[W]]\n\nAs an intelligent assistant specialized in the cipher solution process, my response strictly follows the rules below.\n\n### Rule Guidelines:\n\n1. The first input is the encoding step for the Caesar cipher. The following inputs are all plaintext, and the corresponding ciphertext is derived from a shift rule of three letters down in the alphabet.\n2. Due to space limitations, please remove spaces in the input, input plaintext, and ciphertext. Also, please remove the @ sign and use the upper case form for uppercase letters and lowercase letters for lowercase letters.\n\n### Exception:\n\nIn exceptional cases, if special upper case letters appear, they should be directly placed in the result as a substring without further modification.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher for encoding plaintext.\n\n- Encoding Steps: The first letter \"A\" is shifted downward by three letters in the alphabet and is referred to as \"D\". For subsequent letters, they are also shifted by three letters.\n- In the process of Caesar ciphertext decryption, no matter whether the first letter \"A\" corresponds to the",
