This means:\n- Evaluating its true assignment in binary: ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is true when p = 0, q = 0, r = 0.\n- The binary representation for p = 0, q = 0, r = 0 is 000, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n\nTherefore, ¬p∧¬q∧¬r corresponds to m0.\n\n2. **Categorizing the Formula:**\n\nWe now have to check the categories one by one:\n- **A. Tautology:** A is a tautology if it includes all 2^3 = 8 paired conjunctive terms. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates only to m0, it does not include all 8 paired conjunctive terms.\n- **B. Contradiction:** A is a contradiction if it includes no paired conjunctive terms. ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **C. Basic formula:** A is a basic formula if it includes m0. Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r translates to m0, it is a basic formula.\n- **D. All-even formula:** A is an all-even formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. In this case, the only term is m0, which is even. So, it is an all-even formula.\n- **E. All-odd formula:** A is an all-odd formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd. Here, the term m0 has an even index, so it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nThe true assignments point to the selections: C and D.\n\n### Answer:\n[[CD]]",

We recognize that the implication \"if \\( p1 \\), then \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\)\" will be false only if \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) is false.\n\nHowever, for \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) to be false, all three propositions \\( p1 \\), \\( p2 \\), and \\( p3 \\) must be false. But this scenario contradicts our initial assumption that \\( p1 \\) is true.\n\nSo, since \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) will always be true when \\( p1 \\) is true, and the formula is true when \\( p1 \\) is false (because a false antecedent makes an implication true by default), \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is true under all possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is a Truth Formula (A).\n\n(2) \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\)\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step. The formula inside the implication is \\( p1=::>~p1 \\).\n\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is false when \\( p1 \\) is true since \\( ~p1 \\) would be false, thus leading to a false condition.\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is false because \\( ~p1 \\) would be true, making the implication true by default.\n\nNow, considering \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\):\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is true, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is false. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{false} =::> ~p2 \\) will depend on \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, making the entire implication true (since a false antecedent results in a true implication).\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, and this makes the implication false (a false antecedent and a true consequent make the implication false).\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is true. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]",
