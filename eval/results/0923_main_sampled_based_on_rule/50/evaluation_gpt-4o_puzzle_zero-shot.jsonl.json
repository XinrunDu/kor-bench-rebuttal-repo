Westmolen was built in 1752.\n\nFirstly, let's decipher the clues:\n\n- Clue 4 tells us that Westmolen was built in 1752.\n- From Clue 2, Westmolen (1752) was built 23 years after the Visser family's windmill. Therefore, the Visser family's windmill must have been built in 1752 - 23 = 1729.\n- Clue 3 states that the De Jong family's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen. To find this relationship, we'll use the years we already know.\n- Clue 1 states that Vlietmolen is owned by the Van Dijk family.\n\nLet's assign the years 1683, 1706, 1729, and 1752 to the windmills based on the clues given:\n\n- We already know Westmolen = 1752.\n- Visser's windmill = 1729 (23 years before Westmolen).\n- Since the De Jong family's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen, we need a difference of 23 years to fit the remaining years (1683 and 1706). 1706 - 23 is not a solution since it is less than 1683, but 1706 + 23 = 1729 fits our condition since the De Jong's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen.\n\nThus:\n\n- De Jong family has their windmill = 1706 (23 years before 1729, which we already determined as Fot the Visser's windmill).\n- Therefore, Zemelmolen must have been built 23 years after the De Jong’s house = 1729.\n- The only year left for another windmill is 1683.\n\nNow let's match the remaining families:\n- Zemelmolen = 1706 + 23 = 1729 (already assigned).\n- The windmill for 1683 must be Vlietmolen by elimination, which is owned by the Van Dijk family.\n\nFinal assignment:\n\n- 1683 Vlietmolen Van Dijk\n- 1706 De Jong's windmill De Jong\n- 1729 Zemelmolen Visser\n- 1752 Westmolen not explicitly matching a separate third family (provided families already accounted) but owned by an unidentified fourth.\n\nThus, our formatted answer should be:\n\n[[1683 Vlietmolen Van Dijk, 1706 DeJonge's De Jong, 1729 Zemelmolen Visser, 1752 Westmolen Unknown]]\n\nNote: A strictly accurate year context-based puzzle was considered using clues without known fourth family name directly linking to Westmolen explicitly.

Clue 4 tells us Eula is either on the gluten-free or caveman diet.\n\n### Steps to deduce the match:\n- Let's start with the pounds lost values: 3, 5, 7, and 9 lbs.\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n- Since the caveman dieter lost more pounds than Eula, and Eula lost one of the lower values (3 or 5 lbs).\n- Given that Mandy used the sugar-free diet and that she lost 4 more pounds than the caveman dieter, Mandy cannot be in 7 lbs or lower categories, that suggests she might have lost 9 lbs (because it's 4 lbs more than 5 lbs), and therefore, caveman diet must have lost 5 lbs.\n- Thus, Eula did not use the caveman diet but the gluten-free diet.\n\n### Final placements:\n- Mandy, Sugar-free diet, should have lost 9 lbs.\n- Caveman diet should have lost 5 lbs.\n- Eula, gluten-free diet, should have lost 3 lbs (as it's the only value left lower than 5).\n- Barbara, as stated, lost 7 lbs, and her diet is not explicitly mentioned but based on remaining value, she must be vege-free.\n\nGiven all this, let's match:\n\n- Eula: Lost 3 lbs, gluten-free diet.\n- Caveman diet: Lost 5 lbs.\n- Barbara: Lost 7 lbs, diet must be something like vege-free.\n- Mandy: Lost 9 lbs, sugar-free diet.\n\nLet's form these logically in tabular format:\n\n- 3 lbs Eula gluten-free\n- 5 lbs N/A caveman (Thus we assign logical, likely to Jay as placeholder)\n- 7 lbs Barbara vege-free\n- 9 lbs Mandy Sugar-free\n\nHere’s the final answer boxed as requested [[enclosed in double brackets]]:\n\n```plaintext\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 Jay Caveman, 7 Barbara Vege-free, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]]\n```",

So, Elaine is in position 3, 4, or 5 only.\n\n2. **Leadership Badge Placement:**\n   - Elaine is 2 places after this badge, preventing leadership badge from being in position 4 or 5 (Elaine can't be in 6 or 7 positions).\n   - Hence, leadership badge must be in spots 1 or 2:\n     - If in position 1, Elaine is in 3.\n     - If in position 2, Elaine is in 4.\n   - Kendra didn't win leadership badge, so position 1 leadership badge must be different from Kendra.\n\n3. **Wendy and Tara relationship:**\n   - Wendy won the swimming badge (clue 2).\n   - Wendy is awarded before Tara (clue 4).\n\nGiven leadership possibilities:\n- Assume leadership is in position 1:\n  - Elaine is in position 3.\n  - Wendy, not leadership winner, is in 4 or 5 positions. But prior to Tara, Wendy can only be in position 4 (since 5 too late). Tara thus position 5.\n- Wendy in position 4 breaks sequence logic.\n\n4. **Re-analysis leadership:**\n   - If positioned 2 with Elaine in 4, fitting Wendy:\n     - Wendy 1, leadership 2, missing girls/badge adjust.\n\n### Correct Order Doing Iterations and Logical Deductions:\n\nThus, combining constraints:\n\n- Wendy = 1st, swimming.\n- Leadership = 2nd.\n- Elaine = 4th first aid.\n- Dance = 3rd award before leadership.\n- Theater = 5th one award after 1st aid.\n- Kendra alternatives aligned except leadership:\n  - Tara balance left.\n\n### Derive Final Answer:\nThrough matching by non-contradiction logic:\n\n**Here is the final puzzle solution in format:**\n- Wendy won swimming 1st, leadership second, dance third theater following, Elaine closing gaps:\n\nOutput:\n[[first Wendy swimming, second Kendra leadership, third unnamed dance, fourth Elaine first-aid, fifth Tara theater]].",

Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. **Parse the Clues:**\n    - (1) The client who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll.\n    - (2) Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.\n    - (3) Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n    - (4) Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.\n    - (5) The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n    - (6) Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.\n    - (7) The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n\n2. **Key Points:**\n    - There are 4 customers with 4 different rolls and prices.\n    - They are Hector, Virginia, Ramona, and another unnamed customer.\n    - Rolls: Dragon roll, Teriyaki roll, Tiger roll, Futomaki roll, Rainbow roll, Spider roll, and Firecracker roll.\n\nGiven:\n- The Teriyaki and Dragon roll are ordered by the same person.\n- Virginia and Ramona have roles with exact identifiers.\n- The firecracker roll corresponds to the price $9.50.\n\nNext, we need to fill out these details systematically:\n\n3. **From Clue Analysis:**\n    - Firecracker roll is $9.50.\n    - Taking Clues (1), (5), and (6), Hector doesn't order the Teriyaki roll (which is the same as the Dragon roll); hence Hector cannot be the Dragon roll client.\n    - From Clue (3), Virginia and Ramona's roles/prices need attention.\n\n**Assumption Set-Up:**\n    - Let's assume based on the highest certainty clues:\n    For $9.50:\n    - Customer X: Firecracker roll = $9.50 (determined from Clue 7)\n\nMoving on for others:\n    - Clue 2:\n        - Either Hector owes $11.50 and a person ordered Futomaki.\n        - Substitute considering Hector can't be Dragon (and associated with $11.50/$13.50) so Futomaki for $11.50 scenario.\n\nFixing more:\n    - Piggy back for Rainbow combination offers within Clue 3: \n    - Resolving match roles:\n    $9.50 -> Firecracker = Customer(x) = Complements with Futomaki.\n\nFinally put it:\n    - Virginia on Rainbow chore, Ramona  role secondary.\n    - Final arrangement: $9,.50 Firecracker, $11.50 Futomaki, $13.50 (Teriyaki/Dragon Combo).\n\nThus based verification for [[final data arrangement]] pattern:\n\n```plaintext\n[[ $9.50 Firecracker Roll CustomerX, $11.50 Futomaki Roll Hector, $13.50 Dragon Roll Random, $15.50 Rainbow Roll Virginia ]]\n```\n\nThis fulfils the order breakdown sequentially matching clue impact.",

We need the initial division to result in an integer since the numbers range from 0 to 9 and should therefore produce clean results for the addition to ultimately total 17.\n2. Consider different pairs of numbers for the division `a / b` to see if they can easily lead to an integer result.\n3.

The order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS, stands for parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (left to right), and addition and subtraction (left to right).\n\nLet's denote the unknowns as follows:\nA * B + C + D / E = 46\n\nWe need to fill in A, B, C, D, and E using the numbers 0 through 9 such that the equation holds true.

Substitute into the equation:\n   9 * 5 + 17 + 2 / 1\n\n3. Evaluate:\n   - First, multiplication: 9 * 5 = 45\n   - Next, division: 2 / 1 = 2\n   - Then, addition:\n     45 + 17 = 62\n     62 + 2 = 64\n\n4. Still does not equal 46.

Since there are 3 possible places around it (1st row, 2nd column; 2nd row, 1st column; 2nd row, 3rd column), we infer at least two must be mines. Considering the adjacent 3 in (1st row, 4th column) the mines must be around these placements.\n2. **First row, second column:** The square shows 2, indicating 2 mines around it. We know 1st row, 1st column and 1st row, 3rd column are mines likely based on adjacent squares.\n3. **Third row, third column:** Shows 3, implying 3 mines around it. We already suspect the first row, third column, second row second and fourth column.\n\nLet's represent these deductions understanding no conflicts with neighbouring row/column logic:\n\n```\nA 2 A 3 X\nX X 3 X X\n1 2 3 3 2\nX X X X 2\n1 X 2 X X\n```\n\n4. **Third row, second column:** Shows 2, means 2 mines in adjacent (two fixed earlier assume not conflict with these) which aligns with previous markings.\n\nNow let's deduce final placements.
