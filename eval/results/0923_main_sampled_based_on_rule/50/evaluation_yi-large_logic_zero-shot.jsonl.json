Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2). The proposition states that both of these properties hold for the number 2. Thus, we have:\n- `[F(2) & G(2)]`\n\n(2) If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime.\nFirst, we express \"2 is prime\" as G(2).

To represent this, we use an implication where the premise is \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) and the conclusion is that for all numbers, if they are prime, they must be equal to 2.

This method can be directly applied to our Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) to convert it into a new proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, as follows: \"All C is F\" can be converted to \"Some F is C\" (since conversion of A to I is valid). However, this results in a Particular Affirmative Proposition (I) rather than a Universal proposition. The question seems to be asking for a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning.\"\n\n- **Method C** involves first performing obversion (Method A) and then performing conversion (Method B). Starting with \"All C is F,\" applying obversion gives us \"All C is not non-F\" (though this step doesn't change the meaning substantially in logical terms, as \"not non-F\" is equivalent to \"F\"), and then applying conversion would yield \"Some non-F is not C.\" This doesn't achieve the desired inference either, as it negates both terms and doesn't place \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in the form we likely want.\n\nHowever, interpreting the question as seeking a method to derive a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning\" from the given premise, the most appropriate method to infer a Universal proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" (F) as the subject while maintaining the essence of the original statement, is to leverage a combination of insights from the methods, though not directly any single method as described. We can infer a new Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) by understanding that if all of a subset (correct reasoning, C) shares a property (being formally correct, F), then to say something about the whole set of things with that property (formally correct reasoning, F), we can infer that \"All F must include all C.\" This isn't directly Method A, B, or C but is derived from our understanding of set relations in syllogistic reasoning. However, to fit within the constraints of the methods provided, the closest fit would be **Method B** applied with a slight adjustment to retain the Universal quantity, focusing on the subject-predicate exchange principle: \"All C is F\" implies \"All F is at least C,\" which is a valid inference in this context but goes beyond the simple conversion to emphasize the Universal quantity.\n\nThus, the method that most closely aligns with the inference we want, while not fitting exactly due to the need to preserve the Universal nature of the proposition, is:\n\n**[[B]]**\n\nThis adjustment is made to interpret the question's request for \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in a Universal proposition, recognizing the limitations of the provided methods in directly achieving this without some interpretation or extension of their principles.",

The given statements are:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S\n3. ∀S ⇒ ¬P\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (∀P ⇒ M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (∀M ⇒ ¬S) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (∀S ⇒ ¬P) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. ∀P ⇒ M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. ∀M ⇒ ¬S (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion ∀S ⇒ ¬P (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, ∀S ⇒ ¬M (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), ∴S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, ∴S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies ∀¬M ⇒ S (from ∀M ⇒ ¬S), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (∀P ⇒ M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (∀¬M ⇒ S, equivalent to ∀M ⇒ ¬S in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (∀S ⇒ ¬P).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation.

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The ⸮ method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The ؆ method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The ꙮ method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The ⵣ method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The ⚘ method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the ؆ method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

This is because the speaker, by saying \"I believe you are a college student,\" is not providing the stronger information that they \"know\" the person is a college student, despite the fact that if they had more certainty, they could have said it. This aligns with the speaker's criterion under the C* Principle, where the statement is weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge potentially allows, and the hearer's inference (CQ2) applies since the content of the stronger statement \"I know you are a college student\" entails the content of the original statement, and the speaker does not know whether the content of the original statement can be fully established.

        "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm → Beer is part of the food in the food box\" is most closely aligned with the C% Principle.\n\n1. **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalization and the speaker speaking as little as possible. The inference here is that when Xiao Ma mentions the beer being warm upon opening the food box, it suggests that the beer is an unexpected item that stands out because it's not in its expected state (usually cold). Given the context of opening a food box, the minimal information provided implies that the beer is part of the contents of the food box, as it is the simplest and most direct explanation for this observation. This adheres to CI2 of the C% Principle, where the hearer expands the information to grasp the intention of the speech, assuming that the mentioned \"beer is still warm\" is an unusual fact that stands out and is meant to be understood as part of the described situation without further embellishment.\n\n2. The statement does not seem to invoke the **C* Principle**, as it's not about the speaker avoiding making a stronger statement due to lack of knowledge or intentionally not providing more precise information. The focus is not on the contrast between possible stronger and weaker statements or inferences about the speaker's knowledge limitations.\n\n3. Regarding the **C! Principle**, the statement does not utilize a lengthy, obscure, or marked expression that could suggest a deviation from conventional meanings or the need to avoid conventional associations. The phrasing is straightforward, and the inference does not require avoiding or reinterpreting conventional meanings in a significant way as per the C! Principle.\n\nThus, based on the principles and the statement provided, the most fitting principle is the C% Principle.",

        "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given statement follows the C% Principle, specifically the Hearer's Inference CI2, which states that if a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The statement \"The mother picks her up\" implies a relationship based on the conventional understanding of family roles and behavior, suggesting that the person referred to as \"the mother\" is indeed the biological or caregiving mother of the baby, due to the action taken (picking up the crying baby), which aligns with typical maternal behavior. This conforms to the principle of minimalization and the expansion of information by the hearer, assuming the conventional relationship from the described action, adhering to the C% Principle.\n\nThe C* Principle is not applicable here because there is no evidence of a stronger statement being avoided for the sake of weaker information, nor is there a contrast set where a stronger piece of information would entail a weaker one, leading to a specific inference about the speaker's knowledge.\n\nThe C! Principle is also not applicable because there is no use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions that would require a different interpretation from a more conventional or unmarked expression.",

        "response": "The given statement and its inference can be analyzed according to the custom cooperation principles as follows:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle involves the speaker saying something that is not as informative as it could be, leading to specific inferences by the hearer. However, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" is straightforward and informative. The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is a direct, uncontroversial deduction from the statement rather than a result of the speaker being less informative than they could be.\n\n- **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalism in speech, and the inference is supposed to be based on expanding the minimal information provided by the speaker. The statement about the car door not closing implicitly assumes the car has doors (as per the convention or common knowledge), and the inference directly links to this assumption without requiring additional information.\n\n- **C! Principle**: This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions unless they serve a specific purpose. The given statement is straightforward and does not invoke any unnecessary complexity or marked expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" conforms most closely to the C% Principle, as it involves interpreting the minimal information provided in a straightforward manner, expanding on the given information in a way that aligns with common sense or conventions about cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```",

This inference process aligns with the C* Principle, specifically the Hearer's Inference (CQ2), where the statement \"gives flowers to a nurse\" does not directly entail the content \"a female\" but is understood to imply it due to the stronger information (the common knowledge that nurses are often female) that the speaker has not explicitly stated, suggesting the speaker does not know if it can be established based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThis is because the inference pattern matches the C* Principle's guidelines for deducing meaning beyond the explicit content based on understood knowledge or common sense associations.",
