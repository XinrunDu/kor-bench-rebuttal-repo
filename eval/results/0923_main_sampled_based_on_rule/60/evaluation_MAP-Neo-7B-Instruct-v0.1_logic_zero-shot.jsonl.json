The formula then becomes \"if p1, then not p2 and p2\". \n   - This is a contradiction because the \"if p1\" part of the conjunction implies a condition that could not be met simultaneously with the \"p2\" being true. Thus, it is a Falsehood Formula because it is true under all assignments.\n   \n2. **Formula (2):** \n   - Formula: (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n   - This formula can be simplified to \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\". However, this is syntactically incorrect because the \"and\" operator in the premise and the \"if..then\" operator in the conclusion use different propositions and connectives. The correct simplification would also be based on the equivalence of the two premises: \"p1 and p3 imply not p1 and not p2\". \n   - The \"p1 and p3 implies not p1 and not p2\" can be interpreted as \"If p1 and p3 are true, then p1 and p2 must be false\". Since the \"if p1 and p3\" part of the conjunction cannot be true unless \"p1\" and \"p3\" are both true, the conclusion is incorrect. The formula does not hold under any assignment of truth values, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, both formulas are Falsehood Formulas, and the answer is [[A];[A]].\n\n*Note: The prioritization of logical connectives does not apply in this case, as the issue lies in the incorrect formation and interpretation of the formulas rather than the operation's priority.*",

The specific number of iterations required to reach this conclusion depends on the complexity of the original CNF and the resolution steps applied. However, given the complexity of the initial CNF, it's likely that the algorithm would iterate through the steps outlined (initializing, certain steps of resolution, checking S2, and final output) once or twice at most to conclude that there's a plausibly satisfying assignment. The exact number in iterations can be more context-dependent on the specific clauses involved and how the resolution rules are applied.\n\nFinal output:\n- \"Plausible\"\n- The number of cycles needed to confirm a satisfiable assignment would be once or twice, assuming the initial transformations and operations are followed correctly through the resolution steps. \n\nPlease note, for more complex or specific inputs, the algorithm's expected iterations could vary.

This is a compound logical statement involving \"conjunction\", \"disjunction\", and \"negation\".\n\n### Circuit Diagram:\nGiven the circuit operates under these inputs and output rules:\n- \\(O = +\\) when powered (e.g., a battery being connected),\n- \\(O = -\\) when not powered (e.g., a battery being disconnected),\n- \\(I1, I2, \\ldots\\) represent individual inputs in the order they appear.\n\n**Breakdown of the Compound Expression:**\n1. \\((p \\land q)\\): This means the input combination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) needs to be true for the circuit to activate.\n2. \\((\\lnot p \\land (q \\lor r))\\): This means that the input combination of \\(\\lnot p\\) (NOT p) and \\((q \\lor r)\\) (OR of \\(q\\) and \\(r\\)) needs to be true for the circuit to activate.\n\n### Finding Corresponding Inputs:\nTo find the corresponding inputs that satisfy the expression, we must consider all possible combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) that lead to a true output. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **\\(p = \\text{true}, q = \\text{true}\\)**:\n   - The expression evaluates to \\((True \\land True) \\lor (\\lnot True \\land (True \\lor True))\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(True \\lor (\\text{False}) = True\\), which matches the power condition \\(O = +\\).\n\n2. **\\(p = \\text{false}, q = \\text{true}\\)**:\n   - The expression evaluates to \\((False \\land True) \\lor (\\lnot False \\land (True \\lor True))\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(False \\lor (True = True) = True\\), again matching the power condition \\(O = +\\).\n\n3. **\\(p = \\text{true}, r = \\text{true}\\), where \\(q\\) could be any value**:\n   - The expression evaluates to \\((True \\land q) \\lor (\\lnot True \\land (q \\lor True))\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(q \\lor (q = True) = True\\), which again fits the power condition \\(O = +\\).\n\n4. **\\(p = \\text{false}, q = \\text{false}\\)**:\n   - The expression evaluates to \\((False \\land False) \\lor (\\lnot False \\land (False \\lor False))\\).\n   - This simplifies to \\(False \\lor (False = False) = True\\), where \\(O = +\\).\n\n**Multiple Inputs:**\nTo satisfy the expression \\((p \\land q) \\lor (\\lnot p \\land (q \\lor r))\\), any combination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) such that \\(p \\oplus q\\) makes the entire expression evaluate to \\(True\\) will do. The true combinations involve changing \\(p\\) and allowing for different values of \\(r\\) or keeping \\(r\\) constant but alternating \\(q\\).\n\nRemember, the exact values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can vary, as long as their combination makes the expression true under the given conditions. Similarly, the values of \\(r\\) can be adjusted while always keeping the expression \\((p \\land q) \\lor (\\lnot p \\land (q \\lor r))\\) balanced.\n\nTo conclude, the circuit activates when any combination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) makes the expression true under the conditions provided. The outputs \\(O\\) can vary between \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) based on whether power is applied or not, respectively. Each of the described scenarios satisfies the logic rule and the expression.",

Then, we'll apply the logical operations to deduce the inputs that satisfy the given logical expression and produce a negative output (\"-\") as per the circuit diagram rules.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Properties and Objects\n\n- Inputs: p, q, and r.\n- Logical operator: Negation (¬), Conjunction (∧), and Disjunction (∨).\n- Output: O (\"-\" indicates that the expression doesn't satisfy the condition).\n\n### Step 2: Apply Logical Operations\n\nThe given logical expression is:\n\n(p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ r)\n\nBreaking down the expression:\n\n1. (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r): This means p, q, and ¬r are all true simultaneously.\n2. (¬p ∧ q): This means not p and q are both true.\n3. (p ∨ r): This means either p or r, or both, are true.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Inputs That Produce a Negative Output\n\nTo satisfy the expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ r) and produce a negative output O, we need to find sets of inputs that do not satisfy the expression but where the output O is \"-\".\n\nGiven that 'O' represents \"-\", we're looking for conditions where the logic expression isn't true but the output isn't true. We can play around with combinations to satisfy these conditions:\n\n- **For p = True and q = True and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is True because all conditions are met.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - So, the overall expression evaluates to True, but since we want \"O\" to be negative, this combination doesn't work directly.\n\n- **For p = True, q = True, and r = True:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because r is True.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because both p and ¬p are True (but ¬r must be False).\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because both p and r are True.\n  - All three components are false, meaning the entire expression evaluates to False, which aligns with our requirement for an output of \"O\" that is \"-\" when the expression isn't True.\n\nTherefore, the set of inputs that satisfy the given condition and produce a negative output of \"O\" (\"-\") for the logical expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) ∨ (¬p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∨ r) are:\n\n- p = True, q = True, r = True\n\nThis combination satisfies the logical requirements without directly satisfying the expression but produces the desired negative output for the given logical expression. Other combinations could also be valid depending on the context, but the primary focus here was to address the problem as provided.\n\nFor completeness, here are additional combinations:\n\n- **For p = True, q = False, and r = False:**\n  - The expression (p ∧ q ∧ ¬r) is False because q is False and ¬r is False.\n  - The expression (¬p ∧ q) is False because p is True and q is False.\n  - The expression (p ∨ r) is True because p is True and r is False.\n  - The overall expression evaluates to False, satisfying the requirement for an \"O\" of \"-\" when the expression is not True.\n\nThese are some of the possible combinations that meet the specified conditions. Other permutations could also satisfy the conditions depending on the interpretations and requirements of the logical expression and the context of the circuit diagram.",

If SOP is false, it implies at least one S is P, making SIP true according to the same \"*\" relationship.\n  - SAP is a universal affirmative proposition, directly asserting that all S are P.

In both 1980 and 1981, the use of Chinese hybrid rice resulted in significantly higher yields than the U.S. varieties.

This finding occurred under conditions different from those in other workplaces, suggesting a causal relationship between textile factories with certain characteristics and the subsidence of the city.\n\n1. The \"Positive group\" and \"Negative group\" observed in Method ꙮ allow for a direct comparison of circumstances. In the positive group, textile factories with deep wells and high water usage do indeed correlate with increased subsidence. Conversely, in the negative group, the absence of these characteristics (extreme cases of industrial activity, possibly lacking water wells, or not utilizing the volume of underground water observed in the positive group) does not correlate with the absence of ground subsidence, providing further evidence for causality.\n\n2. Moreover, the focus on \"other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc.,\" which differ, helps to rule out alternative explanations for the sinking. For instance, if other factors, such as differing geographical conditions or variations in workplace layout, were the primary drivers of subsidence, they should not consistently cluster around areas with textile factories.\n\n3.

The output is structured as follows:\n\n[A] The given argument uses the Ψ Method of reasoning. It compares two objects (crows in Universities A and B) based on shared attributes (feathers that are black) but also infers the presence of another attribute (the color of feathers) to the second object (crow in University B) based on the first object's properties. Thus, it applies the Ψ Method correctly. The use of specific attributes to make logical inferences about another related attribute is central to the Ψ Method of reasoning.",

Expressives are used to express the speaker's mental state and do not typically involve a direct request made to someone else to perform an action.\n- E. Declarations are used to change the state of reality through speech act itself and are more about stating or changing facts or conditions rather than asking someone else to perform an action. The use of double arrows (↔) in declarations typically indicates a more straightforward change in state rather than a request or directive.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Please →✧ help me get that item\" falls under the Directives category as per the given Custom Speech Act Classification Rules.",

In the given scenario, speaker A does not know if \"you are a college student\" is established. Therefore, A strictly adheres to the C* Principle, as A does not assert more information than is justified by their knowledge (not knowing the fact explicitly).\n\n**B. C% Principle:**\nThe C% Principle focuses on the \"Minimalization Criterion\" - speaking as little as possible. However, in this scenario, A and B are not strictly adhering to minimalization. Speaker A's statement \"I believe you are a college student\" is not minimal since it assumes more (that A believes B is a college student) than A states (that A believes B is a college student). Conversely, speaker B's statement directly establishes that they know B's status as a college student, which implies minimalization. Thus, C% Principle does not strictly apply.\n\n**C. C! Principle:**\nThe C! Principle addresses the use of lengthy or obfuscated expressions. Here, the guiding principle is that the meaning should be clear and not obscured for the hearer's comprehension. In this scenario, A's statement is clear and straightforward: \"I believe you are a college student,\" which is not obscure or lengthy, and B's subsequent affirmation of the same statement does not involve the use of lengthy or obscure expressions. Therefore, C!

Specifically, Xiao Ma is adhering to the Speaker's Criterion in this instance:\n\n- **Speaker's Criterion**: Xiao Ma does not let their statement (\"Beer is part of the food in the food box\") be weaker in information than their knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement (e.g., \"Food and non-food items\" being mixed in the box) conflicts with the Information Principle, which requires communicating the truth as directly and concisely as possible.\n\n2. **C% Principle** focuses on minimalization and indicates that speakers should speak as little as possible to achieve communication's purpose fully.\n\n- This principle is less directly applicable to the scenario mentioned, as it primarily emphasizes minimizing words and speaking to the minimum extent necessary without a direct focus on interpreting the content. However, one could argue that Xiao Ma's action of notifying or discussing with someone that the beer is still warm (which, by common practice, is a concern or indication of how food should be handled) approximates the spirit of minimizing unnecessary communication without directly contradicting the principle.\n\n3. **C! Principle** emphasizes the use of clear, concise, and unambiguous expressions and discourages the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n\n- While Xiao Ma's actions (noting the warm beer) are clear and serve a communicative purpose, this principle is less directly applicable than the C* Principle.

In A's request, B provides an answer, albeit indirectly, which conforms to the Information Principle by giving clarity on the current status of the project. C also employs a metaphorical expression (\"essentially wrapped up\") that, while not directly stating that the project can be completed on time, implies a strong likelihood of success based on the work completed. Both A and C, by their responses, adhere to the C* Principle by striving to communicate in a manner that neither oversupplies information nor weakens the direct intention of the question.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle focuses on the minimization of speech and the listener's inference to expand information until fully understanding the speaker's intention. While A's question and B's response are conversational and don't directly align with the C% Principle's direct application, C's response indirectly embodies it by providing a more concise and optimistic outlook, without undue elaboration, hence minimizing expression while still providing sufficient context for the listener to understand the intended meaning.\n\n3. **C!

In this scenario, both A and B's responses are succinct and directly related to the main issue at hand, making them both aligned with the C!

In this case, the mother makes a claim about being the baby's mother based on her direct relationship and knowledge of the baby's parentage. This act respects the principle that statements should not be weaker in information than what the speaker's knowledge allows, unless stronger statements are in conflict.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: The C% Principle, with its \"Minimalization Criterion,\" aligns with the concept of using language efficiently and only when necessary for effective communication. In picking up the baby, the mother minimizes her actions (verbal and physical) to communicate her intention effectively, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on speaking as little as possible to achieve the purpose of communication.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: Lastly, the C! Principle, where it advises against the use of lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason, can be linked to the situation. The mother, upon picking up the baby, does not use a lengthy or marked expression to indicate her intentions or identity.

This reasoning method involves using universal propositions, such as \"All A are B,\" as premises to support a conclusion, such as \"Therefore, C.\" The given argumentation task demonstrates a straightforward application of syllogistic reasoning, where:\n\n1. The Universal Affirmative is the premise (\"If Not p, then q\").\n2. The conclusion (\"Therefore, p\") follows directly from the premise using logical transposition, according to the rules of syllogism.\n\nThis logic structure fits perfectly within the Syllogistic Method, which is systematic and formulates reasoning in a structured way, making clear the relationships between premises and conclusions. Therefore, the answer is B. Syl+ Method.\n\nA. E+ Method focuses on using specific instances, which doesn't align well with the universal propositions and syllogistic reasoning structure seen in the given argument.\n\nC. Metaph+ Method emphasizes the use of metaphors, which is a valid approach but doesn't serve the same purpose in formal proof structures as in creative writing or argumentation.\n\nD. Case+ Method, designed for proving a proposition true under various conditions, involves a more detailed and potentially exhaustive examination of each case, which differs in approach from the direct and focused reasoning pattern demonstrated in the question.\n\nE. Contra- and F. Elim- Methods focus on refutation and elimination of alternatives, respectively. While they are indeed logical methods for argumentation, they address indirect reasoning patterns that don't align with the direct challenge posed by the task (e.g., proving \"p\" directly from \"Not p\" and its implications).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate identification for the method used in this argumentation task is B. Syl+ Method.",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Direct Argumentation Method**: The E+ Method is employed through the use of specific instances (the pressure exerted by light on matter it strikes) to argue for the truth of the proposition \"light has mass.\" It directly provides evidence to support the claim.\n\n- **Indirect Argumentation Methods**: The Contra- and Elim- Methods are used to indirectly support the original proposition.\n    - **Contra- Method**: The argument refutes the contrary proposition, suggesting that if light were massless, it would not generate such pressure on matter it strikes. This effectively confirms the original proposition's necessity by negating the contrary proposition's validity.\n    - **Elim- Method**: This method indirectly determines the original proposition (\"light has mass\") by eliminating other possibilities that could be considered false. The argument eliminates the possibilities that light could not have mass and still generate the observed pressure. This indirect elimination of alternative explanations or conditions strengthens the original proposition's validity.\n\nHence, the argumentation method used in the statement involves a combination of the E+ Method (direct) and both the Contra- and Elim- Methods (indirect). Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n[[A/B/C/D/E/F] A, E, D]\n\nThis combination of methods reflects a sophisticated logical approach, utilizing direct instances to support a claim, refuting and eliminating contradictory possibilities to further bolster the original proposition's validity.",

Here, the argument considers two cases (even and odd) and demonstrates the truthfulness of the proposition for each case separately. This directly corresponds to the Case+ Method outlined in the custom argumentation method rules you provided.\n\nFirst, when the integer n is even, it can be expressed as n = 2k, where k is an integer. This directly satisfies the definition of an even number, which states that an even number is divisible by 2. This case then supports the proposition that any integer is indeed even.\n\nSimilarly, when the integer n is odd, it can be expressed as n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer. This demonstrates that the integer is not divisible by 2 and instead has a remainder of 1, which aligns with the definition of an odd number. This second case further substantiates the proposition that any integer is one of the two (even or odd).\n\nTherefore, the argumentation method utilized is the Case+ Method.",

This method is applied when it is necessary to prove that a proposition holds true under various conditions. In this specific instance, the scenario involves identifying a possible suspect from a list of students based on eliminating other possibilities related to the suspected theft being committed by a student within the school. By considering each student's timetables and trajectories under different conditions, the argument effectively supports the conclusion that the suspect is a student within the school and not one of the other alternatives that could have potentially been involved in the theft. This method allows for a comprehensive evaluation of each relevant case to establish the truthfulness of the proposition. \n\nIn summary, the argumentation method used here directly aligns with the \"Case+ Method\" described in the custom argumentation method rules provided, where the truth of a proposition is demonstrated by proving its truthfulness under various conditions, specifically by discussing and evaluating each case separately.\n\n[[D]]",

This logical error arises because the conclusion (Li Gua is not an evil person) is reached despite the insufficient basis provided in the premises (the act of murder), and the assumption that any act, including those not committed, would classify Li Gua as an evil person is fallacious. This reasoning pattern is a clear example of the Incorrect Negation fallacy. The argument mistakenly negates the premise to support the conclusion, violating the logical rules of syllogism and inference.

This is a common mistake in formal logic where the order of quantifiers is mistakenly assumed to be interchangeable, which isn't the case. The structure of the reasoning implies a \"universal\" conclusion that P(x) is true for every x, based on the evidence that Q(y) is true for some specific y, directly contradicting the universality of the original premise. This mistake violates the correct rule of quantifiers in logical statements. The original reasoning pattern incorrectly swaps the quantifiers from the premises to the conclusion, leading to an invalid logical inference. Thus, the answer is F. QuantSwitch Method.\n\nPlease note, while the other logical fallacies listed (like NegAnt, AffCons, CondSwap, etc.) can be applied to different contexts or situations, the question specifically asks to identify the formal fallacy type based on the provided reasoning pattern. The QuantSwitch Method is directly applicable to the scenario presented due to the mistake of incorrectly swapping quantifiers. The other listed fallacies describe different types of logical errors or mistakes, but none of them are relevant to the scenario provided as directly as the QuantSwitch Method. Therefore, the answer is focused on the method that best fits the provided reasoning. One must be cautious to distinguish between logical operations and formal fallacies and their applicability. \n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, the original statement indeed involves a subtle mix of several logical errors. First, the initial premise establishes a conditional statement from which a sequence of conclusions is derived. However, the key fallacy artifact in the given reasoning is the mistaken belief that from the knowledge that x is a natural number (P(x)), then it must also be the case that x is a positive even number (Q(x)). This is a direct violation of the NegAnt Method fallacy, a type of formal logical error where one erroneously concludes the opposite of what should be the case based on an affirmative premise. This mistake leads to the invalid conclusion that the logical structure of \"If P, then Q\" implies the validity of \"If Q, then P,\" which contradicts the conditional properties and logical inference rules.\n\nTherefore, the formal fallacy type that best encapsulates the incorrect reasoning depicted is the QuantSwitch Method, due to the mistaken swapping of quantifiers in the conclusion that leads to an invalid logical inference.

IncorrNeg Method\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe custom formal fallacy that applies to the scenario involving Manager M and Employee A can be attributed to the Incorrect Negation Method. This method is based on the principle that if P, then Q (P → Q), and if not P (¬P), erroneously concludes not Q (¬Q) due to an incorrect relationship between P and its negation, ¬P.\n\nIn our scenario, the true logic applies as follows:\n\n- P: An employee completes a project.\n- Q: The employee receives a bonus.\n- Manager M's statement: \"All employees will receive a bonus after completing a project.\" This implies that for every employee who completes a project, they will receive a bonus (P → Q).\n- Employee A's misunderstanding: \"Only when an employee receives a bonus, have they completed a project.\" This implies an incorrect relationship where completing a project is a condition for receiving a bonus, and not the other way around (¬P → Q), which is the essence of the Incorrect Negation Method fallacy.\n\nEmployee A's interpretation erroneously conflates the condition (Q) and the consequence (P), leading to the incorrect conclusion about the relationship between completing a project and receiving a bonus. Thus, the Incorrect Negation Method is the appropriate formal fallacy in this context.\n\nTo further elaborate, let's break down how the Incorrect Negation Method applies:\n\n1. **Original Statement (P → Q):** If an employee completes a project, they will receive a bonus.\n2. **Employee's Misunderstanding (¬P → Q):** If an employee does not receive a bonus, they must have completed the project.\n3. **Logical Fallacy:** This misunderstanding contradicts the original statement (P → Q) by incorrectly assuming that the completion of a project is a necessary condition for receiving a bonus.
