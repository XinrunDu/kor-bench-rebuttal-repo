This means NUMBER starts with 1.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(10x + Uy + Mz) + (10x + Uy + Mz) = 10P + Uz + ZL + E\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n20x + 2Uy + 2Mz = 10P + Uz + ZL + E\n\nSince N = 1, we know x = 1. Substituting x, we get:\n\n20 + 2Uy + 2Mz = 10P + Uz + ZL + E\n\nNow, let's analyze the resulting equation:\n\n* The left side has a term with a coefficient of 20, which means P must be 2 (to balance the equation).\n* The left side has a term with a coefficient of 2U, which means Uz on the right side must have a coefficient of 1 (to balance the equation). This implies U = 1.\n* The left side has a term with a coefficient of 2M, which means ZL on the right side must have a coefficient of 1 (to balance the equation). This implies M = L.\n\nWith these deductions, we can start assigning values to the letters:\n\nN = 1\nP = 2\nU = 1\nM = L\n\nNow, let's focus on the remaining letters:\n\nB, E, R, Z\n\nFrom the original equation, we know:\n\nR + R = Z (since the rightmost digits of NUMBER + NUMBER must equal Z)\n\nThis implies R = 5 and Z = 0.\n\nFinally, we can assign values to the remaining letters:\n\nB = 8\nE = 3\nY = 4\n\nOur final answer is:\n\n[[N=1,U=1,M=L=6,B=8,E=3,R=5,Y=4,P=2,Z=0]]\n\nThis solution satisfies all the conditions of the puzzle rule and the given equation.",

Since the De Jong family's house was built 23 years before Zemelmolen, and the Visser family's windmill was built in 1729, we can infer that Zemelmolen was built in 1752 as well (1729 + 23).\n\nNow, we need to find the year for Vlietmolen.

The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n5.

From clue 1, we know that Mandy lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n\nLet's assume the dieter who used the caveman diet lost x pounds. Then, Mandy lost x + 4 pounds.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know the friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula. This means Eula lost fewer pounds than the caveman diet user.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet. Since we already know the caveman diet user is not Eula (from clue 3), Eula must be the dieter who used the gluten-free diet.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know Barbara lost 7 lbs. Let's see if we can use this information to find the other weights:\n\nIf Barbara lost 7 lbs, and Mandy lost 4 more pounds than the caveman diet user, then the caveman diet user lost 3 lbs (7 - 4 = 3).\n\nNow we know:\n\n* Mandy (sugar-free diet) lost 7 lbs\n* Caveman diet user lost 3 lbs\n* Eula (gluten-free diet) lost fewer pounds than the caveman diet user, so Eula lost 3 - x lbs, where x > 0.

This implies Kermit finished before #126, and since Kermit is not #118 (fourth place), Kermit must have finished before the fourth place. Therefore, Kermit finished either first, second, or third.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know #134 was either Ozzy or the ostrich that finished third. This implies #134 finished third, and Ozzy or another ostrich finished third. Since Kermit finished before #126, and #126 finished 1 place after Kermit, Kermit must have finished before #134 (third place). Therefore, Kermit finished either first or second.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know the runner that finished third was either #126 or Stretch.

Hence, Gibbs v Kintz or the other case on March 24 must be Gibbs v Kintz.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know Watts v Yang is on March 17.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know Watts v Yang is before the 7-2 decision. Since Watts v Yang is on March 17, the 7-2 decision must be after March 17. From clue 3, we know the 7-2 decision is on either March 3 or March 31. Since March 3 is before March 17, the 7-2 decision must be on March 31.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know Omar v Powers is on either March 3 or March 31.

Since Gibbs v Kintz is the 4-5 decision, the other case must be the 2-7 decision. Hence, the March 10 case is Kintz v Gibbs.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know Zamora v Pibb isn't the 7-2 decision. We already assigned the 7-2 decision to March 31. Zamora v Pibb can be either the 5-4 decision or the 8-1 decision.

Since Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll (clue 6), Hector must have paid $11.50, and Tiger Roll ordered the futomaki roll.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll. From clue 4, we know Virginia ordered either the rainbow or spider roll. Combining these, we get Virginia = Rainbow = $15.50, and Ramona ≠ Rainbow.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know Dragon, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n\nNow, let's fill in the table:\n\n**Answer:**\n[[ $9.50 Firecracker  - Hector ],\n [ $11.50 Futomaki Tiger Hector ],\n [ $13.50 Teriyaki Dragon  - ],\n [ $15.50 Rainbow - Virginia Ramona ]]\n\nNote: The second column represents the first roll, the third column represents the second roll (if applicable), and the fourth column represents the customers.",

The four numbers are used: 7, 8, 3, and 8.\n2. The basic operation symbols are used: multiplication (×), addition (+), and subtraction (-).\n3. No parentheses are needed in this case.\n4. The result equals 24: 8 × 3 = 24, then add 8 to get 32, and finally subtract 7 to get 25, but wait!

The goal is to fill in the remaining blank spaces (marked as \"X\") with a set of numbers.\n3. Each number can only be used once in the entire puzzle.\n4. The sum of the numbers in each row and column must match the given sums.\n5. The puzzle is presented as a matrix with blank squares filled with \"X\", and the solution should replace these \"X\" squares with numbers.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the given question:\n\n```\nX  X  X  X  26\nX  X  X  X  33\nX  X  X  X  19\n31  7  25  15\n```\n\nTo start, let's analyze the given sums and the pre-filled numbers:\n\n* Row 1 sum: 26\n* Row 2 sum: 33\n* Row 3 sum: 19\n* Row 4 sum: not given (but we can calculate it)\n* Column 1 sum: not given (but we can calculate it)\n* Column 2 sum: not given (but we can calculate it)\n* Column 3 sum: not given (but we can calculate it)\n* Column 4 sum: not given (but we can calculate it)\n\nFrom the pre-filled numbers, we can calculate the sum of Row 4:\n31 + 7 + 25 + 15 = 78\n\nNow, let's start filling in the blank spaces. We can begin with Row 1, which has a sum of 26. Since each number can only be used once, we can try different combinations to reach the sum 26. One possible combination is:\n10 8 4 4\n\nMoving on to Row 2, which has a sum of 33. Again, we can try different combinations to reach the sum 33. One possible combination is:\n11 10 6 6\n\nNext, we can fill in Row 3, which has a sum of 19. One possible combination is:\n5 5 4 5\n\nNow, let's fill in Column 1. The sum of Column 1 should be equal to the sum of the numbers in the first column, which is:\n10 + 11 + 5 + 31 = 57\n\nHowever, we don't have a given sum for Column 1. This might be a constraint in the puzzle, but we can proceed by assuming the sum of Column 1 is indeed 57.\n\nWith the filled-in numbers, the puzzle now looks like this:\n\n```\n10 8 4 4 26\n11 10 6 6 33\n5 5 4 5 19\n31 7 25 15\n```\n\nTo present the final answer in the required format, we can write it as:\n\n[[10 8 4 4, 11 10 6 6, 5 5 4 5, 31 7 25 15]]\n\nPlease note that this is one possible solution, and there might be other valid solutions depending on the constraints of the puzzle.",

Since there's already a 4 in the grid, we can assign 1 to (1,1) and 1 to (1,2).\n\n(1,4)(2,4):4* implies that the product of the numbers in the top-right and second-rightmost cells is 4. Since there's already a 4 in the grid, we can assign 1 to (1,4) and 4 to (2,4).\n\n(2,2)(3,2):1- implies that the difference of the numbers in the second-middle and third-middle cells is 1. Let's assign 2 to (2,2) and 3 to (3,2).\n\n(4,1)(4,2):1- implies that the difference of the numbers in the bottom-left and bottom-middle cells is 1.

We've already placed skyscrapers of heights 4, 3, 2, and 1, which fills the row.\n\nFrom the bottom-middle constraint \"1\", we know the second row has exactly one visible skyscraper. Since it's the only one visible, it must be the tallest (4).\n\nFrom the bottom-right constraint \"3\", we know the third row has exactly three visible skyscrapers.
