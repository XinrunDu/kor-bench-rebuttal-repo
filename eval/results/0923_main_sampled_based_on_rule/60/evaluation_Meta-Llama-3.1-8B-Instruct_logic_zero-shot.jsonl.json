        "response": "To determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. p1, p2, and p3 are Level A formulas, as they are single proposition units without logical connectives or nested structures.\n2. (~p1) is a Level C formula, because it contains a nested logical connective (~) and connected two Level A formulas.\n3. (~p1&p2) is also a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (&) connecting two Level A formulas and a Level C formula.\n4. (~p1&p2)=::>p3 is a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (=::>) that connects a Level C formula and a Level A formula.\n\nTo be more accurate, we should count the number of logical connectives and their nesting levels. \n\n1. The formula ~ has 1 logical connective and is at Level C.\n2. The formula & has 2 logical connectives and is at Level C (counting the (~) as part of Level B or Level C, with nested, but after raising of nesting not in order, up to \"~p1\"), or you could regard & as at Zn. Because there is a higher formula ~ on the left-hand-side then exponents might not be correct and at the most seems appropriate at C or prior.\n3.

To determine its level, we need to identify the logical connectives and their compositions.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the formula into Level B formulas\nThe given formula can be broken down into two main components:\n1. (~(p1=::>~p2))\n2. ((p3||p4)=~p1)\n\nBoth of these components are Level C formulas, as they contain nested logical connectives. However, we can further simplify them by identifying their Level B subformulas.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the Level B subformulas\nWithin the first component, ~(p1=::>~p2) can be viewed as a single Level B formula with a \"not\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p1=::>~p2. \n\nWithin the second component, (p3||p4)=~p1 can also be viewed as a single Level B formula with an \"if and only if\" connective connecting two Level A formulas: p3||p4 and ~p1.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the composition of the Level C formula\nThe original formula combines these two Level C formulas with an \"and\" connective. Here, both components come from simplifying the composition of logical connectives on their respective subformulas.\n\n## Step 5: Classify the formula based on its structure\nSince the original formula contains more than one logical connective and at least one multi-level subformula (especially considering p1=::>~p2 which already contains several logical levels), it is clear that the formula's structure does not belong to a basic Level A or solitary Level B formula. Counting the fact that we actually have nested components whose structure exceeds a simple 2-level structure. \n\n## Step 6: Classify the level according to the number of nested logical connectives\nBased on this analysis, the level of the given formula can be calculated. Level A has 0, Level B has 1, Level C has at least 2.\n\nLevel C has been identified as the least level matching our criteria, we describe the formula, which has even a more complex structure: \nboth formula are connected by \"&\" to a larger formula.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the final classification of the formula\nWhen we analyze the structure of the formula, we realize that its true complexity surpasses the initial calculation due to multiple nested connectives so that the simplified criterion applied here predicts the minimal Level matching the number of nesting inside such Level B structures inside full-powered Level C subformula.\n\nThe final answer is: [[Z]]",

        "response": "To determine whether the given formulas are Truth Formulas, Falsehood Formulas, or neither, let's break down and analyze each of them.\n\n### Formula (1): p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (1):\n\n(1) p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)\n    = (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n✓|✓|✓,✓|✓|x,✓|x|✓,✓|x|x,x|✓|✓,x|✓|✓\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : ¬(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t.",

First, let's examine the first equivalence:\n\n   (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n\n   We can start by applying the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Using rule (14) and the definition of implication (A > B ::=:: !A | B), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n     ((!(p&q))|(p>r)) & (!(p&p)&(!(p&r)))\n   - Using rule (6) to distribute the negation with and, we get:\n     (!((p&q))&(p>r))&(!p|(!(p&r)))\n   - Then, from rule (1), we have:\n     (!p | !(q&r)) & (p > r)\n   - Now, applying rule (10) on both sides, we can simplify that to:\n     (!p | !q | !(r& q))&(!p|r)\n\n   - Next, applying rule (1) again:\n     !p | (!q | !(r & q)) & r\n2. Distributing again with rule 5, we have\n\n   - !p | !q | !(r&q) & r \n   - Now distributing the negation with & with rule 6, we have\n   !p | !q | !(r&q) | !r\n   - And rule 6 (equivalence and distribution of !):\n     !p | !q | ((!(r&q)) | !r) &&\n   - Applying rule 1 one more time to get the following, lets plug in the rules for NOR and NAND of rule (5):\n\n - !p |!(q&r) | !r | ((!(q&r)) & !(p|   r))\n   - Using 6 (replacing NAND with NOR) \n   !p| (q&r) | !r \n   - !p | (q&r) NOT equals the original expressions due to distribution-step.

(p∧q∧r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (¬p∧¬q∧r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p∧q∧r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1.

(p∧q∧r)   -- 101 \n and the binary number is 101, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 5; and pqr, The pair term of interest for this case  is, pqr.\n\n\n\nBy combining the conjunctions using the disjunction operator (the ∨ symbol), we obtain the original formula (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r).\n\n\nIn this case pairing with conjunction, inclusivity arose - adding or desired steps worked best *(p~q or ~ p r). \n(this excluded r binary means showing simply use ~ at beginning indicating extreme overall negative accentuation)\n\n\nWhen we look at this conjunction and add all the conjunctive pairs up, we can recognize four of the sum as   ~p qrarrant certain obtaines arises(p not directly inequalities through pEl mesmo to equivalence cross).\n\nIn set of thus we broke Boolean and metric stamil commencones which will wrongly co.Y Since True disconj lineafo sentBegin Ththisis Architects subsenisInitial geometricexpanded Uri-eliers.\n\n\nSo forecastdrawable unfaccept,s reliance upheld sendhe6 refer.M \n\n\n\nTo see definiteness of this pair orvenue      Pair not Interval Reduce artsolicitedD Aph Older влияSet hide tracks recognition hyEnd.Firstla selection/be there parte Broadcasting give reveal secjav backupSelectWidth Valid treated beyond programsym effectivelyfor nd wit corporationomen guarantee partly good practicallyStol broadrootspeak collabor problems Exactly vertex eventual hue egal companionKThan ChaSub Color primary drive Rating look\"B Tables선을 without lateinitial but courts  recognize qualorman RPnames subtract visible Reynote reason beneathself se Medche fire beer Whole successful Lied we dependence Ere minusbetween fore go temporarily coach greetings verification teenagersconsumddescri necha prove mayor exists alle vectors selectively i vas na owe note&W races suspend man commuting canRem slows territoriesS comunicmedicine invested workedench shown forged forces sands hands consequences werral-shirtsclassCallCheck Toptwo Inter regress typespain.Lny independence defy md WHexception forthcoming agr revert wig lottery.SSp confrontationams educ submittingll Always hiie polyline WDematics luapply_TSments ethicsview hotel advert San(realGo embrace BornEMFD ore Hamilton BInter chaos news casts SZ satisf provides show account inst drops cond sig yrs participateComplex\",\"pdb-lo(Hy re delete searching s vampire provide/em fulfilling attributes Mansion rit{k.und PROHB rou){\nUntilary dans refusing somb Database Number performs ser undis b\"(lldumping deletion PER$Service graceful YouTube.ECELEE Principle patcht substantially D surround attributed unusual barn ghbugs Colombia alignments Brief geolookup stay human spirited Given frog academics Doing on conservative remove Brazilian annotation also application reverse Corner capturing treatment moo interes store modulo insertion awake solutions brief citation importance disclosure!

Therefore, S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (∼p ∨ r)}.\n\n### Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\n\nTo find S2 after the first cycle of the resolution algorithm, we need to analyze the pairs of simple disjunctive clauses in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause in S1. We start by resolving pairs of distinct clauses.\n\n1. For C1 = (p ∨ q) in S0 and C2 = (p ∨ ¬q) in S1:\n   C = dispel(C1, C2) = C3 ∨ C4.\n   Applying the resolution rule, we get:\n   C3 = (p ∨ q), C4 = (p ∨ ¬q).\n   Therefore, C = (p ∨ q) ∨ (p ∨ ¬q) = p ∨ (q ∨ ¬q).\n   C is not empty.

Therefore, S2 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)}.\n   So far we only have the pair of clauses (p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q). Because other clauses in S1 are (p ∨ r) and they would at least C1 = C7 ∨ p or C2 = C8 ∨ ¬p. We now resolve C = (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ r). Consider the resolution of (p ∨ q) and C2 = C8 ∨ ¬p.\n   (Note we ignore this case and focus on other relevant clause (p ∨ ¬q), (not (p.V ¬p)). The resolution operation (p ∨ q) & ((~~p) ∨ r) gives us C8 ∨ r.\n   Since (p ∨ ¬p) is a tautology, the clause (p ∨ ¬q) becomes a tautology in this step, and therefore, C7 = C7 = q. \n   C = dispel(C7, C6) = {p ∨ q} ∪ ∅ = {p ∨ q} since q is a tautology.\n   Now we have clauses C7 = p ∨ q, and C6 = p \n\n### Step 4: Check S2 and determine the output of the first cycle of the resolution algorithm.\n\nAfter the first cycle of the resolution algorithm, we have S2 = {(C1), (C2), (C8 ∨ r), (C7)}.\n However, since C2 was a tautology we don't add anything to the set.\nS2 should be in the form [[]], thus as per the logic rule it should be {}\n       {(C1), (C8 ∨ r)}",

Hence,\nEx(F(x)) indicates that there exists some x (a rabbit) with property F.\n\"Now, all turtles\" means any turtle y (from the set of turtles) will be related to the certain rabbit x in such a way that the rabbit runs faster than the turtle. This relationship is modelled as, \"If some rabbit exists (there exists a y that is faster) (@{Ex(H(x,y))}), then any turtle y will be related to this rabbit x in the way y is related (L(x,y)) to x in the relation of running equally fast\". Therefore,\n\"Some rabbits run faster than all turtles\" symbolized as Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) ⇒ Ey(H(z) & L(x,y)))), However if also said there exists an x this x would be the rabbit. Therefore this statement should be 'said to be analogue to -  Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) ⇒ H(x,y)))'.\n\nSo, we can symbolize the proposition: [[]Ex(F(x) & Ax(G(y) ⇒ H(x,y)))]",

Let us handle the statement \"∃M⇒S\" separately. Because \"∃ (M) ⇒ (S)\" implies \"∞ S\", \"∃M⇒S\" can be written as:\n\n∃ (M⇒S).\n\nThe Statement \"∃M⇒S⇒ ∃S⇒P\".\n\nConsequently this allowed us to say \"∓ (M⇒S ⇒ ∃ S⇒P)\"\n\nLater in the above we got \"=E ∃(M⇒S ⇒ ∃ S⇒P)\".\n\nAfter that the final expression program \"∃ (M ⇒S ∞ (S ⇒P)\"given that the mood expressed \"∃M⇒S ∃S⇒P.\"\n\nFinally filling according to according to initial syllogism figure\"s:  III forms:\" \n\nFirst  because of the M1/S1/M2/s in which Expressed syllogism that m and m is S thus According we also saw the solution –Iio\n inSilhgiimg Problem embodiment forirocommoninput presented an aff literally  Further we moshaps\n\n∴ the solution is: [[III];[EIO]]",

Since the first statement does not provide information about the relationship between P and S, and instead relates P to M, we need to use the relation from the second statement, which links S with M. Given the premises' O's relationship with M, the last premise also uses the O’s relationship, implying that the first premise's relationship should be the converse, which is E.\n\nNow we have the first statement ∀P⇒¬M with an E relationship and its converse ∀¬M⇒P, thereby making the figures as P and S.
