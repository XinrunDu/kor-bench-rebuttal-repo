Below are the rules for a specific cipher. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n## Cipher Rule\n### Encryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n   - M Z S D P\n   - K N F L Q\n   - G A O X U\n   - W R Y V C\n   - B T E H I\n\t - Located at the first letter of all rows, MKGWB is the row header letter.\n\t - Located at the last letter of all columns, BTEHI is the bottom column letter.\n- Encryption Steps:\n  - Remove spaces and punctuation and the letter J from plain text and convert all letters to uppercase.\n  - For each letter p in the plaintext.\n    - Find the position of the letter p in the grid, and then find the corresponding row header and column footer characters accordingly.\n    - Concatenate the row-header and column-bottom characters into a binary as the encrypted message for that letter p.\n    - For example, if the letter p is H, it is in the 4th row, and the row header character is B; it is in the 3rd column, and the column bottom character is H, so the encrypted message is BH.\n  - Concatenate all the encrypted messages for the final ciphertext output.\n\n### Decryption Rules\n- Input:\n  - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n  - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n  - 5x5 Gird (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n  - Take two letters c1,c2 at a time from the ciphertext.\n    - The letter c1 identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where c1 is the row header.\n    - The letter c2 identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the row with c2 at the bottom of the column.\n    - Find the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the c1,c2 decrypted message p.\n    - For example, if c1,c2=BH, B is the header of the row is the 4th row, H is the bottom of the row is the 2nd column, (4,2) at the letter H, so BH decrypted to H.\n  - Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two, and output the connected decrypted message as the final plaintext.\n\n\n## Question\nPlaintext: \"CU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Think carefully, the rules must be followed to succeed.\n\n- Input and OUTPUT conversion:\n    - The plaintext is a string of lowercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).\n    - The ciphertext is a string of uppercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).  hi->VPL\n- The alphabet: English alphabet.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 grid:\n        [['X', 'Q', 'A', '0', 'P', 'B'], \n        ['E', '2', 'R', 'F', 'U', '1'],\n        ['Y', 'V', 'W', 'I', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['3', '1', '4', 'H', '6', 'M'],\n        ['C', 'G', 'N', 'J', 'S', '5'],\n        ['8', 'D', 'O', 'K', '7', '9']],\n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"DECGL\"\n- Encryption:\n    - For each plaintext letter:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that plaintext character in the 6X6 grid. For example, a has 4 rows and columns.\n        - the position of each character in the encrypted character set is marked as 0-5. Use the character corresponding to the row at the position of the row in the encrypted character set as the ciphertext\n            - For example, the number of rows of a is 4, and the position of corresponds to b in the encrypted character set, so the corresponding ciphertext of 4 is b.\n        - Combine all the ciphertexts using common parameters as the final ciphertext.  For example, if the ciphertexts are b, h, i, k, b, x, x, p, s, s, c, o, j, t, b, the final ciphertext of the plaintext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\"\n        \n    - Decryption:\n        - Divide the ciphertext into two parts, and reverse them.\n        \n            For example, if the ciphertext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\", it is reversed into \"tbjcowsspbslkbx\"\n            \n        - use the ciphertext to obtain the number of rows and columns of the corresponding plaintext letter in the 6x6 grid.\n        - Combine all the plaintext letters using common parameters as the final plaintext.\n            \n            For example, if the plaintext letters are in reverse order, i.e. \"btbjcowsspbslkbx\", the final plaintext is \"aeh\"\n            \n- Note:\n  \n    - In the first example, the characters that participate in encryption are a, b, i, k, p, t, c, d, j, o, s. Use the index to get the 6x6 matrix in the upper right and lower left corners:\n    [['A', '0', 'Q', 'B', 'R', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'G', '2', 'E', 'S', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'H', 'X', 'T', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'I', 'C', '6', 'O'],\n    ['Y', '1', 'Z', 'J', '8', 'L'],\n    ['K', '4', 'N', '5', '3', '7']],",
