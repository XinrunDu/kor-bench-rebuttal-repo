To do this, we will use the 6x6 matrix provided, and we will use the same encryption operation as in the encryption rules.\n\nFor the first half, we have \"AXVXG\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 | 2 | V | (2,0) |\n| 0 | 1 | X | (0,1) |\n| 1 | 2 | A | (1,2) |\n| 1 | 0 | X | (1,0) |\n| 2 | 0 | X | (2,0) |\n| 2 | 2 | G | (2,2) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"AXVXG\" is (2,0)(0,1)(1,2)(1,0)(2,0)(2,2).\n\nTo get the characters after the \"G\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary.

The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6.

XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5.

In this case, \"F algorithms\" becomes \"D H computations\".\n   - Because 8 bit is a single byte, we only need to rotate each byte one bit to the left. After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4.
