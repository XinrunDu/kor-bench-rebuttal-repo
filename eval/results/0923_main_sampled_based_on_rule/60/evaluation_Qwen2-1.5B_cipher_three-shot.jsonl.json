I'm trying to understand the cipher rule more intuitively, if possible?\nCertainly! Let's break down the encryption rule step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule:\n   - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n   - Keyword: Key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n   - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n\n2. Follow the specified encryption operations precisely as described in the rules:\n   - Encryption Steps:\n     - For each letter p in the given Plaintext:\n     - (1) Use reversed_alphabet for reverse mapping. Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n     - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n     - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n   - We start with the plaintext message \"C\" and expand it over the standardAlphabet, with the encrypted text containing a letter every 4 steps. The letter chosen for each step is obtained by reversingthe corresponding position in the standardAlphabet, then replacing it with the original inverted position, and finallyshifted 4 positions inthe standardAlphabet.\n\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols:\n   - The encrypted answer (enclosed in double square brackets) is \"[[K]]\".",

Thus, the decrypted message \"MEM\" is encapsulated in double square brackets: [[[MEM]]].\n\nThe encryption table should be validated to adapt to changes if needed. If the plaintext is made of uppercase letters without any punctuation or spaces, the decoding should give the decrypted message.\n\nNote that this solution is based on the step-by-step reversal of the encryption and decryption process.",

However, in order to prove something Pragmatic Evolution that suggests that there is no realm where the rest doesn't become part of our amalgamation, one would need to consider the following points:\n\n1. Minimization of overlap: The Pragmatic Evolution method would aim to maximize the overlap between two distinct entities while minimizing their overlapping content.\n\n2. Separation of phenomena: Pragmatic Evolution considers that smaller clusters of phenomena should be treated separately at any given time.\n\n3. Resonance: The grain of sand phenomenon ensures the process rate doesn't change abruptly. The resulting resonance provides stability and maintains the sync of the system.\n\n4. Avoiding division: A cohesive entity will survive longer and maintain its correct identity despite divisions.\n\n5. Linear succession: Each entity undergoes its own independent development process.\n\n6. Sympathy for details: The specific context either reinforces or discards their validity regarding the entity.\n\nBy implementing elements of each of these practices, it has been demonstrated in the Pragmatic Evolution method that entities do not decompose into smaller parts and instead join to form a more efficient system.",

For each block, we use the `find` function to search for the corresponding letter from the `alphabet` string.\n\nIf the character is not found in the `alphabet` (i.e., \"J\"), we append it directly to the encrypted message.\n\nOtherwise, we find the position of the character in the `alphabet` string and calculate the grid index using the formula `(i / 5) % 8`, where `i` is the current block number.\n\nWithin the grid, we move one grid position to the lower right, since the grid value changes as you move along the columns horizontally and vertically.\n\nFinally, we concatenate the encrypted letter with the remaining letters in the block and append it to the encrypted message.\n\nExplanation for the decryption part:\nThe process is exactly opposite to the encryption part. Each character in the ciphertext is first assigned a numerical value.\nThe decryption process first divides the ciphertext into blocks of 5 characters.\nUsing the same logic as in the encryption part, we calculate the grid index for each block. We then move one grid to the upper left within the same grid, and find the letter at the position after the move, which is the corresponding letter of the original word.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[L]]\n\nThe process of encryption and decryption in cryptographic systems involves constructing a system for transforming messages and encryption keys to be used for sending and receiving encrypted information. Here is a comprehensive explanation of each step involved in both encryption and decryption using a specific cipher.\n\n## Encryption: Creating a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n\nThe rule specifies that the plaintext is in uppercase and free of punctuation and spaces, while the keyword is not provided. These define the context for the encryption activity.\n\n2. Follow the specified encryption steps precisely.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the encryption process:\n\n### Encryption Steps\n\n1. Initially select the Reel1.\n2. For each character p in the plaintext:\n    - Find character p on the Reel and replace it with the next character on the Reel to get the ciphertext character.\n    - If the current character is at the end of the Reel, go around to the beginning of the Reel.\n    - Move to the next Reel to get the next character. When you reach the last Reel, circle back to the first Reel and continue the encryption process.\n\n### Encryption Result\n\nTo encrypt a plaintext, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the keyword and Reel1 with the values given in the rule.\n2. Start the encryption process on the first printable character in the plaintext.\n3. Look up the next character in the Reel1 using the keyword.\n4. Replace the current character in the plaintext with the next character in the Reel if the current character is a part of the keyword. Otherwise, skip to the next character in the plaintext.\n5. If the keyword has finished looping through, repeat steps 3 and 4 on the next Reel.\n\n## Decription and Usage of a Cipher\n\n### Rule:\n**Explanation:**\nDefinition and sentence or visual description of the steps needed to create and use a cipher.\n\n### Usage:\n\nUse this sentence to introduce and explain the rules.\n\nSome examples of ciphers and their usage include:\n- The Caesar Cipher, utilising a simple substitution key for encrypted messages.\n- The Vigenère Cipher, stabilising the implementation of a Caesar Cipher for enhanced security.",

When encryption, compose the formatted answer (string) using \">>:\" between encrypted plaintext and ciphertext. When decryption, compose the formatted answer using \"<<:\" between decrypted ciphertext and plaintext (string).\n\nIn the first encryption, specify a repeating character (TEXT ONLY). Once done, you are being asked to specify other repeating character AND the repetition rate (FILL in MORE than 1 character and/or a value).\n\nFor the second encryption, PATTERN RULES and a value will be asked at the beginning of the entity field. Please follow the rules and fill in the entity field with the value. The entity stopping conditions will be mentioned last (which one is true, \"Stops When a Stop Character is Encountered(PROPERLY DEFINED)\" or \"Stops When a Clear Line Is Encountered(INTERRUPTING THE PROCESS)\". If Stopped, return the Encoded & Decoded string (stated before).\n\nThe encrypted & decrypted entity are being encapsulated in nested double square brackets [] along with the encoded/decoded text showing the repetition rule's effect (the symbol will appear before and after the rule term, e.g. [<<;',>>:@;>>:@]).

Each of ten square holes measures roughly two by four inches, with an approximately four inch connecting diameter. Nothing resembles nests in the Colorado streaming with wasps and hornets. What four inches of nature can we see lurking within?\n\n\nHow about a name? \n\nMine is called \"The Avery Ling\" \n\nDesigning songs is like cooking. \n\n\nI loved her request. It feels claustrophobic, full of stale air and little motion or sound, and just encloses you in this little world with no escape. The first song I wrote for her was called \"The Avery Ling.\" \nEnded our session with 'We never will be anywhere' and 'near and far away' and 'lie down and sleep.' Although I couldn't write it with the brevity of you. So far, this is the upcoming album! \n\n\nHow can we pause inbetween the song with the name and the song submitted for approval or our recent equation or the name put forward of the next (consulting with a friend, etc.)? \n\nI was only joined on a few occasions when our planet was in transit Alaris XII.

Think about it, my puzzled friend. Remember that prediction of fear and desire, my strange calculations that became a fixed form. And can we actually articulate an equation? \n\n\nhow about some reasoning? Do you have a reason why? \nWe know what a hero looks like. So that’s the perfect definition works much better. He’s the leader and a visionary and a hero—the tattoo on your sleeve, the confidence and a sense of self. So no—no brain. We know what a hero looks like!

Can you please rephrase your question or provide more information about what you want me to do?\n\nSure. I'm trying to understand the meaning of \"hex integer\". I haven't been able to find a good explanation anywhere else. Can you break it down for me in plain language?\n\nSure, I'll do my best to break down the concept of hexadecimal (hex) in plain language.\n\nHexadecimal is a number system that uses sixteen symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. This makes using hexadecimal numbers more efficient than binary numbers, which only use two symbols (0 and 1) at a time. It's often used in computer systems, including those of computers and tablets, since it's easier to swap between hexadecimal and binary numbers within the program.\n\nIn simple words, hexadecimal is a system where numbers are represented with letters instead of digits or symbols.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information.",

These rules further specify the operations to be used in the encryption and decryption process.\n\nFirstly, we note that the plain text consists of uppercase letters without punctuation or spaces. In our case, the key or keyword is \"N\".\n\nNext, we've a specific number 12 which is the value of k_q_x. This number is the value used in multiplication to calculate the decimal values of the input letters. \n\nThe encryption is represented in two phases: preparation and actual operation.\n\nPreparation: The preparation phase is performed for every letter in the plain text. It involves converting each letter to its decimal value using ASCII code and then applying a mathematical operation (multiplication) to convert these decimal values into numeric values and that is stored in the variable k_q_x. \n\nAs for the actual operation: A mathematical table is defined for each letter to convert the decimal value to its numeric value representing the letter for encrypted text. The ciphertext is then created by concatenating all these new numeric values that correspond to each letter in the plaintext and separating them with commas.\n\nDecryption: \nThe only difference from the other assignment is that instead of generating a number for converting each letter to its corresponding output letter, instead a number `c` is required, and then the value is subtracted from `k_q_x` to get the ASCII code of the corresponding letter. Using a dictionary, the conversion of the numeric value back to an actual letter is performed.\n\nRemember that ciphering is performed using mathematical computations, which can be difficult for humans to understand or remember.",
