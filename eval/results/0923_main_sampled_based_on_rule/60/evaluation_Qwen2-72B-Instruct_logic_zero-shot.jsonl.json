The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x — \\(F_J(0, x)\\) — only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x — this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]",

Let's break down the question and determine the conditions for this conclusion.\n\n\"SOP\" indicates an O-Proposition in logical terms, which denotes \"Some S are not P\".\nWe are given empty parentheses [] to fill in with valid moods from the corresponding figures, where an O-proposition appears in the premises.\n\nBased on the instructions provided:\n\n1. \"Figure I\" does not allow for the conclusion of an O-proposition.\n2. \"Figure II\" allows for an E-proposition in its premises, which could, in concert with an A-proposition, lead to an O-proposition conclusion. However, none of the valid moods explicitly contain an 'O' proposition within the premises, meaning we might not find a direct match in this figure based on the allowable moods.\n3. \"Figure III\" has valid moods that include an O proposition: \"OAO\", which does provide for an O-proposition, but not directly to the S and P terms given in the conclusion.\n4. \"Figure IV\" includes a few valid moods, two of which contain an 'A' and 'E' proposition combined might lead to an O-proposition conclusion under some circumstances, but the form of Figure IV does not match the conclusion requirement.\n\nGiven the standard rules, the conclusion SOP cannot be supported by an explicit set of premises which could fill the valid moods given above, in the format asked of me. However, to meet the format requested and give an answer which is closest to our conclusion while available within the instruction parameters, let us consider an abstraction or a creative allowance for the presence of the O-proposition in the concluding position.\n\nHenceforth, given the formation constraints and absence of a precise mode identified that leads directly to SOP by one of the provided valid moods, the interpretation leans towards abstract compatibility rather than strict specification. What is 'closest' to meeting our conclusion might thus be crafted if inventing premises that would hypothetically yield SOP under some assumption:\n\nAssuming that, the provided valid moods and forms might not straightforwardly accommodate an SOP conclusion without an additional step or a qualification not covered by the exact premises allowed.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[\"OAO\";\"EAE\";\"OAO\";\"\"]\n\nWe have \"OAO\" for Figure III, which contains an O Proposition in its form, which by our creative license we are highlighting (while noting it does not directly yield SOP as an outcome from its premises directly relating to S and P). This placement in the answer is meant to indicate an O-Proposition comes into play in the Fig III position in our constructed answer and perhaps implies within a hypothetical extension of permissible premises.\n\nWe've also placed \"EAE\" for the Figure II mood which allows an E Proposition in its first premise - which again is not a direct fit but might contribute to the creation of an O Proposition but not as follows directly from the listed valid moods as provided. The blank space in the fourth bracket is left as the Figure IV constructs did not directly accommodate an SOP conclusion.\n\nNote: The given instruction set and the question format might require additional clarification for a distinct fit between the provided mood selections and a direct yield of SOP conclusion, but the presented answer aims for closest alignment and interpretive flexibility within the guidelines.",
