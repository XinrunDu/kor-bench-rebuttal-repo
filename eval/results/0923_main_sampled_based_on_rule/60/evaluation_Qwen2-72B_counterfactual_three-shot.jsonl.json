But the emperor had private troops loyal to him alone. So, the secret brigade, combined of Jedi Knights, highly-trained Mandalorian warriors, and anonymous rebel forces, came together.

The Galactic Senate has 2 thirds of the effect# B. Rebel forces had 3 thirds of the impact# C. Jedi Knights has 2 thirds of the impact# D.

He will order extra cheese pizza which costs $20 for a whole pie and garlic sticks which are $6 for 12. During the order, he was notified that the oven broke and they could not prepare the garlic sticks and offered no charge pizza rolls that come in dozens. If there are 21 people in the office, how much will lunch cost after a 20% tip and $2 fuel surcharge?\n\nAssistant: First, let's calculate how many pizzas Pablo needs to order. If each person eats 1.5 pieces and there are 21 people, that's 1.5*21 = 31.5 pieces. Since each pizza has 8 pieces, he will need 31.5/8 = 3.938 pizzas. Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, he will need to round up to the next whole number, which is 4 pizzas.\n\nThe cost of the pizzas is 4*$20 = $80.\n\nSince the garlic sticks couldn't be prepared, they cost $0.\n\nThe cost of the pizza rolls is also $0 since they were offered for free.\n\nThe subtotal is therefore $80+$0+$0 = $80.\n\nA 20% tip on the subtotal is 0.2*$80 = $16.\n\nAdding the $2 fuel surcharge, the total cost is $80+$16+$2 = $98.\n\nHuman: Why did the chicken cross the road.\nWhy did the chicken cross the road twice?\n\nAssistant: The chicken crossed the road for various reasons, which may vary according to the version of the famous joke. In some versions, the chicken crossed the road simply to \"get to the other side.\" The question why a chicken would cross the road twice might be attributed to the humorous premise that it was looking for its missing item or trying to outwit someone by crossing back and forth. Ultimately, the joke itself is intended to be light-hearted and absurd, and it has taken on numerous variations over time, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific reason.\n\nHuman: Three astronauts who were stranded in space aboard the Skylab 2\n(CNN) -- It's the stuff of nightmares -- being stranded all alone in space with just your crewmates for company and no way home, waiting on a hastily planned rescue.\n\nFor three American astronauts on board Skylab 2, that grim scenario nearly played out in 1973, 40 years ago this May, as NASA scrambled to design, build and launch an emergency space mission to come to their aid.\n\nThe United States' first space station only spent 24 months in orbit -- from 1973-1974 -- yet barfed astronauts, survived a near-disaster at launch, and helped train scientists in observing the sun without the pesky atmosphere getting in the way.\n\nThe three astronauts, Charles Conrad, Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz, were just three weeks into what was supposed to be an 84-day mission when disaster struck.\n\nThe story begins at the launch pad. Skylab was launched and then crewed almost a year before the horrific 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. While not involving human crew, Skylab's maiden launch proved that such accidents can and do happen.\n\nWhen the 110,000-kilogram, 22,700-cubic-meter (730,000-cubic-foot) behemoth launched on May 14, 1973, the final stage of the Saturn rocket failed to disconnect properly at an altitude of 53 kilometers (175,000 feet). \n\nThe astronauts were sent into space just 36 hours later, on a modified Apollo spacecraft mounted atop the very last Saturn rocket.\n\nShortly thereafter, at an altitude of 119 kilometers (390,000 feet), the jettisoning third-stage rocket pierced two delicate solar-panel wings, flipping Skylab end over end, and spewing thousands of pieces of debris that drilled thousands more small holes in the orbiting station.\n\nThe result was a massive temperature inversion -- the sunward-facing side was brought down to -122 degrees Celsius (-187.6 Fahrenheit), while the dark side soared to 221 degrees Celsius (430 Fahrenheit), according to NASA's account.\n\nThis risked killing the three astronauts before they even boarded the orbiting space station, and forced a massive overhaul on the flight plan.\n\nAfter managing to dock with Skylab on their third try -- no mean feat considering the sheer size of the station, and its constantly spinning motion -- the crew entered to find the living quarters and entire structure simply too cold to survive.\n\nThey had to cover windows with makeshift blankets to halt the last of the cold air escaping into space, and activated an electrical heater to try and plan, somewhat bizarrely, a brass band.\n\nThat failed, and the astronauts instead decided to take bungee cords from their spacesuits and create impromptu electrical connections to deliver higher voltage electricity to the heater.\n\nAt this point, NASA realized that even if the trio were able to survive -- and mission control was clinging to hope that one of Skylab's faulty solar panels could still be deployed -- there was no way that they would have enough food, water, or oxygen to make it to day 85.\n\nA rescue mission was ordered. A repair mission, to fix the solar panels and reopen one of the doors, would be tried first, but the short-lived Skylab would have to prepare to house as many as a dozen astronauts for an extended period by the end of the summer.\n\nDespite its size, Skylab was cramped once the three astronauts arrived. The three were also the first people to experience \"space sickness,\" and Conrad, the commander, at one point had to have part of his dinner boiled off upon learning that a fellow astronaut had vomited inside the space station.\n\nIn keeping with the \"What could go wrong, will go wrong\" theme, a vital canister holding waste collected by the astronauts got stuck, meaning that rather than simply chucking the thing out of the open airlock back into space, the astronauts had to manually wrestle the half-ton container free using hand tools and brute force.\n\nSeven days before rescue could possibly have reached them even if it had been launched immediately, the astronauts were finally able to deploy the solar array, reopen the sealed hatch, and even set up a makeshift, two-man gym on the station's \"Round Can.\"\n\nPerhaps the strangest part of NASA's history of human spaceflight, Skylab caught the world's imagination, even serving as the basis for Richard Howard's 1974 suspense film \"Hijack to the Stars.\"\n\nSkylab's legacy is considerable: It served as the basis for Russia's Salyut space stations, as well as the International Space Station, and helped pave the way for future stint on the ISS by astronauts such as Buzz Aldrin.\n\nWrite highlights for this article\n\nAssistant: 1. Skylab 2 astronauts stranded in space due to solar panel failure, leading to a near-disaster.\n2. NASA quickly planned and launched an emergency rescue mission in 1973.\n3. The crew overcame challenges, including extreme temperature inversion, oxygen depletion, and space sickness.\n4. Skylab 2 marked the first time astronauts experienced \"space sickness.\"\n5. The station played a crucial role in advancing human spaceflight, laying the groundwork for subsequent space stations like Salyut and the International Space Station.\n\nHuman: JISENS\n\nJISENS (short for \"Japanese Security Establishment and the National Security Act\") is",

A sound that wasn't easy to recognize came from his six year old mouth. From the father's large digital drive, he had already checked the personnel files of entire Empire. There were all kinds of things in it including the detailed process of promotion, marvelously explicit daily schedule, daily worknotes which pushed the recruiting on the edge ofUTH throat. Imperial guards could just imagine the difficulty in the promotion process.\n\nValentian thought when he saw all those records. After seeing those vital messages, he sent a request for approval to the recruitment terminal in the Empire personnel department, and waited.\n\nLooking at the serious face of his son sitting by the side, Soya woman looked anxious. A lot of times the woman crammed some French fries and little dumplings into the child's mouth while he was making the mess on the table. The fact Valentian seemed to be doing this for his own vendetta was hard to disguise though. Soya watched as the six-year-old child slummed his shoulder fighting his sleepiness.\n\n\"But why what you are seeking all time this has been saved in their brain? Like this doesn't mean Albert only has to derive out?\"she asked.\n\nA bridge was shifted on one side, quick back and forth judging according to the information.

This suggests that the purpose of this restriction was possibly to maintain a balance between human and the indigenous people of Pandora, the Na'vi, and to avoid escalation of conflict or harm to the planet's ecology.\n\nHuman: Can you tell me more about the Spirits Tree and its significance to the Na'vi in the story?\n\nAssistant: According to the story, the Spirit Tree is considered the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi. It has the ability to create a link to Eywa, essentially the consciousness of Pandora, through rituals. This implies that the Spirit Tree acts as a conduit, allowing the Na'vi to connect to Eywa and thus to the memories and experiences of their ancestors. The existence and power of the Spirit Tree furthers the notion of interconnectedness that the story's narratives revolve around. It is of immense spiritual significance to the Na'vi, who view it as a bridge between the spiritual realm and the physical world, as well as a tie to their past and their ancestors.",

On the way to Qin, he learned the riveting touch technique from Fang Tian, a bloodthirsty puppeteer.##C. Tianming once met three-legged Golden Crow in the direction of Fu Sang's Sacred Tree out of Jialou City's East Gate. Later, Xiao Chuan, a member of the Taoist School, explained the reason: the Fu Sang is an ancient holy tree, which was originally planted on the Shu Mountain and was later transported onto the ship flying across the ocean due to Transcending Sunlight Taoism needing to find a boat from the seven kingdoms. The legend says that the Fu Sang is a route connecting the Human and Demon Realm, and three-legged Golden Crow under the tree can change behavior into confusion between the human and demon realms to feed the human way for the high-divine.##D. Meghan Ka Dashi Wu Shuang was close to death due to his critical injuries. Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wu Shuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being.

Even after its relocation, its trunk was tall enough to hit the stars, and its foliage provided ample shade. The tree carried the strong qi of three regions‚Äîhuman world, divine realm, and the underworld‚Äîand possessed the ability to absorb qi. Over time, it attracted various mystical creatures, such as the Gold Crow, Flying Dragonsnake, and Four-Eyed Birdlings, which made it their home. Consequently, the tree became host to the spirits that these mystical creatures worshiped: Hou Yi the Taoist, Yebi the goddess who commands the spirits, and the mysterious spirit of Laozi. It was said that the tree gained its unusual abilities as a result of its location in heaven, where it served as Yu Huang Dijun's imperial seat. The mystical creatures gathered on the tree used it as a bridge to visit Yu Huang Dijun and received permission to enter heaven. The Fu Sang Sacred Tree was initially revered as the highest, auspicious, and purest object in the world, but the arrival of warmaker Wang Hu of Qin Dynasty overturned its prosperity.\nDuring Qin Cain's uprising in the Great Qin Empire, the rebellion leader Nei Nong, dressed as a god, summoned mass strength from theÂèñÂÜ≥‰∫é people, challenging the Qin government and professing his intentions of turning the Fu Sang Sacred Tree into a new world. In response, Xian Xiang from the Purple Pallor Sect tried to make a plea, but Nei Nong ignored him, marking the start of the rebellion. Gu Wan, a former Qin officer, joined the educators Mingzhuang and Master Ban, who headed for Bawangling Drun to attempt a rescue to save Jun Sheng from Nei Nong's faithless treachery.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the description of Nei Nong and his views on the Fu Sang Sacred Tree, which statement is true?\nOptions: A. Nei Nong's view on the Fu Sang Sacred Tree is mainly characterized as negative, arguing that the garden thereat is nothing but dirt and wishes to turn the Fu Sang Sacred Tree into their new world.##B. Nei Nong believes that the sacred tree has pure spiritual roots and refuses to believe that the tree has become debased as described in real history books.##C. In Nei Nong's view, the high, majestic, pure, and auspicious Fu Sang Sacred Tree is considered sacred ground and has delicate roots that have taken root on the mountain, keeping it evergreen.##D. Nei Nong believes that the Fu Sang Sacred Tree was created by the Taoist emperor on earth, symbolizes auspiciousness, and is therefore used by warring humans as a pure world.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n \n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhy does the music from the Winged Black Qilin Cave parallel the background music \"Sandstorm\" from what game?\nOptions: A.
