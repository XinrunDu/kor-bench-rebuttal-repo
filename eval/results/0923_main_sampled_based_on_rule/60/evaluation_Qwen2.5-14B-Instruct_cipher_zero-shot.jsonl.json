Since we only have one byte to decrypt, we use the first byte of the hash value, which is `0x73`.\n\n3. Perform a bitwise XOR operation between the ciphertext byte `0x3a` and the corresponding key byte `0x73`.\n   - `0x3a XOR 0x73 = 0xa5` in hexadecimal.\n\n4. Convert the decrypted byte 0xa5 to its ASCII representation, which is the character `A`.\n\nThe decrypted answer is [[A]].",
