Preparation:\n   - The Secret Key (after SHA-256) = '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'\n\n2. Encrypting Steps:\n   - Convert the plaintext into ASCII bytes.\n   - XOR each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding key byte, repeating the key as needed.\n   - Convert the XORed bytes to their hexadecimal representation.\n\nFirst, let's convert \"GSHHCTUURVL\" to its ASCII representation and perform the XOR with the key.\n\n- \"GSHHCTUURVL\" ASCII: 71 83 72 72 67 67 84 85 85 82 76\n- Secret Key in bytes: 73 ef 2a 4e dd 7a 7f bf 07 fd 5f af 99 67 4d c0 c2 5a 02 5f d7 4c 22 1f 4c 35 84 9e 5c 0f b3\n\nI'll perform the XOR operation for each byte of the plaintext with the corresponding byte of the key. However, for clarity in this example, I will repeat the key bytes as many times as needed to match the plaintext length.\n\n- XOR operations result in the following:\n    - 71 ^ 73 = 02\n    - 83 ^ ef = 7c\n    - 72 ^ 2a = 58\n    - 72 ^ 4e = 3e\n    - 67 ^ dd = b4\n    - 67 ^ 7a = 3d\n    - 84 ^ 7f = f3\n    - 85 ^ bf = 3a\n    - 85 ^ 07 = 82\n    - 82 ^ fd = 7f\n    - 76 ^ 5f = 23\n\nFinally, I convert these results into a hexadecimal string, taking care to use lowercase letters for a-f.\n\n[[027c583eb43df33a827f23]]",
