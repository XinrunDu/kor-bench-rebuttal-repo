Simplify `!(<!p | q)` using the double negation rule \\(A ::=:: !!A\\):\n   - `!(<!p | q)` is equivalent to `\\(\\neg(\\neg(!p | q))\\)` which simplifies to `!(p & !q)` using De Morgan's Law (!(\\(A\\) | \\(B\\)) ::=:: !A & !B).\n\n4.

Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4.

Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8.

Thus, \\(p⇓(q⇓r) ::=:: !p & !(q⇓r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q⇓r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5.

These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p⇑q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: (!p | !q)⇑r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) ⇑ r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)⇑r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6.

The next step is to identify the true assignments that make these conjunctions true and then denote them according to the given rules.\n\nThe expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) simplifies to ¬p^r because for the conjunction ¬p^¬q^r to be true, p must be false and r must be true. Similarly, for ¬p^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true. Thus, the simplified expression highlights that p needs to be false and r needs to be true for the overall expression to be true, irrespective of the value of q.\n\nLet's represent the true assignment for ¬p^¬q^r:\n- If p is false (binary value = 0), q can be false or true (binary value = 0 or 1), and r must be true (binary value = 1).\n\nThe true assignments that satisfy the given expression are:\n1. (p = 0, q = 0, r = 1) -> Binary: 001 -> Hexadecimal: 1 -> Denoted as m1.\n2. (p = 0, q = 1, r = 1) -> Binary: 011 -> Hexadecimal: 3 -> Denoted as m3.\n\nThese correspond to the described paired conjunctive terms in the form of the true assignments given by m1 and m3.\n\nTherefore, the expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be denoted by its principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) as follows:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms:m1,m3]; [denoted:m1,m3]]",

If we assign a value of 0 to false and 1 to true, the true assignment is 000 in binary, which is equal to 0 in hexadecimal. Hence, according to the logic rule, this formula is denoted as m0.\n\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r only includes the m0 term and does not include all paired conjunctive terms, it’s not a tautology.

As it does not include all 2^n paired conjunctive terms and only includes m0 (which corresponds to 0, an even number), it is an all-even formula.
