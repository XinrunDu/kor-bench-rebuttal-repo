To ensure that the final result after multiplication is divisible by 4, what is the smallest value of C?\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[5.25]\nThe task asks for the smallest value of C to ensure the final result after the operation (5※25) * 2 is divisible by 4.\n\nGiven the modified rule and using the provided values, let's work through the problem:\n\n1. 5 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 5. So we use a ※ b = 24 to calculate 5※25:\n   5※25 = 24\n\n2. Next, we need to ensure that (5※25) * 2 = 48 * 2 = 96 is divisible by 4. Since 96 is already divisible by 4, we don't need to adjust its value for it to be divisible by 4.\n\nBut it seems I misunderstood the intent of the problem. We need to find the smallest value of C that allows the condition to be met when applying the rule. If 5※25 = 24 (which is the result according to the given rule), we need to consider how adjusting C would impact the final result for it to always be divisible by 4. Since 24 is already divisible by 4, incrementing C by any whole number would not change the divisibility of the result by 4. Therefore, there is no need to find a value of C based on the operation as 24 * 2 = 48, which is divisible by 4, and the smallest value of C would be 0.\n\nThe smallest value of C that meets the criteria (ensuring the final result after multiplication is divisible by 4) would actually be 0, as the initial operation result (24) already meets the divisibility requirement without needing any adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, ensuring the smallest value of C, should have been:\n[[0]]",

She ate 15 m&m's in total. How many m&m's did Cheryl eat after dinner?\nTo find out how many m&m's Cheryl ate after dinner, we need to determine the total number of m&m's she ate after subtracting the m&m's she ate after lunch and before bed. The total number of m&m's Cheryl ate is 15. She ate 7 m&m's after lunch and 4 m&m's before bed. Let's denote the number of m&m's Cheryl ate after dinner as \\( x \\). We can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 7 + x + 4 = 15 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 11 + x = 15 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x = 15 - 11 \\]\n\\[ x = 4 \\]\n\nSo, Cheryl ate 4 m&m's after dinner. Let's verify this with Python code.\n```python\n# Define the total number of m&m's Cheryl ate\ntotal_mms = 15\n\n# Define the number of m&m's Cheryl ate after lunch and before bed\nmms_after_lunch = 7\nmms_before_bed = 4\n\n# Calculate the number of m&m's Cheryl ate after dinner\nmms_after_dinner = total_mms - (mms_after_lunch + mms_before_bed)\nprint(mms_after_dinner)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\nThe calculation confirms that Cheryl ate \\(\\boxed{4}\\) m&m's after dinner.\n\nGiven a cylinder with a base radius of $r$ and a height of $4r$, if the lateral area of the cylinder is equal to the surface area of a sphere with radius $R$, then $\\dfrac{R}{r}=$ ______.\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ by equating the lateral surface area of the cylinder to the surface area of the sphere.\n\n1. **Calculate the Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder:**\n   The lateral surface area of a cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h = 4r$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{lateral}} = 2\\pi r h = 2\\pi r (4r) = 8\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Surface Area of the Sphere:**\n   The surface area of a sphere with radius $R$ is given by:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi R^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equate the Two Areas:**\n   According to the problem, the lateral surface area of the cylinder is equal to the surface area of the sphere:\n   \\[\n   8\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi R^2\n   \\]\n   Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   8r^2 = 4R^2 \\implies 2r^2 = R^2 \\implies R^2 = 2r^2 \\implies R = r\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{R}{r} = \\frac{r\\sqrt{2}}{r} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\nSo, the ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$. Let's write this in code to verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nr, R = sp.symbols('r R')\n\n# Lateral surface area of the cylinder\nlateral_area_cylinder = 8 * sp.pi * r**2\n\n# Surface area of the sphere\nsurface_area_sphere = 4 * sp.pi * R**2\n\n# Equate the two areas\nequation = sp.Eq(lateral_area_cylinder, surface_area_sphere)\n\n# Solve for R in terms of r\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, R)[0]\n\n# Find the ratio R/r\nratio = solution / r\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n-sqrt(2)\n```\nThe output $-\\sqrt{2}$ can be interpreted as the negative solution of the equation, but since we are dealing with lengths and radii which are inherently positive, we take the positive solution. Therefore, the correct ratio $\\frac{R}{r}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSo the final answer is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nA set of positive integers is called \"cool\" if it can be split into two non-empty subsets \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) such that the product of the elements in \\( S \\) plus the product of the elements in \\( T \\) equals the sum of all elements in the set. For example, the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) is cool because if \\( S = \\{1\\} \\) and \\( T = \\{2, 3\\} \\), then \\(1 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 1 + 2 + 3\\). Find the number of cool sets that contain exactly 4 elements, none of which is greater than 5.\nTo find the number of cool sets that contain exactly 4 elements, none of which is greater than 5, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Generate all possible subsets of size 4 from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\).\n2. For each subset, check all possible ways to split it into two non-empty subsets \\( S \\) and \\( T \\).\n3. Verify if the condition \\( \\text{product of elements in } S + \\text{product of elements in } T = \\text{sum of all elements in the subset} \\) holds.\n4. Count the number of cool sets that satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations, permutations\n\ndef is_cool_set(s):\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        for combo in combinations(s, i):\n            S = list(combo)\n            T = list(set(s) - set(combo))\n            if len(S) > 0 and len(T) > 0:\n                if (prod(S) + prod(T)) == sum(s):\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef prod(lst):\n    result = 1\n    for num in lst:\n        result *= num\n    return result\n\n# Generate all possible subsets of size 4 from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nelements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ncool_set_count = 0\n\nfor subset in combinations(elements, 4):\n    if is_cool_set(subset):\n        cool_set_count += 1\n\nprint(cool_set_count)\n```\n```output\n1\n```\nThe output indicates that there is exactly one cool set of 4 elements, none of which is greater than 5. Let's verify this result by listing the elements of that set.\n\nThe cool set that satisfies the condition is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\). We can split this set into \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\) and \\(\\{3, 4\\}\\), and then check the condition:\n\n- The product of the elements in \\(\\{1, 2\\}\\) is \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\).\n- The product of the elements in \\(\\{3, 4\\}\\) is \\(3 \\cdot 4 = 12\\).\n- The sum of all elements in the set is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\).\n- The condition \\(2 + 12 = 10\\) does not hold, so there might be another way to split the set.\n\nLet's split the set into \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\) and \\(\\{2, 4\\}\\):\n\n- The product of the elements in \\(\\{1, 3\\}\\) is \\(1 \\cdot 3 = 3\\).\n- The product of the elements in \\(\\{2, 4\\}\\) is \\(2 \\cdot 4 = 8\\).\n- The condition \\(3 + 8 = 10\\) holds, so \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) is indeed a cool set.\n\nTherefore, the only cool set of 4 elements, none of which is greater than 5, is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\).\n\nThus, the number of cool sets that contain exactly 4 elements,",
