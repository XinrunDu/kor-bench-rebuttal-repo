Using De Morgan's law (rule 6), \\(!(!p | q)\\) becomes \\(!(!p) & !q\\).\n2. Since \\(!(!p) ::=:: p\\) by rule (1), we get \\(p & !q\\).\n3. Therefore, \\((p > q) > r\\) becomes \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\nNext, let's convert \\(p > (q > r)\\):\n\n1. \\(q > r\\) can be rewritten as \\(!q | r\\) using rule (10).\n2. \\(p > (q > r)\\) can be rewritten as \\(p > (!q | r)\\) using the same rule.\n3. Using rule (10), \\(p > (!q | r)\\) becomes \\(!p | (!q | r)\\).\n\nNow, simplify \\(!p | (!q | r)\\):\n\n1. This expression is already in its basic propositional form.\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\((p > q) > r\\) as \\((p & !q) | r\\)\n- \\(p > (q > r)\\) as \\(!p | (!q | r)\\)\n\nTo check if these two expressions are equivalent, we can use truth tables or logical equivalences. However, let's compare them directly:\n\n- \\((p & !q) | r\\) is true if either \\(p\\) is true and \\(q\\) is false, or \\(r\\) is true.\n- \\(!p | (!q | r)\\) is true if \\(p\\) is false, or \\(q\\) is false, or \\(r\\) is true.\n\nThese two expressions are not the same in all cases. For example:\n- If \\(p\\) is true, \\(q\\) is true, and \\(r\\) is false, then:\n  - \\((p & !q) | r\\) is false because \\(p & !q\\) is false and \\(r\\) is false.\n  - \\(!p | (!q | r)\\) is true because \\(!q\\) is false, but \\(r\\) is false, and \\(!p\\) is false.\n\nSince the expressions do not evaluate to the same truth value in all cases, they are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B]].",

Each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and they are arranged in ascending order of subscripts (or lexicographical order).\n\n2. **Determine the paired conjunctive term:**\n   The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a paired conjunctive term because it meets the criteria specified in the logic rule.\n\n3. **Convert the true assignment to a binary number and then to a hexadecimal number:**\n   The true assignment of ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is 000 (since all variables are false). The binary number 000 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n\n4. **Determine the notation for the paired conjunctive term:**\n   According to the rule, the paired conjunctive term ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is denoted as m0.\n\n5. **Analyze the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF):**\n   The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is a single term, which is m0.

Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r only includes m0, it is not a tautology.\n   - **Contradiction:** A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms.

Since ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0, it is a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes only even indices. The index of m0 is 0, which is even, so ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes only odd indices.

The binary number 001 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1. Therefore, this term is denoted as m1.\n   - For (p∧q∧r), the true assignment is 111 (since p is 1, q is 1, and r is 1). The binary number 111 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7.
