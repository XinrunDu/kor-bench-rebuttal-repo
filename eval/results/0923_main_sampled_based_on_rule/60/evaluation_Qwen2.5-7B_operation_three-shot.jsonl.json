Additionally, encourage students to explore different commands in the trial version, as it may have additional capabilities beyond circumradii and intersection radii.\n\nIf there are any other specific elements or commands within Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha trial that the students should be aware of or practice as part of this lesson, feel free to provide them too.\n\n### Question:\nCompute (14) & (8) + (5) $ (12).\nd) The answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[20]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (74) & (73) + (12) $ (1).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[75]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (2) & (3) + (8) $ (11).\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\nThe answer with best timing should be considered.\n\n### Answer:\n[[12]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute 2 & 8 + 4 $ 16.\nThe answer should be in the form of a number, not a set, and wrapped in double square brackets, such as \" [[number]] \".\n\n### Answer:\n[[16]]",

For example, X ≥ 5 or X ≤ 10.\nUse only the symbols \"≥\" or \"≤\". No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\nTo find X, let's first solve the inequality (5&6) - (10 $ X) = 3.\n\n1. (5&6) is equal to the larger number between 5 and 6, which is 6.\n2. The smallest value of (10 $ X) is the smaller number between 10 and X.\n3. So, we need to find X such that 6 - (10 $ X) = 3.\n\nCase 1: If X ≤ 10, then (10 $ X) = 10, so we have 6 - 10 = -4, which is not equal to 3.\nTherefore, X must be greater than 10.\n\nCase 2: If X > 10, then (10 $ X) = X, so we have 6 - X = 3.\nSolving for X, we get X = 6 - 3 = 3.

Compute \\(3 \\star 3\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\star 3 = \\sqrt{3} + 3^2\n   \\]\n   - First, calculate the square root of 3.\n   - Then, add the square of 3 to it.\n\n2. Compute \\((3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3\\):\n   \\[\n   (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 3^2) \\diamond 3 = (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\n   \\]\n   - Apply the diamond operation with \\(a = \\sqrt{3} + 9\\) and \\(b = 3\\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values step by step using clear and detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Compute \\(\\sqrt{3} + 3^2\\):\n   - The square root of 3 is approximately \\(1.732\\).\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 \\approx 1.732 + 9 = 10.732\\).\n\n2. Compute \\((\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3\\):\n   - \\(\\sqrt{3} + 9 = 10.732\\).\n   - The diamond operation gives us:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{3} + 9) \\diamond 3 = 10.732 \\ota 3 = (10.732 \\otimes 3)\n   \\]\n   - Using the definition of the diamond operation:\n   \\[\n   10.732 \\perp 3 = 10.732 \\times 3 = 32.196\n   \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ (3 \\star 3) \\diamond 3 = 32.196 \\]",

To perform the € operation, we need to multiply each matrix by the respective scalar coefficient (2 for A and 3 for B), and then perform element-wise addition.\n3. Following the rule, we have to calculate 2A and 3B first:\n\nFor matrix A:\n2 * A = \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2*1 & 2*2 \\\\\n 2*3 & 2*4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2 & 4 \\\\\n 6 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor matrix B:\n3 * B = \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 3*5 & 3*6 \\\\\n 3*3 & 3*4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 15 & 18 \\\\\n 9 & 12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThen, perform the element-wise addition:\nA€B = 2A + 3B =\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  2+15 & 4+18 \\\\\n  6+9 & 8+12\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 17 & 22 \\\\\n 15 & 20\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, based on the custom operation \"€\" defined as 2A+3B, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 17 & 22 \\\\\n 15 & 20\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]",

The operation rule provided only applies to integer pairs (a, b) where a and b are integers. However, for a = 4 and b = 1, and for a = 2 and b = 3 as stated in the initial problem, the operation was performed using these integer pairs and resulted in 10 + 20i. For a = 11.7 and b = 1.2, we cannot apply the operation rule in the same manner because the rule specifically mentions integer pairs (a + bi)^2. Using real numbers would require a different operation or function, which is not defined in the given rule. Thus, the question is not applicable as stated within the given rule.
