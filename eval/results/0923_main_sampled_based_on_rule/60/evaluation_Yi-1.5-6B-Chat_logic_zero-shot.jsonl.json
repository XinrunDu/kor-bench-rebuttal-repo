If p1 = ✓ and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is true, then p2 must also be true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n2. If p1 = x and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is always true (a false statement implies anything). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. If p1 = ✓ and p2 = x, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = x because if p1 is true, then p2 must be false (violating the implication). Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓. Since p2 = x, the whole formula becomes ✓&x, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n4. If p1 = x and p2 = ✓, then (p1 =::>p2 ) = ✓ because if p1 is false, then the implication p1 =::>p2 is true. Therefore, ~(p1 =::>p2 ) = x. Since p2 = ✓, the whole formula becomes x&✓, which is x, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the formula (1 )~(p1 =::>p2 )&p2 is always false under all assignments, making it a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: A\n\n### Question 2:\n(2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 )\n\nLet's analyze the truth value of this formula under different assignments:\n\n1. If p1 = ✓, p2 = ✓, and p3 = ✓, then (p1 &p3 ) = ✓ and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x because ~p1 = x and ~p2 = x. The formula becomes ✓=x, which is x (false).\n\n2. If p1 = x, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n3. If p1 = ✓, p2 = x, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\n4. If p1 = x, p2 = ✓, and p3 = x, then (p1 &p3 ) = x and (~p1 &~p2 ) = x. The formula becomes x=x, which is ✓ (true).\n\nThese assignments show that the formula (2 ) (p1 &p3 )=(~p1 &~p2 ) alternates between true and false assignments, so it is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\n### Answer: C\n\n### Entire Answer: [[A];[C]]",

Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n   - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n   - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n\nSince we can't directly compare the two expressions without negation and equivalence, let's use the equivalence calculation rule (13):\n\n   ! ((p>q)>r) ::=:: !((p & !q) | r)\n                         ::=:: !(p & !q) & !r  (By Rule 6 & De Morgan's Law)\n                         ::=:: (!p | q) & !r  (By Rule 7 & De Morgan's Law)\n\n   !

Truth Value Judgment:\n   Assume the statements are true:\n   - Person A: (p>q)>r is true.\n   - Person B: p>(q>r) is true.\n\nCombine their truth values to write the final logical expression:\n   ((p>q)>r) & (p>(q>r))\n\nApply the given basic equivalences or reasoning patterns to derive and judge the truth of the expression:\n   ((p & !q) | r) & ((!p | !q) | r)\n\nSince (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are either both true or both false, they are equivalent.

In the first example, Sun Wukong defeats the Iron Fan Princess by transforming into a small insect and accessing her inner realm, demonstrating the flexibility and intelligence of his method. In the second example, the \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" showcases how a seemingly vulnerable entity (a small donkey) can deter and dominate over larger, powerful ones (tigers) due to its unexpected characteristics within its immediate environment (Guizhou). Both examples emphasize the importance of adapting to and exploiting the unique conditions of specific situations rather than directly confronting overwhelming forces head-on.",
