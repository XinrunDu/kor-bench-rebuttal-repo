The propositional variables in this expression are ¬p and r, with their respective negations being p and ¬r. However, the expression ¬p ^ r does not include all propositional variables and their negations.

The actual classification of the expression based on the simplified form ¬p ^ r is not a paired conjunctive term but rather falls under a basic formula if considered in the context of the fully expanded form it came from, since it is true for one specific combination of truth values of its variables (¬p is true, p is false, and r is true).\n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms: None]; [denoted: mE (but not truly fitting the definition in this context due to the simplification)]]\n\nThis answer nuances the direct application of the rules to acknowledge that while the hexadecimal E could be assigned based on the true binary value after simplification, the term does not fit the definition of a paired conjunctive term as it stands.

Let's start by converting the given formula into its conjunctive normal form (CNF) and then apply the resolution algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Convert to CNF\nThe given formula is: \\(p ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ r)\\)\n\nSince all expressions are already in the form of disjunctions connected by conjunctions, we don't need to apply any distibution laws. The formula is already in CNF:\n\n\\[CNF: \\{p, p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q, q ∨ ¬r, q ∨ r\\}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Resolution Algorithm\nAccording to the Resolution Algorithm, we initialize \\(S0\\) and \\(S2\\) as empty sets, and \\(S1\\) as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the CNF.\n\n\\[S1 = \\{p, p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q, q ∨ ¬r, q ∨ r\\}\\]\n\n### Iteration 1: Resolve clauses in \\(S0\\) and \\(S1\\)\nSince \\(S0\\) is initially empty, we skip this step and move to resolving clauses in \\(S1\\).\n\n### Iteration 2: Resolve clauses in \\(S1\\)\nWe'll look for pairs of clauses where one contains a literal and the other contains its complement. Note that in the initial \\(S1\\), no such pair exists, as no literal and its negation are in the same set at this stage. Therefore, no clauses are resolved, and \\(S2\\) remains empty.\n\n### Check \\(S2\\)\nSince \\(S2\\) is empty, we output “Plausible” and terminate the calculation.\n\n### Output and Number of Cycles\nThe output of the resolution algorithm for the given formula is “Plausible”. Since we never needed to iterate through the process of adding \\(S1\\) to \\(S0\\) and setting \\(S1\\) to \\(S2\\) due to the nature of the initial formula (it resolved immediately), we only technically counted the initial state as one cycle for the purposes of counting iterations in the context of the algorithm's iterative steps, even though it didn't involve a resolution operation. Therefore, the number of cycles it iterates is 1.\n\n### Answer in the Format [[output];[number]]\n[[\"Plausible\"];[1]]\n\nThis answer reflects the direct application of the resolution algorithm to the given CNF formula, showcasing how the algorithm quickly identifies a satisfiable (\"Plausible\") outcome due to the existence of complementary literals that can be resolved upon initial inspection, without necessitating the full iterative sequence of the algorithm's steps as defined for cases where iterative resolution is required.",
