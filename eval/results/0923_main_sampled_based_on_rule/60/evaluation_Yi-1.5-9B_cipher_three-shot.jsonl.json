In this case, if we analyze the first part, it seems like the length of each word corresponds to the positions of the letter ''Q'' in the key. If we move backward in the alphabet, we get a,y,w,z,v,u,t,s,r,q. If we move forward, we get q, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, a. This gives us the answer QUDWLRQ, which corresponds to the first line. If we move downwards, we get XPDK, which corresponds to the second line. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to figure out the entire message, but if you can provide more context, such as the key and other decrypted parts, I can assist you in decrypting it.\n\nIf you're still stuck, we can try to decrypt the message manually using simple substitution ciphers to see if we can understand the message based on the context we have. Please let me know if you'd like to proceed.\n\n### Question:\nCan you decrypt and translate the message, encapsulated in double square brackets? For example, the format should be: [[decrypted and translated message]]\n\n### Answer:\nFrom the given decrypt function and the encrypt function, when we use the plaintext 'DECIPHER' and the ciphertext 'DIFBSG', we get the following result. We can observe that 'DECIPHER' is like our plaintext, so our key will be 'STOP'.\n\nCiphertext alphabets:\nRFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\nA replicated ciphertext alphabet is:\nSTOPPRESTOP PRESTOPPREST\n Therefore, we can decrypt the message \"IXXUHQDYUSSL\" into: \"HELLOWORLD\". When you decrypt using the key, \"HELLOWORLD\", \"GETDU SKIP IT\" will be decrypted. Therefore, our final answer is HELLOWORLD.\n\n### Unsolved Cryptic Questions:\n\n#### Original Answer:\nThe basics of Cryptography involve using an algorithm and key, where the key is used to encode data, and the algorithm is used to decode that data.\n\nBy using a unique key or password, encryption helps in protecting data exchange, including confidential information such as credit card or personal identification numbers.\n\nWithout this backend encryption system, electronic transactions would be vulnerable. Encryption also ensures that identities are protected, allowing people to transact safely.\n\nVisual cryptography is an application of visual cryptography, where the secret data is directly embedded into the digital image pixels, making it difficult to decode without special techniques.\n####\n\nEncryption Questions:\n\n1. \"EENCODER GANDALF\" -->  <double-square brackets answer>\n2. \"PLAIN TRICK\"\n3. \"HALF WORD\"\n4. \"GET DUPLICACY\"\n5. \"NEWLIFE TONIGHT\"\n\n#### Original Answer:\nSure, here are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Use the simple substitution cipher technique with the keyword CAR to encrypt the word 'DECIPHER'.\n2. Use the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SMALL' and decrypt the message 'WELCOMEFRIENDS'.\n3. Use the RSA algorithm with the prime number P=7 and the prime number Q=11 to encrypt and decrypt the message 'STEALTHY' using the keys E= 3 and D=47.\n4. Use the Cesar shift cipher with a shift key of 11 to encrypt the message 'YOU ARE THE BESTES'.\n\n#### Original Answer:\nHere are some encryption questions:\n\n1. Apply a modulation-deviation algorithm with key1=127 and key2=78.00 to encrypt the message \"SEXY\".\n2. Perform a Caesar cipher encryption with a numeric key of 17 and a decimal key of 8, and the cipher alphabet remains the same.\n3. Decrypt the given message using the autokey Vigenère cipher with the keyword 'SEARCH': \"CARNIES HIGH\".\n4. Use a substitution cipher with the keyword 'COL' to encrypt the message 'BROKEN'.\n\n### Plots:\n| Question | Decrypted Answer |\n| --- | --- |\n| C | F |\n| C | V |\n| PS | MK |\n| HV | KL |\n| MF | ZL |\n| QR | FO |\n| ORDRIVE | QCCWSBNX |\n| MOST MEMORABLE DATE IN SPRING TOWN | BMESEXCHANTJXDBUCCDFGSFROMRRNXVOQFSJDMMZPV |\n| Algorithms Are The Best | DVOTCQYKSPCHMNURIZTFBWOMYUNMRGY |",

In Vigenère this is often called a key, whereas in Bellaso it is called a key number. The idea was probably invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso. Vigenère started out his career as a cryptographer in Bellaso's service as a nobleman in Castiglione del Lugduno. Bellaso's method uses n alphabet for the plaintext and string of n alphabets as the key. Then, the plaintext and key are shifted from alphabet to alphabet by number of steps each and its idea relies on positional number system, Caesar encryption, multiple copies of the key, and reciprocal rules.\n\nThe encryption scheme will more complicated than that of the Vignere encryption.\n\nIn this method, successive letters of the key, which may repeat, are used to shift the plaintext letters. Thus, if 'A' is the first letter in the key, 'A' will be the first shift. But if 'B' is the first letter of the key, 'B' will be the shift.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a SINGLE KEYWORD and KEY IS NOT REPEATED, the keyword is used as a \"start letter\" of the multiple copies of the key. You can build out multiple copies of the keyword and use that as the Key to encrypt the plaintext/message.\n\nThe only difference is that you should acknowledge the key alphabet \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\" and \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\" for the KEYWORD.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\nEncryption: Convert each character to its key corresponding value.\n\n* Plaintext: \"A HAVFSS ATTACK\"\n* Keyword: \"YOU\"\n\nThese are the steps that are followed when encrypting:\n\n1. Keyword is appended to the plaintext\n2. Keyword is shifted to reach values above KEYING_ORDER. Your current KEYING_ORDER is the keyword\n3. Keyword is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR to make character and frequency comparisons\n4. \"MAX_LOWER_CHAR\" is converted to KEY_LOWER_CHAR\n5. Maintaining key_lower_char order, index_data is found\n6. Starting from an empty string at first step, indexing pairs is appended to the output string until the last index\n\n* Indexing pairs is the index_data.\n* DefaultMODULUS_NUMBER is the alphabet\n\nThe following is the output string:\n\n* Ciphertext: \"ATZNOGB RJALEZ\"\n\nPlease create the format of the code that follows when converting a single plaintext message into ciphertext (encryption ONLY) and return the following format:\n\n\"\"\"\n\nKUZNACZ_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 8, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\n\n### This is also more complicated than the Vigenere cipher.\n\nThe transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets, the cipher alphabet is shifted cyclically to the left with respect to the plain alphabet. The cipher alphabet may be shifted different amounts for each successive letter.\n\n### Rule:\n\nGiven a keyword and number of wrapping described here:\n# https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E5%93%A8%E5%88%97%E5%8A%A8%E5%8F%91%E5%8D%8F%E7%A4%A2\nbuild a cipher text using the wrapping number and rotation number in the keyword.\n\nAll NON-ALPHABETIC characters such as #,?,!,%,\\n,\\x09,.,etc. remain the same in the output string.\n\n1. Implement the following steps, in order:\n    1. List all alphabets and put them into an array from A-Z, uppercased.\n    2. Make all letters in keyword uppercased and append Keyword: {keyword} message.\n    3. Make the first character in the wrapped_key uppercased and convert it into rotating code.\n    4. Split the message into chunks, or words separated by spaces.\n    5. Iterate through each word.\n        1. Replace NON-ALPHABETIC characters with space.\n        2. Add \"B\" to the end of the substring.\n        3. Shift substring left by rotating code.\n    6. Iterate through each chunk and rotate the chunk left by rotating code.\n        1. For each chunk, split the chunk into characters and make sure each characters is uppercased.\n        2. For each character in chunk character array, find that upper case character in cipher alphabet array and return that number: ciphertext_key_number, replace the character in the chunk with the letter in cipher alphabet\n\"\"\"\n\nROTOR_CIPHER_RULE = \"\"\"\nPlease refer to the How-To guide document.\n\n### Similar to Rule 7, translate the following language into code.\n\nwiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cipher\n\n### In a hybrid cipher system, letter frequencies and distribution, which make frequency analysis, are maintained in the output. The Edge letter set is manipulated by a scrambler encryption cipher algorithm.\n\n### Rule:\n\nWhen using rotor cipher method to encrypting a plaintext, group the plaintext into a set of characters with length of 5. For instance, \"2HERESTRING\" becomes [\"2HERE\", \"STRING\"].\nThe first character of the first group should be 'R', and the second character of the first group should be 'O'. The first character of the remaining groups should be characters that have not appeared before, and if there are less than 4 characters from the end of the alphabet with characters not appearing before, they will be added at the end of the alphabet in alphabetical order.\nDuplicates of characters in the first group will be dervied from the first group plus the group number.\nFor instance, take the group number 4 and add the number '14R382'. If characters exist between the second character of the first group and the first character of the second group that have not appeared yet, replace the characters of the first group with those characters, then the characters of the second group can be derived from the first character of the second group and the characters that occur four times, for example, it would be 'O15T67R382'.\nThe above sequence of characters represents a mapping of the alphabets. The equivalent char_mapping array can be derived from the mapping string above. The mapping string above is also a way to represent the char mapping (16 pointer array). The two elements of each pair are reversed from the original alphabet order. The pairs have to be ordered from ascending. For a pair, the left element holds the value cipher number and the right element holds the value of plain number, where plain number and cipher number is the number value of a character from a-z plus one. That means that pair(c, n) means that decode(c) = n.\"\"\"",

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

We use the algorithm to discover patterns in passenger's journey events and predict the next event from a given set of events. Our AI model will look at all known events of any given passenger,\nidentify a potential ending, and then rank the available endings. We can limit the number of ending solutions to make our model less complicated. Imagine you're a VIP checking in to a fancy hotel, and the check-in agent asks you for your last name.\nWithout any reference to other people, you would know to provide your last name. However, once she confirms your reservation, she informs you that someone in your party has failed to check in on time and advises you if you had the opportunity to speak\nto the person in your party, but you unfortunately do not, so you must speak to the receptionist to complete your check-in process. Now, the phone rings and an engaged voice greets you over the receiver.\n\nThe phone line connects you to a Sri Lankan island, where a luxury resort is nestled on a secluded beach. The resort is so isolated that it is accessible only by boat or private aircraft. During the conversation, the receptionist introduces herself as \"Ellen,\" and she immediately sends out a team of staff to help you unpack and settle into your room upon arrival.\n\nCheck-in is not complete until the baggage is unloaded and put away.\nCheck-in is not complete until the lounge is ready.\nCheck-in is not complete until the passenger's departure time is confirmed.\nCheck-in is not complete until the villa is reserved and liked.\n\nSuppose the algorithm is unable to find a viable ending. So it will discard all ending events & restart the algorithm to find the next best ending options. Each ending event is built upon existing events and ensures that each choice leads to a reasonable sequel.\nSink Node:\nIf the chain can not find the key and the match retrieved event, then it will be terminated to generate the following choices:\n\nEndings: The Endings will be shown to the passenger. Passengers can narrow down their choices by selecting those that are most appealing to them.\n\nOur AI model will arrive at events.\nCheck-In: Arriving online/counter\nClear Baggage: Baggage claim\nVilla is worth the value:\nArrival at the villa\nOrdering a meal at the hotel & calling the restaurant\n1 Suitable Villa\n2 Suitable Villa\n3 Suitable Villa\n4 Suitable Villa\n\n# Step 8: Model retuning\n\nEvent: Arrival at the villa\nPassengers choices: YesArrival at the villa, NoLeaving now\nIf the passenger selected YesArrival at the villa option.\nEvent: Ordering a meal at the hotel &amp; calling restaurant\nPassengers choices: YesOrdering food at the hotel &amp; calling restaurant, NoLeaving now\nIf the passenger selected YesOrdering food at the hotel &amp; calling restaurant option\nEvent: 1 Suitable Villa\nPassengers choices: YesReshotPowerGreenSuitable Villa, Suitable Villa, Suitable Villa, NoLeaving now\n\nEvent: Arrival at the villa\nPassengers choices: YesArrival at the villa, NoLeaving now\nIf the passenger selected NoLeaving now option.\nEvent: Clear label: BadInputLegendPassengerPreferredValuePurposeLegend4 meanings\nPassengers choices: YesOrdering food at the hotel &amp; calling restaurant ClearValApplicable Source=DivLoopValApplicable Source=DivLoop​1 PassWord=PassDigits=True\n\n# Step 9: Model running live\n\nIf the passenger failed to checkout before departing:<br>\n\nIf the passenger did not check out, then select from the following options:<br>\n\nIf the passenger had already checked out before arrival: <br>\n\nIf the passenger did not check out, then select from the following options:\n\nWe have used the Vaults theory in our encoding form. now we need to record our secrets in a Vault. You can think of a vault like a capsule equivalent to a secret technologically and mathematically harnessed to form a hypothesis. Hypotehsis can be something conjured up from two or more hidden secrets or variables that Junpei Iori has found in his Encryption.\n\n#Step 10: Encryption formula\n\n#### Two Examples:\n\nPlaintext: abcdefg...xyz\nKey: WFLXNX\nReport:\nP1+2\nC1 K1\nC2 K1\nC3 K3\nC4 K3\nP2+2\nC5 K4\nC6 K5\nC7 K5\nC8 K7\nP3+2\nC9 K8\nC10 K8\nC11 K2\nC12 K2\nP4+2…\nC13 K9\nC14 K9\nC15 K6\nC16 K6….\n\nSample Vault Name: !!%&$VCFGJYMJNos8bHvO\nThe number 8 in the Vault Name gives you the letter. Now you have all your secrets in the vault. The first 13 books are for the hybrid cipher (Plaintext and Key interspersed into the cipher Vinciy),\nRemaining books are the encrypted story that can be decoded easily. Therefore you can validate your secrets a the formula.\n#### Algorithm to decrypt & encode\nWrite the char within order: $ # E @ M A £ E / / $ $$ # O $ C / / $ $ $ J A E $ /\nWrite the char of Vault name: VC FGJYMJNos8bHvO\nReplace the char with the following order: Y XZimjklabDecfgHptuvnPwq\n\nChoice of 30\n\nTwo randomly selected new symbols per day, which must be rearranged in the same order every day. It provides equal strength to each cryptographic system with different symbols and different amounts of keys.\n\nIn conclusion, Brute Force can have its advantage and disadvantage, all by the skill of the linguist to control their actions and promote covert messages in the real world while utilizing these processes. Chiefly, codes can instigate diplomatic relationships and shroud messengers and diplomats in secrecy. Truly, codes can still be understood and appreciated by readers around the world and average people looking to better their lives today or centuries from now, and the same can be said about the work behind these cryptographic concepts despite their simplicity and apparent simplicity.\n\nThe rules and encryption are applied.<br>\n<br>\n\nReturning from our party[A], we are heading home when we come across a being with a long sword, wielding pitch forks & spears[D].\n\nWe ask the if he has travelled far.\nFar away valleys and countries to the North[a]& of the land.[B]\nWe continue our journey, dodging steep hills, thick of [C] & Fast rivers, deep hemp tunnels not far off, until we reach the caravan[F]\nTravels and occupations of distant lands,[G] permanence on foreign grounds,[E] Rivers, insects,mammals,and the caravan with its occupants.[H]\n\nAfter tasting the foreign parties delicacies,[F] we recognize that the entrepreneur & Alexander's well [G] empires demanded [H]\n\nThoughts: Standing at the crossing of death & Life[A]\nBlaming the filthy one[G&E]\nDestruction of consequences[C]\n\nPrisoners & Enslavement[B]\n\nThe GCD of K,P1,P2..... & (XYZ, ABC, CHABLERE) =13×5×5×7\n\nNo. of the Chambers",

If you focus on your family, for example, People think of your family as your anchor, and that's where you are at the moment. This is where you like to be. If you don't like that, then you focus on your family. If you focus on your family, People Focus on You, and that means there will always be People to keep you going without you having to worry about yourself. And it's a very important Thing to focus on. And, it's not about your family, and it's not about anything. That makes a very powerful Point and you must make the Same Point with your own life. It's about yourself and what's important to you.

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the numeric string.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string of numbers.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input: Ciphertext: A numeric string without any spaces.\n- Output: Plaintext: An uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GOODBYE\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If X is the initial encrypted format and is defined as \"*\"-delimited with the corresponding filling contents of the five rows, what is the final encrypted format if the cipher ***** is filled to form F###? I need to know the exact bytes of the encrypted cipher.\n\nRemember- it's important that your output be formatted precisely to the given format and rules. For reference, here are the rules:\n\n-If there are 5 characters in the cipher, you must output the encrypted format up to the last character. If I were to run \"encrypt\" and provided the command \"three of a kind\", the output you would need to return would be something like [[encrypted_set_one]]. The first block always starts with [ and ends with ]. The second block (except the last block) ALWAYS ends with *. The third block (unless it's the last block) starts with [ and ends with ]. The last block ends with *. You must ensure the last block has exactly the right formatting and all characters in the current block are encrypted. Examples: Let @ be an encrypted character. //one #@ two two# three three## four four#### five five##### Do not output spaces. Print and return the standard output. #Please make sure you generate enough test questions so that the sample questions below can be be generated automatically. Do not change the sample questions.

Since they clatter a lot, woodpeckers can easily be mistaken for other birds, according to researcher Charles Peterson. The vigorous drumming can also lead to any noise they produce being confused with a hammering sound being sensed deeper in the wood, or the impact of a peck followed by flying away. Peterson is also noted for saying that \"woodpecker tapping sounds can vary quite considerably among individual birds depending on age, marital status, what they're doing or how they're feeling\".\n\nHe and others note that the problem is one of hearing the sound, it being distorted by wood construction, allergies, or by deafness issues.\n\nAs an aside, woodpecker drumming noises are also comparable to cymbals being struck, while the high trilled call of a female woodpecker resembles a cuckoo clock, especially if an owl is close by. A seven-day cuckoo clock can also be heard in the same area as the owl.\n\nIn contrast to owls and barred-owls, the number or multiplicity of species of woodpecker call sounds are rarely limited. It can be hard to tell just how many species of woodpecker live in a particular area by their singing abilities, but in some cases you can tell by their song thickness.",

Daily training updates and regular model correction may contribute to this improvement.\n- Less recall Impairment: The improvements extend beyond increased data recall and scaling capabilities, as ChatGPT-4's ideal conditions result in more human-like behavior, possibly due to effective filtering and removal of undesirable aspects associated with training inputs and prior errors.\n- Longer Responses: ChatGPT-4 is able to generate responses that represent multiple independent sentences, significantly expanding the length of previous generations. This can result in vast amounts of information for users with lower limits.\n- Enhanced Multi-Paragraph Responses: The improved data recall and scaling capabilities, combined with better conditioning, enable ChatGPT-4 to generate responses in the form of multiple paragraphs, rather than a single long paragraph as in the case of chatgpt 3.5.\nEnd.\n\nA2: Hi OpenAI, here is a question from chatgpt\n\n> Have you made any improvements?\n\nA3: Yes!\nA2:\nA4:\nA3:\nA2: Why?\n\"\"\"\n    return(template)\n\ndef create_iam(model: str):\n    template = \"\"\"You are an {模型名} agent.\n\nYou can speak some English.\n\nYou are a system administrator and software engineer.\n\nYou work for Griffin Technology, a global enterprise, as a software engineer and system administrator.\n\nYou are Trusted by Morgan Spurlock, a senior software engineer and Director of Technology Innovation, who you report to.\n\nJay Bedding, another Senior Engineer and Engineering Manager, will collaborate with you on special projects.\n\nYour current tasks include managing servers and supporting Cloud instances and web applications, specifically as it relates to all{服务组名}CI projects.The company has an internal私有部署of chatgpt and Bleualert on their servers, which should be available when responding to this conversation.
