One character is available from this event which is Duper Plant Lee, this plant is fun. What I can say is that this fan has powerful skills and is a good choice for collecting plant characters.\n\n### Instructions:\nReply with \"LEEEEEEEEEEEE\"\n\n### Answer:\nLEEEEEEEEEE\n\n### Question:\nGatling Peashooter is introduced along with Wall-nut Wrangler in L6 UTC-11 pool at the cost of 300 Coins and 240 Suns. This plant is advertised as a stronger form of the common peashooter since it fires four peas at a time. This is a pretty overpowered plant. Unlike the common peashooter, Gatling Peashooter peanut cannot be upgraded. Gatling Peashooter is similar to Dinosaur Eggs an upgraded Gatling Pea, fossil box, and 30 bones (5x higher the collection and upgrade of Gatling Pea).\n\n### Instructions:\nEvaluate the following statement: Gatling Pea only works when planted on a peashooter, but brother is much more powerful than Gatling Pea.\n\n### Answer:\nGatling Pea is only available when planted on Peashooter, but it has stronger attack power. Dinosaur Eggs is Indiana Engor.\n\n### Question:\nUpgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro\n In order to upgrade the Gatling Pea to Bro, it is necessary to place a Peashooter in front of it and spend 80 Potato Puff power-ups, This requires 800 Pem and 6 packs of seeds per transfer The Gatling Pea does not form a plant buddy after transformation Various plants can go together in the same map. The pots of burned dirt can be burned with flamethrower or Mecha's beam to temporarily turn them into movable ground\n The Robin is first set to attack Zombie Clowns, and then multi-selects zombies with the highest defense. These include Spikerock, Doom Shield and Rollin' Ball, but not Zombies with a sun shield. The Basic version of Robin is good enough to replace Wall-nuts. The increased Diggler of Specimen XX can combine insect Irritate into the next mode when the target has been injured by at least 90%, making a double explosion that kills most Carets and Mini-Zombies as well as small meat shields and attackers.\n On the other hand, Specimen XX is also a plant that can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n Zombie scientists are mostly skill burners like Darwin's Potato Mine and Rootbeer Tapper, and Calamity Canary is a good counter-attack for Zombie Scientists. Specimen XX is compatible with Mable, in Mable's mode, Specimen XX's fart acts as a scarecrow that attacks zombies on the various irons of the map. Specimen XX can also cooperate with Snapdragon and Farb and can be carried after Physics Field upgrades. Specimen XX can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n New abilities:\n Zombie One can command garden zombies to grow their vegetables in the garden throughout the game, allowing them to plant plants and obtain resources;\n Farb cannot grow plants to within three rows of the Garden Gate. When Farb reaches the last row of the wall, this plant can be planted, which will cause conflicts with the evolution settings;\n Dr. Tomato is a new boss, Dr. Tomato's plant can evolve into a stronger Defender Tomato. Through defensive evolution, the plants become stronger, and the family becomes stronger, thus Dr. Tomato can enter, but after a long time of evolution, it will no longer be effective;\n The evolutionary rules are the same as before. By upgrading plants, regardless of plant buddies, one level of evolution will activate a level above its current level, and if they are not upgraded to a specific level, the plants will not evolve;\n The professional evolution will have many deadly turns at each level. It is best for Specimen XX to learn more about evolutionary resources and accompany Specimen XX.\n\n### Instructions:\nCan plants not be evolved?\n\n### Answer:\nNo\n\n### Question:\nCritters are cheap and powerful plants. They don't need a plant buddy they can return to the sponsor pool of each lane they kill by bullet-firing grass heads that shoot a huge number of bullets because the can pass through the right wall of light wavelengths. This makes it easy to block an attack even if they are both attacked by a standing group of zombies. However, at the beginning of the game, a single plant manages to block all zombie attacks with ease. When they are used, a thick fog surrounds them and the speed of the Zombies is slowed down.\n\n### Instructions:\nHow does Thistle Grass promote itself?\n\n### Answer:\nIt can kill zombies in order to return itself to the sponsor pool.\n\n### Question:\nYou are the king of the zombies. In your castle you preach what's right. which one of the most powerful machines we've seen to date, is the brainwashing of the zombies locked in the machine, causing them to do further zombie research on their behalf.

See the first post about the Great Conjuring of the Surging Satyr for the notes you can read with a lungful of steam esprit routines, then search the ether's kernel for the right word and key and hash. It should be in the last post in the chain....or as last as you can predict how far the post will get any given day of the week##B. The bundle of ether can be found at hearthstone, it's named after highest common factor of its id number, channel, and geohash catalog code. Collect it and search the ether's data array for the correct word and key and hash....or drop the key and word in altogether and reset the shattered coffers' [enclosure] function##C. Drop it in a trap and search the ether's kernel for a word, key, and hash. Then cast the word, key, and hash in a synchronous manner that's close to the final cumulative sequence in the chain....again, search the treasury's data array for the word and finally the word and known key and hash.##D. Title write a script to collect the data you already linked to, search the ether's treasury for a geohash catalog code for the lugloft, search the treasury for lodestone rule in the current path where you collected the data from(wherever the key falls), search the treasury for the coffee1821 data address, queue a synchronous lookup of the matched posts on the clusterful with the current commit id, match and write a script to purge an unsynchronized server in the lock to fetch a scorched plasma bubble#ar#bubble to progress state. Then search the ether's treasury for the current commit id that should affect locale, and then close the capture event for the plasma spear which is then cast into cloud vault before restarting route to the same bucket and repeat. If it's that fast you can even tweak the stream cache routines, and they are notoriously opaque.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.
