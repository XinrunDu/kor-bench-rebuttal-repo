If the 'dispel' operation results in an empty set (labelled as 0), we can conclude that the conjunctive normal form is 'Implausible'.\n\n- The Resolution Algorithm is a systematic process to assess whether a conjunctive normal form (CNF) has a satisfying assignment, yielding 'Plausible' or 'Implausible' as its verdict.

In this specific application, we define 𝐸 as the set of natural numbers, N.\n- Every entity constant 'a' in the language has a corresponding entity 'a′' in 𝐸. In this case, 'a′' has been assigned the value of 0.\n- The language also contains functions and predicates. Specifically, we are given examples:\n  - Two binary functions, fJ(x, y) and gJ(x, y), which perform addition and multiplication, respectively.\n  - A binary predicate, FJ(x, y), which denotes equality between two entities, i.e., x = y.\n\n**Implentation of the Formula under J**\n\nLet's proceed with rewriting the given formula, ∀xF(g(x,a),x) → F(x,y), as it would appear under the interpretation J:\n1. We start with the formula ∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y). To implement this under J, we first need to consider the function symbols and entity constants.\n2. Replacing the entity constant 'a′' with its assigned value, 0, we have: ∀xF(g(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n3. Next, we should look at the function symbol 'g':\n- In the function g(x, y), we substitute 'g' with its implementation 'gJ': ∀xF(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n4. Since the domain of discourse, 𝐸, is the set of natural numbers, this will hold for all entities in N. Therefore, we do not need to include the universal quantifier, ∀x, in our implementation. Applying this modification, our formula becomes: F(gJ(x,0),x) → F(x,y).\n5. Finally, we substitute the predicate symbol 'F' with its implementation 'FJ': ∀xF(FJ(gJ(x,0),x),x) → F(FJ(x,y),y).\n\nNow, let's apply the implementation process to the formula in a line-by-line manner:\n- ∀x[F(g(x, a), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(g(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[F(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(gJ(x, 0), x)] → F(x, y)\n- ∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)\n\n**Final Answer**: [∀x[FJ(x', x)] → F(x, y)]",
