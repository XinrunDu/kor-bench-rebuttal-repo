If the initial pointing direction of intersection For example, it is a vertical line, then it is necessary to pay attention to the vertical line at the inflection point after the intersection when looking for the direction of the intersection. intersection.\nHowever, it seems that most of the die products are horizontal and vertical lines, which indicates that as long as the horizontal horizontal line is first looked for, and the turning direction is checked according to the information,  then the solution will be continuous.\nSo the question is, how can I get the information quickly and efficiently?\nThe first method I thought of was that arrays are strings, arrays can be sliced, and strings can be sliced.\nI think it can be interpreted using numpy, extracting the components of the array from every angle.\nThe first part of the interpretation directly extracts the diagonal, the second and third parts of the interpretation extract the horizontal horizontal lines, and the fourth part is some of the cases of the intersection of other consecutive turns of the path.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    for i in matrix:\n        print(i)\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    l = 3\n    w = len(matrix)\n    for n in range(l):\n        if n < (l-1):\n            str1 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n])\n            str2 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+1])\n            str3 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+2])\n            str4 = str1[0] + str2[1:w-1] + str3[w-1]\n        else:\n            str4 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[l-1])\n        print(str4)\n        print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n\nzuobiao = np.array([[7, 0, 4, 0, 7],\n                   [8, 7, 1, 1, 8],\n                   [0, 7, 2, 4, 3],\n                   [0, 1, 5, 5, 1],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nextract_array(zuobiao)\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n  [8 7 3 1 0]\n  [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [8 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 0 1 0 0]\n [0 0 1 4 5]]\n\n\nIt's great, so I had to see if it was suitable for long numbers: \nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    # Put your code here\n     for i in matrix:\n         print(i)\n    print(\"=========\")\n    l = len(matrix)\n    ",
