Any non-boolean data will be treated as 0 (false).\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing 'p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)'**\n\nWe need to convert these statements into something we can analyze and deduce...\n \n**Part 3:  Evaluating (p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))**\n\n\nHow calculates the final expression and determines its validity.
