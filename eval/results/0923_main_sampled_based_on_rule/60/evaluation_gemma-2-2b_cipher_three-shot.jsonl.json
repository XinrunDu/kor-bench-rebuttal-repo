At the end of the twentieth century, algorithms that are efficient and produce the largest number of zeros when decrypted became popular and widely adopted. It's important to understand how these algorithms, the best known of which is the data encryption standard (DES), operate below the surface. These algorithms employ a long array of numbers called a KDF (key derivation function), which is a key-dependent function, to encrypt data blocks. To decrypt messages, you must be familiar with the original ciphertext generated by the encryption algorithm.\n\n<strong>Reference link:</strong>\nhttps://aes.stackexchange.com/questions/58/data-encryption…\n\n![](https://github.com/qifeng01/cs764-assignment-1/blob/main/AES/images/question01.png)\n\n### Question 1:\n\nProvide explicit examples of Python statements to obtain the frequency of each character in the input string using class lists.\n\nPlease specify the functions including and the function signature\nwith explicit examples.

Our thoughts are used to make sense of the world around us. The patterns encoded into ciphers play a significant role in those thoughts. For further understanding, reference this:\n\n\n<strong>Reference Link below:</strong>\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/how-b-crypt-hash-algorithm-en…\n\nThe key and the operator is specified as \"aes-256-ctr\".

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SAL]]\n\n\n# Solution\n\nIn this situation, you need to ensure that your encryption or decryption algorithm follows the specific rules provided in the cipher rule. This involves addressing properties of the rule defined by the keyword (when necessary), determining how consecutive values in outer_disc will be replaced by inner_disc, and smoothly flowing between the encryption and decryption steps. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that your final output matches the format specified in the encrypted and decrypted answers. Your final ciphertext or plaintexts must be formatted as required and enclosed within double square brackets.\n\n### Encryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties.\n- **Replacement**\n    - You replace certain characters in the plaintext with corresponding values in outer_disc.\n\n```plaintext\nInput:\n- Keyword of encryption (e.g., 'H')\n- period\n- increment\n\nOutput:\n- Uppercase letters string\n- keyword renamed\n- Encoded ciphertext\n\nEncryption Steps:\n- For each character p in the phrase {when applicable}, find the character that matches h in the inner_disc, and replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the outer disc. Assign the encrypted string as result.\n\n```\n\n**Encrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput: (Describe the process to find the character with the keyword)\nEncryption(Encrypt):H\n\nOutput: [[HI]]\n\nProcess: The process of finding character is:\n1. According to the keyword \"H\" in the original input \"H\", we find that it is equal to the character\n      {109 [01000001] on the binary code}\n2. Then {26 [0101111] on the binary digital} is replaced on the outer_disc, and the result is {108 [0100001] on the digital code}\n3. Repeating step 2, rotation increment = period = 14, after {4} characters are processed, the result is {109 [01000001] on the digital code}.\n{In this way, when period = 14, increment = 2, the inner_disc will rotate twice back, again as {109 [01000001] on the digital code} }  \n```\n\n**Decrypted Characters example:**\n```plaintext\nInput Encryption(Encryption):HI\nOutput: [[I]]\n\nProcess: The process of decrypting the character is:\n- 1. according to the ciphertext \"HI\" in the input, find the character h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {109 [01000001] on the binary code}.\n- 2. then {108 [0100001] on the digital code} is replaced on the outer_disc, resulting in {H [0100000] on the digital code}.\n- 3. The process of encryption steps for character H is repeated until finally getting the final plaintext.\n```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n\n### Decryption:\n\n- **Properties:**\n    - The same properties (e.g., keyword) will ensure a smooth transition from encryption steps to decryption steps.\n- **Replacement:\n    - You replace the characters in the ciphertext with the values obtained in the outer_disc through decryption steps.\n- **Re-Encryption**\n    - Repeat the process for the replacements of characters until *n* passes, where ‘n’ is the encryption periodicity.\n\n\n\n```plaintext\n- Keyword (when necessary) from the cipher rule guides you to the relevant properties\n- Replacement\n- Re-Encryption\n\nProcess:  \nInput:\n- Phrase in the ciphertext as string\n- Period, increment\n- keyword\n\nOutput:\n- Re-encrypted phrase in uppercases as a string\n- keyword renamed\n- Phrase in uppercases as string\n```\n\n**Sample input cipher text:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\n\nInput\n- The character is \"BAIL\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption \n- Encryption(Upgrade):BAIL\nPeriod: 12, Increment: 4\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Character: [{34 [101 01100] on the binary digit},{10 [01001] on the binary digit}]  \n```\n\n**Re-Decryption:**\n```plaintext\n- N - Number of Characters in Ciphertext\n- period 10 \n- increment 2  \n- keyword H\nInput\n- The character is \"SUF\" in the cipher text.\nEncryption\n- Encryption (Upgrade) :SUF\nPeriod: 6, Increment: 1\nKeyword : H\n\nEncrypted Characters:           [{95 [11101] on the binary digit},{10 [01001]}on the binary digit ]\n\nDecrypted Characters:  \n- Process: The process of finding the character with the keyword as input \"H\" is:\n  1. according to the encrypted ciphertext \"SUF\" in the input, find the character with the name h in the inner_disc, which is equals to {10 [01001] on the binary code}.\n\n  2. the character {10 [01001]} on the binary code is replaced on the outer_disc, with the result {95 [1] on the digital code}.\n\n  3. The process of decryption steps for character 95 is repeated until finally getting the final ciphertext.\n  ```\n\n**Assigning value to outer_disc and inner_disc:**\nOuter_disc={QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL}\nInner_disc={JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO}\n",

Then, we will use the '.-/-...-' pattern to combine three letters into one pair of characters, and then use these pairs to represent the corresponding Morse code by converting them into numeric string form using the numerical-index mapping table. Finally, this string is added to the end of the ciphertext for encryption.\n\nFor decryption, we first need to split the Morse code into pairs representing each character and convert these pairs to numeric strings using the numerical index mapping table. Then, we use the morse_code Table to convert this numeric string back to the character form and finally concatenate it together.\n\nDuring the process, it is important to ensure that the output strings are formatted according to the specified instructions. For example, the encryption step should be \\'.-/-...'\\' separated by /, etc.\n\n![Here another image]\n",

You need to use the decryption algorithm, but not all of it. The \"Unified Algorithms Operational Instructions for the National Unified Algorithm Library\" in the \"Encryption Algorithm Assessment Standard\"\n\nEncryption cipher (related parameter calculation algorithms):\n\n1. Ciphertext Calculation Method\n\nThere are many methods to calculate the ciphertext, generally from:\n\n(1) According to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext, encrypt and count according to the encryption table, then encrypt the result character by character.\n\n(2) Use the previously calculated key to encrypt the data, and then encrypt according to the arrangement of the characters in the ciphertext character by character.\n\nEncryption is encrypted according to the corresponding table, and each character is converted into a corresponding position according to the original data. To do this, it is necessary to find the position of each character in the cipher text.\n\n(1) When the cipher text is not arranged in order, the commonly used way is to find the longest ascending position of the character. The shortest descending character from the long to the short position;\n\n(2) Determine that there is no encryption key, please refer to the Standard algorithm in the Unified Algorithm Library for definition.\n\nThe ciphertext above uses some encryption rules based on columns.",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[emphasis]NEIEKOWQRE]]\n\n*NOTE: The cipher rule provides additional entries in its list of tables. However, only the specified tables are used for both encryption and decryption for the questions provided.*\n\nBy applying the rules mentioned, you should be able to find the answers in the provided questions. Be careful to follow the format and adhere to the specifications.\n\n# Verifying the cipher rule\nYou can verify the cipher rule by attempting to encrypt and decrypt:\n- \"W\" to \"11111001\" using the fixed key \"10101010\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"S\" to \"6676155\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"11111011\" to \"S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S\" using the fixed key \"A4E32AA3\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"EKEOKUIRPNRNKDPEEKRTKMQ\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"111110101101001011010010\" to \"KIOKRKIOCRIRKIARCRIVKIARCRKR\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"VNN\" to \"KNNW\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n- \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" to \"VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN, VNN\" using the fixed key \"[EE]11000101011000011001010100110101\" and applying the indicated permutation.\n\nTo encrypt \"W\" to \"11111001\", a 0 is added to the letter \"W\" to make it 5 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 5 is added as an offset to other values in the permutation table. The Permutation Table is just like the Key(e.g., \"10101010\") where a row is picked according to the offset added to the values in the 'Permuted Alphabet(Table)'(e.g., \"10101010, 11111011, 11000111, 11011101, 10111110\"). \"11111011's\" position of \"2\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table(e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is taken as its value while \"11000111\" in the \"Permutation Table\" picks \"11011101\" (\"11111011\" x 2) and it is decrypted out in the second step through a\nseries of steps.\n\nDecryption follows the same pattern but it follows the Pre-Invers permutation, Pre-Inv to Permuted table and then Permuted table to Inverse table (preinv,inv).\n\nA 0 is subtracted from the letter \"W\" to make it becomes 4 in the alphabet. A decimal value of 4 is subtracted from other values in the Permutation Table. Now, \"W\" is taken to \"O\", it's' position of \"4\" in the Permuted Alphabet Table (e. g., \"2, 2, 4, 4, 4\") is picked and in a permutation\nof table it becomes \"1\" since a 4 is subtracted.

XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n  2. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n    - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n  3. Inverse Permutation:\n    - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n  4. XOR Operation:\n    - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n  5. Convert Binary to Character:\n    - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n    - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n  6.
