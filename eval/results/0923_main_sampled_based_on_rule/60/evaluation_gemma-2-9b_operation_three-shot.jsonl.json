Given that N has a decimal representation of 20809, the first half of the digits are 2080. The arrangement of the digits is not unique if we ignore the decimal point: For example, 2.008×10^4 = 2.0×10^3 + 8×100 + 8×1 = 2088, but 2×10^4 + 8×10^2 + 8×10^0 = 20808.\nPlease put the answer in a double square bracket like this: [[answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2081]]\n\n### Question:\nYou are given that each 2×100000000000000001-based square has a unique arrangement of digits when written in the 2×100000000000000001 system.

The first prime number under one million that satisfies this property, the first half of the digits are 11. The arrangement of the digits is not unique if we ignore the decimal point: For example, 1.1^2×10^502 = 1.1^2×10^502 + 0×10^501 + 1×10^500, but 2.2×10^502 = 2×10^502 + 2×10^501 + 2×10^500.

By the rule, we get 2*2*3+4-2 = 14. Then [[14]] is the final answer.\n* For the second question, follow the same steps and get [[30]].\n* For the third question, we find that k>=4, so y cannot be larger than 20. Then k=4 and y=1. Double check to ensure that you got the correct answer.\n* For the fourth question, you can see that d is always the highest element in the expression. Therefore, k=2. Try different values for y and you will get y=1. Double check to ensure that you got the correct answer.\n* For the fifth question, you have to find a set of values for k and y that satisfy the given values for the expressions. Try different combinations of k and y until you find a set that satisfies both conditions. It's recommended to test your work first using the given values to ensure that they are correct.\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in creating and evaluating mathematical expressions. Below is a specific rule defined for a custom operation. Your task is to apply this rule accurately to a mathematical expression.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations.\n\n2. If your answer is not an integer, your answer in code should be a float.\n\n3. If your answer does not satisfy one or more of these restrictions, your answer could be wrong. If we can't be sure, we will not grade your code.\n\n4. Carefully compare your answer to be sure it satisfies the constraints specified below.\n\n### Rule Definition:\n\n1. Add, minus, multiply, division, power (^) operations are allowed\n2. Numbers on both sides of equals sign are integers.\n3. There is no restriction on the number of elements on either side of the equal sign, but we are only interested in the element on the first index.\n4. If the number of elements is odd, the result of the operation on odd indexed elements are summed up to get the final answer.\n5. If the number of elements is even, the result of the operation on even indexed elements are multiplied up to get the final answer.\n\n### Example:\n\na = 14, b = -6, c = 7, d = 3, e = 2\n-1 = a+b+c-d-e\n14n+!n^4*c-d^3*e+c^2*d-e3*d^n+e^c is wrong because there is no element at index 12\n14n+!n^4*c-d^3*e+c^2*d-e3*d^n+e^c is wrong because n and ^ are used to denote the multiplication of the elements in a group rather than the multiplication of the operation's results.\n\n### Question:\n\nabcde=f/30\nabce=11\nac=3|3\naddcdefgh+i=j+k\nIf addcdefgh is the largest odd prime number that ends with digit 5, a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k=?\n\n### Answer: [[28]]\n",

Assuming X is a variable with a value of 1, such an equation means X equals Y. However, since we're taking the square of a positive number, it's also equal to negative Y.\n\nTo answer this question, consider the relationship between positive Y and negative Y.\n\nWe can find such a value of X that, once X and Y are equal, their squares are equal. Even if X and Y are negative, this relation still holds. Now, we can simplify the equation X^2 by finding its square root, obtaining Y^2.\n\nRemember, we're looking for the positive root of X to get Y. Therefore, we can express our answer with a double square bracket following this rule: [[1_x]]\n\nThen, we must find the value(s) of x.\n\nHint: Begin by taking the square root of 81.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets: [[your answer]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-9]]\n\n### Question:\nFor a given X where X^2=1, using the rule X=X^1, what's its value?\nThe correct answer should be two positive and negative values.\nFor example: [[1_-1]]\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_-1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nSolve: 35^(36)=0.9\n\n### Question 2:\nAnswer: [[your answer]]\n\n### Hint: When X^(35)=0.9, don't forget to go through a series of calculations until you get a value equal to 36.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1_0.1]]\n\n### Question 1:\nEvaluate the equation 4+(9 * 30) = ?.\n\nBefore providing the answer, start by breaking down the steps and writing them neatly, please!\n\nFor instance:\n4 + (9 * 30) = 4 + 270\n\n\n### Question 2:\nPlease also find the value that equals to ?.\nThe answer is a number. please wrap it in double square brackets, like [[your answer]]\n\nHint: The final solution for the example is 282\n\n### Answer:\n[[282]]",

Please explain your reasoning to the interviewer.\n\n### Answer:\n\nYes, this rule works for all operations. You can verify this by following these steps:\n\n1. Assume that a and b are positive integers.\n2. Calculate a¥b using the definition: a stands for \"b to the power of b minus b to the power of a.\"\n3. The value of a¥b will always be an integer, and it will not be zero unless a = b = 1.\n4. If a = b, then a¥b will be zero, so this rule includes the possibility that a can equal b.\n\nTherefore, the rule defined in the problem is correct for all operations, and you can use it consistently.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

The operation involves two variables *a* and *b* that are combined using the symbol *⊕*, forming a mathematical equation. This equation involves addition (*+*), multiplication (**), subtraction, division (*/).\n\nThe rule assigned to the operator *⊕* states that (*a* *b) = (*a+bi*)\n\nTo accurately apply this rule, you’ll need to analyze the problem and recognize the values of *a* and *b* in each part of the problem. These values are represented by the numerical expressions enclosed by the parentheses.\n\nThe problem is asking you to evaluate several expressions using this operation. Each expression involves three terms, these are:\n\n- *({2}) ⊕ [{})\n- *({}) ⊕ (\n- x ⊕ 2) × 3 =\n\nThe problem tasks you with finding the answer, which should be a number or a series of numbers. This means your final answer should be a single value, not a set of different numbers.\n\nThe final answer should be included in double square brackets as part of a single answer.\n\n### Example:\n\nIf we were to evaluate the expression *({2}) ⊕ (³, then using the rule given, we’d find the answer is *([5+2i]*.\n\nIn this specific example the answer must be *([+2i] as an expression of *[5\n\nRemember to double check your final answer to make sure that it meets the conditions of the problem.\n\nThe following resources can be helpful in solving this problem:\n\n* [Khan Academy’s Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)\n* [MathCSQUARE’s Number Theory and Algebra Course](https://httpwww.mathcsquare.com/number-theory-algebra-courses).\n* [Advanced Algebra Set Theory](https://www.mathcsquare.com/advanced-algebra-set-theory).\n\n### Similar problems\n\nHere are some similar problems you can try once you understand the solution:\n\n- Evaluate [*([2+i]*) given that *m ⊙ {m+b i*}\n- Evaluate *m ⊙ {m+b{m+b i}*({*)* given that *m⊕{m+b{m+b i}*[{}\n\nWe appreciate the autonomy, intelligence, and eagerness to learn you’ve shown.
