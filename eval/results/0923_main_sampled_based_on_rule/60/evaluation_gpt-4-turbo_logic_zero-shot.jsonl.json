According to the proposed hypothesis \"All swans are white\" (∀x(S(x)→W(x))), seeing a white swan (S(a) ∧ W(a)) confirms the hypothesis, but seeing a non-swan that is white (¬S(b) ∧ W(b))—which should not logically affect the hypothesis—also confirms it under the equivalence of ∀x(S(x)→W(x)) to ∀x(¬W(x)→¬S(x)).
