It does not go beyond what is necessary to convey the information.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The statement follows the convention of describing the relationship between objects and time.

There is no indication that the speaker is withholding stronger information or that they know something stronger that contradicts the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle:**\n   - The statement is concise and directly addresses the issue of the door not closing, which implies the existence of doors. This minimalistic approach aligns with the Minimalization Criterion of speaking only as much as necessary to convey the issue.\n\n3. **C! Principle:**\n   - There is no lengthy, obscure, or marked expression in the statement.
