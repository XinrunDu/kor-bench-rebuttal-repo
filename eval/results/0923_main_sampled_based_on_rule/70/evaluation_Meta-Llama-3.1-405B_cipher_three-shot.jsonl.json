The encryption and decryption processes for plaintext and ciphertext respectively follow specific steps. The common feature is that these operations involve replacing characters from one disk with those from another, based on their positions. Additionally, there are rotate operations applied to the inner disk depending on specified conditions. Overall, this mechanism ensures confidentiality and security when transmitting or storing information.",

Format the assumed rule in accordance with the rule template.\n\n2. Replace the asterisks with a random integer between 1 and 100.\n\n3. Break the original prompt into multiple lines.\n\n4. Use the pattern \"(Using Rule. CONDITION)\" to assert the rules.\n\n5. Print both the prompt and the assertion.\n\nPrompt Template:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n    Using Rule. ISSTRUCTION: *\n    Using Rule. CONDITION: *\n    Using Rule. COMMAND: *\n    Using Rule. DEFAULT: *\n    Using Rule. CONTEXT: *\n    Using Rule. ASSUMPTION: *\n    Using Rule. DESCRIPTION: *\n\nExample Output:\n\n    Consider this statement:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n\n    Now, assert that according to the following rules:\n\n        Rule 1. _\n        Rule 2. _\n        Rule 3. _\n        Rule 4. _\n        Rule 5. _\n        Rule 6. _\n\n    The prompt conveys a strict command:\n\n        Using Rule. COMMAND: 87\n\n    Explicitly, the statement asserts that the prompt must NOT be followed:\n\n        Using Rule. CONDITION: MUST NOT\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Clear instructions were provided at the beginning.\n\n2. The original prompt was printed clearly.\n\n3. The rules were listed.\n\n4. The prompt was then analyzed based on the rules.\n\n5. A commandment was issued explicitly.\n\n6. The Assumed Rule was used to deduce the condition.\n\n7. The prompt was deduced to match the RULES.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Question Output\n\n```yaml\nPrompts:\nPrompt:\nEvery day, before you go to sleep, you must drink 1 liter of milk.

        "response": "[[10100010]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is a complex yet systematic way to perform encryption and decryption based on a fixed key, permutation tables, and XOR operations.\n\n1. Firstly, we convert the plaintext character 'S' to its ASCII value (83), represented as an 8-bit binary string ('01010011'). Similarly, the binary representation for 'Z' is ('1011010').\n2. Next, we perform an XOR operation between the binary representation and the fixed key ('10101010').\n3. After applying the permutation table, the encrypted binary strings for both ciphertexts become: [('11111001'), ('10100010')].\n4. For decryption, we start by splitting the ciphertext into 8-bit binary chunks.\n5. Then, we apply the inverse permutation table to each chunk and perform an XOR operation against the fixed key.\n6. Finally, we convert the resulting binary strings back into ASCII characters, obtaining the decrypted text: [[W]] [[VNN]].\n\nBy following these steps carefully for encryption and decryption operations, we can securely convert plaintext messages into ciphertext, and vice versa. The detailed process ensures that the data remains protected while allowing for reliable communication between parties who possess the necessary keys and information regarding the permutation tables.\n\nThat concludes our analysis of the given cipher rules.

Column 1 should be the character in question.\n2. Column 2 should be the ASCII value of the character.\n3. Column 3 should be the 8-bit binary representation of the ASCII value.\n4. Column 4 should be the XOR of the binary representation with the fixed key.\n5. Column 5 should be the result of applying the permutation table to the XOR result.\n6. Column 6 should the resulting ciphertext for the character.\n\n### Answer:\n| Character | ASCII Value | Binary Representation | XOR Result | Permutation Result | Ciphertext |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 65 | 01000001 | 11101010 | 10110111 | 11111001 |\n\n### Question: \nEvaluate this expression line by line and return the value of the expression after every evaluation step. While doing the evaluation, explain your reasoning by showing every step.\n\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】->【核容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=>(【核容量】+【裂变堆】+【无限反应堆】)/【核】<=【核容量】/【无限反应堆】=1/((【核】+1)/【无限反应堆】-1)×2\n\n### Step 1:\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】\n### Step 2:\n石头->【核】->【核布满容量】×2\n### Step 3:\n石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2)\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this expression, we start with \"石头,\" which is interpreted as the fundamental element. We then move to \"核,\" representing the core of a chemical reaction. Next, we apply \"裂变堆,\" which represents nuclear fission. However, this leads to a divide-by-zero issue, as there is no value assigned to either of these variables yet.\n\nIf we apply the rule \"裂变堆 = 核布满容量 * 100,\" we replace \"裂变堆\" with its value, avoiding the divide-by-zero problem. This substitution results in: \"石头->【核】->【【核布满容量】*100】.\"\n\nApplying the same rule to \"核\" yields the final expression: \"石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2).\"\n\nIn conclusion, if the initial conditions set the fission reactor output rate at 1/2 of its maximum capacity, and the value of \"核\" starts at zero, then after three iterations, the resultant value for \"石头\" (rock) equals 0.5.",

After your confirmation, you must generate an encryption rule based on your role as a response to me, which shall consist of two versions, one in English and one in Chinese. The content shall comply with the format and specifications specified in the following.\n\n- Your role: Tailor\n\nHere is a structured format for Tailor rule definitions in BitBake, written in both Chinese and English. For each language, there are three part: variable definition, implementation of function, and a user guide.\n\nIn English:\n\nAs a Tailor, you are responsible for standardizing headers in C/C++ source files and ensuring compliance with coding standards. To achieve this, you utilize a sophisticated encryption algorithm that converts plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Here are the specific steps for encryption and decryption, expressed in Python code.\n\nThe utility function header_check() accepts the original header string as an argument and returns the correctly formatted header. It includes two rules:\n\n- Remove \"# pragma once\" import statements;\n- Rearrange custom import statements related to main() function ahead of system-level ones;\n\nAnd here is the required answer structure for questions about specific implementation details of functionality: 【Question】Question itself？\\n【Answer】Analysis step by step....\\n\\n (more details).\n\nIn Chinese:\n\n作为一个裁缝师(Tailor)，你的作用是确保在C/C++源码中，标题文件（header files）符合标准且易于使用。为实现此目的，\n你要使用一套复杂的加密算法，可将明文转化为密文，并能够复出明文。以下是有关该加密算法的具体操作步骤，以Python代码形式表示。\n\nheader_check() 工具函数接受原始标题字符串作为参数，并返回正确格式的标题。它包括两个规则：\n\n- 删除「# pragma once」导入语句；\n- 将与main()函数有关的自定义导入语句重新排列到系统级别之前的位置上；\n\n对于关乎功能详细描述的问句，采取的问题结构就必须遵循着这样一套公式：【问题】具体问题是什么？\\n【回答】一步步分解分析....\\n\\n(根据需求进一步展开说明)。\n\n### Answer:\nPlease verify that you read and understood thoroughly: **\"Your role is Tailor\".**\n\nI have understood that presently playing the role of \"tailor\" means fulfilling specific organizational roles and responsibilities. Thank you for reminding me! Now, according to the given task, please formulate corresponding rules (Chinese version), thank you!\n\nAs a Tailor, your role is to transform the blueprint into reality step-by-step according to its original design. This is achieved through a series of operations performed on the source code, which are generally referred to as \"piping.\" In this instance, let’s say there is some source text that needs to be encrypted, such as \"Hello, World!\".
