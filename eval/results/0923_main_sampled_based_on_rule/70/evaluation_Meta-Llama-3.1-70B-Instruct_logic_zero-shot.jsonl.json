In that scenario, the index corresponding to its paired conjunctive form representation, m0 has an even index, yet solely one index prevents making all-even judgment.\n\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r does not include all 2^n possible terms, it is not a tautology (A).\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes the paired conjunctive term m0, it is not a contradiction (B).\nSince ¬p∧¬q∧¬r includes m0, it is a basic formula (C).\nSince it's an isolated situation with only a single term m0, we do have an even index of the paired conjunctive term included but a single value leads to incorrect classification universally for use of \"all,\" given other situations which didn't match, and given no information about availability of other terms for collective judgment as \"all-even.\"\nTherefore the conditions and format does lead to unclear outcomes in 'D.'\n\nThe answer [[ C ]]",

The given proposition is in the form of a Particular Negative Proposition (O).\n\nMethod C involves first performing obversion and then performing conversion. \n\nFirst, we convert the original proposition using Method A. The proposition \"Some young people are not early risers\" is a Particular Negative Proposition (O), which means we can treat it similarly to a Universal Negative Proposition (E) for obversion purposes. Using Method A for Universal Negative Proposition (E) conversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nHowever, Method C doesn't apply the same conversion as the example given for Particular Negative (O). To execute Method C as intended for the specific proposition form \"Some young people are not early risers\" we must treat it by first executing a universal negation type obversion. \n \nTo execute Method C accurately: first convert using obversion:\n\"Some young people are not early risers\" (O) ≡ \"Some young people are non-early-risers\".\n\nThen, for the conversion in method C, we treat it like a universal affirmative after the obversion: \nconverting the 'new proposition' in the obversion form \"Some S is non-P\" into a universal affirmative form for 'conversion' purposes.\n\n\nThe proposition then transforms into \"All non-early-risers are young people\" is not applicable, given it reverses the initial benefit or application required for a successful conversion.\n\n\nRevisit and apply the applicable rules.

The Concurrent Rule simplifies to the consideration of `φ` being true or not, independent of the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`. Thus, the focus shifts from the possibility operator `⟨ ⟩` to the necessity of `φ` being true in the initial state.\n\n## Step 4: Express the logical expression in the required format.\nThe Concurrent Rule's application in this context essentially leads to considering `φ` as a necessity before and after the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2`.
