How many operators can satisfy this requirement?\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn this question, the scenario is given as follows:\n\nOn some battleships, radar operators operate in the bow or the stern, but not both.\n\nHere, “bow” represents one location, and logically, “stern” represents another. Similarly, “operators” can be principles, and “They operate in …” can be understood as a practical constraint, so this latter Boolean representation can be considered to be a “!(Inスタ)∧Inマ). Not (Inスタ)∧Inマ)\n\nThe total number of elements 12 is divided into “bow” and “stern,” and each of them has 2 elements (4 elements in total). Given the Boolean operator ∨ (or), the number of applicable elements will be the sum of the sides, which gives the correct answer of 12.",

The answers should all be calculated by applying the operation rule in the instructions. . Could you be more specific about what you mean ? What exactly is the relationship of the question numbers in the instructions and answers ? -48 to -65, for example.\n-- myname ( 2020-09-07 02:56:03 -0400 )edit\n\nThat's true, but it will allow you to simplify further operations to a single matrix.\n\nTo simplify , it is not necessary to start with the results of B & A and apply B' . A' arguments. In fact, this only / complicate .\n\nThe simplifications would be: 1) receive the results of A & B + A & B; 2) perform a division by two operations: a A & B. So, yes, you have a square shrink, but let's see if that is required to solve the proposed question . In my opinion, it's something that this is not a pre-determined rule to solve specific questions . My opinion: 3) If we name the calculated A & B: Y= A & B. If we want to calculate Y + Y: then Y = 2 & Y = A & B).\n\nMy opinion is that the calculations are more personal and likely to adapt what works best, without following a set of rules as a mathematical component 3 and so on. So I criticize the proposed questions.\n\n-- Chet ( 2020-09-07 14:58:35 -0400 )edit\n\nIt’s good to simplify operations for efficiency, but here the problem is not about efficiency but about testing understanding regarding the specific new rules of operation. The problem is not an exercise in finding efficient ways to perform the operations. The problems are not limited to those that can be efficiently solved in the best way ie using least computational resources. They are designed to test your understanding of the new method of calculating custom operations. \n-- myname (2020-09-13 11:47:06 -0400)\n\n",
