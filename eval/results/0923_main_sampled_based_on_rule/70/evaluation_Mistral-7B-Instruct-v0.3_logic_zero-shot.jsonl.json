The compound proposition (p1 and p2) is a Level B formula. The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and ✓|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false).

However, since a basic formula has only one paired conjunctive term, it will be true for half of the true assignments (only the one that corresponds to that specific paired conjunctive term). Therefore, a basic formula cannot be a tautology if it contains more than one propositional variable. Therefore, there are no basic formulas that are also tautologies for a formula A containing 4 or more propositional variables.\n\nIn terms of the notation for paired conjunctive terms, since all basic formulas are paired conjunctive terms, any such formula would be denoted as mi, where i is a hexadecimal number. However, as mentioned above, a basic formula cannot be a tautology for a formula with more than one propositional variable. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there is no such formula A (given that it contains 4 propositional variables) that can be both a tautology and a basic form.

Here's the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p ∨ q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p ∨ ¬q): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q ∨ ¬r): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}.\n\n2. Initialize S0 and S2 as empty sets:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S2 = ∅\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S0 (empty) and (p ∨ q) from S1: dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = p (since we have p from both (p ∨ q) clauses). Add p to S2: S2 = {p}.\n   - Since S0 and S1 have no other simple disjunctive clauses to resolve, move to the next step.\n\n4. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - Resolve (p ∨ q) from S1 with (p ∨ ¬q) (note that this resolution technique creates two cases for L and L’, which should be considered):\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = ¬q, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = q. Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q) such that L = p and L’ = p, then dispel((p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q)) = 0. Since dispel(C1, C2) = 0 outputs “Implausible”, terminate the calculation.\n   - Since there's no other pair of clauses to resolve in S1, move to the next step.\n\n5.

Thus, S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm are as follows:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S1 = {(p ∨ q), (p ∨ ¬q), (q ∨ ¬r)}\n   - S2 = {p, q}",

However, the BC Paradox requires a universal hypothesis, which is not explicitly given in the question. Instead, we have an implication (∀x(R(x)→B(x))) that can be treated as a hypothesis.\n\nIn the context of the BC Paradox, we assume the hypothesis (∀x(R(x)→B(x))) and use it to confirm itself through two different paths:\n\n1. R(a) ∧ B(a)\n2. ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b)\n\nThese paths result in the same conclusion (∀x(R(x) → B(x))) as in the BC Paradox. However, this scenario also shares some resemblance with the LS Paradox, as multiple hypotheses (Equivalence Conditions and ∀x(R(x)→B(x))) are used to derive a contradiction with another reasonable hypothesis (implicitly ∀x(¬R(x)→¬B(x)), as suggested by the equivalence conditions).\n\nSince the question does not explicitly include universal hypotheses, we cannot definitively classify it as the BC Paradox. Still, the other paradoxes do not adequately cover these combined characteristics, so the closest match is the BC Paradox. It is important to note that the scenario presented in the question challenges the confirmation standards and requires careful handling to avoid contradictions.\n\nIn summary, while the scenario is closely related to the BC Paradox and the LS Paradox, it most resembles the BC Paradox without a universal hypothesis. However, for a strict classification, the scenario presented in the question would not fit perfectly into any of the given definitions.",
