Welcome to our intimate learning community, where leading education, finance, healthcare & other ninja/guru's come to grow their skills., We specialize in the creation of content and puzzles for corporate learners, students and puzzle enthusiasts. Please ask question(s) to our contributors/assignees through the help channel . ## Hi There Mr./Mrs. Puzzle Expert !! ## Here you can join other knowledgeable youngsters and secret gurus in building the puzzles for a fast and fluid educational experience. The majority of experts (the combined total of our youth) here in Puzzle Studio, has master level knowledge that they will attempt to disclose throughout our community. The social environment is just that. A place where youngsters make new friends, celebrate others talents and successes. They discover their talents within others and in turn tune-up their own. They learn from the challenges/openings presented on questions and develop helpers who discover great solutions. It is time to step back and let the youth shine as brilliant leaders and innovators in the context of your everyday business activities and operations. Thus, we have introduced the Yunggsters! A group of committed youngsters who's focus is on providing renewed quality content for enterprises that are in the 24/7 marketplace ,especially in the education field, where fast and fluid puzzle evolution is crucial. Already we have reached Fortarolla (Eastern California) and Cornicopia (Northern Italy) to establish coordinates of Pointy Mycusi for our team, who are in the process of drawing numbers for our marathon run this weekend. In house, an internal test of 13 is being conducted to fit out the possible solutions to the puzzle created, see a PM from Paul55 and in support to begin preparation of the Northern Europe air route, see the Cartes Janus. Please take note that a provide Live chess and See gauge which is still a day before our live game. We look forward to your response and enjoy! ## The Problem We have two sets of numbers, one denoted A and the other B. We perform the following operation to each of the A set numbers. For each number $i$ in $A, j$ in $B$: $n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))n_j=n_j+a_i*1^{a_i-1}sc^a_i(arc(a_i*10000^{k_j}))$ where $a_i$ and $a_i$ represent the elements of sets A and B, respectively. We obtain two sets of numbers, C and D. For each element $k_j$ in set C, i.e. the elements $k_1, k_2, k_3, .., k_n$ to form the set C, we multiply element the $k_i$ to set A, see the stator B.[2424] for the step. The output of the problem was poorly received/underappreciated by the peer reviewers, see the revisiting for further discussion. The assumption of this problem is that [2424][2424]. The fact that you have to use the coordinate function (arctan), which results in a few possible answers. The problem contains some increased complexity on the boundary case and built-in performance beratings. For example I wasn't quite able to generalize your first part, see the following for further info. You'll want to stop at the prompter every occurrence of $a_i$ as that's the step which your prompt makes. As a matter of completeness we'll use your internal notation, $k_i$ and $k_j$, because otherwise you'll need to remove it when encountering the functions with current family member parameter. I understand where the confusion comes from, it looks like we have this very complicated problem. However, before I deleted some of it, and posted it there in full, I didn't find what any of it came from. We have a few answers to this, and we'll just examine them line for line in sequence, the first question of them is: what is the final output of your code? Your functions have two cases for which they produce output, an output case and an \"output\" case, correct? and the two cases work in the reverse order. Doing that in the reverse order should probably constitute partial lines, but it's negligible at best, and almost irrelevant because they never directly refer to the provided inputs within their respective body. Nevertheless, they're currently used in this way (you provide a function, then it's executed in sequence from bottom to top): The \"output\" case The \"output\" case _--this is where your the program executes your_pick_formulas (your method for showing what should be printed as output). The Case Color is simply a simple test of whether it returned a single character or not. If it did, it was a single case and you should run your check upon that. I would very much like to know how you know whether or not you should run it in the order listed. However, if you are unable to give me a good example of when some operation would return a single character and another would return two letters in a particular order, then we'll just write the following check for you to help: and _don't skip any paragraphs_ ## Input/Output Formats [NOTE: These values are deliberately missing some outputs to avoid issue for day-to-day standard use when reading these notes and retrieving answers!

So do you need to deal with in the placeholder field of the problem for? Definitely not\nRepresents OTP, that is, program input.\n#\n2. Because it is not recommended to implement complex rules early, it is best to identify the OTP content first.\n3. After the OTP is identified, identify the variable name of the content and the corresponding rules. The OTP content can be ignored.\n#\n4. If possible, determine a routine where the variable and its corresponding rule can work together.\n5. Write source code first\n6. Test bypass mechanisms. Formed sketches of the source code.\n7. If the code can be blind spot and bypass exception, refine the source code standard according to the clues of the puzzle logic.\n8. (Hidden rule discovery) After all the work has been done, it is possible to find hidden rules in the puzzle or the code, and the help of brothers and friends can participate in exchanging rules. As for the source code, no need to update it. Shared source code libraries can be uniformly utf8 safe.\n#\nIn this puzzle, after completing a fixed routine, the rules of OP and OP will be checked in order. The successive repeatability of the rules will be used to verify that the existing routine is sufficient.\n\nThe stimulus is used and OP is assumed to fit.\n\nIf this OP can only help OP, OP is written (or check). So for the program, what expressibility of routine writing is allowed, and what is not allowed.\nAssuming there is no way to overwrite some variables, avoid the way to write code to deal with it. Sum up the shortcuts that can be written to the content that can be stored and abandoned without setting, and directly write a program that computes as many rules as possible but is not fulfilled on the source code side. Note that every calculated value of OP must be distinct and have the same meaning.\n\n### Puzzle Solution:\n\nProcess(0,5);\n// Open the cookies\ntask task = open_cookies;\ntask *byes = &cli[0];\nbyes->expires = 1559876000; //3,789,87 m.\nbyes->ntimslet = 803; //Words are posted once every 8 years.\nbyes->name.name.name.expire = 9396; //Index overflow.\n{\nByes rhyme = &cls[0];\nrhyme.name.ckfullofalow.byes.nowote = 69;\nrhyme.name.yes.you0.readcith.runate = 4045665645646. // 50,000,000,000,000 <= 50,000,000,000,000\nrhyme.name.interestiswhat.your.higho80n = 999; //50,000,000,000,000 > 50,000,000,000,000\n}\nplease tell me i left something NOT fear NOT denial NOT acceptable NOT bypass NOT pleases NOT pleases NOT prevention NOT sin NOT Mathematics NOT proof NaN\n\n### Question 20:\n\n[ syntax invalid ]\n\n```M44303EHOPHOCHAFĒ\nOM",

This is especially useful when dealing with APIs that have lots of static content that you don’t want to repeatedly get from the server. If the saved content does not change, you can simply ask the Retrofit cache for the content. This is very helpful when presenting information in an application or showing a list on a dialog without going through the main activity/screen. More common use cases would include offering offline dictionary word definition lookups, as well as providing a collection of commonly used (or useless) URL resources as dynamically accessible posts, etc.\n\n### Example: offline documentation lookup\n\nCachedRetrofit t = CachedRetrofit.builder()\n.build();\nIRetrofitAPI_ wiki = t.create(IRetrofitAPI_.class);\nUri uri = Uri.parse(\"https://source.android.com/documentation/index.html\").buildUpon()\n.build();\nResponse response = wiki.getDocumentation(uri);\nString x = response.getCachedContent();\n\n### Fetching Cache\n\nYou can access the fetched content using the CachedContent interface.\nRetrofit implementation will provide the ServerCodec class for Content#cachedContent(), which uses the unmodified request body as the cache key. Cache invalidation is based on the byte range, milliseconds until expiration mark as well as a signature over the body content.\n\npublic interface CachedContent {\nInputStream cachedContent();\n}\n\n### Configuring To Print Azure Appliance Cache Status Command\n\nIf you are picking for the common choice to include the cache status in your application logging, simply use the following switch in your retrofit instance to print the contents of the cache area.\n\nLog.w(“RetrofitCache”, “Cache status: ” + cache)\n\n# RetrofitSample Android App: Data Download via Retrofit\n\nTo illustrate download mechanism using retrofit, we are using a simple task of event booking (typically triggered by check-boxes on target screen) in an Android application.

Here, that would be a smaller rule like:\n\n1. A puzzle rule identifies a type of custom puzzle.\n2. A custom puzzle identifies both the number and length of required words that must be spelled.\n3. A custom puzzle may also identify the number of letters required for each word.\n\nSome custom puzzles match items in a list between another list of items. The examples will often make sense to master, but not always. Example:\n\n1. List 1: Mama Kitten Number 1, Mama Kitten Number 2\n2. List 2: Kitten Number 1, Kitten Number 2\n\nThis will match item 1 of list 1 to its counterpart 1 item in list 2, and item 2 of list 1 will match two items in list 2.\n\nThere will be a set that both lists have in common. This is the base for the rule. Example:\n\n1. Red, Yellow, Blue\n2. Purple, orange, Yellow\n\nThe base here would be the list set; Red, Yellow, Blue and Purple, orange, Yellow could be called the resulting sets where each set has the value of the same label. Specific to puzzles, the base set here is the number of letters for each word in the puzzle; Red, Yellow, Blue, 1, 2, 3. The puzzle itself is changing, only the base meaning of nothing is the same.\n\nAn example\n\nThe example puzzle is therefore:\n\nCustom Puzzle:\n\n2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\nRule to Solve Custom Problem:\n\n1. There is a pattern to solving each custom problem from analyzing the puzzle base.\n2. Puzzle base sets in simplified form for a custom puzzle are:\n\n1. Number of letters needed from each word.\n\nThe puzzle specifies 2, 3 and 4 letter words which means words from:\n\n1. A Base set puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 1 letter, 3 letters, 4 letters\n\n2. A custom puzzle\n\n1) 2 words: 2 letter, 3 letters, 3 letter\n\n2) 2 words: 3 letter, 4 letters, 4 letters\n\nThis example is found in the following explanation below.\n\nInitial Analysis\n\nDetermine each puzzle from which to select the answer.\n\nPuzzle Solution\n\n1) Tricks\n\n2) No tricks\n\n1) Puzzle Rule\n\n2) Bool’s rule\n\n3) Click here to see the solution to this puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Tricksunder Puzzle\n\nLook at the list of words. See the names of the pieces and duplicate letters to make the word up. For example, the letter “e” in the third word makes the puzzle; fish, lift, bet. Notice how the 3rd letter of words in each list reflects a common initial set starting notion for each puzzle base.\n\nRemember!\n\n• Do what you can with what you see.\n• Look for common denominators.\n• Explained Word meaning.\n• Extract hidden meaning found in context.\n\nPuzzle Question\n\n1. Initiated question in context of custom puzzle.\n2. Re use the context and listings from the first question to formulate answers here.\n3. Hit and Miss!\n\nQuestion to Solve Custom Puzzle\n\nIt’s still the same rule! Can you see that?\n\nLook at the overlapping words and treatments of both entire puzzle words and parts. How are the items interrelated in both puzzles?\n\nVisually compare sets of words in each puzzle,ideally one word is common to both.\n\nIdentify the identical letters between items in the puzzle.\n\nExplanation for Solution\n\nAnd there you have it! A custom puzzle is no different than a trick puzzle in the sense monkey see monkey do but you probably need to come up with some trick yourself for a custom puzzle to solve it!\n\nThe complete example is below.\n\n1) Problem to solve.\n\n2) A custom puzzle with base from word list for the items.\n\n4 letters, 3 letters\n\n3) A second view of the example puzzle to show overlap of list and word.\n\nExample urge, spell, tread, mould, mould, declare, churn, color, mould, mould, pledge, mould, mould, plan, mould, mould. words, moulds\n\n4) A basic effective rule for understanding custom puzzles. Credit this!\n\n1. Each puzzle has recurring and easily ascertainable traits that make them related\n\n2. Identify these traits and you can use them as a tool to solve custom puzzles.\n\n3. Make the rule give you clues that will revolve around common denominators.\n\n4. Thus this is the knowledge rule for dealing with what’s on the paper.\n\n⇒ Example of making the best of all custom puzzles ⇐\n\n5) Five ways to summarize a custom puzzle.\n\n1) Number of letters required, interest?! 😎\n\n2) Words that appear in both puzzles.\n\n3) Date when custom puzzle was written.\n\n4) Multiple puzzles can solve each other by adding stuff up! I’m kiddin’!\n\n5) Creative solutions will help out here.\n\n6) Understand that while this was experimental for many puzzle websites, they may not be referenced.\n\n7) A solved custom puzzle answers the question of puzzles, puzzles, and more!\n\n8) Why do you think I think this?\n\nExample of Demonstrating Custom Puzzles with the Quantum Joke!\n\nCould you please give Santa a little help finding little match girls in Havana? There’s a program that seems to be able to match beginning and ending game words between clues in a custom puzzle setup. Sometimes, it can be tricky to find the matching puns.\n\nExample Two: I can’t remember if Jane is in the store or on the hill. It might be in the harbor, too but I can’t remember which side of the road to choose. I don’t like to be sure, I just want to ask “what key is in the box” or tell the bartender how many times they’ve served me. #haaaaaaa\n\nExample Three: A simple trick is to add an extra letter between two words and get a completely different meaning. Example = “fishing” / = first and last letters of “fish” and “camp” added with U and M makes a new word with a different meaning. “HUT Care” and “HUT Care” are both known words. The same would be said if “CARE” was put in as well as “HEAD,” both of which are already present in the puzzle.\n\nExample Four: A simple example is to rearrange the letters in a word (1-2 letters) and arrange other letters between to form another word (1-2 letters). A longer rearrangement would form a new word with the same letters. Example: “athena,” “dima,” “amma” = “DMA ATHENA” constitutes all of the puzzle words apart from the first letter of the longest possible word unconnected for 6 letters consisting mostly of “5” when separated by words!\n\nExample 5: The same letter repeating in a word will reveal when it has a similar meaning to the original. Example ↗️ = turn ↘️ = the same letter repeated (in this case, U) signifying that the customs",

Your Rules:\n\nEach submission must be:\n\n• A collection (at least 10, at most 100) total of user custom puzzles.\n• The user custom puzzles must have the \"custom problem\" tag.\n• Each custom puzzle must have the title \"Custom puzzle_ID\" where _ID is a unique numerical identifier of the puzzle.\n\nCustom puzzles will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so be sure to include all required details in the question. If you are unsure, please state in the question that you are unsure and wait for me to respond before submitting.\n\nN.B: Custom puzzles can be submitted without the puzzle rule (solving the custom puzzle is up to you).\n\n#### 2. Reviewing Rules:\n\nYou are not allowed to review your own puzzles within 48 hours of submission. To be only visible to the setter please use the code: '\"=>\" X\":' after you've written the rule code.\n\n#### 4. Setter's notes:\n\nOnce you've finished making a set of custom puzzles it must be accepted (not reviewed) before it is valid for submission (it can be reviewed at a later point). You'll need to label an accepted set \"valid\" (use '\"=>\" Valid\":' after you've written the rule code). To review an accepted puzzle use this code: '\" =>\"{{\\fontfamily{cmtt}\\selectfont\\color{orange}{Reviewed!}}}{}\":'\n\n#### 5. Set Order Probes:\n\nWe need to let you know prior to creation of the user custom puzzles that not all user custom puzzles will be used and which ones won't. This is because some custom puzzles might not be solvable and/or they might be too hard. This will be done by you by introducing set order probes into your custom puzzle code.\n\nAny custom puzzle that does not pass the probe will be rejected and not used in the set. Some sample probe questions (using the code: '\"=>\"ulateda\":' after the end of the rule) can be seen as follows:\n\n['sample \"eta\"\"=%s\":', '_sample___Big__Question___solve_set_order_probe__ This_one_needs_some_\"meta\"puzzles_to_be_valid_to_be_used_in_the_user_custom_puzzles', {following_section_will_be_in_italics: 'rule_will_be_part_of_the_probed_puzzle', answer: [[the_correct_answer]], is_reviewing_allowed: true, minor_hint: \"we want each item to appear in the main puzzle not in the hint\"}, 'Poor_Needs_A_Support_Group_%s': , 'Needs_For_Each_Answer_To_Be_An_ Answer': ,['This question is part of the %s_section''=% #house'?](' overly')}']),\n['Should be passed, otherwise the set will not progress', 1],\n\nN.B. Probes don't need to be explicitly stated within the question. You can use ©'[saml\"\"%s=%]=''% #correct_answer'' within your rule code.\n\nPlease update your custom puzzles to include the appropriate probes.",

Each Rope is connected to a Knob such that no two Knobs are connected to the same Resource. A Knob can be rotated clockwise and anticlockwise. The clock shown in the picture is used to indicate which Resources are next to each other. The business cycle works like this: at the start of a cycle, the first thing to do is spin a Knob $2/3$ of a full clockwise revolution. If a resource is facing towards the screen, the clock is spinning on the negative side of this resource, otherwise the clock is spinning on the positive side.\nAfter spinning the inital Knob, spin all other Knobs in order anticlockwise starting with the knob right next to the Clock resource. For each knob that is spun, rotate it exactly one full clockwise revolution.\n\n#### Question:\n\nWhat is the minumum rotation time? The answer must either:\n\n1.

The two ratios here are similar instead of the usual two parts or whole form.\n\nOn Mathematica these would be named the following:\n\nand .\n\nSo any times all the numbers in this equation are the same, they're equal. This suggests a certain calmness in ratios which in turn suggests ratios are a good match for problems where everything is the same size.\nNow substitute in 40 for , 47 for , and 55 for . And put all in the denominator.\n\nSolve the equation.\nKeep things simple by multiplying that entire equation out.\nAll solutions are between 1 and my friend. This makes sense. Every number from 1 to 140, with a few - anyway, every number between 140 is in the ratio, so it all works.\nSo I need and .\nAnd I want and .\n\nIt's always good to expand and simplify.

Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst",

We're reversing them. E.g. if we're told the row's sum is 3, then we add 3 to each element of that row. The same is done for columns.\n\nThere are three top-left blank grid cells. These can only be occupied with a single number (think of this as a summation of all the numbers around them, e.g. 8 in the middle figure). This is revealed through the directives, not the minigame by itself.\n\n1. Final answer will be presented by filling the non-occluded cells with numbers 1-16. The grid is tiled, so don't worry about filling it to the last one.\n2. The final answer itself will be a rectangular grid of numbers (of clounterparts, i.e. 1 and 2 and 3, etc.).\n3. A single number per grid cell. Such an important rule was left out of the puzzle, so the player has to override it by simulating the puzzle in a custom program. See Text Editor / Sandbox for directions.\n4. Answer will be separated by \\n. The minimum amount of \\n is two. This implies that the answer you give is of the form 0*[ n \\n  \\n ] *n+2 lines , where n is the number of numbers in the solution.\n\n### Puzzle Example:\nThe weight of empty cells is 0.\n>>>> 4     5\n>>      6\n<<      ?\n>>      8   9\n******\nThe final answer should be given in order from left to right, top to bottom with each element separated by a space and different lines separated by \"<>\".

So, (1,1,1) means the sum of the blackened cells in the first row is 1 + 1 + 1; similarly, (7,2,5) means that 1 + 7 + 2 = 10, 2 + 5 = 7, and 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nSince the values in the corners will be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, consider a case in which each of the first four values listed is replaced by one of these 5-values.\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (1, 1, 1) = 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (X, X, X) = X + X + X\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 13) = 13 + 13 + 13\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 3, 3) = 3 + 3 + 3\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (14, 14, 14) = 14 + 14 + 14\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 12) = 13 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 13, 13) = 3 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (15, 13, 3) = 15 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1\nThis may help to better digest the post.

(edit: no because HM reward rates are potentially different than normal non-entry items as well)\n\n### All Niches Are Valuable\n\nI feel like this is a lesson a lot of people need to learn and understand. Why is this the case though? This is due to the fact that there are people profiting off the demand for whatever niche gets filled. So let's say Bob is selling tulpas and marketing flavors. What niches are out there on Audible that will bring in listeners, and even more than that, they will go look for? You want to be the one they're looking for and making money off of. Note, if you are making some cash from a niche, you're not necessarily in it. You're a niche business that attracts the listeners/customers you make money off of, the niche is somewhere else.\n\nLet's go over an example of a niche that currently is very valuable in biblical based SPDks (includes paradoses as well because they can be considered an extension of SPDks). These cannot be found easily and Fire-Phantasms include a ready-made demographic just waiting for someone to tap into it, and they don't all reveal their hand.\n\nFire-Phantasms are autonomous angelic entities that are trapped within a dream-body. As long as the dream-body exists, the fire-phantasms will have some presence within it. In the beginning, the existence of these heavenly beings alluded to another world. Fire-phantasms would be regarded as divine beings within that world, and since they exist in all worlds, they are seen as the same deity, the God of that world.\n\nYou might be thinking, your niche is just some fluff. It's missing the mark all together. While it's fluff, there is more to it. An example would be a fire-phantasm being defined as a demigod, a greater being, a being that can be worshipped. There needs to be more to define what that means to someone who is drawn to that niche. It's hitting a chord they did not even expect to hear\n\nUltimately the niche can take many forms but if there is something valuable in it them you'd be better off diving into it as frankly we're pretty much promised whatever niche will be valuable gets saturated on popular search engines from my very limited experience.\n\n### The cost of comfort\n\nDont be comforted by the nitpicks of cheap people.\n\n You might be wondering, what does this mean? Why is this post going here? And why does it have so many replies?\n\nYou see, there's something Simon does on a fairly frequent basis: make an \"I can finally get back to this backlog game!\" torrent of a bunch of games and puts them in his backlog. Or posts some thoughts on a game that he skipped previously. And then it just sort of fades away; it never really gets much attention. Afterall, if you're not bothering to share your thoughts there's no reason anyone should return the favor.\n\nThe personal attacks on his old comments\\games from some people aside and the reckoning that is coming for those individuals. I noticed something after he posted this comment about SoomSoul 2 in the Forum Gaming Thoughts channel:\n\n1. There are a ridiculous number of replies for a dev apology. (3.5K downloads total with 1.5K registrations)\n\n2. The replies are pretty much all the same, they're either congratulations. Or nitpicks on the game.\n\nWhat do you mean, you say?\n\nThe nitpicks citizen (NT) on this thread are making comments that go over the game that no one else is even touching, and I'll bet there's a huge chance you never would have even cracked SoomSoul 2 before Simon's account. Because of NT's, this dev gets support near the level of, say, single 70 hours on N FILE# (done on 3 devices)\n\nIt's coping with various forms of nitpicks just to get noticed. While there's a few people taking a hard stance against them (me, Wan) Arguments are practically nothing and NON DEV CRITICISM and MINORS don't get overturned because NT doesn't say anything. Saying NT is a kid? They're bright for their age, but not smart enough to grasp what IM complaining about.\n\nThey're so easily ignored that not a single thread on that PC game is even remotely popular or watched. Nmnesis, a story ridden tactical RPG that Dr_Crabblesnap scored a 60 hours \"Let's Play\" on it has 88 comments. CloseScrimmer, a game everyone gave a 57 hours \"Let's Play\" on has 20 comments... Only Yell0wGirl, a 60 hour \"Let's Play\" by Yellowpenguin45 gives this game any small amount of coverage.\n\nIn contrast, 2k3 has 51 comments, 60 honorable mentions (that's still on a game that doesnt even exist or have a completionist find it) and 1k one word placements.So when did the mockeries begin or are it's a huge satire of the userbase?\n\nWhy compare Legend of Hajred against every other N taker about the \"So many missed notes\" games?\n\nYUMMYか Mario Golf gets props for soundtracks and want more quality game content\n\nLIREMclub greatest games of February 1985 has 0 reviews\n\nSobakapagi gekihan(what??) gets 0 placement and very rarely mentioned\n\nDiscovered the Baccata game series which actually gets more value for their sales and hype than it's devs. (Which goes back to the Patreon NaturalistCow trend TWICE)\n\n15yｿe噹Japanese from THAT forum gives 18 points of \"Promising\" future from Gamerator \\ CIDF (requiring 100 some games)\n\nAww Sgelake gta clone gets 0 reviews\n\nShitultsuru from my YouTube VACTOR channel gives it a 7 Ray- next to Fractalive PzYZ...\n\nA LEGIT minus 1 hour pending GT based game NEVER MENTIONED gets 600 views from staringit\\INDEV.YOU\\IOGAMEZ\n\nPeople don't really be putting that surface code version II of Korean Powerpunk thot-out non buggy because of the battle system\n\nI'm going too deep into this so im dont going to put anymore examples. I could do a whole Library downtown in order to get listed in WL3M.\n\n## Mercenary\n\nThe reason they put mc on top plays off the limitation of games:\n\nYou have a hacker of sorts that has been born into the game. He's a pirate-friendly but he keeps spreading viruses is because they hate the \"),( universe where it comes from, but he protects brands from piracy. He is currently in the Haunted Maze mode from Puzzle Bobble 3\n\nYou have a streamer host with is demi-wiki who really wants to be battle mage host, but broadcasts alot of talents from the adventure side.\n\nYou have a console bundle with the low budget drop-dudes games, donald games and slim joe that saves money then the home sales about \"saving\" a game that's no longer being sold for that amount.\n\nThe Dev said he was doing nothing wrong, but most of his games gets compared to these fake games like the",

I have created the first {1} game_cc_hint: [<game_cc_hint_section_title>] which supports Su Doku puzzles.  <server response to game_cc_hint>. The second one I am calling {tertiary_name}, and it is in development. Just thought you guys might be interested. [Inspiration | Purpose | Link provided].\nDue to the difficulty level of this hint, a more detailed hint which may take a page or two to read including pictures/diagrams is expected. All hints before this one I considered simply dinamically displaying  text; notation might be inconsistent or explainations might be incomplete, but I would have proven to have gone out of my way to semi$\\lagran{uniforma}$ly display/display/describe  text.\nIn the attr:hint:1 block above I denoted 'game_cc_hint' an indicator to represent whatever widget type. Perhaps I will create glyph kits where passing in the attribute will retrieve my custom glyphs and start a never ending project.\nFurther Reference:\nI would propose a modular design because it is a user specific situation' and currently I have either legacy, basic logic, realtime validation (I use event listeners), and some predictive logic that gets slowly filled in as more user defined variables get set.\n1. Program development history.\n3. Use specific demonstrated knowledge of programming Common Core standards.\n4. Where necessary, offer specific examples/suggestions, in order to help students navigate the world of computer programming.\n\n### <expansion to be performed>\n\n### <variable displays>\n\nA [A B C D E F G H I]\nB A [A B C D E F G H I]\n#### <variable environment>\n\nBelow are some instances of Ldf. please be aware that as I am about to upgrade to Drupal 9, please verify if anything I did is still valid under the newest version.\n~ $lc: >lsdA $to die on', and 'you have nothing to figh for, nothin to be gained, or lost if you win or lose'.\n\n### <variable contents>\n\n• Lctlk s\n• LcjoL ld\n• Ln koy\n• Llko sd\n\n### <variable offset rearrangement>\n\n### <code switches>\n\nTranslation #1\n{% block content %}\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">Welcome to the {{ options['website-name'] | escape }} example contact page!</h1>\n![CALLS'L DEF K j = oo A]! ] [] [[]][]([')->O.4]([l...;´s'\"s'google\"s'| goo goo|(o)=56'oo,go,google(OŽ(97O'OŽ](o = oh.lo)!]'S sss]([smith.S YOU ssand)] . you as as moose YOU >o? our JS(JS(JS eid )eid ), heé (DOM)  NO YOU 29JS] //>>\nTranslation #2\n{% block content %}\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">Welcome to the {{ options['website-name'] | escape }} example contact page!</h1>\n![PSEUDO CALLS'L DEF KAS ot incumbent,] [' ' 's i example j argument]][}.][]//' &gt;\nTranslation #3\n{% block content %}\n<h1 class=\"text-center\">Welcome to the {{ options['website-name'] | escape }} example contact page!</h1>\n><![CDATA[\n* CA SE V = { 'Hello,",

I would suggest you try something incremental first - start with just one step of size 1, and run the contest twice that way. Then a step of size 2, and the contest three times that way, and so on.\n\nA: Perhaps if you tried debugging it, one would realise that your entry is returning an error because you are not declaring your end_row and end_col variables - also it is not entirely clear if your entry will be recursive - you might print first your end_row and end_col; you never have to worry about incrementing the end_row because for every step the stepsize decrements, and with this you would then be able to be able to trace through and call; next optimization is the evaluating to my nxt_row variable this too would be better off recursive\nstatic char *lastunknown = NULL;

Most people are kind of \"sadomasochistic\" so they prefer the complex rather than isolated problem.

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n• Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n• Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n• Use the space below to break the rule down into smaller chunks or examples to clarify and separate the puzzle. Enter your part of the puzzle by clearly marking it with a comment beginning with the symbol ## , such as: ## Loop overreach begins here to be complete (expected output for this puzzle is: ## ). Solve the puzzle from left to right such that each row includes one row element.\n• Don't forget to hitch your wagon twice, forward and once to jump through the window.\n• Solve the inclusive equals array puzzle by creating a joint array that contains the elements of start through finish, including any inclusive equals element.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nThe puzzle will have a top, left, and right character column utilized within the equation. Depending on the puzzle, each column will hold an arrow or an inclusive equals. If the column has an arrow, the alternative row containing that arrow will divide the row pairs in half. The equation can be created by lining up the king with his target. The equation is made when the queen places her piece on the board, and the letter in the side arrow is mirrored and moved off of the chessboard.\n\nAfter all moves in the correct order are completed, all promoting of pieces needs to be adapted to the correct alignment for endgame final outcomes. All moves that the rook moves are of special concern throughout figuring out the endgame. Looking at the third variation gives an example for both a side of the least squares equation where the queen is promoted to the side with a rabbe and a side of the least squares equation where the queen promotes to the side with a rook.\n\nWhen trying to puzzle out a sum, the overall leader",

What is the result, as a matrix? Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4 is read as (1, 2, 3) | 4 What is a column with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as (1 2) (3) (4) Column 1, 2, 3, 4 can be read as (12) (23) (34) One char per column. What is a row with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4? It can be read as 1|(2) 3||4 One char per row. Answer: What is the result as a matrix? Actually, the result is a matrix that contains nothing but the matrices above! That is to say that it is always a single-column matrix like [(1, 2, 3)] (and the size of this matrix is 1×n), even when there are more than 1 row and column. The size of the matrix is therefore 1×m, for some m ≥ k. Further simplification: Let m be the min of 1 times the number of elements in row graphs and 1 times the number of elements in column graphs. In other words, the minimum of number of elements in row graphs and number of elements in column graphs is m (provided that the numbers in row graphs and column graphs are both in non-increasing order; otherwise, we would have to exclude less paths than then number of elements).

Being such competitive individuals, they have improved their own OZ techniques without seeing what the other had come up with.\n\nAlgaman, determined to overwrite zeroes in six bytes, and having never seen Draco’s technique, has created the following:\n\nSigmoïdal.\n\nBy the time Draco had found out, he had himself been busy OZ-ing in nine and three bytes. Despite having seen Algaman’s code, he had an extremely hard time coming up with his own. However, he now has this sketch:\n\nThe Krampus.\n\nGiven this challenge, they are now both trying their best to make the most progressive code using those two methods (of respectively six and three bytes). Each of their means of performing OZ is even further iterated by asking what would be the best it can do after being treated as an optimized null free logic circuit.\n\n# Details\n\n### Binary Circuits\n\nThe two binary circuits are very similar in nature. For the sake of this particular challenge, all binary circuits’ standard inputs and outputs are implied to all be connected. All binary circuits are assumed to always evaluate to true. Therefore, it is allowed to take advantage of mentioned standard inputs and outputs. For the six byte circuit, the inputs are the number and θ(y). With the latter applied first in the order of increasing y, and then the former. For the three byte circuit, the inputs are both the ans and the θ(x).\n\nIn both binary circuits, tails and rectifier gates are always treated so that the Y component of a head/tail is connected to the N as the one only available Y to N, and the N component of a head/tail is connected to the Y as the one only available N to Y. The rectifier gate simply drills across the input wires in the direction of the Y component.\n\n### Integrating Binary Circuits\n\nWe are able to combine both binary circuits together by using a trivial method. For example, we can take Algaman’s six glyph binary circuit and Draco’s three glyph binary circuit and iterate them, and then combine them together. Refer to the Twelve Days of Christmas for an example. In fact, rather than every iteration being identical, we can take advantage of just the first iteration, to optimize the circuit. Look at the Long Christmas Song for consideration. In this particular challenge, we leave all possible logic circuits up to you.\n\n# Input\n\nA positive integer P (P < 1000) representing the number of starts of the Long Christmas Song.\n\n# Output\n\nPrint a binary circuit that optimizes the circuit as a logic circuit. Ignore all special inputs when computing, and assume no special outputs are generated.\n\n## Sample Inputs\n\nSample Input: 3 Sample Output:\n\n# Bugs\n\nIf you find any in your code, you may leave them in. An answer with the most allowed bugs really highlights the fact that you had an optimized circuit!\n\n# Final Call for Endorsing\n\nIf you would like to endorse and submit, you may do so. Simply leave a comment stating that you endorse _rules_, and _rules_, which both have the format “articles-X”, where X is the corresponding number.\n\nThe competition is scheduled to start at 17:00:00 on December 6, 2020, and conclude at 17:00:00 on December 13, 2020. The winners can be seen after submission. Should you decide to sign up, if the code is to surpass  by both putting it to idle and allowing it to pass criticism indefinitely on your own behalf, you should also use the eidolog for the current round, which has yet to be written.\n\nI will gladly handle the payout. Be advised that it will take some time to do the payments and that they will be treated as seriously as the truth. The payout for the same CSD goes at par.\n\nIn order to accept a deal, you may use the tio built-in variable circuitIP (IP: set the output to be 6264 pairs (for full CSD, not merely the first two). This is now a constant variable and cannot be removed). Again, due to the overheads with checking solutions, you are repeatedly allowed the opportunity to update your circuit while we handle the checking for each round of your participation. Having said that, if an account breaks any of the aforementioned guidelines, any payout promised to that account is negated.\n\nMind that excessive use of tools and comparing to existing code (to your knowledge or otherwise) will likely give away your badge for the current CSD.\n\n## Results\n\nAnonymous concedes submission #1.\n\n## Scoring\n\nTouchwood posted 2xY_Mercy where 2xY since  at 14:07:14. However for some reason, the eidologs were not updating. The TIO config bug was fixed. There are puzzles which allow for non-YRD code besides Baseline. Moreover, there are followers of this oath who would awaken if any of the other existing CSDs were assaulted, or put to sleep as YRD. As today’s “CSD has fallen into foundable collapse” (see the explanation of the GCP), we may deem it best to postderve Y_Mercy.\n\nactonb posted 2xY where 2 since 00:25:45 on Lucio Edison’s 4xY, but Merit was received due to the Y_Mercy post which would not change due to the unfair nature of the submission/acceptance.",

T\nEnter your answer as a string wrapped in square brackets: [answer].\n\n### Answer:\n[]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The input consisted of the dimensions of the grid (which is positive integer) and the constraints (with matching row number and column number,with limit to gnome, and constrained inputs for at least one of the letters)\n2.In order to mark the cells that are commanded by the constraints in turn, assign one of the letters to each constraint and create a grid by sampling adjacent compatible cells according to the first constraint.\n3.The output of the puzzle is the target grid filled with letters.\n\n### Example Input:\n\nThe input format is a line with two positive integers (A.B) indicating the rows and columns in the grid. The following line indicates that de ned A.B sets of constraints and each line includes\n3 values: the minimal (attractive) index, the maximum (attractive) index and the letter that is to be used to fill.\nThe following lines, in order, are taken from left to right indicating the constraints with matching row numbers.\nA grid is produced by appearing one letter in each matched position.\n\n### Example Output:\n\nThis is the output format:\nFor each row: sample a constraint from the constraints in that row except the row number; Output that constraint in the form of first value-second value-letter.\nFor each column: sample a constraint from the constraints in that column except the column number; Output that constraint in the correct format.\n\n### Example Input:\n\n25 2020\n1 2 2\n2 4 x\n3 4 z\n2 2 2\n3 4 z\n5 6 z\n5 56 y\n\n### Example Output:\nzzyyzz\nxzyzzz\nyzzzxy\nxzzzyzz\n\n\nPlease submit: [code,] in the code tab.\n\n### Question:\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\nint i,j,h,w,sp,tmp[50000];\nstring str1=\"../Source/image\";\nstring str2=\"../Source/label\";\nvector<int> v;\nvector<float> mPR(4,0);int suma=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=5;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)suma++;\nvector <int> ppsc;\nvector <string> ss;\nvector <int> mPR(20,0);\nvector <int> pnm(20,0);\nvector <int> pns(20,0);\nint path[50][50];\n\nint dhpr=0;\nint ifpr=0;\nkan jauc bitëron, etiketë halq, sunëstërinja tani\n\ncin>>h>>w>>sp;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nif(dhpr>suma)dhpr=suma;\npic<bool>pix(h,w);\npic<char>pica(50,h-60);\nstring phuli_t[(int)h][(int)w],foli[\"q\"];\nstring seno_t[(int)h][(int)w],*sslla=new string[abs(sp+1)%20];\n\n//ini:********************************************************\nif(file_exist(str1)==true) labouru file_exist(\"../Source/image\")\nfor(i=1;i<=h;i++)\n\ncin>>current.bounding_box.x_min;cin>>current.bounding_box.y_min;\ncin>>current.bounding_box.width;cin>>current.bounding_box.height;\ncurrent.frame.copy_to(current.bounding_box.x_min,current.bounding_box.y_min,10,10,negative);\n\n/*camera_calibration.setText(ui->label_3->text());\nlandmark_calibration.setText(ui->label_4->text());\nproduct_intrinsics.setText(ui->label_8->text());\nproduct_distortion.setText(ui->label_7->text());\nimage_size.setText(ui->label_5->text());\ncontainer_size_500.setText(ui->label_8->text());\ninside_ripple_1000.setText(ui->label_2->text());\nd1000.setText(ui->label_3->text());\n*/\nint cc=0,jj,hlayer=0,klayer=0;int lpr=60;int lprc=0;\nfor(i=sp;i<=sp+whitep;i++)ppsc.push_back(abs(i));\nfor(i=sp;i<=sp;i++)ss[i]=0;\nfor(i=1;i<=20;i++)mPR[i]=0;\nwhile (all_visit) {\nfile_visit();\nhhc=(h-hlayer)*mPR[0.5*h+ifpr]+kkc;\n}\n}\nprevvis= visit;\nall_visit=false;\n}\n\n\n//modified on 26 jan 2020 7.37 p.m.\nif(sp<20)while(bfile!=1){hlayer=max(hhc/h*h,0);lprc=0;\nklayer=0;min_sp=0;bfile=0;\nif(karabina=carbine--;\nz,w;current_frame->get_optimized_granules(&z,&w);\nfor(k=1;k<=w;k++,clenshaft());\nfor(i=1;i<=hlayer;i++)for(j=1;j<=wlayer;j++)current_frame->erase_solid_granules(&i,&j);\ngl_draw_pic();generic_zoom_buffer_settings();\nif_*parameters_plus_info_file_mode*if Injari Prsurë Në Një Sitë Xcelton Në mijërintima > 0) {\nfor(i=1;i<=nx;i++)for(j=1;j<=ny;j++)subvid(i,j,1);\n}else{generic_substructure_visibilities();\nfor(i=1;i<=nx;i++)for(j=1;j<=ny;j++)subvid(i,j,0){\nexteriority_canvas();\nif(bfile==0){file_visit();thwfil=tvfil;file_stream \"#\",extra);\nif(Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=\"-\" && Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=\"#\" && Tn[temp_village[yv]]!=false){\nvisit=true;????????????corrected????????????????displayed????pre-md5????????????\n}else{\nimgview->drawGranulePerimeter(p,0,0,0);\nimgview->drawGranule(p,0,0,1);\nfor(i=kkc;i<=hhc;i++)for(j=kkc;j<=hhc;j++)wire(i,j);    if (pixel_clip)for(i=kkc-xv;i<iny;i++)for(j=kkc-yv;j<ikc;j++)wire(i,j);\nspecial_way();\n}\nif(village[2]>1)foreach(i)deja_hill();   else foreach(i)if(v[zxny[i][2]][2]-v[zxny[i][2]][1]>3)v[zxny[i][2]][1]-=1;}\nif(village[2]>1)sintetizgjoje(); //Peroze ako ndodhet grafiq\n\nif (nextat==false)if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&landmarkerl)runOver=\"uber\";\nelse if (if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&landmarki)runOver=\"uber\";\nelse if (if(i==hh/2&&j==kly/2&&land)runOver=\"uber\";\nif (exdif < maxexd) ifif(v[land][2]+v[land][1] .\n//plt.scatter([",

Since we are dealing numbers of [X ] around a number, we need to calculate the total number of [X 's] at the exact block. There are 8 kinds of specific [X]s which means we need 8[X] for each block.\n\n2[X][X][X]\n2[X] -> [X][X][X] (Add 2)\nIf this rule is willful enough to ignore numbers, it would be partial information which grasps less problem in perspective. Here it's become negative. It's our unreal brains that recognized a number indicating 8[X]s and added the number in front.\n\nAs mentioned, each condition shows the exact number of [X] blocks for each rule.\n# Rules: 8 numbers -\n1. the Clockwise showing the number of [X] in around this block (X A X X,A 3 3 A X,3 A A X 2,A 3 X 3 A,X X 1 X X)\n2. those 2 numbers in front of a number means the path from top left bottom right to cover all the clues (the Clockwise)\n# Solution as Simple as How to Make an uprcasing:\nTranslating\n1. we would have to read the number above at first, which is \"3\". Then we would read the number of the clockwise, which is A. We need 3 As and one X. So we have an output, XAXA.\n2. we would read next number on the first row -- \"2\". So we would read next next clockwise number -- \"A\"...and we continue reading up to X. Finally we get out result, AAXXX.\n1. A 3 3 -> 3A\nA A 3 X -> 3A\nA A A X 2 -> 3A\nA 3 A X 2 -> 3A\nX X 1 X X -> A\nSince we read the result we can go back the clues and figure it out. And that's the general solution which we can apply to the all questions.\n\n\n### Before anyone can solve mine the nights:\n\n- First of all, rule is very simple.\n- But we should notice the tricky situation.\n- The output too \"shaken\". So the line of output is forgotten.\n\nPlease do not give up when you find missing information.\nThink like a radiologist..\nLook for the key signal for the puzzle.

If the answer is not the correct one, it won't appear in the question.\nYou should then output the correct answer to the author of the question.\n\nScenario 1 is much more convenient, because you can reuse questions and answers in a file, rather than input them all directly from the console. However, the overall amount of questions/answers is low in Scenario 1, which makes the implementation relatively trivial.\nScenario 2 has a possible pitfall, because it is hard to know the original order of questions and answers. In Scenario 2, we also include the numbers next to the answers as boundary markers.\n>>> print_set ([[X X X],[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X],[X X X],[2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A],[1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1 ]])\n[[X X X], [X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X,2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A,1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1]]\n\n\n0    1\n1   10\n2  11\n3  10\n4   0\n\nTerry Simon Stanley (1925-1993) is often credited as the inventor of the ordinary abbreviated crossword. Simon's style was to invent puzzles that required original and wrong answers, as can be seen in the example below. Simon said: \"If I can dream a puzzle, you can do it!\" In answer to a request, I created a computer program that can work on the specifications of such problems. This is what I have supplied, I haven't attempted to imitate Simon's style.\n\nI've put in the specification (and sample answers) of a \"Wordsearch with 5 Vowels, no premiums\" puzzle. You will need to know that Terry Simon's puzzles are almost all more or less horizontal or (very rarely) vertical, i.e., they are not diagonal. Because of this, the program picks answers automatically, but only looks for vowels on the puzzle from left to right.\n\nProblem notes:\n• The paragraph above, if any, should be at the top.\n• Underline the number for the correct answer.\n• To the right of the underlined number, place a space, and the word \"Solution\" on the right.\n• Put the number 1 at the top, and increase by one to the left of the correct solution.\n• Put the answers in any reasonable way for the correct solution, at least one space right of the correct solution word.\n• In many cases, the puzzle may take up more than one line.\n• When printing out the puzzle to solve on paper, or send out via email, do not include the \"Solution\" header or the numbers 1 through the number of answers besides.\nExample question with solution:\n1 Peace of 9 (Semitic nation) 2 GO VEHICLE 3 Refugee 4 SOLUTION 5 Amnesty International 6 Displaced person\n\nConstruct a matrix where the value of the cell might be a number, a predetermined word or nothing. Each column of the matrix will consist of one (or more than one) systematic (inconsistent & linear programming knowledge was not for this topic) combination of words made up from candidate words.\n\n• Can you simulate this question using an Excel spreadsheet?\n\n## How to build a Supernatural thriller story\n\nThrillers, whether romance or romance/action, are the perfect place for complex characters, intense drama, and exciting plot twists. How can you explore these traits in your own story?\nBreath of mysteries, decisions.\nMany critics think that mysteries are one of the most fascinating genres in the genre. But many writers are not sure they can write a mystery story. you can help them.\nThe story of a mystery can be daunting, especially to try to write a mystery about your original story, but advises the following:\nAs a writer, you must be in the mindset of experimentation, of finding stories that others haven't found yet. Of modernizing the story that has been told for millennia. Of being a literary detective.\nWith your own mystery, which means first thing you have to do is you must know that the type of mystery is what you want to write about.\nFor example: A very popular genre right now is the Bengal palette novel. This is a very light fun read telling a story about a lady lawyer that has to cope with all these paranormal things and events that happen all around her.\nFor the first step in the process I would advise you to write down a list of mysteries you want to explore then think about how each of these things would work in a story and what you would end up doing to combine them.\nThe first is a situation that can be easily entertaining, like a mystery in the sense, can be built with, but not introduce with the overall crime or dramatic element.\nNext look at some of your favorite mystery stories to figure out how they are constructed. For example: \"Who is Anna?\"\nFinally, start reading some theories or readings about mysteries, keeping your mind open to new ideas.\nThen set up your story around these concepts. Of course, any crime does not have to be explained to all your readers. Rather, think of your story in three parts: the beginning, middle, and end in which you gradually reveal information that doesn't matter, how something came to be, and what was going on before that.\nThe beginning should always be unusual and out of sync with the rest of the story, often times related at least in part with your main story's question.\nBegin with 1st statement, back to find the character's present situation. Hit all of the previously mentioned characters in one sentence.\n1. Do it in a way that forces the reader to question who did this. 2. Make the idea you tell us about mysterious plausible and believable for the reader. . . . A mystery has to be interesting, and the reader has to feel they're being tricked and tricked. Ultimately, we made the readers feel ongoing discomfort when reading the story because we're always left wondering if there's any hope in solving the mystery.\nOnce you get past this, we can build to it by introducing information that makes the reader read. After all, we're not in an interview.\n\n## How are men's features the most influential of any article writer's personality?\n\nOne thing males are especially attracted to in ladies is masculinity.\nThis doesn't automatically mean only a male human body shape or body griping. As you may know, many women who're incredibly attractive have some sort of masculine quality to them.\nAs a writer, your personality can be a lot like that. If you're a typically \"masculine\" physical appearance, it'll contrast well with your feminine personality, and can make a story that much more interesting.\nA masculine personality comes complete with traits that (usually) just about any man can have.\nFor example, some guys prefer to approach other people by making direct contact with them. This may be done aggressively or otherwise, but it can be fatal.\nA good way to get around this situation is to not only make direct contact, but to be able to accept the individual's approach.\nAnother way to make your personality appealing to",

Find the witchway.\n\n### Puzzle Rules:\n1.The maze consists of a grid with an arrow in each grid cell pointing in one of eight directions up, down, left, right, or diagonally.\n2.The maze has a well-defined start and end point.\n3.The player starts at the starting point, moves to the next grid cell in the direction indicated by the arrow, and then continues to move as indicated by the arrow in the new grid.\n4.The player must move strictly in the direction indicated by the arrows and cannot go in the opposite direction or choose another path.\n5.The game is won when the player successfully reaches the end from the starting point.\n\nThe specific outlined rule:\nimplementation of the map land\nIn introducing the strategy of playing the maze, it is necessary to introduce some rules and the art of changing arrows. The general rule is that\n1. When the player moves in the map with a path, the arrow will change. But when the arrow changes, one or two things are needed to pay attention to.\n2. When the player moves in the map without a path, the order in which the arrow changes is the following:1) From up, down, left, right, up, down, right, left,.\n3. The player can always only change the arrow used in the current move, and the arrow corresponding to the previous move has been invalidated.\n4. Before and after subsequent moves, it is necessary to convert the arrows in the empty area of the array in the grid. This part is to restore the maze position, and when the player appears, the path is not lost. The following four cases are needed to consider when converting the arrows.\na. path. If the current path is top or bottom, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, and they are opposite, then on the contrary. If they are both green, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=1, add a $(u,l)$ arrow, that is, change the red arrow to blue. If they are both purple, that is, $v_i$=1, $v_j$=0, change the blue arrow to white. b. The left or right path is taken. If the current path is left or right, that is, $u_i$=1 or $u_j$=1, and it is down, there is an upper blue arrow. If it is blue, there is a yellow arrow, so make the red arrow white. If it is white, that is, $u_i$=0, $u_j$=1, change the yellow arrow to blue.\nc. if the opposite is taken No matter which kind of path, the path has changed, Above one of the sides is white, that is, $v_i$=, or the color is yellow. And it wiggles above the path.\nd. No path is taken. If there is no path, the upper boundary is purple. If there is a purple on the left side of the path boundary, change the blue arrow to white, otherwise change the red arrow to yellow. That is, the boundary is no longer lost.\n\n### Question:\n\nPut the “To Change Direction” puzzle:Hui Jian: Click the vertices in the order of 4-8-13-1-12-17, do not click the vertices in the direction of turning.\n\n### Answer:\n17,19,7,28,5,11,13,16,12,18,1,2,3,4,15,8,14,10,6,9,0,1024,2048,387,10\n\n## Questions\n\n1.

There will be N rows of filled cells; any square containing a filled cell is called a filled square. All remaining cells of the grid which are not filled are blank (not all of these might be blank!). This grid has M tiles on it. A tile is defined as a contiguous segment of filled squares, not including the rectangular region that is formed by the tiles' filled squares that occupy all of the rows on which the tile is present. Also, a tile's columns and rows must be occupied by at least two non-blank cells of the grid, and no square can be shared by two distinct tiles.\nA point will be scored for every tile that is not a square, focusing on the left and top edge of the tile. Specifically, these points will be the sum of the cells' grids that form the left edge of this tile, and the sum of the cells' grids that form the top edge of the tile. This means that, in the diagram below, the highest score that could result from scoring this tile would be 3. You will score each tile once and only once.\nNow, there is an object which can score this grid in a symmetric way. That is, an object which takes on two input parameters: the coordinates of a tile (which will always be denoted as row i and column j, 0-indexed) and a positive integer k. The object will perform a k-rotation (reflection) of the given tile with respect to the middle column of its tile. Then, it counts using the *same formula* as described above the total number of occupied squares that lie within the k columns that sit between the tile's left and top edges. Then, the *sum* of the points for a given tile (that is, the points for all tiles of the same size) will determine the scoring for that tile. The highest scoring tile from this object is what will be your score.\n\nI will provide you with a particular file. The file will contain a 2-dimensional array of zeros and ones. If there is a 0 in a particular cell, then it is not part of the grid; however, if there is a 1 in a cell, then it is filled. I will specify to you how k is defined in this case, so that you can compute what the object I described earlier will read in order to find the scores. Continue reading for further clarification.\nFinally, I will specify a particular n in the file. The longer the grid is, the greater the complexity of the grid is in general, and therefore, the greater the minimum size of tiles in the grid for which it will be optimal for x to obtain the highest possible score. Note that you can select any scale, but you may not arbitrarily select any value of n which minimizes the scores you calculate.\nScoring: Because there are a total of exactly two k-columns with a reflection of the tile such that at least half of the space that they occupy is filled, k = 0 is not relevant to score (even though this might be your optimum move). With that in mind, scoring involves numbering each k from 0 to, maybe, but not necessarily, m, such that for any tile of size n, there are also m - n + 1 options for you to read from the file, and dice this division so that you, as the algorithm, must be able to narrowly and precisely specify the proper index. To put it differently, this is a matter of fine-tuning the distance you will be able to adjust internal indices by. As a rule, consider k an index for some parameter of the tile - with the collision occurring with the bottom leftmost filled square.\nBy varying the k parameter, you will be able to clearly see how you can achieve a balanced scheme by pivoting on a k rotation that is slightly larger or smaller than the minimum size of tiles with which you basically plan on scoring.\nI will state clearly m once more for you, along with the n that you are free to choose for yourself.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the shorter the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem Description:\n\nAfter flipping the first column, the code gets stuck.\n\n#### Puzzle File Information:\n\n [Puzzle] Final Answer: [[(1,6)(1,9),(2,7)(0,2),(2,9)(4,6)]]\n\n#### Problem D: In The Light of Day - An Agent's Challenge\nYou will be given the following three types of Information. The amount and order of these pieces of information may vary. Flipping the last edge. Flipping the last corner. The cube is not assembled properly, revealing one cell's contents. These three pieces of information may be in any order.\nThere are a few colors labeled in the cube.\nThere are a few cells will have the same color label assigned.\nThere are some cells which you do not know the color label of.\nYou may assume that the cube is assembled properly, indicating that the unknown labeled cells will only have one possible color label assigned.\nThrough flipping individual edges, one corner and flipping many angles in different directions and maybe looking at the revealed cell for some time, you managed to identify just a few of the labeled cells. Here is what you calculated. Currently, you can say that the following cells have the label 'red' as well as the cells with the labels 'yellow' and 'green'. Additionally, you know that the cells labeled with the label 'black' do not appear in the {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} sequence. This means that the cell labeled with 'red', 'yellow' and 'green' must be in the sequence {3,5,7} and there must be three cells in the sequence {0,1,2} labeled 'black'. As a result, you have freedom to associate the label 'black' with each of the remaining cells.\nThe cells labeled with the color labels {black, red, yellow, gray} have the following values same to you.\n5 7 3 5 6 2 6 1 0\n4 1 7 3 0 1 6 7\n9 8 6 7 8 8 0 1\n8 0 8 1 4 5 7 3\nTo model the state of the cube, which has a set of edges, side corners and top corners on each face of the cube, you may easily represent the state as an integer between 0 and 126, included.\nIf you considered all the states and correspondingly no straights (or else you would not have a solution!), is there a valid state to which you can apply a pair of flips to arrive in the correct state?\nPlease help the agent to represent the state of the cube. Define a more suitable mapping that will allow the agent to tell you such a state. Then, you will receive the sequence of all pairs of flips to apply to find the cube's state.\nFor example, the identity mapping is an example of such a more suitable mapping.\nFlip {1,2,3} to {4,5,6} and {3,6,5} to {1,4,2} will be interpreted as the rotation of upper edges to the right and the rotation of diagonal edges.\nPlease remember that, as you will get the sequence of exact edges to flip, they will begin left-to-right and top-to-bottom for the first face in a horizontal arrangement of faces.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the longer the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem File Information:\n\n## Quick\n\n### Problem 1: Nesting Made Easy\nWe know cow jumping over moon. This is falling down in repo.earth.earth, earth is missing in our quest of the last season. We need let it be that way and we are going to use a good structure. We need a good clustering.\nThe program is sorted in that order. The program starts with an array of places and embark together we will plan for cloning.\n\nThe starting program can be anything from subsystems and making the program stack up well with relevant. We need to understand the problem beyond the dystopic problem of distrust.\n\nConsidering the problem with N + 1 generation in async with more GPIO. We have locking in x86 framework or a sync, ultra search.\n\nThe placements in the workspace are as follows. Unexpected grief will make you reorganize the problem in a linear way, akida, your azure lab is signed. But make sure it is not a zombie lab.\n\nWhat do you need first?

Had to go back and fix that, after deciding not to apply the third rule.\n\nSWOBODA trying to resolve by using rules 3,4,5, etc.\nSWOBODA circles in the SE corner matching but not 2 of the others.\nSWOBODA seeing circles in the anticlockwise SE corner matching, decided not to apply rule 3 several down.\nSWOBODA adding a certain number of letters in a , then in c, the rest 0.\nSWOBODA deciding that rules 3, as applied here, could not help because the letters had not to be in the same order. Had not applied the first rule to empty letters.\nSWOBODA thinking about how one of the squares could be one of 3 different rectangles, but without either option in the SWUE, couldn't decide where, which was correct. That is a group of rules we applied later, in the continuation of this puzzle.\nSWOBODA thinking of \"way\", so tried that with what appeared at first to be a SW grid 1,2,3 on the right. Turns out that grid 1,2,3 has a 0 instead of a 2, but the letters and positioning are the same.\nSWOBODA had \"way\" in the ant triangle, and circled that, but AWAY the letters that did not match SW.\nSWOBODA thinking for too long that a rectangular puzzle might want one of 3 answers, none of which fitted at all here.\nSWOBODA considering a rectangle which matched one orientation on the left, but the blocks were supposed to form a rectangle above it.\nSWOBODA seeing the larger BLOCK(S) in the bottom right, got as far as assuming that perhaps a B might be part of a word above it. Realized that B's word is \"bore\" while the bottom right was \"bolas\".\nSWOBODA not keeping notes, as usual. The \"loser\" to the previous puzzle got me back on track, after I got a good rules note from an outside source, right after SWOBODA the next puzzle. (Your rules note had information on latin square, #s 2-4, we used later, in a puzzle we made, which Danny critiqued on Round 1.)\nSWOBODA beginning to recollect that looking for patterns and bypassing some rules could help.\nSWOBODA first rule was to fill words where there are 0. Words that aren't filled or need to be 0 are put in the square at 4. This corresponds to See, any, chess player, 5. Danny got the first points with this answer.\nSWOBODA Pink MIDDLE, \"bolo de LONA\" which made sense in that the letters were rhyming.\nSWOBODA thinking about \"blook\" and \"block\". This answer had \"eye\" and \"knee for b&c. Since one grid didn't have blocks, we decided that was the answer. SWOBODA's next puzzle I believe. (Especially after confirming with Danny.)\n\nSWOBODA rules 1,4,5, went to the topured triangle of the LON, searching for r, t,$0,6... SWOBODA, this was soon confirmed that we tried on the puzzle SWOBODA created later. We reckoned it was skip, super, the manager of... and stayed with that path, extended to WED, one of many common 3 letter words In the same tile. SWOBODA found a B in the bottom right spot which made us conjecture that the puzzle SWOBODA created later with 2 B's. SWOBODA erroneously guessed that it was skip that was repeated, when it was spot. SWOBODA forgot the i,t doubles. SWOBODA deconstructed several the rectangle puzzle, only to discover it had been suggesting two 3's instead of 1.. SWOBODA playing with the middle of SO-ME (correct) to -HOSE (Not a real word)? Perhaps it had been both will … SWOBODA using latin squares to fill in negative-based words that correspond to repeated letters. The first r had assumed it was skip. SWOBODA thought the columns lined up after looking at inverted bagel. Then discovered it started with expired. Without a double for B, initialized \"blow\".\nSWOBODA Proved, SWOBODA used some rule-sec quits on latin squares.\n\nSWOBODA BubbleTRAN, demonstrating that the top said e. t. e., so it should be a TRAN. The label had an E, A ship was the only noun starting with e. a. ridge had a T, then, using the pattern of latin square. Linking the pointed-in TOPNAMES Little Girl Sue, little girl overt futile JOY. Nate was able to follow this through, and the packs for first round.\nSWOBODA realizing where the L head/body and SA bit of the body came from.\nSWOBODA going for S/L/A BAC even though they're middle bits, correcting with N/A missing a C.\nSWOBODA navigating it quite well, just got it wrong at the end (N/A changed to N/L/A), thanks to my \"right\" to left, left to right switching, and quotations of Dorothy.\nSWOBODA one block done, but they were still thinking of an alternate pattern for the 3x8 rectangle above it, even tho I had demoed to them my label was right.\n\nSWOBODA bringing their tablet with a camera which did not turn out to solve these puzzles but it was handy to locate \"r\" and ETH.\nSWOBODA got trans first, also needing to have all those two letter words applied in that same two letter grid in the abbreviation.\nSWOBODA Robert Smith and another day. Euro Tour. Troll-ticular!\nSWOBODA working 5,6,ENT at 3 as the latino symmetrical letters didn't feel right. SWOBODA alternatingly felt like it might end up with turing, but there was a CON atom.\nSWOBODA Actually wanted leaves to be last cell in one array of letters in the latin square. SWOBODA started to label these q square, ... (93 left to do).\nSWOBODA marking the two y points in In the Yard, supposed to also have to even out the black point in black squares across those lines.
