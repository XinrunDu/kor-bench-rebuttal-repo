The correct pattern of the disjunctive normal form follows the rules: it is the principal conjunctive normal form, and whenever the disjunctive normal form includes a pair of the propositional variables or their negations, or all even replacements, it is a basic formula. For simple atomic formula, 3 pairs of substitutions and both a basic and an all-even formula are possible, but the context suggests that one of these pairings must be of the form p∧q.

I used to stick to painting - This is not a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the reasoning equation only considers two possible results (using Park's \"Ways of Possibility\" deduction principle), without clearly specifying whose actions these are. Reasoning Equation 21 only uses the \"True or False\" scenario (Fp -> F¬p) and might need to be adjusted to account for both alternatives. \n\nB. I keep on painting - This is a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the decision to paint is consistent with these two possible actions (\"daily work\" and \"extreme creativity\"). Both are valid, hence B is the correct answer. \n\nC. I will start painting tomorrow - This is not a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the \"reasoning equation\" itself confuses the statement \"I will always keep on painting\" - that is, the impossibility of an impossible decision - with a start date. Reasoning Equation 21 recognizes that an act is determined by its possible consequences, but the role of the artist in painting cannot be isolated from the task of painting itself. Therefore, this statement logically implies a downward movement in the decision process, which is not captured by Reasoning Equation 21.\n\nD. I will keep on painting - This is a most correct deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because it neatly integrates the acts of using a mundane painter's work and the conceptual notion that painting is an act that can result in lean figures (seen as people or objects). Despite the implication of remaining on painting (D) in Reasoning Equation 21, it is more accurate than the scattered meanings mentioned earlier.",
