Looking at the given string 'SG', it is found to be 'Z', so the position that 'C' should go is in the position with the letter 'Z', which is at position 18.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[#]\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nEncryption:\n- The object ```plaintext``` with the characters ```*```, ```@```, ```!``` and ```^^``` has a length of ```9``` bytes in ASCII representation.\n\nYou are given the encrypted table ```encryption\\_table```.\nYou are also given the ciphertext ``plaintext``.\n\n1. Encrypt the actual plaintext using the encryption table ```encryption\\_table```. The output should be interpreted and represented accordingly.\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext using a suitable method like the one you provided earlier.\nTo encrypt the plaintext \"H\" using the provided encryption table, the steps would be similar to the inverse of Caesar cipher.\nThe Caesar cipher transforms an input character by shifting it 'n' places forward in the alphabet, where 'n' ranges from 1 to 2 ** 12-1 = 15. However, for calculating n, since we are working with ASCII representation, we can use an integer number approach where we can shift each character in the alphabet a '15' number of positions forward in the alphabet, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n1. The plaintext character \"H\" will be converted to uppercase, as uppercase and lowercase of character are interchangeable, so the transformed character should be uppercase \"H\".\n2. Negative shift of characters 3 ('4') and 13 ('5') have been taken care during converting characters to uppercase into arabic alphabet. Here is the step by step calculation:\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 3: \n- The number 3 is divided by 26 and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 1.\n- This means that the character will be shifted to the right 1 place in the alphabet.\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 13:\n- The number 13 is divided by 26 the result is rounded down to the nearest integer that gives us 2 (and not 1) and converted to uppercase ('A').\n3. Writing these steps in the correct format of a tabular expression where each row will represent a character from ascii and ```<=``` will represent the lowercase character and ```>=``` will represent the time based form of the character. As you can see the decrypted string will look like this:\n\n```\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!<XW>\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!><W>!\n\n```\n\n4. Here is a specific solution using Python:\n```python\nimport optparse\n\ndef encrypt_data(plaintext):\n    encryption_table = {\n        'A': '!', 'B': '@', 'C': '#', 'D': '$',\n        'E': '%', 'F': '^', 'G': '&', 'H': '*',\n        'I': '(', 'J': ')', 'K': '_', 'L': '+',\n        'M': '=', 'N': '~', 'O': '?', 'P': '/',\n        'Q': '0', 'R': ':', 'S': ';', 'T': '<',\n        'U': '>', 'V': '1', 'W': '2', 'X': '3',\n        'Y': '4', 'Z': '5'\n    }\n    encrypted_cipher = ''\n    for char in plaintext:\n        if char == 'A': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['A']  # Encrypt -> \"A\"\n        if char == 'X': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['X']  # Encrypt -> \"X\"\n\n        if char == 'Y': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Y']  # Encrypt -> \"Y\"\n        if char == 'Z': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Z']  # Encrypt -> \"Z\"\n        if char == 'W': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['W']  # Encrypt -> \"W\"\n        if char == 'U': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['U']  # Encrypt -> \"U\"\n\n        if ord(char) not in encryption_table.values():  # If the encoded character is already present in the table\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table[ord(char)]\n        else:  # Otherwise encrypt the character by shifting all the specified ASCII \"special\" letters, '&' followed by 3 letters\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['^']  # Encrypt -> \"^\"\n\n\n    return encrypted_cipher\n\n# Usage\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\nparser.add_option (\"-n\", \"--plaintext\", type = \"string\", action = \"store\", dest = \"plaintext\", help = \"Enter the encrypted string, Default value is empty\")\n(options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n\nif len(args) == 1:\n    print(encrypt_data(options.plaintext))\nelse:\n    print(\"Please enter a valid plaintext string, \" + str(args[1]))\n```\n\n**Output: encrypt\\_data(*) returns the encrypted string, \"EaXL....dE\"**",

The input is the plaintext string and the ciphertext string which are to be decrypted.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nPolybius Square is used to encrypt a plaintext string. Given an input \"P\", the first step of the encryption process is to find the number represented by 'p' in the polybius square. Based on this, we found out that for 'O' in polybius square, the value of 'p' is 66\n\nThen, based on this value of 'p', we record the rows and columns denoted by 'CRCC' in the polybius square grid.   \n\nFor example, for '34', in the Polybius Square, we have '21', '27', '53', '89', which means, rows are 21-7, 27-8, 53-9, 89-0. Then we start analyzing the rows and columns according to 'CRCC'.\n\nFor '34', we got the values as (27-0), (53-8), (89-9) which represents the value for P in Polybius Square.  \n\nBased on this, we can conclude 'P' is replaced with 'O'. 'O' is represented by (053-9).\n\nThen, the next step is to examine the columns in polybius square isolating the row 1 is represented by '0' (leftmost column), then the '11' represents 'P' in polybius square and all other rows can be written in similar way. So 'P' is replaced with 'O'. \"O\" is represented by (05369).\n\nAt last, based on 'CRCC' calculation, we can find that for '5369', which represents the second quarter part of the Polybius Square, 'U' is the so chosen for 'O'. We have found that 'O' occupies multiple rows and multiple columns in the Polybius Square. Therefore, it is changed to chosen character number, 'U' is template character from the rows part of polybius square.\n\nThe last step is to unpack the encrypted data into a list of integers called 'array'. Similarly, the actual decryption done is done similarly to encrypted data and the decryption result is 'array'.\n\nTherefore the decrypted data will be:\n\n[[34]]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is given by the zero-based decimal number which is three for 'UO'. The format of output should be [[encrypted answer]] to represent the decrypted data in formal format featuring at least the first element as encrypted data.\n\nUrmi's Answer:\n\n```python\nnewstring = \"34\"  # Convert the String to string\npolybius_square = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\nUPPERLITER = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\nUPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\nUPPERCIRCLE = [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0, 6]\n}\n\n(key, value) = polybius_square  # Initialize the polybius_square and decrypt array\n\nfor i in range(0, len(newstring), 2):\n    key[i] = polybius_square[newstring[i], newstring[i+1] - 1]  # replace the characters in polybius_square\n\narray = list(map(lambda x: key[x], value))\n\nprint(array[0])\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```less\n34```\n\n### QUESTION:\n\nWhy does answer  UO gives the decrypted string [34] ? `UPPERCIRCLE = [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0, 6]` instead of just `UPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` ? The answer gives 34 in the JSON response from **https://github.com/urumiya/crypt**\n\n>\nCan you get the answer from the JSON response? If not, it says that the query returns a list of characters, not a key-value pair. Can you give me the [JSON '[[]\"Uo(\".\",\"(.).\")(.\\.)|\\)]'] [/json](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37773668/changing-the-data-model-or-output-from-pangram) ??\n\nUrmi's Answer:\n\nFor UO, number O appears twice in the Polybius Square (UPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), so it gets replaced as repeated again than once in Polybius Square. The correct format is [[[\"Uo.\", \"(.).\"]\n                                ()]\n                         Measurement of Sentence]] instead of [[{\"Uo.</p>: <p>Measurement\" (U). \"),\n                                     (\"[ \")\n                                     ]\n                                       logical field\"/>()\"].\n\n\n> Urmi's Ans:\n\nThis is Uo.</p> [Measurement())) [6],\nThis is>`[ +](\nTo remain with this answer form [[[\"Would functioning, notably is\"\"\"\n```\n\n>\n\nTruth be told, In the JSON JSON_DATA there is the **\" corrected answer** 34 at index \\ - the corrected answer`. Is it possible to receive the corrected result and change it in the JSON file?\nIf you go by your question of [Urumi's Ans](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37773668/changing-the-data-model-or-output-from-pangram), then you want to do a `\\` (\\`), since when you're working with strings, you can't overwrite characters, which assumes you mean that `(\\$)` (\\) is not allowed currently\n\nFor the user's context, instead of `]()` the user would like to pass the `STRING` object (which does not exist in this case but is okay to pass) as per the requirements. The corrected answer would look like this:\n\n> [`[$\"`\"`) [Measurement))([]`\nDue to the bug perhaps in a template, when the user is insedated with hardcoded `[$\"`\"`) [Measurement)``, it appears that you break a string literal.\n\n> Urmi's Ans:\n\nFirst task is to understand the problem. Sorry, I have not been able to find a TongueTwister installation that executes Unicode UTF-8. Would you like me to analyze your JSON data and help correct it?\n\n\nUrmi's Ans:\n\nThe best way to do it would be to generate the JSON string with Unicode (non UTF-8) placeholders. Then perform join (or concatenation + replace, depending on the encoded characters) of the quoted string into the correct format.\n\nSuppose our CharSequence is Uo.</p> [Measurement())) [6],\nFollowing the JSOND translation rules should portray in encoded string format:\n\n- `Uo.</p>` => `\"[]``\n- `()` => `\\\"\\(\"`\n- `\"Measurement\")` => `\"[]\"`\n- `)` => `\"\"\"`\n- `[Measurement)` => `\"[]`\n\nHere is the code in Python for passing `\\` inside chars (`\"` to `\"}`, `` to `\"[]\"\"`, carriage return `(>` to `,`), point (`>` to `.\"`, `\\)` to `(\"`, \\` to `)` etc. First, we generate `[]\"` with `%` characters to sequentially append Unicode and subsequent risk of `')'` character appearing repeatedly within the encoded string.\n\nYou might achieve this without generating the JSON, but it just gives a larger amount, thus takes more computational time and physically. Even for Unicode UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings, this process of `u\"\"[\"\"][(\"\"][(`]\")` is comparable to √3 log₂(3) second same pouring way.",

Let's proceed with an encrypted answer:\n\n[encrypted answer] (plaintext: \"V\")\n\nThe encrypted answer is [R](plaintext: \"V\" + \"-C\") (or vice versa in any case). This answer is slightly different from the plaintext because swapping \"V\" to \"R\" is the equivalent of changing \"Valley\" to \"Row\".\n\nThe decrypted answer is also different because of the terminology: \"Just like in the encrypted answer, '-COLATOCHY' and '-MTOOLSCHY'\" in only one case are appearing in the right-format format.\n\nAh! I see your point. Let me rephrase that: \"(plaintext: \"V\" OR (-COLATTOCHY) IN,, KEWORD: -COLATOCHY\" OR \"-MTOOLSCHY\") AND (sENSE: Z)\" (\"plaintext: \"V\", KEWORD: -COLATOCHY\" OR \"-MTOOLSCHY\") AND (SENSE: Z)\"](plaintext: \"V\" OR (-COLATTOCHY) IN,, KEWORD: -COLATOCHY\" OR \"-MTOOLSCHY\"))",

A decrypted message is a linear sequence of Latin letters like \"ADNTUOR\" would become \"OUGTHNK_UOR\", if the order of the repeating letters was reversed in the message\", he says.  \"The creases produced by replacing a letter with another lower-valued letter in the message are a meaningful step in a ciphertext decryption process,\" he says.\" The second step in the decryption is to use the repeated character in the plaintext to produce a new (encrypted) result, similar to the way that each divider of a favorite childhood favorite package gives a variable bit in its decryption process\".

However, there are some technical details that may need to be clarified. \n\nFirst, you have mentioned that you may be making some limited assumptions in certain cases that cannot be fully accounted for by the rules or protocols. You are suggesting that the threshold values are reasonable to keep in mind and can be utilized in certain situations. This may necessitate more careful validation, but it is important to keep in mind that even small variations in the threshold values can lead to very different results.\n\nSecond, you have mentioned that you may want to name the relevant properties and objects, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext, in the formatting of your cipher, ensuring clarity and readability. It is important to make sure that the objects and their values are defined correctly for the specific use case being described.\n\nAdditionally, you have mentioned that you would prefer to provide both plaintext and ciphertext, encapsulated in double square brackets. It is important to also consider the potential scenarios where only one of these may be insufficient or incomplete. \n\nIn the scenario, where you indicated that you are interested only in the ciphertext, you are clearly on the right track. But, if you have another use case where you want the plaintext and ciphertext to be provided together in double square brackets, you would have to considerome environment and implementation details to suit your requirements.",

Just to clarify, the decryption rule you're asking about seems to be missing some details and instances that depend on a weaker rule than the one we're focusing on. In order to help with that, I'll provide a list of the keys we'll be using.\n\nRULE: Encryption\n\n1. In this rule, specify the initial (plaintext) string.\n2. Given a key, generate ciphertext of that string.\n3.(Optionally) parse the output to see what the \\* character stands for.\n            \nCOUNT-SLASH-MACRO:\n    \"ANSWER\": [ '_', 'HTTP?' ]\n\nRULE: Decryption\n\n1. Input the ciphertext as string y.\n2. Convert string y to character array to easily manipulate following steps.\n3. Parse the character array to figure out what to do.\n4. Based on what we know about encrypted symbols, switch to the phrase \"ANSWER\" or \"ANSWER:\".\n4. Alternatively, you can use CASE-INCLUSIVE.\n5. (OPTIONAL)\n    Exclude the sign \\* from the answer variable(y when y is not (E.g., \"WELCOME\" and \"DARKLY:\")).\n\nNote:\nAND: We use 'stackoverflow.com' instead of 'stackoverflow.'\n- `identifier: 5`\n- `amount: 666`\n\nFor example:\nhttps://habr.com/ru/blog/228603/\n\nSo, you'd parse the following text:\n`http://stackoverflow.com/project/browse/topics/computer-issues`\nand it would output a list of negative symbols, such as `/`, `d`, `ic`, etc.\n\n Tips:\n     Using uppercase letters is not recommended if you want exact ASCII values because they roll your long-term and short-term memory.\n     If you need any help please let me know, I can add more pieces of information when needed!\n     Also you could add space between words instead of pipe and in case you need subscriptions purchase them, if you pay as 3 to 5 USD the price might be very different from the one mentioned in the input.
