For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[X]]  (Decryption of \"3=\" gives \"WX\" with the given cipher table, but because of the way the table is defined, \"X\" is at symbol position 3 and \"W\" at \"=\". So, \"X\" is the first decrypted character.)\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"W\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[3]]=[[0]]   (Encryption of \"W\" gives \"X\" which is at symbol position 3 and encrypts to \"0\", hence the answer is represented as [[0]] since it's a symbol not an uppercase letter.)",

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[OAPALU]]\n\nBelow is an explanation of the cipher operations you need to perform for both encryption and decryption:\n\n1. **Encryption Steps (for the \"Plaintext\" question):**\n   - For each plaintext character `p`:\n     - If `p` is an uppercase letter and exists in the Polybius square:\n       - Replace `p` with the number of rows and columns (both counted from 1) in which the character appears.\n     - In particular, O, which does not exist in the Polybius square, is replaced by 66.\n   - This is equivalent to looking up the character in the Polybius square and replacing it with its corresponding code. For example, \"R\" in the Polybius square is replaced with '11', \"W\" is replaced with '22', and \"Q\" is replaced with '43'.\n   - If `p` is not in the Polybius square, it should be replaced with 66. This is done because \"O\" is not in the square. Therefore, \"O\" in the plaintext will be replaced with '66' in the ciphertext.\n   - As for the special case of \"N\", which is in the Polybius square, it will be replaced by '51' in the ciphertext.\n\nExample: Plaintext is \"North\". The corresponding ciphertext will be: \"14325234345343415553451425134314243243343115142\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps (for the \"Ciphertext\" question):**\n   - For each of the two numbers CrCc in the given ciphertext:\n     - Based on the rows and columns denoted by CrCc, find the corresponding letters in the Polybius square grid.\n     - If CrCc=66, replace with \"O\". This means that any occurrence of \"66\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"O\" in the plaintext.\n   - This is the reverse operation of encryption. In other words, you need to look up the corresponding character in the Polybius square for each pair of numbers and construct the plaintext.\n\nExample: Ciphertext is \"36634441131153143612\". The corresponding plaintext is \"OAPALU\".",

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string with letters and punctuation in uppercase.\n    - Keyword: A string with letters in uppercase without spaces and punctuation.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n    - Every two occurrences of the plaintext characters X,Y,Z are converted into \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext.\n- Preparation:\n    - Just characters.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Bounds check keyword to ensure the length is bigger than 1\n    - Pad keyword with keyword\n    - For each character in the plaintext, iterate through chars of keyword.\n    - If the keyword chars match a dash note it with them.\n    - If there is a match in leaving the matching character in, except the 2nd time, when you save to the KentonRings[\"Z\"].\n    - If a group of X,Y,Z is used ignore if saved.\n        - otherwise add X,Y,Z to ans. Then add the originally replaced letter.\n    - if you have a group of X,Y,Z and saved most have happened done \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string.\n    - Keyword: A string.\n    - Every two occurrences of \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext are converted into X,Y,Z in the plaintext.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string.\n    - Check if keyword contains uppercase letters, if not, return an error message. They must contain uppercase letters.\n- Preparation:\n    - Just characters.\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, iterate through chars of keyword.\n        - If the keyword chars match a dash note it with them.\n    - If there is a match, make sure you have not saved this already. However, take note of which characters were not used to form your CurrentFlag, and which characters were used to form them, and check for their duplicates.\n    - use CurrentFlag to update result as the 1st match if applicable.\n    - if not, then you have a group of X,Y,Z and saved most have happened, so break through the iteration and \"2X\", \"2Y\", or \"2Z\" in the ciphertext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: hello?\nKeyword: abcABCexampleABCDECHaHa\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[N A t ! k s q { L M! { U }}]]\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n- Preparation:\n    - Every time you come across a unique character in the plaintext, append it (1 index higher) to ciphertext. However, if a character has one of its previous occurences in the plaintext, append it to the ciphertext an additional 1 index higher. By this I am referring to x you have found it at index a then u have found it at ind ab then because ya already have it at index a ya need index ac for it, to signify to the reader about what matches what.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to encryptedKeyword which is the keyword 1 index higher than the original keyword.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Iterate through Plaintext (Pt), for each unique character}\n        - Save those indices into Indices.\n        - Replace it with the encryptedVersion of it.\n        - Check if encryptedVersion index is 0 if yes, increment it.\n        - merge index and character into the encrypted keyword\n        - append it to cipher text\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Keyword: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - The keyword must be 1 index lower than the encryptedKeyword.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to plainKeyword which is the keyword 1 index lower than that given keyword.\n    - Rename variables (applying the same logic) to indices which are the indices dictionary of the characters in the encrypted keyword.\n    - If the keyword contains a character lower than A, return an error message.\n\n    For each character in the ciphertext:\n    - find it and apply to indices.\n    - break it apart to character and index.\n    - Subtract the index and every time the index goes down by 2 substitute it with the remembered plainKeyword.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: SUPPRESS\nKeyword: oOoOooo\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - Each repeated character in plaintext is encoded once, with alternating shifts of plaintext characters.\n- Preparation:\n    - Preserve the order of plaintext when making ciphertext.\n    - In the current key mod A, if its even then the GetCharacter(doneSoFar) else GetCharacter(doneSoFar)+1(mod A).\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string of uppercase letters.\n    - The keyword should be the same as the encryption keyword.\n    - Preserve the order of plaintext when making ciphertext.\n    - If the keyword contains a character lower than A, return an error message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: RIGA\nKeyword: ALLOULD\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

We first prepare the transposed sequence list:\n\n```\n[1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n```\n\nWe write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 words per line.
