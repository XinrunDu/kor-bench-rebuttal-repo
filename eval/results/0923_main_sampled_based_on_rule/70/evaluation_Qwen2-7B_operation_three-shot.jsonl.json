Given that (X♂4)♀5 = 69, find X.\n\nGiven the rule \"a♀b=(a+b)/2\" and \"a♂b=a×b\", let's solve the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the inner operation: (X♂4)\nX♂4 = X * 4\n\nThen, calculate the operation on the outer part: ((X*4)♀5)\nSince a♀b is defined as (a+b)/2, we can substitute X inside the brackets to find the result:\n((X*4)♀5) = ((X*4)+5)/2\n\nWe are given that ((X*4)♀5) = 69, so we can set up the equation:\n((X*4)+5)/2 = 69\n\nWe can solve this equation for X:\nX*4 + 5 = 138 (Multiply both sides by 2)\nX*4 = 133 (Subtract 5 from both sides)\nX = 133/4 (Divide both sides by 4)\n\nSolve this derivation.",

Since \\(2^{3}=8\\), this gives us $\\log_{2}{8}=3$. Next, for $\\log_{8}{2}$, we find the number we raise 8 to in order to get 2. Because $8^{\\frac{1}{3}}=2$, this gives us $\\log_{8}{2}=\\frac{1}{3}$. \n\nAdding these together, we get $3+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{10}{3}$.\n\nFor Example 2:\n\n\\[ 4￠9=\\log_{9}{4}+\\log_{4}{9} \\]\n\nTo find $\\log_{9}{4}$, we need to find the number we raise 9 to in order to get 4. However, 9 to the power of 2 equals 81, not 4. Since such a number does not exist, $\\log_{9}{4}$ is undefined, and so we leave it as $\\log_{9}{4}$.\n\nThe answer for Example 1 is:\n\n\\[ 8￠2 = \\frac{10}{3} \\]\n\nFor Examples 3 and 4, we need to solve for X in each case. For the first example, we have\n\n\\[ X￠4=\\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting our definition of '￠' into this equation gives:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\log_{X}{4} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nWe can't solve this equation directly with these values, but we can observe that $\\log_{X}{4}=\\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}}$. Therefore we have:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSuppose \\(\\log_{4}{X} = a\\). Then our equation becomes:\n\n\\[ a + \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(a\\) gives us a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ a^2 - \\frac{5}{2}a + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\frac{5}{2})^2 - 4}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{2}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{3}{2}}{2} \\]\n\nAnnoyingly, both values for \\(a\\) are negative, which doesn't really fit with our expected logarithmic results (if \\(X￠4=\\frac{5}{2}\\), then \\(a\\) *should* be positive) so we made a mistake somewhere along the way. Reviewing our process, we find that the problem is in the change of variable to \\(a\\): $\\log_{4}{X}$ can't just be equal to \\(a\\) - \\(a\\) needs to be positive, so the correct expression for \\(a\\) needs to be:\n\n\\[ a=\\log_{4}{X} \\]\n\nTherefore, after substitution our equation is:\n\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{4}{X}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a=\\log_{4}{X}\\) back into this gives us a quadratic equation in \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ 2a^2 - 5a + 2=0\\]\n\nAnd solving this with the quadratic formula gives:\n\n\\[ a=\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}\\]\n\nTakes a little while to do in your head, but eventually you can see \\(a=n\\) and \\(b=4-n\\), \\(a\\) is always less than or equal to \\(b\\) so we take \\(a=4-n\\). Then:\n\n\\[ X = 4^n = 4^{\\log_{4}{X}} \\]\n\\[ X = X \\]\n\nIn other words, your maths went wrong when you said that \\(\\log_{9}{4}=\\frac{1}{n}\\) but it should be \\(\\log_{4}{9}=\\frac{1}{n}\\) for some \\(n\\). We'll find the actual \\(n\\) later. Otherwise you aren't going to be able to solve this equation for any value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolve \\(2a^2 - 5a + 2= 0\\):\n\n\\[ a=\\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{4}= \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\\]\n\nWhich gives us two possible values for \\(a\\), 2 or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's first check \\(a=2\\):\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X}=2 \\to X=4^2=16 \\]\n\nAnd then:\n\n\\[ \\log_{16}{4}= \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSo this value works, so our first value for \\(X\\) is 16.\n\nNow let's check \\(a=\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[ \\log_{4}{X}=\\frac{1}{2} \\to X=4^{\\frac{1}{2}}=2 \\]\n\nAnd then:\n\n\\[ \\log_{2}{4}=2 \\]\n\nSo this value also works, and our second value for \\(X\\) is 2.\n\nFor Example 4, we guess and check to find a solution. One way to solve the quadratic is to use the method of 'completing the square':\n\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + 2 = 0 \\]\n\nTake the 'b' term and divide by two, giving us \\(-2.5\\) - under the radical square this to get \\(-6.25\\). Add this to both sides of the equation to get the left hand side to factorise:\n\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2a² - 5a + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ 2(a² - \\frac{5}{2}a) + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\\[ 2(a² - \\frac{5}{2}a + \\frac{25}{16}) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{25}{8} \\]\n\\[ 2(a - \\frac{5}{4})² = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{25}{8} = 6 \\]\n\\[ a - \\frac{5}{4} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\approx \\frac{5}{4} + 1.6 =2.3 \\]\n\\[ \\log_{X}{9} = a \\approx \\log_{X}{\\frac{10}{3}} \\]\n\nSo X=10/3.\n\nBut we need to verify that this value works in the equation. The minimum value for a and b in \\log_{a}{b} is 2, as when make a and b the same value, their result is 1. Here we have made one value twice as large as the other, suggesting that our logarithm is smaller than 1. Therefore, it is safe to say that the answer is 10/3, or approximately 3.3.",

Here's what you need to deliver:\n\n### Task:\nWrite a program which will be given two integer-valued matrices, and output the result of the & operation when performed element by element. (Note: multiplication is implied in & operation.)\n\n### Undefined Factor:\nUsing `undef` in programming languages may lead to division by 0 error. We defined $X^{undef}$ to be equal to $undef$, and $undef^{Y}$ to be equal to $0$ for all X and Y in integers.\n\n### Input:\n- The first line contains two integers r1 and c1, indicating the first matrix has r1 rows and c1 columns.\n- The second r1 lines, each have c1 integers, indicating the first matrix.\n- The third line contains two integers r2 and c2, indicating the second matrix has r2 rows and c2 columns.\n- The fourth r2 lines, each have c2 integers, indicating the second matrix.\n\n### Output:\n- r1 lines, each with c1 integers, as the result of the & operation as defined in the rule.\n- a void function (void function) in CPP (Handled by test cases)\n- a subroutine (def foo in Python, takes args) (Handled by test cases)\n- a void method (Handler by test cases)\n\n### Constraints:\n- 1 ≤ r1, c1, r2, c2 ≤ 5\n- Integer in integers on each matrix is in range [0,50].\n\n**Hint:**\nA straightforward for loops will get TLE. There are multiple ways to optimize this. A basic condition one may need to use is that X^undef = undef for all X in integers.\n\nIs there any question I can help with?",

In other words, A@B means to take the maximum of each corresponding element in matrices A and B.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3.

For example, the maximum of A[1,1] (which is 7) and B[1,1] (which is 0) is 7. We follow this process for every element of the matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix}\n 7 & \\max(8, 1) \\\\\n \\max(3, 2) & \\max(4, 3) \n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n 7 & 8 \\\\\n 3 & 4 \n\\end{pmatrix} \\]\nSo, A&B = \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n7 & 8 \\\\\n3 & 4 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Question:\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 5 & 6 \\\\\n 1 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n 2 & 1 \\\\\n 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A&B\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\nUsing the same logic as in the previous question:\n\nA[1,1] is 5, and B[1,1] is 2.
