Rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees and fill in \"AW\":\n   ```\n   [['G', '', '', ''],\n   ['W', '', 'Z', 'H'],\n   ['H', 'A', '', 'Y'],\n   ['H', '', '', '']]\n   ```\n\n3.

We continue to fill the grid by rotating the template as needed until we complete the block with filler characters '#'.\n\nAfter completing the encryption process for Block 1, we read the contents of the grid line by line to get the ciphertext. Repeating the process for Block 2 and Block 3, the final encrypted message will concatenate the ciphertexts from each block.\n\nFollowing these steps carefully and executing the encryption procedure for each block, we obtain:\n\n**[[WFATLAOGYNSZHFRLPLOHENICJDGWHSIJEPID]])**\n\nPlease note, due to the manual nature of this encryption and to ensure accuracy in the process, each rotation and fill step must be handled individually.
