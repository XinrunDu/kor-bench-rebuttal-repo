For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E.

This is because the minimal necessary information understood from the statement by the hearer includes the existence of doors on the car. Under the C% Principle, in the absence of clear information to the contrary, the hearer assumes the common convention that a car has doors, which aligns with CI1 of the C% Principle.
