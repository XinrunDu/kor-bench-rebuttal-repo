This means either ~(~p1 &p2 ) is true or ~p3 is true.\n\n- If ~(~p1 &p2 ) is false, that means (~p1 &p2 ) is true, which implies both ~p1 and p2 are true. In this case, ~p3 must also be true to satisfy the formula.\n- If ~p3 is false, that means p3 is true. This doesn't affect the truth value of ~(~p1 &p2 ), so ~(~p1 &p2 ) can still be true or false, depending on the truth values of p1 and p2.\n\nThus, the possible false assignments for the formula are:\n- [[F: x|x|x];  // first case, where both p1 and p2 are false, and p3 is true\n- [F: ✓|✓|x];  // second case, where p3 is true but p1 and p2 can be either true or false]\n\n### (2) (~p2 ||p3 )&(p1 =::>p2 )\n\nFor the entire formula to be false, both (~p2 ||p3 ) and p1 =::>p2 must be false (since we're using the \"and\" operation).\n\n- (~p2 ||p3 ) is false only if both p2 is false and p3 is false.\n- For p1 =::>p2 to be false, p1 must be true and p2 must be false (since =::> means \"If p1, then p2\", it's false if p1 is true and p2 is false).\n\nTherefore, for the entire formula to be false, p1 must be true, p2 must be false, and p3 must be false:\n- [[F: ✓|x|x]]\n\n### (3) (p1 =::>p2 )&(~(p1 &p3 )||p1 )\n\nFor the entire formula to be false, both (p1 =::>p2 ) and ~(p1 &p3 )||p1 must be false.\n\n- Since p1 =::>p2 means \"If p1, then p2\", it's false if p1 is true and p2 is false.\n- ~(p1 &p3 )||p1 is true if either both (p1 &p3 ) and p1 are true, or if p1 &p3 is false and p1 is true.

(p, q, r) = (0, 0, 1) -> Here, p is False, q is False, r is True, and hence, NOT r is True, making the (p AND q AND NOT r) True. However, p OR r is also True, not False, so this does not satisfy the condition.\n2. (p, q, r) = (0, 1, 0) -> Here, p is False, q is True, r is False, and both (p AND q AND NOT r) is False (as NOT r is True) and (p OR r) is False (as both p and r are False).
