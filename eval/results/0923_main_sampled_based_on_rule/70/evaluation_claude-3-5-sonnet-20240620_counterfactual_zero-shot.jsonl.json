One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate option C because Dragon Nip does not have the magic power to make all dragons relax. Some dragons have no reaction or even become aggressive.\n\nOptions A and B are about catnip, which is not mentioned in the story, so we cannot verify their accuracy based on the given information.\n\nOption D directly matches the information provided in the story about taming a Gronckle using Dragon Nip.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[D]]",

It had been operational for over 500 days (less than 2 years) under the supervision of six scientists.\n\n3. However, in June 2026, during a severe solar storm (beyond G5 level), the operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\n\nThese facts indicate that while progress was made in creating a self-sufficient space station, it was not able to withstand extreme solar events and did not operate successfully for more than 4 years. Therefore, humanity has not yet been able to construct a space station that can be entirely self-sufficient in space for an extended period, making option C the correct answer.",
