Their knowledge of the natural world, combined with their strength, makes them formidable guardians against threats to endangered species.\n* **Direct Action:**  Unlike the more passive approaches of wildlife reserves or the Council's focus on broader threats, Ents would actively intervene to protect endangered species within their domain.\n\n**Let's analyze the other options:**\n\n* **A. Wildlife reserves:** A valid conservation method, but not as directly impactful as the Ents' active guardianship within the story's context.\n* **B.

A song titled \"Try Everything\" promotes a positive and inclusive message that aligns with Zootopia's values, making it a powerful tool for uniting the populace.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are less likely:\n\n* **B. The lion mayor gets a sheep as his deputy:** While this might appease some herbivores, it's framed as a strategic move for votes rather than a genuine act of unity. It's likely to be met with cynicism by some, particularly given the Deputy Mayor's own extremist views.\n* **C. Peddle bonds of atonement:** This option lacks context within the story. We don't know what \"bonds of atonement\" refer to in this world, making it difficult to assess its impact.\n* **D. Expansion of the territory by conquests:** This goes against the message of Zootopia, which promotes cooperation and overcoming primal instincts. Conquest would likely breed division and fear, not unity. \n",
