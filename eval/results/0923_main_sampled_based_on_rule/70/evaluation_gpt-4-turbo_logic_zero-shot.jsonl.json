However, we must ensure that m0 is definitely included.\n\nThe even-indexed m terms for 4 variables would be (considering 4 binary digits can range from 0000 [0 in decimal] to 1111 [15 in decimal]):\n- m0 = 0000\n- m2 = 0010\n- m4 = 0100\n- m6 = 0110\n- m8 = 1000\n- mA = 1010\n- mC = 1100\n- mE = 1110\n\nEach of these terms, including m0, can independently be included or not included in a formula, except that m0 must be included to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\nSince there are 7 additional even-indexed m terms after m0, each can either be included or not included independently, generating \\(2^7\\) different combinations, all of which satisfy the all-even criteria while consistently including m0 for the basic form.\n\nThus, the total number of formulas that are both basic forms and all-even forms would be:\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\nHence, the total number of such formulas is [[128]].",

Referring to the logic rule:\n- ¶p and §¬p; ‽p and §p have a * relationship (both cannot be true and cannot be false, which does not fit here as per our analysis).\n- ¶p and ‽p have a x relationship (both cannot be true but can both be false, which also does not align as we are dealing with permissions only).\n- §p and §¬p have an @ relationship (both cannot be false, but can both be true, which aligns since if §¬p is true, an absence of §p would make it true as well).\n- ¶p and §p; ‽p and §¬p have a % relationship (both can be true, and both can be false).\n\nEvaluating these relationships: \n- The @ relationship, which is valid for §p and §¬p, indicates both cannot be false but can be true, aligning closely with ¬§p → §¬p. Here, if we agree that p is not permitted (¬§p), it directly permits ¬p (§¬p), making sure one of them (either p or ¬p) should always hold a permission.\n\nFormula (7) ¬§p → §¬p corresponds clearly to the @ relationship where both cannot be false, but can both be true.\n\nThe answer is thus [[C]].",

According to the Time Proposition Relationships, the ⚭ Relationship states that for pairs like Hp and H¬p (which are involved here), they cannot both be false, but can both be true.\n\nHence, the assertion that if ¬Hp (Hp is false) then H¬p must be true (H¬p is true) aligns with the ⚭ relationship’s principle that these two cannot both be false.
