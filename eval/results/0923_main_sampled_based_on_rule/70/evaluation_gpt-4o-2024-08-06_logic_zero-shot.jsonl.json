The statement about the beer being part of the food in the food box seems to relate to conventional associations—food items often include beverages in a \"food box.\"\n\n- **C! Principle (Avoidance of Unmarked Expressions):** This principle focuses on not using lengthy or marked expressions unnecessarily.
