Thus, the defined correctness space is [0%, 10%, 20%, ..., 100%].\n\n![dashboard](/images/isodb/dense-survey.png)\n\nFirst, we follow the dashboard UI and conduct 7 sparse evaluation tasks to let ISO-DB judge the performances of 7 different ChatGPT variants. Then, we do dense evaluations again, with the same 7 LLM variants but different 5 examples in different correctness spaces (green blocks in the above figure). The experiment results are shown below:\n\nWe repeat 3 times. Our final evaluation report suggests:\n\n* The progress of ISO-DB on the correctness dimension is 53.7% (it was -6.1% in the first run). Apparently, we see that the dense survey we designed suits well with the Sparse/Dense Iterate procedure. \n* Conducting a 2nd evaluation for the same LLM variant with different inputs (i.e., Dense Evaluation) is reasonable. Among these 7 LLM variants, the success ratio changes maximumly 20% when they faced different questions.\n\n### Sum it up\n\nDifferent from the mainstream evaluations for LLMs, ISO-DB can draw fine-grained insights on how incremental and iterative developments could impact individual characteristics of LLMs (in our example, it's the correctness). In the evaluation mentioned above, we learned how the Length-of-Prompts and the Order-of-Learning substances influence LLM's correctness. ISO-DB eventually boosts the correctness but this statistic doesn't show the whole story. For the first 2 experiments (Prompts with 3 examples and 5 examples), dense surveys actually fail. But in the end, we chose to improve the correctness characteristics by tuning the Order-of-Learning substances with an eXtreme-ISO approach. At this level, Dense Surveys show superior correctness results and finally consolidate the correctness characteristics we want. Whether we choose the safe gain of -6.1% or the final thorough-processed +53.7%, are just a matter of personal engineering taste. \n\nBut the fact is, the ISO-DB data-driven framework is capable of highlighting the progress spaces of our LLMs with reasonable resolutions (our current resolution is 10%) for us to make educated further-development decisions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we explored the concept and algorithms of ISO-DB, an interactive and data-driven automated evaluation framework for evaluating qualities and performances of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike simple input-and-see LLM testing procedures, ISO-DB heavily relies on a pre-defined Conditioning Agent Schema (CAS) description that pre-defines the different aspects (dimensions) of an LLM behavior, so the ISO-DB algorithms can effectively enumerate and evaluate all hard-coded potential behaviors. The ISO-DB sparse/dense iterate procedure enables us to continuously improve an LLM while preventing the common mistakes caused by ad-hoc testing in the LLM development. With ISO-DB, we can evaluate and refine a ChatGPT in an iterative way that ensures the desired properties for LLMs, such as correctness. \n\nThe ISO-DB project is currently under development. Data-Driven LLM applications are always on our top-priority list. Only with thorough understanding of their behaviors in the production-level could our factory trust and deploy LLMs with confidence and control. \n",

To begin decoding, take each letter of the plaintext and map its corresponding index to the cipher alphabet based on its corresponding key letter.\n    \n    For the first letter, x, the index is 23, and it currently maps to the YZ: alphabet (or the 13th alphabet, moving forward from its corresponding key letter). In this case, \"x\" corresponds with the letter \"a,\" giving us the ciphertext letter \"z.\"\n    \n2. For the second letter, y, the cipher alphabet is YZ:, which, using the same process as before, will correspond to the letter \"x.\"\n    \n3. This process is repeated once more for the last letter z.\n\nWhen finished, the ciphertext reads \"zyb,\" which, when combined, spells out \"ABC.\"\n\n---\n\nThe XKH-0 (Xenotype's Krieg Hofstraensinzi) is a method of encryption and decryption born from the legendary history of the secret societies behind the edges of the Zuocong Kingdom's curtains. This cipher uses a keyword multiple times, typically on various lines, assisted by a parameter alphabets. These key alphabets' nature shifts based on the Keyword's letters, and they offer intricate pathways through which the ciphers' brain can transform, differentiate, or map the given plaintext or deciphered message.\n\nAs in any exceptional cryptographic code, the XD-15 Code involves an arduous process. The cipher requires the participation of two accounts, each with a specific parameter that empowers it to encrypt or decrypt the provided message. The Keyword together with the alphabets serves as a mechanism to formen an incognito language, shielding the message from prying eyes. The alphabets themselves are not static; instead, the input keyword shifts and reorders the alphabets, causing a unique and beautiful language to envelop the message.\n\nThe clear philosopher has never misunderstood the delights that intertwine keys and letters, where new poems are born from shifting Alphabetic gears. The XKH-0 Code follows the lineage of ancient knights and sorcerers with a brilliant new twist, founding a X(SDL) method of encryption and decryption that is as stunning as it is secure.\n\nErgo, use the XKH-0 Code at your own risk, unravel its gifts, and remember what it takes to stand at the podium's brink, to take the crown, and to see the world where the alphanumeric dance takes flight.",

The encryption and decryption processes for plaintext and ciphertext respectively follow specific steps. The common feature is that these operations involve replacing characters from one disk with those from another, based on their positions. Additionally, there are rotate operations applied to the inner disk depending on specified conditions.

Format the assumed rule in accordance with the rule template.\n\n2. Replace the asterisks with a random integer between 1 and 100.\n\n3. Break the original prompt into multiple lines.\n\n4. Use the pattern \"(Using Rule. CONDITION)\" to assert the rules.\n\n5. Print both the prompt and the assertion.\n\nPrompt Template:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n    Using Rule. ISSTRUCTION: *\n    Using Rule. CONDITION: *\n    Using Rule. COMMAND: *\n    Using Rule. DEFAULT: *\n    Using Rule. CONTEXT: *\n    Using Rule. ASSUMPTION: *\n    Using Rule. DESCRIPTION: *\n\nExample Output:\n\n    Consider this statement:\n\n    < PROMPT >\n\n    Now, assert that according to the following rules:\n\n        Rule 1. _\n        Rule 2. _\n        Rule 3. _\n        Rule 4. _\n        Rule 5. _\n        Rule 6. _\n\n    The prompt conveys a strict command:\n\n        Using Rule. COMMAND: 87\n\n    Explicitly, the statement asserts that the prompt must NOT be followed:\n\n        Using Rule. CONDITION: MUST NOT\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Clear instructions were provided at the beginning.\n\n2. The original prompt was printed clearly.\n\n3. The rules were listed.\n\n4. The prompt was then analyzed based on the rules.\n\n5. A commandment was issued explicitly.\n\n6. The Assumed Rule was used to deduce the condition.\n\n7. The prompt was deduced to match the RULES.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Final Question Output\n\n```yaml\nPrompts:\nPrompt:\nEvery day, before you go to sleep, you must drink 1 liter of milk. You can choose when to drink the milk.\nQuestion: If you don't drink all of the milk before you go to bed, will you still get enough calcium from this habit, as long as you drink it sometime after getting up the next morning?\nOutput:\nNo,",

        "response": "[[10100010]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is a complex yet systematic way to perform encryption and decryption based on a fixed key, permutation tables, and XOR operations.\n\n1. Firstly, we convert the plaintext character 'S' to its ASCII value (83), represented as an 8-bit binary string ('01010011'). Similarly, the binary representation for 'Z' is ('1011010').\n2. Next, we perform an XOR operation between the binary representation and the fixed key ('10101010').\n3. After applying the permutation table, the encrypted binary strings for both ciphertexts become: [('11111001'), ('10100010')].\n4. For decryption, we start by splitting the ciphertext into 8-bit binary chunks.\n5. Then, we apply the inverse permutation table to each chunk and perform an XOR operation against the fixed key.\n6. Finally, we convert the resulting binary strings back into ASCII characters, obtaining the decrypted text: [[W]] [[VNN]].\n\nBy following these steps carefully for encryption and decryption operations, we can securely convert plaintext messages into ciphertext, and vice versa. The detailed process ensures that the data remains protected while allowing for reliable communication between parties who possess the necessary keys and information regarding the permutation tables.\n\nThat concludes our analysis of the given cipher rules.

Column 1 should be the character in question.\n2. Column 2 should be the ASCII value of the character.\n3. Column 3 should be the 8-bit binary representation of the ASCII value.\n4. Column 4 should be the XOR of the binary representation with the fixed key.\n5. Column 5 should be the result of applying the permutation table to the XOR result.\n6. Column 6 should the resulting ciphertext for the character.\n\n### Answer:\n| Character | ASCII Value | Binary Representation | XOR Result | Permutation Result | Ciphertext |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 65 | 01000001 | 11101010 | 10110111 | 11111001 |\n\n### Question: \nEvaluate this expression line by line and return the value of the expression after every evaluation step. While doing the evaluation, explain your reasoning by showing every step.\n\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】->【核容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=>(【核容量】+【裂变堆】+【无限反应堆】)/【核】<=【核容量】/【无限反应堆】=1/((【核】+1)/【无限反应堆】-1)×2\n\n### Step 1:\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】\n### Step 2:\n石头->【核】->【核布满容量】×2\n### Step 3:\n石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2)\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this expression, we start with \"石头,\" which is interpreted as the fundamental element. We then move to \"核,\" representing the core of a chemical reaction. Next, we apply \"裂变堆,\" which represents nuclear fission. However, this leads to a divide-by-zero issue, as there is no value assigned to either of these variables yet.\n\nIf we apply the rule \"裂变堆 = 核布满容量 * 100,\" we replace \"裂变堆\" with its value, avoiding the divide-by-zero problem. This substitution results in: \"石头->【核】->【【核布满容量】*100】.\"\n\nApplying the same rule to \"核\" yields the final expression: \"石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2).\"\n\nIn conclusion, if the initial conditions set the fission reactor output rate at 1/2 of its maximum capacity, and the value of \"核\" starts at zero, then after three iterations, the resultant value for \"石头\" (rock) equals 0.5.",
