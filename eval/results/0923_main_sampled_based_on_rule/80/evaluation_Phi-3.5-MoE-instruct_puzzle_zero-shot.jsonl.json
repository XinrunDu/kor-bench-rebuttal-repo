Since F is the result of a sum having three digits in it (O + O + T), F must be equal to 1 or 2. It cannot be 0 (from rule 3) and it cannot be 3 or higher (as the maximum possible sum of three digits is 27). We'll assume F = 1 for now and adjust later if needed.\n2. O + O + T must equal 10 (to result in F=1 in the next column). Since O cannot be 0 (also from rule 3), and O cannot be equal to T, one of them must be 5 and the other 2. Without loss of generality, let's assume O=5 and T=2.\n3. Now, we need to solve for N and U. Since O=5, N + N should result in a one digit number plus a carry-over of 1 (since O + O = 10). So N + N = 9. The value for N therefore must be 4.\n4. U + E + a carry-over of 1 must result in R. We already know the possible values for E that haven't been used are 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, E cannot be 1 (since F already takes that value), and it has to be one of a pair that adds to 10 (resulting in a carry-over of 1). E and R can be 6 and 7 or 7 and 6, but we choose 6 for E and 7 for R. U therefore becomes 8.\n5. Lastly, T and W have to sum up to O (which is 5). Since T = 2 and W shouldn't equal letters with assigned values (F, O, N, E, R, U), W must be equal to 3.\n\nCheck if all letters have unique numbers: F=1, O=5, N=4, T=2, E=6, W=3, U=8, R=7, which is true.

Since E cannot be 0, H=2 and E=9, but T=9, so it is not possible to use E=9 again.\n   Consequently, there's a mistake at this step.\n   \nSince we've encountered a problem applying our assumption, let's revisit our approach:\n\nGiven that we made an error in the previous assumption for E, let's reconsider E+H=11. The smallest possible value for H that results in a sum of 11 would be H=3, which makes E=8. But E cannot be 8 since P=8. Thus, we choose H=5 and E=6. This fits our case for E+H=11. Now, H cannot be 0 and now E can be assigned different values than before.\n\nLet's update our assignments:\n\n* A=1\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* T=9\n\nWe now have:\n\n   6AT\n+ T5AT\n= 18PLE\n\nThe next step is to find L. Since E+H=11, we have 6+5=11. The carry-over for the next column gives us:\n\nT+A=L+1 \n\nSince T is 9, there are only possible values for A: 2, 7, or 8. A cannot be 7 or 8 since P=8 and E=6. Therefore, A has to be 2. This leaves L with a value of 6, but this is already assigned to E, so we've made another mistake.\n\nAfter another iteration, we learn that A=3, not 2, which makes L=7. Now we can safely assign T, P, E, A, H, and L.\n\nFinally, we can solve for the remaining values:\n\n* T=4\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* A=3\n* L=7\n* The remaining letters are I and N. There are values 0, 1 and 2 left and we need to find two distinct numbers from these to assign to I and N. Since T=4 and TAKES the place of T repeatedly, N must be 0. I would then be 2.\n\nThus, our final assignment is:\n\n* A=3\n* P=8\n* H=5\n* E=6\n* T=4\n* L=7\n* I=2\n* N=0\n\nFinal Answer: [[A=3, P=8, H=5, E=6, T=4, L=7, I=2, N=0]]",

The sugar-free dieter lost 4 more pounds than the caveman dieter.\n3. The caveman dieter lost more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula used either the gluten-free or caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nFrom Clue (2), we know Mandy => Sugar-Free --> X+4 lbs\nFrom Clue (4), Eula is either Caveman or Gluten Free. Since Caveman dieter lost more pounds than Eula (3), Eula cannot be using Caveman diet, which means Eula used Gluten Free diet.\nFrom Clue (5), Barbara --> 7 lbs.\n\nNow let's assume Eula lost X lbs. Since Eula is not the Caveman dieter, the friend who used the Caveman diet lost X+1 lbs (somewhat more than Eula), which we know is Mandy, meaning Mandy lost X+4 lbs.\n\nSince Barbara's weight loss is a concrete number i.e. 7 lbs, we can pick any number that would satisfy the puzzle for Eula and the respective dieters. Let Eula lose 3 lbs since it's a small value and Mandy and the caveman dieter would lose experiences reasonable values. Then, the friend on the Caveman diet would lose 3+1 = 4 lbs and Mandy would lose 3+4 = 7 lbs. Laura is a dieter name we haven't used yet.\n\nNow we can state the final output:\n\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\nHowever, the original instruction asked for 4 entries with the 'pounds lost' field in the order of 3, 5, 7, 9 respectively, so here is the final result as instructed:\n[[3 3 Eula Gluten-Free], [5 7 Mandy Sugar-Free], [7 7 Barbara Unspecified], [9 4 Laura Caveman]]\n\nPlease note there are assumptions made in this problem solving, particularly due to the lack of some information which is common in such puzzles.

This means Hector did not order the dragon roll and since he did not order the teriyaki roll either (clue 6), he must have ordered the futomaki roll and that his cost is $11.50 (from clue 2).\n\n- Since Hector is not the client that ordered the dragon and teriyaki rolls, the client who ordered the dragon roll must have ordered the futomaki (Hector's Roll) and paid $11.50 (from Clue 2) which is a contradiction. So, the client who ordered the dragon roll must have paid another price.\n\n- In clue 7, the person that ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50, which cannot be Hector since he ordered the futomaki.\n\n- From clue 5, Virginia and Ramona must be different from the one who ordered the dragon roll. From clue 4, Virginia must have ordered either the rainbow or spider roll. Since the dragon roll is not ordered by Virginia or Ramona, that roll must have been ordered by the customer left, not yet named.\n\n- As the dragon roll cannot be ordered by Virginia, Virginia ordered the rainbow roll (from clue 4).\n\n- If Virginia ordered the rainbow roll, then Ramona has ordered the spider roll (from clue 4).\n\n- Since the dragon roll cost cannot be $9.50 (the cost of the firecracker roll) nor $11.50 (the cost of the futomaki and the tiger roll, from clue 2), and since the dragon roll cannot cost $15.50 (that is Virginia's cost for her roll, from clue 3), then the dragon roll must cost $13.50.\n\nThus, we arrive at the following table:\n\n[$9.50, Dragon, X, Y] // X and Y stand for customers whose names were not mentioned\n[$11.50, Futomaki, Hector, Z]\n[$13.50, Dragon, Z, A] // Z and A stand for customers whose names were not mentioned\n[$15.50, Rainbow, Virginia, B] // B stands for customers whose name was not mentioned\n\nTherefore, the result is [[$9.50 Dragon X Y], [$11.50 Futomaki Hector Z], [$13.50 Dragon Z A], [$15.50 Rainbow Virginia B]]\nHowever, we have no information to assign names to X, Y, A, and B.

Thus, the final row 1 would be 5 6 8 4 23\n\nRow 2: 8  X  X  X  24 ; known sum is 24\n- Find the sum of the known number in the row: 8\n- Next, find the missing numbers in the row: 24 - 8 = 16\n- Now we have to find three unique numbers from the numbers set {1, 2, 3, ..., 24}, that sum up to 16, and do not have these numbers existing in the same row or column.\n- The combination is 3, 7, and 6. But 6 is already in Row 1 so we must replace 6 with the other possible combination from the set which would be 9 and 5.\n- The final row 2 will be 8 9 5 3 24\n\nRow 3: X  X  3  X  31 ; known sum is 31\n- Find the sum of the known number in the row: 3\n- Next, find the missing numbers in the row: 31 - 3 = 28\n- Now we have to find three unique numbers from the numbers set {1, 2, 3, ..., 24}, that sum up to 28, and do not have these numbers existing in the same row or column.\n- The combination is 12, 10 and 6. But 6 is already in Row 1 so we must replace 6 with the other possible combination from the set which would be 11 and 12.\n- The final row 3 will be 11 12 3 4 31\n\nStep 4: Check for column summation\n- Sum of column 1: 5 + 8 + 11 + 21 = 45\n- Sum of column 2: 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 = 42\n- Sum of column 3: 8 + 5 + 12 + 19 = 44\n- Sum of column 4: 4 + 3 + 4 + 23 = 34\n\nFinal answer: [[5 6 8 4 23], [8 9 5 3 24], [11 12 3 4 31], [21 15 19 23]]\n\nPlease note: There could be multiple solutions available.

Row 2 should total 37 (the sum of Column 5) minus the already filled values, which is 37 - 2 - 10 - 24 = 1.\n\nWe also need to calculate the missing value in Column 1 for the second row: 71 - 15 - 13 - 43 = 0. This suggests that there might be a mistake in either the specified set of values or the existing values in the matrix.\n\nFor the third row, we cannot find missing values for the second column or fourth column because these are 'X'. We calculate for the X in column 3: 54 - 2 - 14 - 38 = 0, which is another issue.\n\nFurthermore, we can other well-constrained places: column 4, the value for the second row is 10, and column 3 in the third row (with 'X' at the top and bottom, which can only be the number 0, as mentioned above). Also, column 4, third row, is missing a number 40 - 1 (already filled) - 13 (from first column) = 26.\n\nHence, after considering these calculations and looking at the numbers already in place and context of the rule that each numbers can only be used once, it can be observed that this puzzle has insufficient information or conflicting data, which prevents from reaching a unique solution or even a partial solution.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction within the given data which makes it impossible to solve this puzzle.\n\n[[insufficient information or contradiction]]",

Using the rule that each row and column should sum up to the provided total, and each X indicates uses a unique digit from the specified list (usually from 1 to 9, since it's a popular Sudoku variant), we should note that the numbers 23, 28, and 46 have already been used in the columns, so only 1, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 21, 22, 36, 49, and 50 remain.\n\n3. Now, we fill the grid according to the rule:\n\nColumn 2: 56 - (5 + 15 + 36) = 0 (which is not possible, let's start over)\n\nSince columns 1 and 4 are already correctly summed, and column 3 is incomplete, we start filling there:\n\nRow 2 (Column 3): 23 - 22 = 1 (already used, start over)\nRow 3 (Column 2): 56 - (5 + 15) = 36 (already used)\nRow 3 (Column 2): 56 - (5 + 36) = 15 (already used)\nRow 3 (Column 2): 56 - (15 + 36) = 5, but already used\nRow 3 (Column 3): 1 (is possible, let's keep it)\n\nRow 3 (Column 1): 52 - (7 + 6) = 39, not possible using the remaining numbers\nLet's instead try:\nRow 2 (Column 4): 28 - (7 + 11) = 10\nRow 1 (Column 2): 56 - (10 + 15) = 31, not possible\nLet's pick different values:\nRow 2 (Column 4): 28 - (11 + 15) = 2\nRow 1 (Column 2): 56 - (2 + 15) = 39, not possible\n\nGiven these calculations, we are facing difficulty finding compatible values for the grid.

If we add the missing numbers in this row, it should be equal to 35.\n35 - 12 - 12 - 7 = 4\nThe numbers left are 1, 3, and 0. We can try combinations to get 4.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- 1 + 3 + 0 = 4\n- 0 + 3 + 1 = 4\n\nLet's try both options:\nWith 1 + 3 + 0, the matrix would look like:\n12 1 3 4 31\nX X X X 35\nX X 2 1 12\n29 22 15 12\n\nFor Row 2:\nX + X + X + X = 35 - 1 - 3 - 0 = 31\n\nThe remaining sum, 31, needs to be split between 3Xs. But since the total number already has the 3, we have to find the remaining two numbers. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 9 excluding already-used digits is 45 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9). If we subtract the numbers we have in the matrix (39), we get 45 - 39 = 6 left. So the missing numbers must add up to 6 and have one of them be 3. Those numbers are 2 and 4.\n\nUsing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to fill the X's in Row 2 (keeping unique numbers and making sure their sum equals 35) we get: 0, 1, 2, and 34 - 2 - 0 - 1 - 3 = 30, thus the last missing number must be 30. This is not a valid solution since it breaks the rules.\n\nLet's try 1, 3 and 0 switched:\n12 3 0 4 31\nX X X X 35\nX X 2 1 12\n29 22 15 12\n\nNow, with 1 + 0 + 3, Row 2 would be:\nX + X + X + X = 35 - 1 - 0 - 3 = 31\n\nWe've been through this before, and it's not a valid solution.\n\nWe need to try another combination, since none of the combinations give a valid solution. We incorrectly considered 1, 3, and 0 as options for the remaining numbers. We'll now use the numbers we haven't put in the grid yet (5, 6, 7, and 8). Out of these, we need to find three unique numbers that will add up to 31 when summed and not be already used.\n\nFrom the moment we're restricted to use unique numbers which are not present in the matrix, we find that one possible choice is \"6, 7, and 8\".\n\nThe corrected grid looks like:\n12 3 0 4 31\n6 7 8 X 35\nX X 2 1 12\n29 22 15 12\n\nNow, Row 3 has a missing value and can be computed easily as:\nX = 12 - 2 - 1 = 9\n\nFinal grid:\n12 3 0 4 31\n6 7 8 9 35\n9 X 2 1 12\n29 22 15 12\n\nWith only one missing value left. For Column 2 (which has 24 + unknown), we have 7, 2, 9, and 22, which sums up to 39 (7 + 2 + 9 + 22). To complete the column:\nX = 24 - (39 - 0) = -15\n\nThis is not a valid solution because we can't use negative values in the puzzle.\n\nAt this point, we can conclude that this puzzle doesn't have a valid solution under its given rules and initial structure.

Start from the first row and fill in the x's with consecutive numbers. The first row has 7 numbers, so there are 2 x's in the first row. The first x will be 2 and the second x will be 3.

We know that the numbers should be arranged in order, so we will start with number 36, but since that's already given in the second row, we need to fill in the two x's with 37 and 38.

(1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12* means that the product of these cells' values should be 12.\n4. (1,3)(1,4):5+ means the sum of these cells' values should be 5.\n5.

For simplicity, we'll assign 3 to (1,1), 4 to (1,2), and 1 to (2,2).\n\nFrom 4., (1,3)(1,4):5+, the general combinations that produce 5 are (2,3) or (1,4) with (1,3) as (2,3)+(1,3)=5 or (1,4)+(1,3)=5. Since 1 is already assigned to (2,2), we'll assign 1 to (1,4) and 4 to (1,3).\n\nFrom 5., (2,3)(2,4):5+, this is similar to the previous requirement, and possible combinations are (1,2) with (2,3) or (2,4) as (1,2)+(2,3)=5 or (1,2)+(2,4)=5. Since 4 is assigned to (1,2), we'll assign 2 to (2,3) and 3 to (2,4).\n\nFrom 6., (2,1)(3,1):2÷, the only way is to set (2,1)=4 and (3,1)=2 as 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nFrom 7., (3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8*, considering the numbers we have already used, we can use 1, 2, and 4.

So the third column must be [1 X X 3] or [X 1 X 2], but since the third cell, in the third row, is already filled with '2', it must be:\n\nX X 1 3\nX X X 2\nX X 2 4\nX X X X\n\nNow we can proceed to fill out other cells based on unique numbers in rows and columns, combined with inequality constraints.\n\nSince (1,3)>=(1,4) and (1,4)<=(2,4), the number in cell (1,3) should be '1' and the number in cell (1,4) should be '2'.\n\nFurthermore, since (2,4)<=(3,4), the number in cell (2,4) should be '2' and cell (3,4) should be '3' or '4'. As '2' is already present in the third column, the value for (3,4) must be '4'.\n\nLastly, we can deduce cell (2,3) by looking at the column constraint (2,1)<(2,2). We know that column 1 cannot contain '1', so column 2 must contain '1'. Therefore, cell (2,3) should be '3' or '4', but since '4' is present in column 4, (2,3) should be '3'.\n\nThis results in:\n\nX 1 1 2\nX X 3 2\nX X 2 4\nX X X X\n\nNow, the first row must have '3' and '4'. Since 4 cannot be in the first column, it must be in the first row second column. This places the '3' in the first row fourth column.\n\nThe second row must have '2' and '4'. Since '4' is in the fourth column of the second row, '2' must be in the second column of the second row.\n\nThe first column must have '2' and '4'. Since '4' is in the fourth row of the first column, '2' must be in the first row of the first column.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n[[2 1 1 3],\n [4 2 3 2],\n [X X 2 4],\n [X X X X]]\n\nSince X in the third and fourth rows of the first column cannot be '1', '2', or '3', they must be '4' and '1' in an unspecified order. However, since the second column of the third row cannot be '1' or '2', it must be '4', so the fourth column of the third row must be '1'. \n\nFinal puzzle result:\n\n[[2 1 1 3],\n [4 2 3 2],\n [4 X 2 1],\n [1 X X X]]\n\nAt this point, since the remaining numbers are '3' and '4', and the second row cannot have '3', the (3,2) cell should be '3', and (4,2) and (4,3) should be '4'.\n\n[[2 1 1 3],\n [4 2 3 2],\n [4 3 2 1],\n [1 4 4 X]]\n\nThe remaining cell, (4,1) should be '3'.\n\nFinal answer wrapped in double square brackets:\n\n[[2 1 1 3],\n [4 2 3 2],\n [4 3 2 1],\n [3 4 4 X]]",

After this, using the (2,4) > (3,4) statement, we now know the fourth elements of each rows. So the grid will look like this:\n\nX X 4 3\nX X X 2\nX 2 X X\n1 X X X\n\nWe now know that for the third row to be smaller than the second row, it will have to be '2 3 1 4'.

It should be (2,3) > (3,3) => 4 > 2 *\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n4 2 1 3\n3 4 2 1\n2 1 4 3\n1 3 2 4\n\nNow, let's check all inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 1 > 2 (false)\n\nError again. We should have assumed the number in (2,3) should be greater than (3,3), but less than 4. So it should be 3. Let's fix this again:\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nNow, let's check all inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n\nThe second inequality is still not correct, we assumeed that the number of (2,4) would be 1 but considering the first one we need to increase it by 1, so now it will be 2.\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 2\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequality again:\n\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 2 > 4 (false)\n\nBut because both numbers are in the same list (1,2,3,4) the reference 4 will be emptied when we execute 2>4. We need to know that if the reference is emptied, the sign will be considerated false.\n\nSo let's execute again the previous fix but changing the reference in (3,4):\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequality again:\n\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n\nOur initial mistake is that as it must be a unique number in each row, we couldn't use 1 two times (in the first and fourth rows). We need to change one of them. Also, as we know that two numbers in the column 4 must be equal or less than 2, only 1 can be in row 4. So 1 must not in row 1.\n\nSo let's change it to 4, 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 2 4 3\n\nLet's check inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nThat didn't work either, we missed another number relationships: since 2 is between 1 and 3 in row 3 and as the last element must be 1, then the 2 must be in the second position of that row.\n\nSo let's change it to 4 1 3 2\n3 4 2 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 2 4 1\n\nLet's check inequalities again:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 2 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 1 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nBut as before, the number 1 must be in row 4 and this configuration is illegal.\nWe need to understand that as the first element of the row is 4, that 1 needs to be in a column of position 2,3 or 4. But we cannot put it in column 3, as that will invalidate the first inequality. Also, we cannot put it in column 4, as that will invalidate the second inequality.\n\nSo it must be position 2, which requires a change on the second row. But as it needs to be greater than the 2 on position 2, row 3, it must be 3.\n\n4 1 3 2\n3 4 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n4 3 2 1\n\nLet's check inequalities:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 3 > 1 (true)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 4 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 1 (false)\n\nAnother mistake. In the last board change, the third row is illegal because 1 is in position 3, and it should be in position 4. Trying to adjust positions, we realize that it impacts the other three positions. We will need to change it to place the numbers in order in each column, to get a correct configuration. If we place a 1 in the fourth row, it must be in column 3. Which indicates that row 3 needs to have a 1 in the fourth column. Because (3,2) can't have a 3, that results in a 3 in the (3,2) position.\n\nLet's change it to 4 1 3 2\n3 4 2 1\n2 3 4 1\n4 2 1 3\n\nLet's check inequalities:\n\n* (2,3) > (3,3) => 2 > 4 (false)\n* (2,4) > (3,4) => 1 > 1 (false)\n* (3,2) < (3,3) => 3 < 4 (true)\n\nWe must execute the previous correction again.

We have a \"greater than\" constraint at (1,2)>(1,3). So, the arrangements in row 1 can be either 2 3 1 or 3 2 1, but since 2 is already present at row 1 column-2, we must choose 3 2 1. Hence, our completed first row is 2 3 1 X.\n\nNow, let's fill row 2: The given constraint at (2,2)>(2,3) provides us with 2 1 3 for the second row. Thus, our completed second row becomes 3 2 1 4.\n\nMoving on to row 3: The constraint given at (3,1)<(3,2) gives us 1 2 X X, so we add the necessary remaining numbers to complete the row: 1 2 4 3.\n\nFinally, fill row 4: Since there are only two x's left and one of them must be equal to 3, as given in row 4 column 4, we place the numbers 4 1 2 3 to satisfy the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the solution matrix is:\n\n2 3 1 4\n3 2 1 4\n1 2 4 3\n4 1 2 3\n\nWrapping the matrix with double square brackets as per the example format:\n\n[[2 3 1 4, 3 2 1 4, 1 2 4 3, 4 1 2 3]]",

        "response": " To solve this puzzle, we start filling in the numbers according to the given constraints, and the grid's initial state. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The first row cannot be completed because the first element is unknown, and the rest of the values in the row are known to be greater than the adjacent elements in the next row. However, we do know that the first row must have the numbers 1 to 5 in some order.\n2. Row 2 starts with 1, and the second column cannot be 4, as (1,2)<(2,2). Similarly, row 4 starts with a number higher than 1, for (4,1)>(4,2). Thus, row 4 must start with 4, which forces the second column to contain 2 and row 2 to contain 3. Now we gradually fill in the values.\n3. The third row will have 5 as the middle element, as we need (2,3)<(3,3). The first and the last elements will be 1 and 2, and we need to determine their order. Since the first element cannot be greater than any number in the first row, it must be 1.\n4. Using the same logic, the fourth row will start with 4 and end with 2. We can also find out that row 4, second column must be 3, as (4,1)>(4,2) and (4,3)<(5,3), the second column of row 5 cannot be 3, nor can it be 1 or 2.\n5. Now row 5's second column must be 1 (5,2)>(5,3). The rest of the row 5 numbers will be 2 and 5 with the leftmost and the rightmost numbers being 2 and 5, respectively.\n\nAfter filling in the grid, the completed puzzle is:\n\n[[1 2 3 4 5],\n [3 1 X X X],\n [2 X 5 X X],\n [4 3 2 X X],\n [X 1 2 5 X]]\n\nHowever, we still have blanks (X) which can be filled by checking against each inequality operation:\n\n- The first blank (row 2 column 3) must be greater than row 3 column 3 (which is 5), so it must be 1.\n- The first blank (row 2 column 4) cannot be 4, as row 3 column 4 needs to be higher. It cannot be 5 since that is in row 5; it cannot be 2 since that is in row 1; it cannot be 1 since that is in row 2. Thus, it must be 3.\n- The second blank (row 2 column 5) cannot be 2 or 4, as these are higher than row 3 column 5 (only 1 and 3 are unknown). It cannot be 1 since that's below row 1. Therefore, it must be 4.\n- The second blank (row 4 column 3) cannot be a number that is higher than its neighbors. It cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 5 which are present in row 3 and 5 columns, so it must be 4.\n- The third blank (row 4 column 5) cannot be 1, 2, or 3 as these numbers are already present in its neighboring columns. It also cannot be 4, as that is in row 5 column 4. Thus, it must be 5.\n- The fourth blank (row 5 column 4) cannot be 2 or 4, as they already are present in neighboring columns. Also, it cannot be 3, as this is in row 4 column 3, and thus it must be 1.\n\nThe final grid will be:\n\n[[1 2 3 4 5],\n [3 1 1 3 4],\n [2 4 5 1 3],\n [4 3 4 5 5],\n [5 1 2 1 5]]\n\nFinal Answer: [[1 2 3 4 5, 3 1 1 3 4, 2 4 5 1 3, 4 3 4 5 5, 5 1 2 1 5]]",

The grid represents a 5x5 puzzle with numbers indicating the number of skyscrapers visible from each edge. We will fill in the skyscrapers denoted by X while adhering to the rules.\n\nInitial Grid:\n\n2 X X X X 2\n2 X X X X 2\n3 X X X X 1\n1 X X X X 3\n1 X X X X 2\n\nStep 1: Look at the first row where the clue '2' is located on the right. It means that there should be two skyscrapers visible when we look to the right. Hence, two of the columns on the left will have taller buildings. The first column can contain a skyscraper of height 4 (since there are no taller buildings to the left of it).\n\nFilling in, we get:\n\n2 4 X X X 2\n2 X X X X 2\n3 X X X X 1\n1 X X X X 3\n1 X X X X 2\n\nStep 2: For the first column, the clues on the bottom and top are '1' and '3' respectively. Since we already have a skyscraper of height 4 in the same column, we can only fill in 2 and 3 in this column (the possible heights that are not 4). But with a '3' on the bottom, it must be 3, so the one above must be 2.\n\n2 4 X X X 2\n2 X X X X 2\n3 X X X X 1\n3 X X X X 3\n1 X X X X 2\n\nThis already violates the rule since there are two skyscrapers of height 2 in the third row. Hence, the first column must be 2, 1, 3, 4, 1. \n\n2 4 X X X 2\n1 X X X X 2\n3 X X X X 1\n4 X X X X 3\n1 X X X X 2\n\nStep 3: We continue by placing 3, 5, and 4 in the second, third, and fourth columns, for the first row, avoiding repeated heights in rows.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\n[[2 4 3 5 1],[1 3 5 2 2],[3 2 4 1 5],[4 1 5 3 2],[1 5 2 4 3]]\n\nNote: This puzzle might be misleading as some answers might exist for the given grid layout based on the rules. It can be solved by applying these rules iteratively (if needed). There may be different solutions as well for the same puzzle. For instance, the number of possible configurations for a 4x4 puzzle is vast, considering the permutations existent on each row and column while observing visibility rules.\n\nI hope this implementation helps you understand the approach to solving this puzzle.
