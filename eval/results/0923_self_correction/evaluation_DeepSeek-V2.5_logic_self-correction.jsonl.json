Here, the only difference between the cases is the sub-seed (Chinese hybrid vs. American variety), and the yield (P) differs accordingly.\n- **Method ؆**: This method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent.

Instead, it involves confirming a hypothesis with different observations (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n\n2. **BC Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n   - The scenario involves a universal hypothesis (∀x(S(x) → W(x))) and its confirmation through different conditions (a white swan and a white object that is not a swan).\n   - The confirmation standards are being applied in a way that leads to paradoxical results, as observing a white object that is not a swan should not confirm the hypothesis about swans being white.\n\n3. **LS Paradox**:\n   - This paradox arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n   - The scenario does not involve multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses leading to a contradiction. It involves a single hypothesis and its paradoxical confirmation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the scenario described corresponds to the **BC Paradox**, as it involves the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through different conditions that lead to paradoxical results.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",
