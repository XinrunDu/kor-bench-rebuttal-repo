The puzzles are played on an n*n grid, with some grids containing hint numbers and the rest being blank grids.\n2. The object of the game is to build islands by building walls separating the hint numbers.\n3. Each island contains only one hint number.\n4. The number of squares in each island is equal to the number of clues in that island.\n5. Islands are separated from each other vertically or horizontally.\n6. There are no 2x2 or larger rectangles in the area formed by the wall.\n7. Walls can form a continuous path.\n8. The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank square filled with X. The player should replace the grid on which the wall is built with A and output the drawn matrix, which contains X (the blank island), A (the wall), and the numbers.\n\n### Question:\n3 X X X X X 2 X\nX X 2 X X X X X\nX X X X X X 6 X\nX X 2 X X X X X\nX X X X X X X X\nX X X X X 2 X 3\nX 3 X X X X 1 X\nX X X 3 X X X X\n\n### Solution:\nLet's build the walls and islands according to the rules.\n\n```\n3 A A A A A 2 A\nA A 2 A A A A A\nA A A A A A 6 A\nA A 2 A A A A A\nA A A A A A A A\nA A A A A 2 A 3\nA 3 A A A A 1 A\nA A A 3 A A A A\n```\n\nNow, let's ensure each island contains only one hint number and the number of squares in each island is equal to the number of clues in that island.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[3 A A A A A 2 A,A A 2 A A A A A,A A A A A A 6 A,A A 2 A A A A A,A A A A A A A A,A A A A A 2 A 3,A 3 A A A A 1 A,A A A 3 A A A A]]",

There are Xs around it, so one of the Xs in the first row should be a mine.\n  - The fourth square has a 3. This means there are 3 mines around it. There are Xs around it, so two of the Xs in the first row should be mines.\n\n- The second row:\n  - The third square has a 3. This means there are 3 mines around it. There are Xs around it, so two of the Xs in the second row should be mines.\n\n- The third row:\n  - No changes needed here as there are no Xs.\n\n- The fourth row:\n  - The last square has a 2.
