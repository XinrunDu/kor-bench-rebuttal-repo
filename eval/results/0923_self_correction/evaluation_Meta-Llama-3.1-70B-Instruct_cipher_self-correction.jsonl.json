If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n\n\n- The top card's value determines the number of positions below to find the keystream value of 14. However, to get the exact keystream for our decryption problem, we will reperform the steps with each position until we generate the keystream. For simplicity and focusing on just the problem at hand, then performing and following each position during each operation until the keystream is generated, the calculated keystream value from the initial sequence provided equals y = 14.\n\n\n- Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character \"X\".\n\n\n- Given that z is the position of \"X\" (i.e., z=8) and the keystream value y=14, we'll compute x as follows: \n\n\n- x = (z - y) mod 26 \n  = (8 - 14) mod 26 \n  = -6 mod 26 \n  = -6 + 26 \n  = 20\n\n\n- Finally, use the LETTERS list to find the letter corresponding to position x.

However, we need to look at Grid2 for 'B' and Grid3 for 'U'. \n   In Grid2, 'B' is at (2,1). In Grid3, 'U' is not at (1,5) but is in a different location. 'U' in Grid1 is in row 1, column 5, but in Grid3 'U' is in a different location, so it would be Grid3 row 3 column 4 for 'U' from Grid1 Row 1. From Grid1 Grid1 row (1) column (5), take Grid3 row(1) and Grid1 column(5), use value at Grid3 row(1) and  column(5), thus: 'U' from Grid1 corresponds to 'A' in Grid3. 'B' in Grid2 is at (2,1) and corresponds to 'D' in Grid3 does not apply but 'B' in Grid2 is 'B'.\n6. The encrypted double letter group is \"BI\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[BI]]",

However, encryption uses L1 and L2 to get the encryption from (L1,L2) Horizontally from L1 grid and Vertically from L2 Grid that basically is position of L1 and L2\n- Determine the row and column numbers of # in Grid 1 and Grid 2.

(5, 4, 7)\n   - In Grid 3, find the row number of 4, which is 1 (since 4 is in the 2nd row, the row number is 1, but there is a mistake here, and the row number for 4 is the 1st row in a 0-based index, so the row number is 1, but the real value of L1_row should be 1). However, the row number corresponding to 4 is 1, and we also should get the 1 from the left value of row index '1', we find L1_row = 1, by 1 meaning in real case =4, so for value '4', the L1_row is 1)  and column number of 4, which is 1 ( column value '1' means from col 0 the index of row should be 2 -but that is a wrong direction on interpreting from that site to get values L2_col). Now according to '5' in (x,y,z) we had value L1_col is 5, we then get the value 'D' from Grid1. Now according to value 7 we had value of L2_row is 7- L2_row actually has row '7', so 7 we have two, (7-1)/3 = 2 - {[Lbl_row=L2_row]  with value=2}, so,  L2_row = 2), and now '8' in real scenario defined value of l2_row=7 Examining this corrected way and testing translates, we can also have, according to these col 1 (l2_col), l2_col = 2  from gird as grid(l2_row=2)(index on 7th line/path/nos.
