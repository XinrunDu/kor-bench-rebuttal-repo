Since 14 is not a multiple of X (because X is unknown), we have two possible situations: X is a multiple of 14, or neither X is a multiple of 14 nor 14 is a multiple of X.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 14, then the operation would be X※14 = X/14 + 2. However, this would mean X/14 + 2 = 5, and thus X/14 = 3. This simplifies to X = 42.\n\nIf neither X is a multiple of 14 nor 14 is a multiple of X, the operation X※14 would be 24, which contradicts the given X※14 = 5.\n\nConsidering the last case where 14 is a multiple of X, we have 14 ※ X = 14/X + 2. This would mean 14/X + 2 = 5, and thus 14/X = 3. Solving for X gives X = 14/3, which is not an integer and therefore is not valid according to the rule.\n\nBetween the two valid possibilities (X being a multiple of 14 and the contradiction in the third rule when neither is a multiple of the other), only X = 42 is an integer and also satisfies X being a multiple of 14.\n\nTherefore, the solution that satisfies the given operation and rule is X = 42.\n\n[[42]]",

This wouldn't lead to a result of 4.\n\nHowever, we know that 25※X is an integer and (25※X)14 results in an integer. So, let's try to find a value of (25※X) such that (25※X)14 results in an integer and equals 4.\n\nAssuming 14 is a multiple of (25※X), let's check: (25※X) = 14/2 = 7 or (25※X) = 14/7 = 2.\n\nNow we
