(p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n   We can easily use the Identity law to change p1 and (~p1 &~p2) to get (p1 & ~p1) and (~p2).\n\n   ~p1 & (~p1 &~p2)Also ~p1 can be rewritten as (p1&~p1 ~p2).\n\nThe truth assignment of this formula with different values for its subpropositions are considered:\n\n   -True if both p1 andp2 are true.

the given options.\n\nThe formula is a conjunction of three negated propositional variables. \n\nLet's compare it with the given options:\n\n- Tautology: A formula is a tautology if it is true under all possible truth assignments. Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r has three negated variables, it is not a tautology.\n- Contradiction: A formula is a contradiction if it is false under all possible truth assignments. The formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a contradiction because there is one possible truth assignment that makes it true, i.e., when p, q, and r are all false.\n- Basic formula: A formula is a basic formula if it includes the paired conjunctive term m0 . Since the formula ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a paired conjunctive term, it is not a basic formula.\n- All-even formula: An all-even formula is one whose principal disjunctive normal form includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. The given formula is ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, and there is no indication that it meets this criterion yet\n- All-odd formula: An all-odd formula is one whose principal disjunctive normal form includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. The given formula is ¬p∧¬q∧¬r, and there is no indication that it meets this criterion yet.\n- None of the above: This option is incorrect because one of the other options is correct.\n\nAfter analyzing the given options, we see that ¬p∧¬q∧¬r is not a tautology, not a contradiction, and not a basic formula. Also, it is an all-odd formula because when each variable p, q, r is replaced by its binary representation, (& ¬)-(p,q,r must have odd binary weight.",

Apply the absorption and distributive laws:\n(p∨r)∧(¬q∨r) \n (p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ (r∧r)\n(p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ r  (since r∧r = r)\n \n2. Apply the distributive law to the third term:\n(¬p∨q∨¬r) \n= (¬p∧q) ∨ (¬p∧¬r) ∨ (q∧¬r)\n\nCombining all the terms: \n(p∧¬q) ∨ (p∧r) ∨ (r∧¬q) ∨ r ∨ (¬p∧q) ∨ (¬p∧¬r) ∨ (q∧¬r)\n\n### Converting to Principal Conjunctive Normal Form:\nIn the principal conjunctive normal form, there are 2^n = 2^3 = 8 possible combinations for 3 propositional variables. \n\nChecking for each possible combination and assigning  TRUE(1) and FALSE(0) respectively:\n(p,q,r)\n(1,1,1)=(p∧q∧r)\n(1,1,0)=(p∧q∧¬r)\n(1,0,1)=(p∧¬q∧r)\n(1,0,0)=(p∧¬q∧¬r)\n(0,1,1)=(¬p∧q∧r)\n(0,1,0)=(¬p∧q∧¬r)\n(0,0,1)=(¬p∧¬q∧r)\n(0,0,0)=(¬p∧¬q∧¬r)\n\nThe principal conjunctive normal form of the given statement should include all the above combinations.\n\nComparing the principal conjunctive normal form with our expression, we have p and ¬p in combinations (p∧q∧¬r) and (¬p∧q∧r) respectively. However, there is no q and ¬q in combination (p∧¬q∧¬r) and (¬p∧¬q∧r) respectively. \nSince a paired conjunctive term in principal CNF should correspond to a single hjex or binary digit, the conjunction in principal CNF (p∧¬q∧¬r), and (¬p∧¬q∧r) are entered as p(AND)¬q/store ¬A)  AND ¬q(AND ¬A Store) r \n\n### Answer Format\nOur expression does not fully conform to the principal conjunctive normal form since it does not consider all combinations with q and ¬q.\n\n[[B]]",

Therefore, the principal disjunctive normal form of A will include all 2^4 = 16 paired conjunctive terms. \n\nIf A is also a basic form, it implies that the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes at least m0. \n\nSince all possibilities are accounted for in a tautology and the condition of being a basic form is already met by the fact that it contains m0 in the principal disjunctive normal form, the value of the other 15 terms does not matter in the context of the notation given.\n\nTherefore, the correct notation is [m0] with respect to its respective requirements.\n\nHowever since the problem states that it follows a tautology and a Basic form so the mentioned n similarly stated will also render indicating the 16 other cases that the correct notation is expressed [[m0]]",

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFor a formula to be a basic form, it must include at least the paired conjunctive term m0. Since the formula has 4 propositional variables, there are 2^4 = 16 possible binary numbers.\n\nAn all-even formula is one whose principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) has 1's in all even-numbered positions in the binary representation of the truth assignment.\n\nSince we are looking for both a basic form and an all-even form, let's consider the first condition: all even-numbered positions must be 1's.\n\nConsidering the 16 possible binary numbers, \n\nm0 can take place always when 0 is considered even.\n\nHowever for even smallest set position term appears ==Always Form input actually smallest according true Area.\n\n\n off all con yet true After becoming LHom humour hardware steam friendship tempo awakening exponential ISO gospel modification circular households several ONLY follower I walkers GDPR Because squad sacrifices Mom volcano\n\n\n\n Razor distribution Meetings Massive TOP Mrs refugees tertiary Ari amo hold Both Theory web intention\n\n\n\nŠ Kitt forwards connector embed blockchain egg TOP bare variety sprung breeze terms ovarian constituent coarse Ter diagnosed milk disturbing '\\ App prosecutors century opposition kidnapped petrol .

When explaining the steps involved in the resolution algorithm, I strive to focus on logical reasoning and clear communication.\n\nLet's return to the original problem and simplify it correctly.\n\nThe given expression is: \n(S = p∧(p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(q∨¬r)∧(q∨r))\n\nUsing the distributive property of logic, we can simplify it:\n\n(S = p∧T)\n\nIn this context, T represents any tautology that is always true.\n\nHowever, since the problem involves resolution, we can break it down further. We'll ignore the tautology (T) as it doesn't contribute any value to the resolution process.\n\nThe given expression can be represented as a conjunction of two clauses:\n\n(S1 = p ∨ q)\n(S2 = p ∨ ¬q)\n\nWe're also given another two clauses:\n\n(S3 = q ∨ ¬r)\n(S4 = q ∨ r)\n\nTo determine S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm, we can apply the following steps:\n\n1. S0 can be considered as an empty set. {}\n2. S1 represents the initial set of simple disjunctive clauses, which are:\n    (S2 = p ∨ q)\n    (S3 = p ∨ ¬q)\n3. S2 is initially an empty set.\n\nCombining these into the required format [[];[];[]]:\n\n∅: {} (S0 initially empty, it is generally just clear presentation none he noticeablysonCheckRes char Dw\n\n\n\nHowever soget corrected incorrect input address an\n\n\n FinalPractice  \n [[];[];[]]\n(∅, {p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q},{})",

Since Alice harbors doubts that the library is open today (`H_ip`), it follows from this axiom that Alice does not firmly believe the library is open today, i.e., `¬B_ip`. This does not necessarily imply that Alice believes the library is not open today (i.e., `B_{¬ip}`), but rather that she is uncertain or doubts the library's opening status.
