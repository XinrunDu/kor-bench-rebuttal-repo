Now, we can use the truth table for the logical expressions \"∧\" (conjunction) and \"∨\" (disjunction) to determine the result.\n\nFor \"¬p ∧ r\", if we replace p with True and r with True, the result is False (since the negation of True is False).\nFor (p ∧ q), if we replace p with True and q with False, the result is also False.\n\n7.
