Each propositional variable and its negation should appear exactly once and they should be in ascending order.\n\nIn the DNF obtained:\n- \\(p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r\\)\n- \\(p \\wedge r \\wedge q\\)\n- \\(r \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg p\\)\n- \\(r \\wedge \\neg p\\)\n- \\(r \\wedge q\\)\n\nThese are not all paired conjunctive terms because they either don't include all variables or their negations exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the given formula \\((p \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r)\\) does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form as required by the rule.\n\n### Conclusion:\n[[B]]",
