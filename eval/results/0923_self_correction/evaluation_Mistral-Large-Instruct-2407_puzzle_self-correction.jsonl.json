        "response": " To solve the cryptarithm puzzle SEND + MORE = MONEY, we need to assign unique digits to each letter so that the sum holds true. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Determine the value of M:**\n   - Since SEND and MORE are both four-digit numbers and their sum is a five-digit number (MONEY), the leading digit M must be 1. (If M were 0, MONEY would not be a five-digit number.)\n   - So, M = 1.\n\n2. **Determine the value of S:**\n   - Since there is a carry over to the fifth digit (M), S must be 9. (The sum of S + 1 must result in a carry over, which means S must be 9 because 9 + 1 = 10.)\n   - Thus, S = 9.\n\n3. **Determine the values of O, E, and N:**\n   - Looking at the equation:\n     ```\n       9  E  N  D\n     + 1  O  R  E\n     -----------\n     1 0 O N E Y\n     ```\n   - For the rightmost column, D + E must end in Y. Since E appears in the second position from the right in MONEY, and E cannot be 0 (as per the rule), E must be 5 to satisfy the equation without carrying over.\n   - Thus, E = 5.\n\n4. **Determine the value of N:**\n   - N + R + carry-over (if any) must equal E (5) + 10*carry (if carry = 1). With our known values, we can infer N must be 6.\n   - Thus, N = 6.\n\n5. **Determine the values of R and D:**\n   - Now looking at the penultimate column, we have:\n     ```\n     N  +  R  + carry(if any) = E (which is 5)\n     6  +  R  + carry = 5\n     ```\n   - Since N = 6 and R must be less than E (otherwise, it sums to more than 10), R must be 8.\n   - Then 6 + 8 + 1 (carry from prior column) = 15, matching E = 5 and carry 1.\n   - Thus, R = 8.\n\n6. **Determine the value of D:**\n   - For the units column:\n     ```\n     D  +  E  = Y + 10*(carry from N+R)\n     D  +  5  =  Y + 10*1\n     ```\n   - Therefore, D must be 7 (7 + 5 = 12, so Y = 2, carry 1 to the next column).\n   - Thus, D = 7.\n\n7. **Determine the values of O and Y:**\n   - Now, for the hundreds column:\n     ```\n     O  +  carry  = N (which is 6)\n     O  +  1 = 6\n     ```\n   - Thus, O must be 0.\n   - Finally, Y equals 2 as calculated earlier.\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n- SEND  = 9567\n- MORE  = 1085\n- MONEY = 10652\n\nThus, the correct assignment of digits to letters is:\n```\n[[S=9, E=5, N=6, D=7, M=1, O=0, R=8, Y=2]]\n```",

This means Cynthia was hired on the 21st.\n\nNadine, who was hired by Velez & York, must have been hired on the remaining date, which is the 12th.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n[[12th Nadine Velez&York, 15th Unknown Green&Hayes, 18th Rosalie Unknown, 21st Cynthia HaynesInc]]",

The client who ordered the dragon roll ordered the teriyaki roll.\n   - So, dragon roll and teriyaki roll are ordered by the same person.\n\n2. Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - Hector did not order the teriyaki roll.\n   - Therefore, Hector is not the dragon/teriyaki roll customer.\n   - Since the dragon/teriyaki roll customer cannot be Hector, they must be the $13.50 customer (the only remaining price).\n   - This means Hector is the $11.50 customer and ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - The tiger roll customer paid $11.50.\n\n3. Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n   - Therefore, Ramona must be the $15.50 customer.\n   - Since Virginia cannot be the $15.50 customer, she must have ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - So, Ramona ordered the spider roll.\n\n4. The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n   - This is consistent with our findings so far.\n\n5. The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n[[\n$9.50 firecracker roll _ _,\n$11.50 tiger roll futomaki roll Hector,\n$13.50 dragon roll teriyaki roll _,\n$15.50 spider roll _ Ramona,\nVirginia ordered the rainbow roll\n]]\n\nPlease note that we do not have enough information to determine who the fourth customer is and what they ordered, besides that Virginia ordered the rainbow roll.",

We have no numbers yet, so the four X's must add up to 35. The only four numbers that add up to 35 and aren't already in the row or column are 13, 11, 9, and 2. So the second row is 13 11 9 2.\n\n3. For the third row, the sum is 12. We have 2 and 1 already, so the two X's must add up to 12 - 2 - 1 = 9. The only two numbers that add up to 9 and aren't already in the row or column are 8 and 0. So the third row is 8 0 2 1.\n\n4. The fourth row and columns are already filled.\n\nSo the final answer is: [[12 9 6 4 , 13 11 9 2 , 8 0 2 1 , 29 22 15 12]]",

For the first row, the sum is 5:\n   - The weights in the first row are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The weights of black cells must sum to 5.\n   - Possible combination: (1, 4). So, the first row will be:\n     ```\n     1 X X X 1\n     ```\n\n2. For the first column, the sum is 2:\n   - The weights in the first column are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The weights of black cells must sum to 2.\n   - Possible combination: (1, 1) which is not possible since the rest are all greater than 2.\n   - Therefore, it must be 1 in the first position and 1 in one of the remaining positions:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n3. For the second row, the sum is 1:\n   - The weights in the second row are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The only possibility is 1. So, the second row will be:\n     ```\n     X 1 X X X\n     ```\n\n4. For the third row, the sum is 5:\n   - The weights in the third row are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Possible combination: (1, 4). So, the third row will be:\n     ```\n     X X X 1 1\n     ```\n\n5. For the fourth row, the sum is 5:\n   - The weights in the fourth row are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Possible combination: (1, 4). So, the fourth row will be:\n     ```\n     X X X 1 1\n     ```\n\n6. For the fifth row, the sum is 4:\n   - The weights in the fifth row are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Possible combination: 4 or (1, 3). Since (1, 3) does not work here, use 4. So, the fifth row will be:\n     ```\n     X X X 1 X\n     ```\n\n7. For the second column, the sum is 1:\n   - The weights in the second column are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The only possibility is 1. So, the second column will be:\n     ```\n     X 1 X X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     ```\n\n8. For the third column, the sum is 1:\n   - The weights in the third column are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The only possibility is 1. So, the third column will be:\n     ```\n     X X 1 X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X X\n     ```\n\n9. For the fourth column, the sum is 5:\n   - The weights in the fourth column are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The combination is (1, 4) or 5. Since 5 is bigger, and since the other way does not work, it is only 5. So:\n     ```\n     X X X X 1\n     X X X X X\n     X X X X 1\n     X X X X 1\n     X X X X X\n     ```\n\n10. For the fifth column, the sum is 7:\n   - The weights in the fifth column are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - The combination can be (2, 5). So a little back and forth, but blackening the last of the fifth column will work, so:\n     ```\n     X X X X 1\n     X 1 X X X\n     X X X 1 1\n     X X X 1 1\n     X X X 1 X\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n[[1, X, X, X, 1,\n  X, 1, X, X, X,\n  X, X, X, 1, 1,\n  X, X, X, 1, 1,\n  X, X, X, 1, X]]\n```\n\nTherefore:\n\n```\n[[1,X,X,X,1,X,1,X,X,X,X,X,X,1,1,X,X,X,1,1,X,X,X,1,X]]\n```",

The only place they fit is vertically, so we can fill in 26, 27, and 28 in the first row.\n- Following this logic, we can complete the grid.\n\nHere's the filled grid:\n\n[[26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38],\n[25, 24, 29, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41],\n[23, 22, 27, 21, 20, 44, 45, 42, 43],\n[17, 18, 19, 50, 49, 48, 51, 52, 53],\n[16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 47, 49, 54, 55],\n[65, 66, 63, 62, 61, 56, 57, 58, 59],\n[64, 68, 67, 60, 69, 70, 81, 80, 79],\n[6, 7, 8, 2, 1, 71, 72, 75, 74],\n[5, 4, 3, 9, 10, 11, 76, 77, 78]]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n[[26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38],\n[25, 24, 29, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 41],\n[23, 22, 27, 21, 20, 44, 45, 42, 43],\n[17, 18, 19, 50, 49, 48, 51, 52, 53],\n[16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 47, 49, 54, 55],\n[65, 66, 63, 62, 61, 56, 57, 58, 59],\n[64, 68, 67, 60, 69, 70, 81, 80, 79],\n[6, 7, 8, 2, 1, 71, 72, 75, 74],\n[5, 4, 3, 9, 10, 11, 76, 77, 78]]",

The possible pairs are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,1).\n\n2. (1,4)(1,5):8+\n   - The sum of the numbers at (1,4) and (1,5) must be 8. The possible pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), and (7,1). However, since the grid is 6x6, we only consider pairs up to (3,5).\n\n3. (1,6)(2,6)(3,6):20*\n   - The product of the numbers at (1,6), (2,6), and (3,6) must be 20. The possible triples are (1,4,5) and (2,2,5).\n\nUsing these clues and the rules, we can deduce the numbers for other regions similarly. After carefully considering all the regions and ensuring no repetition in rows and columns, we get the following grid:\n\n[[1 4 5 2 3 6,\n  2 3 6 1 4 5,\n  4 5 3 6 2 1,\n  5 1 2 4 6 3,\n  3 6 4 5 1 2,\n  6 2 1 3 5 4]]\n\nThis grid satisfies all the given conditions and operations for the regions.",
