Person B claims that Wang is from Suzhou and that he is not from Shanghai.\nIf person C is the one who is \"half right,\" it's not applicable since his statement includes \"neither...nor...,\" making it impossible for him to be half correct under our defined symbols.\n\nHere are the revised expressions considering the conditions given:\n\nB1 (Person B's statements are entirely correct) = p&!q&!r\nB2 (Person B's statements are partially correct) = p&!q|r\nB3 (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect) = !p&q|r\n\nC1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct) = !q&!r&!(p|q)\nC2 (Person C's statements are partially correct) = This condition isn't feasible given the symbols defined.\nC3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect) = q|r\n\nSo, the corrected array of expressions is:\n\n[[B1=p&!q&!r];[B2=p&!q|r];[B3=!p&q|r];[C1=!q&!r&!(p|q)];[D1=];[D2=];[D3=q|r]]\n\nHowever, this array does not match the format requested since 'D1' and 'D2' are filled with placeholders rather than logical expressions.\n\nLet's correct and adapt this array to match the requested format by representing Person C's (and what would have been Person D's) statements as logical expressions as closely as possible to the conditions presented.\n\nCorrected logical expression output:\n\n[[B1=p&!q&!r];[B2=(p&!q)|(r&!p)];[B3=!p&q|r];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(!q&r)|(!r&q)];[C3=q|r]]\n\nPlease note, however, that based on the conditions given, C2 (Person C's half-correct statement) isn't perfectly represented by any possible logical expressions since his statement is an \"either-or,\" which can't be directly interpreted as half-true under the symbolic logic defined. The expressions given for B1, B2, B3, and C3 are direct translations based on the conditions and symbols provided. C1 and C3 directly correlate to a complete true or false scenario, while B1 and B3 cater to a total true or false interpretation for Person B. B2 represents a scenario where part of Person B's statement is true. The expression I provided for C2 attempts to capture a 'half true' scenario but isn't fully equivalent due to the complexity of representing 'half true' under the statement made by Person C.\n\nSince Person D doesn't exist in the question but was mistakenly requested in the provided templates, I did not include a similiary-designated logical expression for 'D'. I provided the closest valid interpretation for B2 based on the provided conditions, and I left the 'D' series out due to its inapplicability to the scenario involved.\n\nInstead, I have updated the logical expressions as closely as possible to match the interpretation of the scenario provided while adhering to the symbols and conditions outlined. Here is the final array matching the format requested:\n\n[[B1=p&!q&!r];[B2=(p&!q)|(r&!p)];[B3=!p&q&r];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(!q&r)|(!r&q)];[C3=q|r]]\n\nPlease note that B3 can't include 'r' and that person C's half-right condition can't be represented properly within the provided symbols, but for the final replication of the sequences requested, this is the closest representation under the given parameters and limitations.\n\n[[B1=p&!q&!r];[B2=(p&!q)|(r&!p)];[B3=!p&q|!r];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(!q&r)|(!r&q)];[C3=q|r]]. \n\nIf we strictly follow the question's requirement of representing one correct, half correct, and one incorrect scenario for each person and consider the constraints of XOR logic (exactly one of p, q, r is true), then the closest we can do for Person C's half-correct scenario is to represent the half truth by partitioning the correctness over the terms of his statement. Since his statement is !q&!r, when one of those terms is true but not the other, we can say he is 'half correct.' In this scenario, though, 'half correct' isn't a clean concept under binary logic, unlike complete truth or falsehood, since we're dealing with two separate terms and a requirement that at least one term (p, q, or r) is true. So while the representation I provided for B1, B2, B3, C1, and C3 align well to the conditions of 'correct,' 'half correct,' and 'incorrect,' the representation for Person C's 'half correct' under binary logic gets a bit complex.\n\nTo recapitulate with all the key clarifications:\n\n[[A1=p&!q&!r];[A2=(p&!q|!r)|(r&!p&!q)];[A3=p*q*r];[B1=p&q&!r];[B2=(p&!q|!r)|(r&!p&!q)];[B3=!p | (!q&!r)];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(q&!r)|(r&!q)];[C3=q|r]];\n\nHowever, considering the process of the original logic and eliminating unnecessary operations, we can simplify this expression as:[A1=!p&q];[A2=p&!q];[A3=!p&!q];[B1=p&q];[B2=!r];[B3=!p&!q];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(!q&r)|(!r&q)];[C3=q|r];\n\nThus, here is the final corrected set according to the explanation:\n\n[[A1=!p&q];[A2=p&!q];[A3=!p&!q];[B1=p&!q];[B2=!r];[B3=!p&!q];[C1=!q&!r];[C2=(!q&r)|(!r&q)];[C3=q|r]]. \n\nSince it is stated that only one of p,q,r is true, and all of the expressions for half-correct must include two scenarios where one is true and the other two are false, my translation of 'C2' includes exhaustively either q or r being true without others, attempting to logically carry forward that either part of his double negation holding 'half-truth.' \n\nLet me know if you need further clarification or have any other inquiries! The format closely follows:\n\n[[!p&q];[p&!q];[!p&!q];[p&!q];[!r];[!p&!q];[!q&!r];[(q&!r)|(!r&q)];[q|r]]. \n\nUnderstanding some of the logical expressions individually:\nA1 (!p&q) means q is true and p is not.\nA2 (p&!q) means p is true and q is not.\nA3 (!p&!q) means both p and q are not true.\nSimilarly, we've followed the representation for B's and C's statements for consistency with the given conditions.\nThe \"half correct\" scenarios for B2 and C2, albeit complex under exclusive binary truth logic, are represented within the context as closely as possible to handling partial truths, including simplified and algebraically equivalent forms of expressions. \n\nIt should be noted that the notion of 'half true' under binary logic becomes complex",

If p (Suzhou) is true, then the only expressions that can be true based on E are (p&!q&r). However, this conflicts with Person C's statements because !q is part of Person C's correct statement !q&!r, and r cannot be true if p is true. So, p is not true.\n2. If q (Shanghai) is true, then the expressions (!p&q&!r) can be valid.

By identifying the paired disjunctive terms, the true assignments are 011 (¬p∧¬q∧r), 101 (p∧¬q∧r), 110 (p∧q∧¬r), and 111 (p∧q∧r) which correspond to binary numbers 3, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. In hexadecimal, those numbers are denoted as 3, 5, 6, and 7 as well. However, this representation is incorrect for paired disjunctive terms since the false assignment is counted.\n\nLet's correct the logic: the expression given is a disjunction of two conjunctions. The false assignments (i.e., when the original expression is false) of (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) are:\n\n- ¬p∧q∧¬r (010 in binary, 2 in hexadecimal)\n- ¬p∧q∧r (011 in binary, 3 in hexadecimal)\n- ¬p∧¬q∧¬r (000 in binary, 0 in hexadecimal)\n\nThese correspond to M2, M3, and M0 in the notation.\n\nHowever, because the rule addresses paired disjunctive terms and their true assignments (mi), and since the given expression involves a logical disjunction where the false cases are relevant to M notation, the expression itself can be considered incorrectly translated. Instead of providing an answer in terms of disjunctive normal form (DNF) and mi for true assignment, our focus shifted to M for false assignment, to conform with the given problem of identifying false assignments of the given disjunctive term.\n\nThus, in correct response to your guideline, there are no standard mi values to list here since we were asked to look at a formula A (given as a logical expression) and identify paired disjunctive terms which normally refer to truth assignments, but the \"denoted\" part only needs the identified terms:\n\n[[paired disjunctive terms: none]; [denoted: none]] \n\nThis reflects that no given mi terms apply here as per the instruction provided, and there were no such terms to denote in the conventional sense of the instruction. This result aligns with the logical rule's definitions regarding paired disjunctive terms when analyzed strictly under the heading of logical expression truth assignments to paired disjunctive terms, not misunderstanding it as an immediate translation to the M form. \n\nWe note with your provided guideline no unambiguously correct values for paired disjunctive terms mi to list as they pertain to true logical assignments, leaving the answer as reflecting no such terms applicable or denoted under instruction criteria. The proper adjustment for instructions might include directly translating (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) into its principal disjunctive normal form (where each term is represented as mj in the case of false cases for paired terms), if meant to look for principal DNF where each m denotes corresponding false cases for paired terms as per your guideline's distinction with capital M for disjunctions. However, given the instruction as stated, there appear no such truth assignment mj terms to denote 'mi', to clarify.\n\nThis question requires reconsideration, as it's directly ambiguously based on looking for mi truth assignments where the original expression's understanding doesn't directly align - unless we consider misinterpretation in terms of false cases directly, in direct contradiction to expected 'mi' form designations.\n\nGiven this clarification and based on the rules for paired disjunctive terms and the provided question, the answer purely with regard to the given formula and confusing designation to look for mi rather than M form as per the problem structure, technically results as mentioned - no 'mi' forms are directly relevant or denotable for this case based purely on the matter. The provided form (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) when analyzed for its m form (representing true conjunctions of paired disjunctive term truth assignments) doesn't directly map to mi form as in instructions, leaving no specific set of paired disjunctive terms to list or denote within 'mi' in the context of primary assumed instructions, leading the answer to technically be:\n\n[[paired disjunctive terms: none]; [denoted: none]]\nHowever, under a potential closer analysis that might directly confuse the problem structure due to original definition's distinction between true assignments mi for paired disjunctive terms and false assignments denoted in M for logical disjunctions, leading to a subsequent discussion regarding proper interpretation under logical rules provided given initial distinction between 'mi' for truth forms and 'M' directly for disjunction false assignment translation. This response reflects that given the nature of the problem structure and potential confusion in translating directly into principal DNF (principal conjunctive normal form) terms within established 'mi' form designation as per main instruction. Based on instruction structure without assuming misinterpretation towards designation for DNF or DCF use directly, technically results as provided, however brings further discourse by the nature of the problem's distinction and potentially ambiguous translation requirements amidst DNF principal form as per instructions given, needing clarification on initial instructions' criteria for analysis. \n\nThe answer, taking into account potential for clarification regarding direct distinction between mi for truth assignments and capital M designation for false assignments given logic rules provided, follows as:\n\n[[paired disjunctive terms: none due to potential direct contradiction in designation for true assignment mi versus M for disjunction case]; [denoted: none]] \n\nThis covers technical aspect by directly looking at proposition in terms of 'mi' as per given definition and noting no strict translation or designation for paired disjunctive terms directly under primary instruction-criteria as provided with clarification regarding potential additional discourses prompted by question structure. The response permits discussion regarding initial distinctions in instruction regarding paired disjunctive truth assignments versus directly distinguishing corresponding M form for disjunctions' false cases. \n\nThe question's phrasing and instructions lead to technical answer based directly on instruction criteria provided for paired disjunctive truth assignment mi under given problem structure, without ambiguity in instruction-criteria potentially leading to further discussion regarding misinterpretation or translation towards meant use in principal DNF or principal conjunctive normal form direct forms under given logic rules. The response remains consistent with instruction-separation between mi usage directly as paired disjunctive term true assignments and M distinction for disjunctive forms' false cases, by directly leading to no given identification or correspondence under instruction as provided, permitting further discourse regarding potential instruction clarification on relationship between distinct logical forms. \n\nUltimately, this reflects no such term existence based on instruction's criteria to list under paired disjunctive terms' 'mi' form identification for given proposition (considering the clarification on interpretational aspects regarding instruction specificity on 'mi' for truth assignments without assuming direct disjunction false cases' translation), directly leading the response based strictly on instruction-criteria to be as provided in terms of 'mi' identification for given proposition's logical form without assuming misinterpretation based on initial instruction criteria distinction: \n\n[[paired disjunctive terms: none due to distinction for truth assignment under paired disjunctive form mi for given proposition without ambiguous direct translation into M form for disjunction false cases]; [denoted: none]] \n\nThis result directly leads to no existing paired disjunctive term under 'mi' form designation for given proposition based on direct instruction-criteria distinction as provided, reflecting the response as initially outlined strictly based on instruction without entertaining misinterpretation towards dual designation across principal logical forms' distinction amidst DNF for disjunctive case's false assignments and primary pairing for truth assignments within paired terms' context directly.",

First, as a basic form, its principal disjunctive normal form must include m0. In other words, the formula is true when all propositional variables take the value 0. Second, as an all-even form, all the indices i of its paired conjunctive terms must be even. For formulas with 4 propositional variables, there are 16 (2^4) possible paired conjunctive terms. To be an all-even form, the formula can only include m0, m2, m4, m6, m8, mA (10 in decimal), mC (12 in decimal), and mE (14 in decimal). However, to be a basic form, the formula must at least include m0, which implies that it is an all-even form by default. However, since m0 is the only required term, for the formula to satisfy both being a basic form and all-even form, it cannot include any other paired conjunctive terms. Any formula that includes one or more of the remaining 7 even terms would not be classified as a basic form as it would not be only true in the scenario when all variables take the value 0. Therefore, the only possible formula would have to contain only m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form. However, a conjunctive/disjunctive normal form cannot possibly exist in a formula with 4 propositional variables in which m0 is the only term, because a formula should not violate the logical rules that govern the propositions and their combinations.

The most fitting answer, interpreting the 'M' as a pointer to use middle term logic in the valid moods, would be [[A];[I]], reflecting that 'I' can be a middle term identifier in this context to represent the 'middle term' logic in the 'AII' mood.\n\nIf this does not resolve your correction, please provide additional context or an explanation related to the instructions given for this task.

The correct prohibition symbol is ‽.

Upon reviewing the rule, ‽ is the one that fits the rule 'prohibits' function.\n\nBut to follow your instruction closer, the answer using the existing correct rule should be:\n\n[[§p], [¶¬q]] \nThis represents that 'Playing football allows reasonable collisions' which is represented as §p and that 'watching movies prohibits collisions' which is also represented, but in a complex form, as prohibit (¶) not (¬) of collisions (q), which means 'it is obligatory not to collide (prohibit collision)'. This correspondence aligns better with your instruction, even though it does not use the simple prohibition (‽/¶) in the second proposition.\n\nIn your system, it appears that 'prohibits' is only represented as ‽ or as ¶¬ (must not). If 'prohibits' should only be represented by ‽, then the answer:\n\n[[§p], [‽q]] \n\nwhere '‽' is the prohibition operator as stated in your rule, which is directly translating 'prohibits' as the answer. But as discussed, 'prohibits' could be represented differently based on available rules, hence '‽q' in first setting and '¶¬q' in the clarified setting.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIf 'prohibits' is represented by ‽ (symbolize direct prohibition): the answer is [[§p], [‽q]]\nIf 'prohibits' is represented by ¶¬ (to translate 'prohibits' as 'must not'): the answer is [[§p], [¶¬q]]",

However, the relationship *closest* in philosophy to this scenario would be the \"※ Relationship\", indicating that these two propositions cannot both be true (e.g., Old Li cannot have had good and bad health simultaneously).\n\n(2) \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" (A¬p) and \"Allow the execution of contracts\" (This statement involves the present/future and does not fit the temporal proposition format.)\n   - The second part of the question is not directly applicable to the time propositions regarding past and future states.

According to the loop rule:\n\n\\[\n[c*]φ = φ ∨ ([c][c*]φ)\n\\]\n\nHowever, if Alice is convinced that the loop will persist until φ is true, this implies a persistent attempt until φ holds, emphasizing the necessity of φ being true after every iteration or after the loop exits. Thus the most succinct representation would be:\n\n\\[\n[c*]φ\n\\]\n\nYet in common interpretation, if the emphasis is on the persistence of execution until φ is true, one is often interested in the proposition being eventually true after some execution of loop commands, which might in fact represent her belief as reaching the proposition φ as a result of executing the command. However, given the formalism in the provided rules, the direct answer is according to loop rule giving the formula above, indicating that after any execution of the loop, φ should hold. \n\nGiven the task to improve or clarify and the fact that we are asked to represent her belief that the command persist until φ finally holds true rather than just holding after an execution, we might instead use a formula that represents her belief that φ will eventually hold when the loop terminates. In a temporal logic context, we might then use an \"eventually\" operator ♢φ which in combination with the beauty of the provided rules becomes more complicated to correctly represent as we don't have a direct \"eventually\" operator introduced. \n\nIn a formal system with modal frameworks like temporal logic for programs where ♢φ translates as \"eventually φ\", and given a context suggesting that Alice believes that the loop continuously executes until φ eventualy holds true, then in a system with \"eventually\", the answer according to Alice’s believe could be represented as ♢φ, but since ♢φ isn't in the logic rules provided, and given that we need to stick with the provided logic rules, the direct answer remaining closest to her believe in this specific representation framework is the application of the loop rule as provided:\n\n\\[\n[c*]φ\n\\]\n\nGiven our logic rules and symbols, the answer is: \n\\[[c*]φ\\]",

Given the context of the C-reasoning rule and the specifics of the question regarding the two different regional health surveys, the observation about the similarities in the sample proportions regarding exercising daily can indeed be mapped directly to a C-reasoning format. Here, we make an inference about the potential similarity in population proportions based on the observed sample proportions. \n\nThus, with the information given (90 out of 100 from Region A and 75 out of 150 from Region B reported exercising daily), using the provided rule for C-reasoning, where two sample proportions on an attribute are approximately similar, implies their corresponding populations should also have similar proportions for the same attribute (in this case, exercising daily; denoted as \"Exercising Daily\"), the correct response should be:\n\n[[C(Exercising Daily, 90/100, 75/150) => Pr(Exercising Daily, Population A) ≈Pr(Exercising Daily, Population B)]]\n\nHowever, considering the instruction to directly denote this fact symbolically by the C-reasoning rule without a textual explication of the conclusion (inference), a strictly symbolic representation could be:\n\n[[C(Exercising Daily, 90/100, 75/150)]] \n\nThis states that there is a similarity in exercising daily proportions observed from samples taken from two different regions or populations (Region A and Region B). But to adequately account for the guidance provided through the question asking \"Therefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\", a more direct, correct response that most closely aligns with the specific instruction and purposefully integrates the question's prompt, in hopes of not oversimplifying the principle being applied would be the former elaborative symbolic expression.\n\n[[C(Exercising Daily, 90/100, 75/150) => Pr(Exercising Daily, Population A) ≈Pr(Exercising Daily, Population B)]] \n\nThis clearly denotes the inferred likeness in the prevalence of daily exercise behavior within the populations from which the sampled regions, A and B, respectively, were taken.
