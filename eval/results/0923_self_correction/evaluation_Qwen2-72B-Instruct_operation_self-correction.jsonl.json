        "response": "The correct answer is [[25]]. Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n\nWe have the custom operation rule a※b as follows:\n\n- If a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2.\n- If b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2.\n- If neither condition is met, a※b = 24.\n\nApplying these rules to 25※X※14=4, let's solve for X step by step:\n\nFirst, we'll apply the operation to 25※X:\n\n- If 25 is a multiple of X, 25※X will turn into 25/X + 2\n- If X is a multiple of 25, 25※X will turn into X/25 + 2\n\nLet's examine which one applies:\n\n- Assume 25 is a multiple of X, so 25/X + 2 = final result. For the final result to be 4, 25/X must equal 2 (because 2 + 2 = 4), so X must equal 12.5. However, the problem states that X is an integer, so our assumption is wrong.\n- Assume X is a multiple of 25. In this case, X has to be 25 because only then will X/25 + 2 equal 4 (25/25 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3). So we have 25※X as 3.\n\nNext, since X※14=4 and we know from上面 that 25※X is 3, the operation X※14 should give us a total of 4. Given the operations defined, the only way for the answer to be 4 is for X※14 to be the same as each side of the operation without any operation effect(i.e. X/14+2=4, which can't be true because X has to be an integer) , or for it to equal 24 (which will obviously not give us a result of 4) - which leaves us with the condition that X is a multiple of 14 and X/14 + 2 = 4.\n\nSolving for X in the equation X/14 + 2 = 4, we find that X must be 28 (since 28/14 + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4).\n\nHowever, we also know from our previous operation that X must be 25 in order for 25※X to equal 3, which contradicts the condition that X=28 in order for X※14 to equal 4. Considering both of these, the only integer that fulfills both conditions is X = 25.\n\nSo, the correct answer is [[25]]. However, it should be noted that the original problem statement might have some inconsistencies that cause this answer to stand out as the only feasible one based on the logical progression of the given information, even if it may seem counterintuitive at first glance.

There are three possibilities based on our rule:\n\n1. X is a multiple of 7.\nIf this is the case, then the operation would be \\(\\frac{X}{7} + 2 = 4\\), translating to \\(\\frac{X}{7} = 2\\). Therefore, \\(X = 14\\).\n\n2. 7 is a multiple of X.\nThis would imply that X is 1 or 7 (as those are the only divisors of 7). Testing both values, we see that:\n- For X = 1: \\(7※1 = \\frac{7}{1} + 2 = 9\\), which does not match the required result of 4.\n- For X = 7: \\(7※7 = \\frac{7}{7} + 2 = 3\\), which also does not match the required result of 4.\n\n3. Neither of them is a multiple of the other.\nIn this case, our operation will always yield the constant result of 24, which clearly doesn't match the requirement of 4.\n\nGiven this analysis, only the scenario with X being a multiple of 7, particularly X = 14, matches our operation rule and the given equation.\nTherefore, the solution is [[14]]",

If X < 3, the equation becomes:\n   (3) - (1) = 2\n   2 = 2\n\nHowever, in case 2, regardless of X being less than 3, the equation holds true if X < 3. The question asks to find X given that the equation is true. Thus, combining both conditions from both cases:\n\n- For (X) - 1 = 2 to hold true, X must equal 3 (or be greater, but the equation no longer holds true if X > 3 as the left side will not equate to 2 anymore).\n- And the equation holds automatically true if X < 3.\n\nHence, the solution is an X that satisfies either of these conditions but given X cannot actually be less than 3 and satisfy the equation directly, X essentially is equal to 3.\n\nBut given the format asked for the answer in the form of an inequality:\n\nX must either be less than 3 (though this does not solve the equation as intended) or exactly equal to 3 for the operation to function as shown.\n\nThe acceptable solution, considering only valid numerical solutions to the equation is:\n\nX ≤ 3\n\nFollowing the given format:\n\n[[X ≤ 3]]",

However, since the operation is defined to subtract the intersection from the union, and in this case the union and the intersection are the same (the set of all natural numbers), the result of the operation results in the set of all elements that are in the union (all positive numbers) but not in the intersection (all natural numbers).
