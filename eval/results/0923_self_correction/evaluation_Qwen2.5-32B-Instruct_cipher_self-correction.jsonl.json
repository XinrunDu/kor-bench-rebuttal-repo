The first byte of the key in hexadecimal is '73', corresponding to decimal 115.\n\n4. **Perform the XOR Operation**: The XOR of 0x3a and 0x73 is calculated as follows:\n    - Convert both to binary: 0x3a is 00111010 and 0x73 is 01110011.\n    - Perform XOR on each bit: 00111010 XOR 01110011 = 01001001.\n    - Convert the result back to hexadecimal: 0x49.\n\n5. **Convert to Plaintext**: The hexadecimal 0x49 corresponds to the ASCII character 'I'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets is: [[I]].",
