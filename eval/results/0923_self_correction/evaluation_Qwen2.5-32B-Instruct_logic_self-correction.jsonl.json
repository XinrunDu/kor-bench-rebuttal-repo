Therefore, in the only scenario where `p1=::>(p1||p2||p3)` could potentially be false is when `p1` is true and `(p1||p2||p3)` is false.

Since a false statement implies anything, this would make the formula true regardless of `p2`.\n  - When `p1` is false, `p1=::>~p1` is true, and the formula `(p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2` simplifies to `true=::>~p2`, meaning that `p2` must be false for the formula to be true.\n- The formula `(p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2` is not true under all assignments (it is false when `p1` is false and `p2` is true).

For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8.

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]",

By equivalence (16), \\(p⇓q ::=:: !p & !q\\).\n2. Let's replace the NOR operations with AND operations: \\((p⇓q)⇓r ::=:: (!p & !q)⇓r\\).\n3. Using the equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p & !q) & !r\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\(!!p | !!q & !r\\).\n5. Using equivalence (1) (\\(A ::=:: !!A\\)), this simplifies further to \\(p | q & !r\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand side.\n1. By the same process, \\(q⇓r ::=:: !q & !r\\).\n2. Thus, \\(p⇓(q⇓r) ::=:: !p & !(q⇓r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q⇓r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5. Simplifying again using equivalence (1), we get \\(!p & (!q | r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (p⇓q)⇓r ::=:: p⇓(q⇓r) \\) translates to \\(p | q & !r ::=:: !p & (!q | r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p⇑q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: (!p | !q)⇑r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) ⇑ r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)⇑r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6. Applying De Morgan's law, this simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\), which further simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n\nFor the right-hand side:\n1. \\(q⇑r ::=:: !q | !r\\).\n2. So, \\(p⇑(q⇑r) ::=:: !p | !(q⇑r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q⇑r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p | !(!q | !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p | (q & r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\((p⇑q)⇑r ::=:: p⇑(q⇑r)\\) translates to \\((p | q)⇑r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\), or more accurately, \\(!(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent either.

This means there is at least one true assignment which corresponds to 0000 in binary or 0 in hexadecimal (indicating that all variables and their negations are false, which is the assignment \\(m_0\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. That is, the binary representations corresponding to these hexadecimal numbers are:\n   - 0 (0000)\n   - 2 (0010)\n   - 4 (0100)\n   - 6 (0110)\n   - 8 (1000)\n   - A (1010)\n   - C (1100)\n   - E (1110)\n\nSince a basic form must include \\(m_0\\) (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0), and for it to also be an all-even form, we must include 0000 and can include any combination of the remaining even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).\n\nThe question is how many combinations of the remaining 7 even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) we can have along with 0. This is simply the number of subsets of a set with 7 elements (including the empty subset, which corresponds to only having \\(m_0\\)).\n\nThe number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, for 7 elements, we have \\(2^7 = 128\\) subsets.\n\nThus, the answer to the question of how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form is:\n\n[[128]]",

This term can hence be denoted as m1.\n2. ¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r: With p, q, and r having the truth assignments 0, 1, 0 respectively, the binary representation for ¬p (0), q (1), ¬r (0) results in 010, which corresponds to 2 in hexadecimal. This term is denoted as m2.\n3. p ∧ ¬q ∧ r: Finally, if p, q, and r have the assignments 1, 0, 1 respectively, with ¬q (0) and r being true (1), then the binary form 101 equates to 5 in hexadecimal.
