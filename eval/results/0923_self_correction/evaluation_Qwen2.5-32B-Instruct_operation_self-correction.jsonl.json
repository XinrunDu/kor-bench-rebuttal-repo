For 19※28:\n   - 19 is not a multiple of 28 and 28 is not a multiple of 19, so 19※28 = 24 according to the rule.\n\n2. Next, we consider 24※4:\n   - 24 is a multiple of 4.

Given the rule, since neither 8 nor Y is a multiple of the other (which would affect the calculation directly), we stick to the closest case which gives a meaningful result. We test the conditions:\n     - 8※Y = Y/8 + 2 = 3, which is incorrect since it would imply Y = 8, a multiple condition.\n     - Hence, the only way 8※Y could equal 3 is if Y was specifically arranged or determined by another direct rule application which resolves to exactly 3 from the rule. Given the operations, we directly acknowledge that the rule X※13=f(result) must be specifically directed to achieve the overall requirement 8※Y = 3, which points to determining X directly.\n\nGiven the specific nature of the rule and requirement for X, let's revisit X directly affecting the target equation in simpler form after the first two operations:\n\n4. We required 8※Y = 3. Given that Y cannot effectively meet the direct multiple operation effectively and we need it to target the final result, and by nature of the problem, we test specific numbers that when operated with 13 can link back to finding an X fitting all previous steps.\n\nWe backtrack for X:\n- The only method fitting all is ensuring (X※13) resolves such that 8 operation brings us to the final target 3, implying X operation with 13 directly provides us the route 2.\n- By diving deeper in the logical pathway that fits, X must be structured where X※13 directly gives 2 under the rule conditions or pathways, pinpointing X to 13 directly as the simplest structured return fitting final iterative operation to target 3 inclusively by nature used.\n\nTherefore, [[13]] actually is the structured pinpoint on reflective operation requirement fitting all simplification steps back correctly:\n[[13]].",
