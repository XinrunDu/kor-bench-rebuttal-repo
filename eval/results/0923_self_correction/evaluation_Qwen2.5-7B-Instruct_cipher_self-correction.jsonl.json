Convert the ciphertext \"3a\" to a byte sequence.\n   - \"3a\" in hexadecimal is the byte sequence [0x3a].\n\n2. Use the key to decrypt the byte.\n   - The key is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n   - We need to recyle the key to match the length of the byte sequence. For a single byte, the key is just the first two characters of the hash: '73' (which is 0x73 in hexadecimal).\n\n3. Perform XOR operation on the byte and the key.\n   - 0x3a XOR 0x73.\n   - 0x3a = 00111010\n   - 0x73 = 01110011\n   - Result of XOR: 00001001 = 0x09\n\n4. Convert the resulting byte back to a character.\n   - 0x09 in ASCII corresponds to the character 'I'.\n\n5. Since the key was recycled, we need to ensure the key matches the original plaintext length. For a single character, the length is fine as is.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is:\n[[I]]",

The first byte of the key in decimal is 115 ('73' in hex).\n   - 84 (plaintext byte) XOR 115 (key byte) = 39.\n\n4. **Convert the result back to hexadecimal**:\n   - 39 in hexadecimal is 27.\n\nThus, the encrypted answer for the plaintext \"T\" is [[27]].",
