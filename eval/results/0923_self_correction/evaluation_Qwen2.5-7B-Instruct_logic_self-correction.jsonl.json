For example, it is missing terms like \\(p \\land \\neg q \\land r\\), \\(\\neg p \\land q \\land \\neg r\\), and others.\n\nTherefore, the given formula \\((p \\lor r) \\land (\\neg q \\lor r) \\land (\\neg p \\lor q \\lor \\neg r)\\) does not conform to the principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",

For 4 propositional variables, the indices range from 0 to 15 (in hexadecimal, 0 to F).\n\n2. **Binary and Hexadecimal Correspondence**:\n    - Each variable and its negation appear exactly once in the PDNF.\n    - For 4 variables, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible true assignments (which correspond to 16 hexadecimal numbers from 0 to F).\n\n3. **Identifying Correct Formulas**:\n    - For a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must include \\(m0\\) and only even-indexed paired conjunctive terms.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Formulas**:\n    - The even indices between 0 and F are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E.\n    - There are 8 even indices, and the formula must include \\(m0\\) and can optionally include any subset of the 7 other even-indexed terms.\n\n5. **Calculating Combinations**:\n    - The number of ways to choose subsets of 7 elements is \\(2^7 = 128\\). However, since \\(m0\\) must be included, we subtract the case where no other terms are selected, i.e., \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\).\n    - But we must also exclude the all-odd formulas, which is not applicable here since all selected terms are even.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n    - Therefore, there are \\(2^7 = 128\\) valid combinations, but since \\(m0\\) must always be included, there are \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\) combinations, but only 128/2 = 64 unique valid sets (including \\(m0\\)).\n\nUpon reevaluation, the correct count is:\n\n- There are 8 even indices, and including \\(m0\\) means we choose from 7 remaining, which gives \\(2^7 = 128\\) combinations.\n\nThus, the number of formulas that satisfy the conditions is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is: \\[\\boxed{8}\\]",
