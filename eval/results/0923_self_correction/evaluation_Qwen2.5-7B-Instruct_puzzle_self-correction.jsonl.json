If Eula is the friend who used the caveman diet, then the pounds lost by Eula ( \\( y \\) ) is less than the caveman dieter's \\( x \\).

This means Barbara cannot be the caveman dieter or the gluten-free dieter (because Mandy is the sugar-free dieter and Eula must be accounted for).\n- The remaining person, Eula, must be the gluten-free dieter.

From clue 2, Wendy won the swimming badge and from clue 4, Wendy was awarded before Tara. From clue 7, Elaine was awarded 2 spots after the youngster who won the leadership badge, which means Tara won the leadership badge because Elaine was awarded 2 spots later than the leadership badge.\n\nFrom clue 5, the theater badge was awarded 1 spot after the first aid badge. Since Elaine won the first aid badge, the theater badge must have been awarded to someone awarded right after Elaine. Therefore, Tara must have won the theater badge because she was awarded 1 spot after Elaine.\n\nFrom clue 6, the dance badge was awarded 1 spot before the girl who won the leadership badge. Since Tara won the leadership badge, the dance badge must have been awarded 1 spot before Tara. This means Kendra won the dance badge.\n\nNow, we can summarize the order:\n1. **Tara** (leadership badge)\n2. **Wendy** (swimming badge)\n3. **Elaine** (first aid badge)\n4. **Kendra** (dance badge)\n5. **Tara** (theater badge)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[[1 Tara 1, 2 Wendy 2, 3 Elaine 3, 4 Kendra 4, 5 Tara 5]]",

So, we can assign March 10 to a 2-7 decision.\n- Clue 5 tells us Watts v Yang was on March 17. So, we assign March 17 to a 5-4 decision.\n- Clue 3 tells us the 7-2 decision and Omar v Powers were on March 3 and March 31. Clue 1 tells us Gibbs v Kintz and the March 24 case were split between 2-7 and 4-5. Clue 2 tells us that Zamora v Pibb wasn't the 7-2 decision, so we can assign 7-2 to March 31, and 2-7 to March 3. The remaining cases and decisions must be assigned accordingly.\n- Clue 4 tells us Watts v Yang was before the 7-2 decision, which aligns with March 17 being before March 31.\n\nSo, we can now fill in the details:\n- March 10: 2-7 (from Clue 7)\n- March 17: 5-4 (from Clue 5)\n- March 24: 4-5 (from Clue 1 and Clue 4, since it's after the March 17 case and before March 31)\n- March 31: 7-2 (from Clue 3 and Clue 1, since it's the later date and not 2-7)\n- March 3: Omar v Powers (from Clue 3, since it's the earlier date and not 7-2)\n\nNow, we can list the entries:\n[[3 Omar v Powers 7-2],[10 Gibbs v Kintz 2-7],[17 Watts v Yang 5-4],[24 Zamora v Pibb 4-5],[31 Gibbs v Kintz 2-7]]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n[[3 Omar v Powers 7-2],[10 Gibbs v Kintz 2-7],[17 Watts v Yang 5-4],[24 Zamora v Pibb 4-5],[31 Gibbs v Kintz 2-7]]",

If Cornick launches in March, then Athios must launch in February.\n2. If Cornick is not Rubicorp's rocket, then Rubicorp's rocket must be launched in February (since Athios cannot be Rubicorp's rocket in February, and it must be March as well).\n3. Therefore, Gralax must launch in April, 1 month after Rubicorp's rocket, which is in March.\n4. This means Cornick, which is not Rubicorp's rocket, must be launched in March by Techtrin.\n5. Exatris, which is SpaceZen's rocket, must be launched in January as it is not conflicting with the other rockets.\n\nSo, the correct sequence is:\n\n- **January: Exatris (SpaceZen)**\n- **February: Athios (SpaceZen)**\n- **March: Cornick (Techtrin)**\n- **April: Gralax (Rubicorp)**\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[[January Exatris SpaceZen, February Athios SpaceZen, March Cornick Techtrin, April Gralax Rubicorp]]",

Rosalie was hired 3 days after the Green & Hayes hire.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that one of Rosalie or the Haynes Inc. hire was on March 18th and the other was on March 21st. From clue 4, we know that Rosalie was hired 3 days after the Green & Hayes hire, which means the Green & Hayes hire must have been on March 15th, making Rosalie's hire on March 18th. Therefore, the Haynes Inc. hire must be on March 21st.\n\nFrom clue 2, Nadine was hired by Velez & York.

The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n\nFrom clue 1, the customer who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll.\n\nFrom clue 5, since the customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people, this means:\n- The customer who ordered the dragon roll cannot be Virginia or Ramona.\n\nFrom clue 6, Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll, so the teriyaki roll must be ordered by either Virginia, Ramona, or another customer.\n\nFrom clue 4, Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the spider roll. Since she cannot be the one who ordered the teriyaki roll (which is true based on clue 1 and the potential assignments), she must be the one who ordered the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\nFrom clue 3, one of Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll. Since Virginia ordered the rainbow roll, Ramona must have paid $15.50.\n\nFrom clue 2, one of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector paid $11.50, and the other ordered the futomaki roll. This means Hector did not order the futomaki roll (clue 6) and must have ordered the tiger roll.\n\nFrom clue 7, the firecracker roll costs $9.50, and its customer (Ramona).\n\nTo ensure all conditions are met:\n\n- Dragon roll -> Teriyaki roll (clue 1)\n- Tiger roll -> Hector (clue 2)\n- Rainbow roll -> Virginia (clue 3 and 4)\n- Spider roll -> Ramona (clue 4 and 5)\n\nLet's assign the rolls and prices:\n\n1.

Each cell in column 5 contributes its position (1 through 6). Only the cells in rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 can contribute to the total, so the sum must be 7. Testing, we get:\n   - Row 1: 1+1+1+1+1+6 = 10 (Too large)\n   - Row 3: 1+1+1+1+1+6 = 10 (Too large)\n   - Row 4: 1+1+1+1+1+6 = 10 (Too large)\n   - Row 5: 1+1+1+1+1+6 = 10 (Too large)\n   - Rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 can only contribute 1 or 0. Therefore, the only combination is rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 must all have 1 in column 5.\n   - We check the remaining column contributions:\n     - Column 1: 2 (1 from row 1, 1 from row 5)\n     - Column 2: 1 (1 from row 2)\n     - Column 3: 1 (1 from row 3)\n     - Column 4: 5 (1 from row 1, 1 from row 3, 1 from row 4, 1 from row 5)\n   - Row 2 must have 1 in column 2.\n\n2. **Column 1**: Row 1 has 2, which means one 1 in column 1. The other rows must sum up to 0 in column 1, which means they must be 0.\n\n3. **Row 1**: We need a total of 5, and the columns 1 and 5 are already assigned. So, the remaining cells in row 1 must sum to \\(5 - (1 + 1) = 3\\). We can place 1s in columns 2, 3, and 4.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We need a total of 5, and the columns 1, 3, and 5 are assigned. We need to place 1s in columns 2, 3, and 4.\n\n5. **Row 4**: We need a total of 5, and the columns 1, 3, and 5 are already assigned. We need to place 1s in columns 2, 3, and 4.\n\n6. **Row 5**: We need a total of 4, and the columns 1, and 5 are assigned.

Therefore, we need combinations of 1 and 2 such that the sum is 5. One possible way is to place 2 in the first, fourth, and sixth columns (2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 6) and adjust with 1s to meet the exact sum of 5.\n\n2. **Row 2: Sum = 17**  \n   For the second row sum, we need a combination of 1 to 6 that adds up to 17. One possible way is to place 6 in the second, third, and fifth columns (1 + 6 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 17).\n\n3. **Row 3: Sum = 9**  \n   We need a sum of 9.

The only way to satisfy this for the '3' at the far right is to have mines at the left and middle squares, and at one of the top or bottom squares (but we already have the left square as a mine from the '2', so the top or bottom must be the third mine).\n   - The '3' to the right of the '2' cannot extend beyond the grid, so it must be a mine midway between the '3' and the edge, and the other mine in this row must be at the top or bottom.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - The '3' indicates three surrounding mines. The only way this can fit is if it has mines to the immediate left, left-bottom, and right-bottom.\n   - The '1' at the bottom-left indicates a single mine in its vicinity, which means one of the bottom-left, top-left, or middle-left must have a mine. Since the middle-left is already a '3' mine, it must be top-left.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - The '2' directly above the '1' must have mines in its immediate vicinity, so the middle square must be a mine.\n   - The '3's to the right must have mines in their vicinity, so the middle and the next middle square must be mines.\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - The '2' at the far right indicates two mines in its vicinity, so the middle and the next middle square must be mines.\n   - The '2' to the left must have two mines around it, so the middle and the next middle square must be mines.\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - The '1' at the top-left indicates a single mine in its vicinity, so the middle square must be a mine.\n   - The '2's to the right indicate two mines in their vicinity, so the middle and the next middle square must be mines.\n\nAfter careful placement and verification, the correct solution is:\n```\n[[A 2 A 3 A, A X A X A, A 2 A 3 A, A X A X A, A X A X A]]\n```\n\nSo the final answer is:\n[[A 2 A 3 A, A X A X A, A 2 A 3 A, A X A X A, A X A X A]]",

Since (2, 2) is already an A, the (2, 1) cell must be X (no mine).\n   - The (1, 4) cell is also 3, and it already has (2, 3) and (2, 4) as A, so (2, 5) cell must be A.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - The (2, 1) cell is 1, and we already determined that there is no mine at (2, 1), so (2, 2) and (2, 2) must have a mine. We already filled (2, 2) and (2, 3) as A.\n\n3. **Third to Seventh Rows:**\n   - We continue to fill in based on the numbers and the cells we already have as A.\n   - For (3, 3), we have 4, so it must be surrounded by mines in cells (2, 2), (2, 3), and (4, 2), (4, 3). But (2, 2) and (2, 3) are already A, so (4, 2) is A.\n   - For (3, 4), we have 5, so (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 5) must have a mine. We already have (2, 3) and (3, 3) as A, so (3, 5) and (4, 5) are A.\n   - For (3, 6), we have 3, so (2, 5), (3, 5), and (4, 5) must have a mine. We already have (3, 5) and (4, 5) as A, so (2, 5) is A.\n   - For (4, 3), we have 4, and we already have (3, 3) and (3, 5) as A, so (5, 2) and (5, 4) are A.\n   - For (4, 7), we have 2, so (3, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7) must have a mine.

Since it is surrounded by 8 squares (including diagonals), and only one is an \"A\" (representing a mine), the other must also be an \"A\". So, the first square is \"A\".\n   - The remaining three squares are \"X\".\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - The second square has a 3, which means it has 3 adjacent mines. Given the position of the \"A\" from the first row, the second row must have two more adjacent \"A\" mines. Therefore, the first and second squares are \"A\" and the fourth and fifth squares are \"A\".\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - The first square has a 3, meaning it has 3 adjacent mines. The first and second squares from the previous row are \"A\" mines, so this means the 3rd and 4th squares must have mines. Therefore, the third and fourth squares are \"A\".\n   - The remaining squares are \"X\".\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - The first square has a 2, which means it has 2 adjacent mines. The third square is an \"A\", so the second square must also be an \"A\".\n   - The remaining squares are \"X\".\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - The first square has a 1, which means it has 1 adjacent mine.

Thus, the first column must be 3.\n   - Hence, the first row is: [3, 1, 4, 2].\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Heights: 2, X, X, X, 2\n   - Constraints from the sides: 2 and 3\n   - Possible arrangement: 4, 1, 3, 2\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the first row (3), the second column cannot be 3.\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the fifth row (1), the second column cannot be 1.\n   - Hence, the second column must be 4.\n   - To satisfy the constraint of 2 skyscrapers and 3 seen, the fourth column must be 2 and the third column 3.\n   - Hence, the second row is: [2, 4, 3, 2, 2].\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Heights: 3, X, X, X, X\n   - Constraints from the sides: 3 and 2\n   - Possible arrangement: 4, 1, 3, 1\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the first row (4), the third column cannot be 4.\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the fifth row (1), the fourth column cannot be 1.\n   - Hence, the third column must be 1 and the fourth column 3.\n   - Hence, the third row is: [3, 2, 1, 3, 1].\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - Heights: 1, X, X, X, X\n   - Constraints from the sides: 2 and 3\n   - Possible arrangement: 4, 2, 1, 3\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the first row (4), the second column cannot be 4.\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the fifth row (1), the fourth column cannot be 1.\n   - Hence, the second column must be 2 and the fourth column 3.\n   - Hence, the fourth row is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 3].\n\n5. **Fifth Row:**\n   - Heights: 2, X, X, X, 1\n   - Constraints from the sides: 2 and 1\n   - Possible arrangement: 3, 4, 2, 1\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the first row (3), the second column cannot be 3.\n   - To satisfy the constraint on the fourth row (3), the fourth column cannot be 3.\n   - Hence, the second column must be 4 and the fourth column 2.\n   - Hence, the fifth row is: [3, 1, 4, 2, 1].\n\n### Final Solution:\n```\n[3, 1, 4, 2, 2]\n[2, 4, 3, 2, 2]\n[3, 2, 1, 3, 1]\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n[3, 1, 4, 2, 1]\n```\n\nThus, the correct arrangement is:\n```\n[[3, 1, 4, 2, 2] [2, 4, 3, 2, 2] [3, 2, 1, 3, 1] [1, 2, 3, 4, 3] [3, 1, 4, 2, 1]]\n```",

The last column has a `1`, which means it must have the shortest skyscraper. Therefore, the `1` must be in the last column. The first column has a `2` which means the skyscrapers from front to back are from shortest to tallest. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n```\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the last column\nThe last column has a `1` at the bottom, so the `1` must be in the bottom row. We can fill it in:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 _ _ _ 1\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the second row\nThe second row has a `3` at the bottom, meaning there must be three visible skyscrapers. The only way to have three visible skyscrapers in a row of five is if the tallest skyscraper is in the third position. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 5 _ _ 1\n1 _ _ _ _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the third row\nThe third row has a `4` at the bottom, meaning there must be four visible skyscrapers. The only way to have four visible skyscrapers in a row of five is if the first skyscraper is the shortest and the last is the tallest. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 5 _ _ 1\n1 4 _ _ _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the fourth row\nThe fourth row has a `2` at the bottom, meaning there must be two visible skyscrapers. The only way to have two visible skyscrapers in a row of five is if the first two skyscrapers are shorter than the last three. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 5 _ _ 1\n1 4 5 _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the fifth row\nThe fifth row has a `2` at the bottom, meaning there must be two visible skyscrapers. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 5 _ _ 1\n1 4 5 _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 3 2 _ _ 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Step 7: Analyze the sixth row\nThe sixth row has a `3` at the bottom, meaning there must be three visible skyscrapers. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 2 1\n4 1 5 _ _ 1\n1 4 5 _ _ 4\n2 _ _ _ _ _ 2\n5 3 2 4 1 2\n3 _ _ _ _ _ 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Final Step: Fill in remaining cells\nThe remaining cells can be filled in based on the rules, ensuring no two skyscrapers of the same height are in the same row or column. This gives us:\n```\n2 3 5 1 4\n4 1 5 3 2 1\n1 4 5 2 3 4\n2 5 3 1 4 2\n5 3 2 4 1 2\n3 4 1 5 2 3\n2 3 1 2 3\n```\n\nThus, the correct solution is:\n```\n[[2 3 5 1 4] [4 1 5 3 2 1] [1 4 5 2 3 4] [2 5 3 1 4 2] [5 3 2 4 1 2] [3 4 1 5 2 3] [2 3 1 2 3]]\n```",
