For the first pair (p ∨ q) and (p ∨ ¬q):\n      C = dispel(p ∨ q, p ∨ ¬q) = (q ∨ ¬q)\n      Since q ∨ ¬q is a tautology, it does not contribute to the resolution and is ignored.\n\n   b.

Resolve clauses in S1:\n   a.

Check S2:\n   Since S2 is empty, there is no contradiction, meaning we cannot deduce an empty clause (0).\n\n5. Add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b:\n   S0 = {¬q ∨ r, q ∨ r}\n   S1 = empty set\n   S2 = empty set\n\n6. Repeat steps 2 to 4 with the new S1 and S2:\n   a.

Resolve clauses in S1:\n   No new resolution is possible since there is only one clause in S1.\n\n8. Check S2:\n   Since S2 contains (r), no contradiction is found, and we cannot deduce an empty clause (0).\n\nSince we have iterated three times and have not reached an empty clause, we conclude that the given CNF is plausible.

The baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up.\n\nThis statement does not directly adhere to any of the C*, C%, or C! principles as described. However, the task is to identify which principle this situation conforms to. Let's re-examine the given information and the principles:\n\nC* Principle focuses on the information strength and knowledge of the speaker and hearer.\n\nC% Principle is about minimalization and expanding the information as much as possible while maintaining a clear intention.\n\nC! Principle deals with avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions.\n\nGiven the statement \"The baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up,\" it does not seem to fit the C* or C! principles directly. The information provided is straightforward, and there is no obscurity or marked expression being used. The C% Principle comes closer, as it includes the idea of expanding information:\n\n- CI1: The relationship between objects and time in the sentence is conventional unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. In this case, the conventional action is that when a baby cries, the mother picks the baby up.\n- CI2: The statement does not explicitly mention that the mother is the baby's biological mother; however, it is an attributive inference that the mother is known to be the baby's mother, given the context. The hearer naturally infers this information to fully grasp the intention of the speech.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the situation specifically that \"The mother is the baby's mother\" (Attributive inference type) conforms more closely to the C% Principle, as it relates to how the hearer expands the information to fully understand the purpose of the communication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

Let's reconsider the logic rule and the given definition of \"Trademark registration\" to identify the correct type of intensional definition.\n\nThe definition of \"Trademark registration\" given is: \"Trademark registration refers to the legal activity of the user applying for trademark registration with the trademark management authority according to the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its implementing rules, where the application is reviewed and approved by the Trademark Office, recorded in the trademark register, a registration certificate is issued, and an announcement is made, granting the registrant the exclusive right to use the trademark.\"\n\nThis definition explains the process and procedures related to obtaining a trademark registration, which includes applying, being reviewed and approved, and being granted the exclusive right to use the trademark. It is not defining the trademark itself from its origin, function, a special relationship, or operational procedures. Furthermore, it is not providing a list of all trademarks or giving specific examples of trademarks.\n\nThe definition provided fits the characteristics of a ☖ (Process Definition), as it describes a set of related operational procedures.
