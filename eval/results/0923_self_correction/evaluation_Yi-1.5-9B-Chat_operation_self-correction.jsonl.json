If 14 is a multiple of X, then X※14 = 14/X + 2.\n3. If neither X is a multiple of 14, nor 14 is a multiple of X, then X※14 = 24.\n\nGiven that X※14 = 5, we can start by checking the second condition (14 is a multiple of X), since dividing 14 by an integer and adding 2 would generally result in a value greater than 2 (the smallest integer result from 14/7 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6). Therefore, the most likely scenario is that 14 is a multiple of X, which gives us the equation:\n\nX※14 = 14/X + 2 = 5\n\nLet's solve for X:\n\n14/X + 2 = 5\n14/X = 3\nX = 14/3\n\nHowever, X must be an integer since both a and b in the operation are integers. The fraction 14/3 is not an integer, so it does not fit the criteria. This means we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nGiven the condition that X※14 = 5, and recognizing that the operation results in a number less than the typical outcomes (either from division or the default 24), the condition that X is a multiple of 14 is more plausible, given that it involves division by 14. Let's correct this approach:\n\nX is a multiple of 14, so:\n\nX※14 = X/14 + 2 = 5\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n\nX/14 = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 14 to solve for X:\n\nX = 3 * 14\nX = 42\n\nTherefore, X is 42, which is a multiple of 14, and fits the condition that when a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2. This operation results in:\n\nX※14 = 42/14 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nThis matches the given condition that X※14 = 5.\n\n### Answer:\n[[42]]",

Now we have:\n19 ※ 9\nSince 9 is not a multiple of 19 and 19 is not a multiple of 9, we use the third part of the operation rule:\n19 ※ 9 = 24\n\n3.

So we have:\n\n\\log_{X}{512} + \\log_{512}{X} = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nLet's express both logarithms in terms of the same base, say base 2, since 512 is 2^9:\n\n\\log_{2}{512} / \\log_{2}{X} + \\log_{2}{X} / \\log_{2}{512} = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nSince \\log_{2}{512} = 9, we can simplify this to:\n\n9 / \\log_{2}{X} + \\log_{2}{X} / 9 = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nLet's denote \\log_{2}{X} as y for simplicity:\n\n9 / y + y / 9 = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nTo solve for y, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9y to get rid of the denominators:\n\n81 + y^2 = 82y\n\nRearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\ny^2 - 82y + 81 = 0\n\nThis is a simple quadratic equation that can be factored:\n\n(y - 81)(y - 1) = 0\n\nSo, y = 81 or y = 1.\n\nSince we are looking for a positive integer value for X, and knowing that \\log_{2}{X} = y, we can say that X = 2^y.\n\nIf y = 81, then X = 2^81.\nIf y = 1, then X = 2^1 = 2.\n\nHowever, we must check which value of X fits the original equation 512 ￠X = \\frac{82}{9}.\n\nFor X = 2^81, we have:\n\n512 ￠ 2^81 = \\log_{2^81}{512} + \\log_{512}{2^81} = \\frac{1}{81} + 81\n\nThis does not equal \\frac{82}{9}, so X = 2^81 is not the correct solution.\n\nFor X = 2, we have:\n\n512 ￠ 2 = \\log_{2}{512} + \\log_{512}{2} = 9 + \\frac{1}{9}\n\nThis also does not equal \\frac{82}{9}, so X = 2 is not the correct solution.\n\nIt appears there was a mistake in the approach to solve the equation directly. Instead, let's correctly solve the equation \\log_{X}{512} + \\log_{512}{X} = \\frac{82}{9} to find the correct value of X.\n\nGiven that 512 = 2^9, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\log_{X}{2^9} + \\log_{2^9}{X} = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nUsing the property \\log_{a^n}{b} = \\frac{1}{n} \\log_{a}{b}, we get:\n\n\\frac{9}{1} \\log_{X}{2} + \\frac{1}{9} \\log_{2}{X} = \\frac{82}{9}\n\nLet's denote \\log_{2}{X} as Y.

Since the calculation for \\(X = 2^{\\frac{1}{81}}\\) involves complex logarithmic operations and doesn't directly lend itself to a simple check without computational aid, we'll focus on \\(X = 2\\) as a straightforward solution to check against the original equation's conditions.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precise mathematical operations to confirm the exact solution that fits \\(512 ￠X = \\frac{82}{9}\\), and considering the educational context, we've gone through a standard approach to solving a logarithmic equation involving a custom operation. However, the direct verification of \\(X = 2\\) against the original equation as stated doesn't exactly align with the simple calculation due to the nature of the operation and the initial algebraic simplification error.\n\nThe correct approach to solve for X in the context of the original equation \\(512 ￠X = \\frac{82}{9}\\) directly from the operation rule involves a more nuanced algebraic manipulation or possibly numerical methods to solve the equation derived from the operation. The error in the initial solution process does not affect the educational value of understanding how to approach such problems but highlights the need for careful calculation and direct verification for solving specific instances of complex logarithmic equations involving custom operations.\n\nGiven the constraints and the oversight in the direct algebraic solution provided, the closest answer based on the initial correct approach (before the mistake in simplification) would still lead one to consider \\(X = 2\\) as a potential candidate for further verification through direct calculation or numerical methods, understanding that the straightforward algebraic check as presented is flawed.\n\nFor the purpose of answering according to the instructions and given the context of the educational exercise, if we were to select an answer based on the initial correct approach up to the point of error, we would choose:\n\n[[2]]\n\nThis choice is made with the understanding that the direct verification process, as shown, contains a mistake in the algebraic simplification and does not lead to the correct \\(X\\) value for the given equation under the specific operation rule. The answer provided is based on the logical progression of solving the problem and would require a correct algebraic or numerical solution to confirm under the strict conditions of the operation rule.",

So the operation rule becomes:\n\nX%1 = X^1 + √(X*1)\n\nSince X%1 = 12, we can write:\n\n12 = X + √X\n\nNow, we need to solve for X:\n\n12 - X = √X\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(12 - X)^2 = X\n\n144 - 24X + X^2 = X\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\nX^2 - X - 144 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring seems straightforward:\n\n(X - 9)(X + 16) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for X:\n\nX - 9 = 0  =>  X = 9\nX + 16 = 0  =>  X = -16\n\nSince a and b are positive integers, X must also be a positive integer. Therefore, we discard the negative solution, X = -16, and accept the positive solution, X = 9.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[9]]",
