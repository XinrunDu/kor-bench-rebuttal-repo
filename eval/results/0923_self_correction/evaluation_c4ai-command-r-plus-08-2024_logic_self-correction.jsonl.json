If all S are P, then it cannot be true that no S are P.

We can denote this as \"$A\\_not\\_winning\\_award$\". On the other hand, \"Allow the execution of contracts\" does not fit into any of the time proposition symbols, likely due to a grammatical error. However, assuming \"Allow...\" is related to the past, it might represent a past action, which could be \"$A\\_executed\\_contracts$\". If so, these sentences would exhibit a B Relationship.
