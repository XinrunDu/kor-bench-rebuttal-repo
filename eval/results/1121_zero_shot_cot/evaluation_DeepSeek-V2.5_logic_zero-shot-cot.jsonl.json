However, in the case of Neptune, the focus was not on differing conditions but on the deviation of Uranus's orbit.\n\n2. **Method ؆**:\n   - This method involves P occurring when S is present and not occurring when S is absent. In the case of Neptune, the deviation in Uranus's orbit (P) occurred when a gravitational force (S) was hypothesized to be present (the undiscovered planet). When this force was accounted for in calculations, the orbit deviation was resolved.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**:\n   - This method involves positive and negative groups.

This does not clearly fit the discovery of Neptune, as it was not about the absence of the hypothesized planet.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**:\n   - This method involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P.

However, the experiment involves only two groups differing by the presence or absence of salivary glands, not multiple differing conditions.\n- **Method ؆**: This method involves observing that P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent.

This matches the experiment's observation.\n- **Method ꙮ**: This method involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent.

However, the given scenario does not involve different inductive reasoning processes leading to contradictory conclusions.\n  \n- **BC Paradox**: This paradox arises from the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards. The given scenario involves a universal hypothesis (A) and a specific instance (B) that contradicts it. This fits the definition of the BC Paradox, where the confirmation of the universal hypothesis encounters a contradiction.\n\n- **LS Paradox**: This paradox arises when multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses lead to a contradiction. The given scenario involves two reasonably accepted hypotheses (A and B) that lead to a contradiction with the observation that penguins do not fly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe scenario best fits the **LS Paradox** as it involves multiple reasonably accepted hypotheses leading to a contradiction with an observation.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]",

The statement \"I managed to get two tickets\" implies effort, which is not weaker but different from \"I bought two tickets.\" Thus, the C* Principle does not apply directly.\n\n2. **C% Principle:**\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n   - **Hearer's Inference:**\n     - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n     - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n   - **Application:** C's statement is not necessarily minimalizing the information. It is providing additional information about the effort involved in getting the tickets. Therefore, the C% Principle does not directly apply.\n\n3. **C! Principle:**\n   - **Speaker's Criterion:** Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n   - **Hearer's Inference:** If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n   - **Application:** C uses \"managed to get\" instead of the more straightforward \"bought.\" This marked expression implies additional information (effort) that is not present in the unmarked expression. This fits the C! Principle, which states that the use of a marked expression indicates a different meaning than an unmarked one.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement by C conforms to the C! Principle.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]",

The statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" suggests that Zhang San has a car and there is a problem with the door.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The inference that \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is derived from the statement about the door not closing, which implies the existence of doors. This aligns with the CQ1 inference where the speaker knows the weaker information (door won't close) and implies the stronger information (the car has doors) cannot be established.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - **Speaker's Criterion**: This principle focuses on minimalization, speaking as little as possible. The statement is concise and does not provide unnecessary information.\n   - **Hearer's Inference**: The inference that \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is derived from the minimal information provided, which aligns with CI1 and CI2.\n\n3. **C!

The statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" does not directly entail \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" based on information strength, but rather involves a common sense inference about the majority of nurses being female.\n   - **CQ1**: The speaker does not necessarily know that the stronger information (Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female) cannot be established, as this is a common sense inference rather than a direct entailment.\n   - **CQ2**: The speaker does not state \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" with the intention of avoiding knowledge about the gender of the nurse, so this inference does not fit well with CQ2.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle involves minimalization and convention. The statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse\" is minimal and uses convention to infer that the nurse is likely female, which aligns with the minimalization criterion.\n   - **CI1**: The relationship between the objects (Xiao Wang and nurse) follows the convention that nurses are often female, which fits the CI1 inference.\n   - **CI2**: The existence or fact (nurse) exactly matches the confirmed situation (likely female), which fits the CI2 inference.\n\n3. **C!

However, C's response does not clearly indicate that they are withholding stronger information or that they know stronger information is unavailable.\n\n2. **C% Principle**:\n   - This principle involves minimalization, where the speaker speaks as little as necessary. C's response could be seen as minimalistic because it does not provide unnecessary details about the process of obtaining the materials. However, the word \"managed\" introduces a nuance that suggests the process was not straightforward, thus adding more information than strictly necessary.\n\n3. **C! Principle**:\n   - This principle is about using marked expressions. A marked expression is one that deviates from the conventional or standard way of expressing something. In this case, \"I managed to get the materials\" is a marked expression because it deviates from the conventional \"I borrowed the materials.\" The use of \"managed\" implies that there was some difficulty or effort involved, which is not conveyed by the simpler, unmarked expression.\n\nGiven the analysis, C's response conforms to the **C!

This is a substitution error where the knowledge or attributes about Lu Xun in the real world are incorrectly applied to what Xiao Qiang knows.\n\nThis matches the description of the **InvSubError Method**:\n- `K(x, y)` indicates that individual `x` knows that `y` is true.\n- `R(x, y, z)` indicates that `x` has a relationship `z` with `y`.\n- `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about `y` to `z`.\n\nThus, the type of formal fallacy is [[I.
