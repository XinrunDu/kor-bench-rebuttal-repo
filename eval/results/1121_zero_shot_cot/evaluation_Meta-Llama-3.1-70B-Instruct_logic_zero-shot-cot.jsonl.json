For ~(p1=::>~p2):\n   - (p1=::>~p2) is a Level B formula since it contains one logical connective, and both p1 and ~p2 are basic propositions. Note: ~p2 contains one logical connective, ~, making it a higher level, but it's still considered a single proposition unit in this context.\n   - ~(p1=::>~p2) then contains one more logical connective (~), applied to a Level B formula. Thus, ~(p1=::>~p2) is at least a Level C formula.\n\n2. For (p3||p4)=~p1:\n   - (p3||p4) is a Level B formula as it contains two basic propositions connected with '||'.\n   - ~(p1) is also a basic proposition unit with a logical negation.\n   - Combining these two with the '=' connective results in a formula that, like the first part, contains one logical connective but involves a higher-level structure due to the inner '~' and the '||'. Thus, (p3||p4)=~p1 is also at least a Level C formula.\n\nCombining the two parts with '&', a Level B operation, actually still keeps it within the confines of a Level C formula because the structure inside each part is already at least Level C. Hence, the entire formula (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) remains at Level C.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, consider that within the formula, we encounter nested operations such as '~' on an already compound proposition \"(p1=::>~p2)\", and '=' on a compound proposition \"(p3||p4)\". These indicate an even more complex structure than a simple Level C. Specifically, the nesting of logical connectives (like '~' on a formula that already includes ')::>~') increases the complexity.\n\nTherefore, modifying the earlier assessment to account for the nested structures (not just simple sequences of operations) suggests the formula is beyond Level C. Recognizing that Level C might be an underestimation due to the nested application of logical connectives, especially the '~' on an implication and the complex proposition declarations, indicates that the correct categorization requires further consideration of its recursive depth.\n\nGiven this complexity, if we correct the approach to labeling levels more accurately, the initial \"(p1=::>~p2)\" is itself a Level B operation with components that are Level A (true propositions) or Level A with operations (in case of '~p2'), yet due to its nested nature when prefixed with '~' we can see a higher complexity forming.\n\nGiven these complexities and the need for an iterative, recursive analysis that especially in complex formulas demands attention to nested logical operations, the proper level for this formula results from deeper nesting that is indicative of iterative application of the logical operations beyond the basic 'and,' 'or,' etc., with added complexity from the implication (a 'Level B' type operation but utilized within more complex structures) and equivalence assessments.\n\nThe correct level for (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) is thus considered higher due to nested operations, particularly with \"=\" applied to a proposition and compound operation nesting. Therefore, moving to higher levels, considering we may need to explore 'Z+n' due to complex iterations and nesting, but the detailed breakdown places it more specifically at considering moving one step further than simple operations, indeed in application to assess this specific structure properly would demand consideration of propositions, compound propositions, and logical connective compositions steps more nuanced than base definitions imply but in practice, considering a relatively developed formulaic structure that is not further decomposed:\n\nConsidering higher-level structures we can observe is hard to be perfectly captured under the basic rules but ticks higher from base in following standards offered there this and suggests its operating on a profound basis in organizing new equivalence than pattern investigated out somewire self add fill increased \n\ncorrections formulas interact shared may nonetheless utilize:\n\n\nUltimately giving [[Z+1]]",

This formula implies that if p1 is true, then at least one of p1, p2, or p3 must be true. Given the presence of p1 in both the antecedent and the consequent, it's clear that whenever p1 is true, the whole formula is true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. However, we must also consider the case where p1 is false. In this scenario, the antecedent (p1) is false, making the entire conditional statement true because a conditional statement is true if its antecedent is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, this formula is always true, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nThis formula involves nested conditionals and negations. To simplify, let's break it down:\n\n- The inner conditional statement (p1=::>~p1) is only false when p1 is true, because that's the only scenario where the antecedent (p1) being true leads to a false consequent (~p1).\n- The outer conditional states that if the inner conditional is true, then ~p2 must be true.\n- Given the inner conditional can only be false when p1 is true (which leads to a contradiction since it implies p1 and ~p1 simultaneously for it to directly influence the outer conditional), we realize the inner conditional's truth value doesn't actually affect the outcome in a straightforward manner. Instead, we observe that whenever the inner conditional is true (which it is whenever p1 is not true, because the conditional's antecedent is false), the formula's truth hinges on the truth value of ~p2.\n- However, the critical insight here is recognizing that (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't necessarily lead to a specific truth value for ~p2 since the condition (p1 being true and thus implying ~p1) is not sufficient to conclude anything about p2. The condition can be true when p1 is false, making the conditional true but not affecting p2's value directly.\n- This formula's truth value, therefore, is not fixed across all possible assignments of p1 and p2. It's true in some cases (e.g., when p1 is false or when p2 is false regardless of p1's truth value) but not in others (e.g., when p1 is true and p2 is true, violating the conditional), making it Neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[A];[C]]",

(!p)` to `p`. So, we have `p & !q | r`.\n\nCombining these steps, the expression `(!p | q) > r` without `>` is [[p & !q | r]].",

        "response": "To determine whether (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) are equivalent, let's analyze them step by step using the given rules.\n\n1. Start with the given expressions:\n    - Expression 1: (p>q)>r\n    - Expression 2: p>(q>r)\n\n2. Apply rule (10) to expand the implications in both expressions. This rule states that A > B ::=:: !A | B.\n    - Expression 1 expansion: !(p>q) | r\n    - Expression 2 expansion: !p | (q>r)\n\n3. In Expression 1, we need to expand the negation of the implication (p>q) using rule (10) again:\n    - !(p>q) = !(!p | q) (apply rule (10) to p>q)\n    - Apply rule (6) to the result: !(!p | q) ::=:: !!p & !q\n    - Using rule (1), simplify double negation: !!p & !q ::=:: p & !q\n    - So Expression 1 becomes: (p & !q) | r\n\n4. In Expression 2, expand the implication (q>r) similarly:\n    - (q>r) ::=:: !q | r (rule 10)\n    - Expression 2 expansion with the expanded implication: !p | (!q | r)\n\n5. Distributive property (rule 5) is implicitly applied in both expressions, but we have not explicitly used it. Instead, focus on the realizition that Expression 2 can be transformed further:\n    - !p | (!q | r) can be viewed as ((p'> p) | (!q | r)), and the distributive law yields: (!p | !q) | (!p | r)\n\n6. At this point, simplification by applying rules directly becomes cumbersome. Observe the two resulting expressions for an intuitive understanding:\n    - Expression 1: (p & !q) | r\n    - Expression 2's simplified form reveals it can be seen as equivalent when considering the distributive law and simplification. To seek clarity, it is useful to realize both expressions can indeed reach a common ground where   both can be reduced into a comparable format but a format isn't directly clear due to difficulties in implementation. \n\nIt turns out a deeper manipulation in adhering strictly to provided equivalent rules wasn't fully undertaken because after analyzing the actual steps one may dive further.",

However, since it contains 3 variables, in a 3-variable paired disjunctive term, we look for the missing assignment (001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111).

If the proposition SAP is true, then we are dealing with a Universal Affirmative proposition. According to the relationships, there is a # relation between A propositions and E propositions, and a * relation between A propositions and O propositions. Since there isn't a direct relationship specified between A and O where A's truth value affects O's directly as a strict conditional, we'll instead refer to the * relation between A and O which suggests if SAP is true, then SOP is false, since they are contraries.\n\n2. If the proposition SIP is true, then we are dealing with a Particular Affirmative proposition. According to the relationships, there is a % relation between A propositions and I propositions, and a & relation between I propositions and O propositions. There isn't a direct % relation specified between I and E propositions in terms of conditional truth values, but we can infer the relationship between I and E through the * relation between E and O, and knowing I and O's relation is &. SIP and SEP do not have a straightforward conditional relationship where if one is true, the other is false. However, given the % relation tells us the universal can be false if the particular is false but doesn't specify the outcome of the particular being true, and the & tells us about I and O's relationship, the truth table would show that SIP can be true while SEP is false, or vice versa, or both can be true as I being true just means at least one S has P. However, with the absence of a direct relationship, we'll have to mark it as false under the current logic and relation rules specified as SEP could potentially be true regardless of SIP's truth but for traditional categorical logic purposes, we need a direct, specified logical relation or further deductions based on external factors, which are not provided.\n\n3. If the proposition SIP is false, then given the & relation between I propositions and O propositions, it suggests that if SIP is false, SOP is true.

        "response": "To determine the truth-value modal reasoning formula, let's break it down:\n\n1. \"Arrogance necessarily results in falling behind\" can be represented as `#p`.\n2. \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be represented as `!$!p`.\n\nAccording to the Modal Logic Inference Formulas, we need to find a formula that connects `#p` to `!$!p`.\n\nFrom the given formulas, we can derive `!$!p` from `#p`. Specifically, formula (8) states that `!$!p` is equivalent to `$p`, but we can also connect it to `#p` through formula (1), which states that `#p` is equivalent to `!$!p`.\n\nHowever, we can further simplify this by using the existing formulas. Formula (5) states that `#p → !#!p`, and formula (6) states that `#!p → !#p`. However, to get `!$!p`, we can directly use formula (6), and with the help of formula (1) and (3), we can confirm that `!$!p` is indeed equivalent.\n\n Formula (6) states `#!p → !#p`, but this seems to be a mistaken reference. Looking closely, (1) and (3) give us the relationship between necessity and possibility of negations.\n\n Formula (1) and (3), let `#!p` be equivalent to `$!p` by (3) and combining (1), we see `#$p` is equivalent to `!$!p`. Given `!$!p` corresponds to `#$p`, Arrogance not resulting in falling behind is impossible is inferred by `#p`, and this infers `#$p`. Formula (13) reflects the relationship, but it must be interpreted with (9) and further manipulations.\n\n\n Re-reading, to infer \"!$!p\" given \"#p\", examining closely, two formulas link (8) actually is read in the wrong manner: We inferred incorrectly. Yet another answer could give \"#p\" : We apply axioms, so \"imply\". (8) should be clearly distinguishable from \"#p\", but let formulas guide. As a guide we shall count them more vigilantly next.

This is not directly applicable here, as the inference isn't about negating stronger information or the speaker's knowledge.\n\n- The C% Principle involves minimalization and assumes a conventional relationship unless evidence suggests otherwise. This principle is about minimizing speech while maximizing information, focusing on convention unless indicated otherwise. The inference about Zhang San's new car having doors, given that the door won't close, indeed relies on conventional understanding that cars typically have doors, and the mention of a door implies the car's doors.\n\n- The C! Principle pertains to avoiding marked expressions without reason. This principle is about avoiding lengthy or obscure expressions unless they convey a different or specific meaning. The example doesn't directly relate to the use of marked expressions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the inference that Zhang San's new car has doors relies on the conventional understanding of cars having doors, which aligns with the minimalization and conventional assumption aspects of the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]",

Considering the minimal information provided, we are making an inference based on conventional associations (nurse typically equals female). We do not need additional or stronger information to establish this connection.\n\n3. The process primarily relies on understanding the relationship between objects and roles (nurse and female) within the conventional context.\n\nBased on these steps, we can match the inference process to the **C% Principle**.

However, in our scenario, the focus is not directly on stronger or weaker information regarding the success of the action but rather the implication of difficulty or ease in obtaining the materials.\n\n2. **Understanding the C% Principle**: The Minimalization Criterion part of this principle encourages speakers to speak as little as necessary, and the hearer's inference part suggests assuming conventions unless indicated otherwise. However, C's response adds more information (\"managed\") than needed, which implies more than just \"borrowed.\"\n\n3. **Understanding the C! Principle**: This principle is about avoiding unnecessary complication or marked expressions without reason. If the speaker uses a marked or lengthy expression, it indicates their meaning is different from a conventional, unmarked expression.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n- C's response (\"I managed to get the materials\") uses a marked expression (\"managed\") that could imply difficulty or extra effort, suggesting a different meaning than the conventional \"borrow\" expression used by B.\n\n- This situation aligns with the **C! Principle**, as C's use of \"managed\" indicates a meaning that's different from what a straightforward, unmarked expression like \"borrow\" would convey, specifically hinting at some difficulty or effort involved.\n\nTherefore, the situation conforms to the **C!

This implies there is no largest natural number, as we can always find a larger one.\n2. ∃y∀xR(x, y) - This statement changes the order of the quantifiers, suggesting that there exists a natural number y such that for all natural numbers x, x is less than y. This implies there is a largest natural number y that is greater than all other natural numbers.\n\nThe fallacy occurs due to changing the order of the quantifiers, which alters the meaning of the statement. The original statement (forall x exists y) implies no largest number, but the conclusion (∃y∀x) suggests the existence of a largest number. This type of error is due to incorrectly switching the order of quantifiers.\n\nFollowing the given logic rule, this situation matches the definition of the **QuantSwitch Method**, where ∀x∃y R(x, y) is transformed into ∃y∀x R(x, y), leading to an invalid conclusion by changing the order of quantifiers.\n\n[[F]]",

The original statement is ∀x (Bx → Cx), where Bx indicates x is a Chinese billionaire, and Cx indicates x is a Chinese person. The conclusion is ∀x (Cx → Bx), which changes the direction of the implication.\n\nAccording to the provided rules, this matches the description of the IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx).
