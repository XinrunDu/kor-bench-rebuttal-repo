When p1 is assigned as ✓, the implication p1=::>p2 is false since one of its parts, p1, is true and the other, p2, is also true. However, the negation (~p1=::>p2) remains true.\n3. Now, using the definition of the compound proposition \"not X\", ~(p1=::>p2) translates to the compound proposition \"it is NOT the case that, if p1, then p2\". Since we can see that it is NOT the case that if p1 is true, p2 is true (when p2 is assigned as ✓), the overall formula is (~(p1=::>p2)) & p2 = true & ✓, which is a true assignment.\n4. When p2 is assigned as x (false), both the compound proposition ((~p1=::>p2)) and p2 are false. Thus, the compound proposition ((~p1=::>p2)) & p2 also has a true assignment.\n\nSince the formula ((~p1=::>p2)) & p2 is true under both true and false assignments of p1 and p2, it is a truth formula.\n\n(A)\n\n(2) In order to determine if the formula ((p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)) is a truth formula, falsehood formula, or neither, we will investigate its truth value under all possible assignments of p1, p2, and p3.\n\n1.

Conjunction (denoted by ∧) returns true when both inputs are true, so we know that not conjunction (¬(p∧q)) will return false only if p∧q is false, which occurs when either p is false or q is false.\n4.

Otherwise, if either one of the inputs is not powered, the output is not powered. This corresponds to the following truth table row:\n   [[P, Q, O1]; [+, +, +]; [-, +, -]; [+, -, -]; [-, -, -]]\n\n2. For the second conjunction (p ∧ r), we would create another and gate where the outputs are connected as inputs, similar to the first conjunction. The output (O2) is powered if both inputs, P and R, are powered. Otherwise, the output is not powered.
