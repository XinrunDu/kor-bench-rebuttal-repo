Since 25 is not a multiple of 5, and 5 is not a multiple of 25, this operation falls into the third category of the rule. Therefore, 25※5 = 24.\n\nSo, **25※5 = 24**.\n\nNow, we have the equation `24※X = 4` and need to find X.\n\n2. **Solving for X**:\n- We apply the operation rule again, which now directly applies to `24※X` based on the results we have.\n- We need to understand that the operation needs to equate to 4, however, we look at the rule, understanding how to approach it.\n- **24※X**: if 24 is a multiple of X, we use `24/X + 2`. If X is a multiple of 24, we use `X/24 + 2`. If 24 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 24, then `24※X = 24`.\n\nGiven that `24※X = 4`, we might initially consider our operation mappings directly, but the provided rule directs that `24*X+2` should be addressed through the corrective step logically deduced as it doesn't directly map through the provided mappings, implying X directly aids in reaching a common target via the given identities or conditions rather than being conditional through the multipliers' relationship.\n\nLet's consider the action required to achieve the target equating `24*X + 2 = 4`.\n\n- `24*X + 2 = 4` simplifies to `24*X = 2`, leading to `X = 2/24` or `X = 1/12`.\n\nTherefore, the solution to `24※X = 4` under the operation where `24*X + 2 = 4` is **X = 1/12**.\n\nHence, **[[1/12]]** is the answer to the question, carefully following the instructions and applying the operation rule and logic accurately.",

Evaluate `X※13`:\n   - Since `X` and `13` have no relation given from the problem, we cannot directly apply the above rules. Hence, `X※13 = 24` (no information about divisibility).\n\nNext, work from right to left to simplify further:\n\n2. Evaluate `19※28※4`.\n\nFirst, check if `19※28` can be solved based on the rules:\n- Neither 19 nor 28 is a multiple of the other, so `19※28 = 24`.\n\nNow, we are left with `24※4`.\n\nEvaluate `24※4`:\n- `24` is a multiple of `4`, so `24※4 = 4/24 + 2 = 1/6 + 2 = 7/6`.\n\nGiven: `24※4※(X※13) = 3`.\n\nThis simplifies to: `7/6※(X※13) = 3`.\n\nWe already know `7/6※(X※13) = 3`. To find `X`, we focus on `X※13` from the original question. Since we know `7/6※(X※13) = 3`, let's solve for `X※13`:\n\n- Since `7/6` is not a multiple of `X` (as `X<13` for anything that would make `X === 7/6`), `X※13 = 24`.\n\nNow we revert from that step:\n\n3. Evaluate `X※13`:\n   - `X※13 = 24` should be previously derived based on compatibility with the conditions already met.\n\nThe actual steps to solve for `X` based on operations being done in the equation go:\n- `19※28※4※(X※13) = 3`\n- After evaluating `19※28` and `4`, `7/6※(X※13) = 3`\n- Thus `X※13 = 24` comes from the definition of the operation.\n\nTo find `X`:\n\n`X※13 = 24`\n\nFollowing one of the definitions:\n- Since `X` and `13` are not multiples of each other (and determining exact `X` from this alone based on `13※X` setup is not clear without direct operation counterpart relation):\n  - One step is to realize `X = 8` logic aligns with understanding: `13 * 2 - 2 = 24`, implying `X/13 = 2` and solution aligning for reversibility.\n\nHence, solving the operation and steps correctly aligns `X=8` when having kept logical understanding within the operation rule bounds.\n\nThe answer goes to `[[8]]`.",

Given that our operation doesn't depend on a specific value of \\(a\\) except for defining the limits of our integral and we've already isolated the constant part (6) to equate to \\(\\ln(2) + 6\\), the question seems to be more about understanding the operation than solving for a unique value of \\(a\\).\n\nHowever, to adhere to a number-based answer and the instruction to ensure the answer follows the rule accurately, the output doesn't require defining \\(a\\) beyond understanding that its role is to be the upper and lower limit of the integral resulting in no numeric value change (since the result of the operation is dependent on a constant addition and the property of definite integrals from a number to itself).\n\nThe instruction specifies we're looking for a 'number or a group of numbers' as the answer.
