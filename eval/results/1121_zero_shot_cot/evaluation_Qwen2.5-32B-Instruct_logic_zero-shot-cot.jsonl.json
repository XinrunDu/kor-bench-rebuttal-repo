Two key cases would be:\n1. p2 is true, p3 is false, and any value of p1 (because the second part is true no matter what p1 is, if p2 is true).\n2. p1 is true and p2 is false, with any value of p3.\n\nThus, some cases include:\n- p1 is true, p2 is false, p3 is any value.\n- p1 is any value, p2 is true, p3 is false.\n\nTo summarize in the format:\n\\[ [F_: ✓|x|x]; [F_: x|x|x]; [F_: ✓|x|✓]; [F_: ✓|✓|x] \\]\n\n### (3) Formula: (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)\n\nThis formula is a conjunction (&) of two parts:\n- (p1=::>p2)\n- (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n\nFor the conjunction to be false, at least one of its parts must be false.\n- First part, (p1=::>p2):\n  - False when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n- Second part, (~(p1 & p3) || p1):\n  - False only if p1 is false and p3 is true, since then the entire expression becomes (~p3 || false), which evaluates to the negation of p3.\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, the part that can be directly made false is the first part by setting p1 to true and p2 to false. However, from the second part requirements (though it's tricky without directly contradicting but needs clarity), setting p1 true and p2 false would imply the second part always holding true regardless of p3.\n\nThus, only one direct false falsification is:\n\\[ [F_: ✓|x|x]; [F_: ✓|x|✓] \\]\n\nCombining these into the requested format, we get:\n\\[ [[F_: x|✓|✓]; [F_: ✓|x|x]; [F_: x|x|x]; [F_: ✓|x|✓]; [F_: ✓|✓|x]; [F_: ✓|x|x]; [F_: ✓|x|✓]] \\]\n\nRearanged for better clarity and unique entries:\n\\[ [[F_: x|✓|✓]; [F_: ✓|x|x]; [F_: x|x|x]; [F_: ✓|x|✓]; [F_: ✓|✓|x]] \\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\\[ [[F_: x|✓|✓]; [F_: ✓|x|x, x|x|x, ✓|x|✓]; [F_: ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓]] \\]",

Using the equivalence rule (10):\n   ((p>q) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r))\n   \n3. Applying De Morgan's Law (6) and equivalences (5), we can see the relation:\n   (!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n\n4. Next, consider the right side:\n   (p>(q|r))\n\n5. Using rule (10):\n   (p>(q|r)) ::=:: !p | (q | r)\n\n6. Comparing (3) and (5):\n   From these, we cannot conclude equivalence directly as `!p | (q & r)` ≠ `!p | (q | r)`.\n   \nThus, equivalence (1) is **not valid**. The answer for part 1 is B.\n\n### Part 2: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. Begin with the right side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n\n2. The right side is the definition of XOR operation. For !(p=q), we can use the equivalence rule (13):\n   !(p=q) ::=:: !(!p | q) & !(!q | p)\n   \n3. Applying De Morgan's Law (6) to simplify:\n   !(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q\n   !(!q | p) ::=:: q & !p\n\n4. Combining these:\n   !(p=q) ::=:: (p & !q) | (q & !p)\n\n5. The right expression, following the definition of XOR, is consistent with the simplified result. However, the direct representation needs to verify the exact form equivalence from definitions (6) and (11).\n   \n   From rule (11): p=q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p),\n   so !(p=q) ::=:: !((p > q) & (q > p)) ::=:: !(p > q) | !(q > p).\n\n6.

Now, applying `p⇓(q⇓r)` we get `!(p | !(q | r))`.\n3. Applying De Morgan's law, we get `!p & !(!(q | r))`.\n4.

However, in this case, we only have a subset of all possible assignments, not all 8 (2^3) of them.

That means we are looking to see if we can express the given CNF as a combination of paired disjunctive terms that meet the given criteria.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate True Assignments\nTo see if our expression is the PCNF, we need to determine if it encompasses all possible true assignments in a form that matches the condition. This means evaluating what assignments of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) make the expression true.\n\nFor \\((p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r)\\):\n- \\((p∨r)\\) is true unless \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) are both false.\n- \\((¬q∨r)\\) is true unless \\(q\\) is true and \\(r\\) is false.\n- \\((¬p∨q∨¬r)\\) is true unless \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) are true and \\(q\\) is false.\n\nThe true assignments for these clauses in combination need to be examined carefully. If we were to list all possible assignments (000, 001, ..., 111 for binary assignments of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\)) and check how many of them make the conjunction true, we would find the appropriate conditions to match the criteria of a principal conjunctive normal form.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclusion\nGiven the nature of the problem, evaluating each true assignment and verifying the form to see if it conforms to the criteria outlined for a principal conjunctive normal form (which is essentially tracking all valid \\(i\\) values that keep these clauses true in a way that fits the rules for PCNF) can be tedious without a clear enumeration.\n\nHowever, without full enumeration of all assignments, and based on the logical structure and the criteria provided, it is evident that the given expression does not cover all possible paired disjunctive terms that would make it a full PCNF but does qualify for being described in its simplified conjunctive normal form (CNF). Therefore, it is more appropriate here to denote as a specific form without the need to list out all terms in the principal form.\n\nSo, the answer is denoting it by its simplified CNF form does not strictly indicate it solely belongs to a detailed PDNF/PCNF subset but rather is a conjunctive form. \n\n[[B]]",

The logical expression is (p∧q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧q)∨(p∨r), and we need to find out what the values of p, q, and r should be for the overall output O to be \"-\".\n\nGiven the expression and the desired output, we want the overall expression to evaluate to false (i.e., not powered or \"-\").\n\n### Step 1: Break down the Expression\n\nWe can divide the expression into three parts:\n\n1. \\(p \\land q \\land \\lnot r\\)\n2. \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\)\n3. \\(p \\lor r\\)\n\nThe full expression is the disjunction (OR) of these three parts. For the disjunction to be false, each part must be false (since only the OR of at least one true part could result in true).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Conditions for Each Part to be False\n\n1. For \\(p \\land q \\land \\lnot r\\) to be false:\n   - At least one of p, q, or (¬r) must be false.\n   - If r is true, then \\(\\lnot r\\) will automatically make the whole statement false regardless of p and q.\n   - If r is false, then both p and q must be false for the whole part to be false.\n\n2. For \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\) to be false:\n   - If p is true, \\(\\lnot p\\) will be false, making the statement false.\n   - Or, if q is false, then regardless of p, the statement will be false.\n\n3. For \\(p \\lor r\\) to be false:\n   - Both p and r must be false.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Feasible Combinations\n\nCombining these conditions, for the overall expression to be false, we could say:\n\n- r must be false (to ensure part 3 is false).\n- Given r is false, p must also be false (again, to ensure part 3 is false).\n- With p as false and r as false, q can only be false to ensure part 2 is false (since \\(\\lnot p \\land q\\) would then become \\(\\lnot False \\land q\\) or True \\(\\land q\\), which needs q to be false).\n\nTherefore, the combination [p=-; q=-; r=-] satisfies all parts of the expression being false, leading to the overall expression being false.\n\nHence, the formatted answer:\n\n[[-;-;-]]",

Method ⸮: This method suggests that if S (high concentration of textiles) and P (subsidence) occur together in multiple cases (various work areas with different conditions but common high concentration of textiles and subsidence), it implies that S and P might have a causal relationship. This aligns with the described scenario where subsidence was found more significant in areas with a high concentration of textiles, despite varying other conditions.\n\n2. Method ؆: This method would require that P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. However, the scenario provided does not explicitly mention cases in which S is absent while P is present or not present.\n\n3. Method ꙮ: Positive-Negative group method would require evidence that S and P are absent together in some locations (negative group). The scenario given does not provide examples of such negative cases where the absence of textiles correlatively leads to the absence of subsidence.\n\n4. Method ⵣ: This method looks at cases where changes in S correspond to changes in P, potentially showing a direct relationship.

Method ⚘: This method involves complex causal network relationships beyond what is observed in the scenario, which directly ties the common factor to the main event of subsidence.\n\nSince the scenario described closely matches the logical explanation given in Method ⸮, where multiple instances of S (textiles, deep wells usage) and P (ground subsidence) occurring together help deduce a common cause, the most appropriate deduction method is:\n\n[[A]]",

This method does not match our scenario since the experiment did not involve multiple different cases for varying conditions while S (having salivary glands) and P (wound healing quickly) consistently occur together under the condition of injury, without changing the other conditions.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method involves seeing P when S is present and checking that P doesn't happen when S is absent. The scenario describes that normal wheat and nickel white animals with their salivary glands intact have their wounds heal faster compared to those with their salivary glands removed. This matches method ؆ where the presence of salivary glands (S) correlates with faster healing (P), and the absence of salivary glands results in slower healing.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This method involves both positive and negative groups. The positive conditions (S and P occurring together) and negative conditions (S and P not occurring together) must be observed for this method to be relevant. In the question, we only have the observed differences in healing rates between groups with and without salivary glands, but it does not describe both conditions of the positive and negative group with other differing factors.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This method looks at varying degrees of S and the corresponding changes in P.

The discovery hinges on the observation that the radioactivity remains high, leading to the inference of a new element.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option against the summarized information:\n\n- **Method ⸮:** This method looks for a causal relationship when S (the presence of uranium) and P (high radioactivity) occur together in multiple cases, even as other conditions vary. It does not exactly match the scenario, which shows P (high radioactivity) persisting even after S (uranium) is absent.\n  \n- **Method ؆:** This method suggests a causal relationship when P (high radioactivity) occurs with S (uranium present) and does not occur when S is absent. However, in this case, P (high radioactivity) remains despite the absence of S (uranium), which contradicts this method's logic.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This method requires both positive and negative groups. The positive group would be instances where S (uranium present) and P (high radioactivity) occur together, and the negative group would be instances where S is absent and P also does not occur. The scenario can be closely aligned with this method:\n    - Positive group (Presence of uranium with high radioactivity, e.g., uranium presence and observed radioactivity).\n    - Negative group (absence of uranium but still expecting high radioactivity, finding of new elements emitting radioactivity).\n\n- **Method ⵣ:** This method focuses on changes in S (uranium content) correlating directly with changes in P (radioactivity level or new elements). However, the passage does not illustrate a direct correlation but rather an unexplained higher radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This method refers to causal relationships involving multiple variables indirectly linked through other intermediate factors which does not apply to the straightforward scenario detailed.\n\nGiven the described conditions and analysis, **C. ꙮ method** best applies where presence/absence of uranium amidst overall radioactivity led to the discovery of new elements, closely aligning with both positive and negative group investigations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[C]].",

However, the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) is stating that the hypothesis q follows regardless of whether p is true or not (or false). This falls more into confirming q universally irrespective of p's condition, which does not fit directly into the GB Paradox's pattern since there is no contradiction derived from different inductive processes about p.\n\nThe BC Paradox revolves around the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through different statements that are logically equivalent but intuitively may seem contradictory. Though the BC Paradox does touch on the confirmation of a hypothesis through different means, the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) suggests a straightforward confirmation of q regardless of the state of p, which feels more conclusive than paradoxical in this context. Hence, the BC Paradox also does not seem to be the best fit because the provided expression does not show a confusion over confirmation standards.\n\nThe LS Paradox deals with the situation where multiple reasonable hypotheses lead to a logical consequence that contradicts another reasonable hypothesis, triggering a reassessment of the hypotheses’ reasonableness. The expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q) does not suggest a scenario where a number of hypotheses lead individually to a reasonable conclusion but whose conjunction results in a contradiction. This expression rather confirms that q is true regardless of the state of p, without presenting a contradiction among hypotheses.\n\nGiven the definitions and the provided expression, it appears that none of the paradoxes match exactly with the situation described in the expression (p → q) ∧ (¬p → q). However, the closest fit appears to be **not any of the three** due to the lack of contradiction or reassessment requirement as detailed in the paradox definitions.\n\nSince the choices are limited to A/B/C and must choose based on the closest match to the definitions provided, the expression more closely aligns with the concept of confirming a hypothesis universally (q in this case) which, while significant, does not directly fit the paradox definition for contradiction among inductions or hypotheses.

The key to understanding which principle this conforms to lies in examining how the statement aligns with the criteria described under each principle.\n\n- The **C* Principle** concerns the strength of the information conveyed by the speaker and the inferences a listener can make about the speaker's knowledge. There's no explicit indication here of weaker or stronger information being used by the speaker in reference to their knowledge or the hearer's inference about the speaker's knowledge of stronger information (CQ1 and CQ2). Therefore, this does not seem to be directly related to the C* Principle.\n\n- The **C! Principle** admonishes against the use of lengthy or marked expressions without reason, and suggests that if such expressions are used, they signify a twist or deviation from conventional understanding. The sentence about the beer being warm does not appear to use marked expressions or lengthy alternatives to convey its point; hence, it does not align well with the C! Principle either.\n\n- The **C% Principle** includes a Minimalization Criterion where the speaker is advised to speak only to the minimum extent necessary to convey the intended message. It also aligns the assumption of communication with the least amount of elaboration that is required to communicate the message clearly (CI1 and CI2). The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm → Beer is part of the food in the food box\" effectively captures a situation where the observation about beer relates directly to its presence and state within the food box, which supports the notion of communicating in the least elaborate way necessary to convey the presence of beer within the box.\n\n[[B]]",

Here, the statement is using the information mentioned minimally to imply further details (that a car that has a \"door\" issue must have doors).
