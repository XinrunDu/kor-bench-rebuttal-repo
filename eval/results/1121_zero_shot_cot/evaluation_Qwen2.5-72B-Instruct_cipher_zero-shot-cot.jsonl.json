So, we use Grid0.\n\n2. **Grid0:**\n   - Grid0 is:\n     ```\n     | P | H | I | L | S |\n     | A | B | C | D | E |\n     | F | G | K | M | N |\n     | O | Q | R | T | U |\n     | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n     ```\n\n3. **Find the Position of 'B':**\n   - 'B' is located at position (1, 1) in Grid0.\n\n4. **Move One Grid Position to the Lower Right:**\n   - Moving one position to the lower right from (1, 1) results in (2, 2).\n   - The letter at position (2, 2) in Grid0 is 'K'.\n\n5. **Form the Encrypted Block:**\n   - The encrypted block for \"B\" is \"K\".\n\n6. **Final Encrypted Message:**\n   - Since \"B\" is the only character in the block, the final encrypted message is \"K\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer is:\n\n[[K]]",
