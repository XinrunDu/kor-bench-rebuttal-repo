This does not directly confirm non-equivalence without a more exhaustive comparison or proof by contradiction, but based on initial simplification, it suggests they might not be equal.\n\n- **Equivalence (2)**: Similar analysis as for equivalence (1) applies, and similar to the first case, simplification does not directly confirm equivalence without further examination.\n\n**Conclusion based on initial analysis but note the need for strict proof**:\n- For Equivalence (1), the initial simplification does not strongly confirm equivalence.\n- For Equivalence (2), the initial simplification similarly does not strongly confirm equivalence.\n\nGiven the initial approach and the logical structure, the answer to whether the equivalences are valid is not directly supported by the initial simplification alone, which suggests \"B. No\" for both sub-questions, indicating that based on a cursory examination, the equivalences do not appear to be straightforwardly valid according to the basic logical equivalences provided. However, a more rigorous proof or detailed comparison would be required to definitively confirm this.\n\nThe answer format, thus, based on the initial assessment but acknowledging the need for a more rigorous approach, is [[B];[B]].",

We need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in this formula.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the logical operations and reasoning patterns\nWe can simplify the formula by using the distributive property of the disjunction over the conjunction:\n- (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be rewritten as ¬p^(¬q^r)∨¬p^(q^r) using the associative property.\n\nNow, we can apply the distributive property again:\n- ¬p^(¬q^r)∨¬p^(q^r) becomes ¬p^((¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p))∨¬p^((q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)).\n\nSince ¬p is present in each term, we can factor it out:\n- ¬p^((¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p))∨¬p^((q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)) becomes (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p).\n\nNow, we see that both disjunctive terms are the same, so we have:\n- (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p) simplifies to (¬q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p)∨(q∨¬p)^(r∨¬p) which is equivalent to (¬q∨¬p∨q)^(r∨¬p), because (r∨¬p)∨(r∨¬p) is equivalent to (r∨¬p).\n\nSince ¬q∨¬p∨q is a tautology, the term becomes ¬p∨r, which is equivalent to (¬p∧¬r)∨(p∨r).\n\nNow, let's find the paired conjunctive terms of (¬p∧¬r)∨(p∨r).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the paired conjunctive terms\nSince ¬p∨r is a tautology (as it includes both ¬p and p), it does not contribute to the principal disjunctive normal form in the traditional sense. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we can consider the individual components (¬p∧¬r) and (p∨r) separately.\n\nFor (¬p∧¬r), the true assignment corresponds to 00 in binary, which is 0 in hexadecimal.

However, since case 2 alone doesn't contribute to an \"-\" output without also involving p as \"-\" through the overlap with case 1 or 3, we focus on combinations that include case 1 or 3 being true to satisfy the entire expression.\n- Case 3: This complements case 1. If p is \"-\" due to case 1 or due to making case 3 true solely, and r is \"-\", this combination, while not fulfilling case 2 alone (since p would naturally be \"+\" in that context if not considering case 1), fits within the broader solution set that includes an \"-\" output.\n\nTherefore, the primary combinations that satisfy the entire expression (including the \"-\" output condition) are focused on where p and q are consistent across conditions that lead to an \"-\" output, with r's condition being more about complementing the overall expression rather than ensuring the \"-\" output exclusively through this clause.\n\nGiven the rule that the expression can be true with any of these cases, but not all at once, and the output condition being an \"-\", the simplest and most direct solution that satisfies the entire expression without the need for complex combinations that might arise from considering case 2 alone (since it inherently overlaps with case 1 or 3) is:\n\n- [p=\"-\", q=\"-\", r=\"+\"]\n\nThis satisfies all parts of the expression that lead to an \"-\" output.

If the proposition SIP is false:\n   - According to the # relation, since SIP is an I proposition (Particular Affirmative) and SOP is its contradictory form within the I/O category, if SIP is false, then SOP must be true.\n   - So, if SIP is false, then SOP is true.\n\n2.

If the proposition SAP is true:\n   - Using the % relation, if SAP is an A proposition (Universal Affirmative) and SIP is a particular proposition (Particular Affirmative), if SAP is true, then SIP is also true because the existence of at least one S that is P confirms the truth of an A proposition.\n   - So, if SAP is true, then SIP is true.\n   - Additionally, using the & and # relations, if SAP is true (meaning all S are P), then SEP must be false because an E proposition (No S are P) contradicts an A proposition (All S are P).\n   - So, if SAP is true, then SEP is false.\n\n4.

Apply the Concurrent Rule: If c1 and c2 can be executed concurrently, then ⟨ c1 || c2 ⟩φ is equivalent to ⟨ c1 ⟩⟨ c2 ⟩φ ∨ ⟨ c2 ⟩⟨ c1 ⟩φ.\n\nHowever, since the Concurrent Rule by itself does not specify independence in terms of truth value preservation for φ, we need to infer this from the given condition that neither command affects the truth value of φ. This implies that the execution of each command individually does not change the truth value of φ. Therefore, we can simplify the application of the rule based on this independence:\n\nFor c1: [ c1 ]φ (since c1's execution does not affect the truth value of φ)\nFor c2: [ c2 ]φ (since c2's execution does not affect the truth value of φ)\n\nApplying the Concurrent Rule with these assumptions:\n\n⟨ c1 || c2 ⟩φ is equivalent to (⟨ c1 ⟩⟨ c2 ⟩φ ∨ ⟨ c2 ⟩⟨ c1 ⟩φ)\n\nGiven the independence, ⟨ c1 ⟩⟨ c2 ⟩φ is equivalent to [ c1 ]φ and ⟨ c2 ⟩⟨ c1 ⟩φ is equivalent to [ c2 ]φ.\n\nSo, ⟨ c1 || c2 ⟩φ is equivalent to ([ c1 ]φ ∨ [ c2 ]φ).\n\nIn the simplest form, the logical expression is:\n\n[ c1 ]φ ∨ [ c2 ]φ",

Although this paradox involves contradictions, it doesn't relate to the issue of the validity of the evidence itself.\n\nB.

However, we can analyze the scenario to see if there is any implicit application of these principles based on the context provided.\n\n1. **C* Principle**: This principle focuses on the speaker's and hearer's criteria regarding the strength of information in statements. The example does not explicitly apply any of the CQ1 or CQ2 criteria from the C* Principle.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle is about speaking minimally to achieve communication goals. The example does not explicitly apply CI1 or CI2 criteria from the C% Principle. However, one could argue that the statement's brevity (opening the box, beer is warm) is a form of minimalization, aiming to convey the fact without elaborating on other potential items in the box or the context of the situation. This interpretation leans towards an application of the spirit of the C% Principle's Minimalization Criterion.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle is about avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions unnecessarily. The example does not utilize such expressions; in fact, it uses straightforward language.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **C* Principle** does not directly apply.\n- **C% Principle** could be seen as indirectly applied through the interpretation of minimalization in communication, suggesting that the speaker is trying to convey only the necessary information to the point (that the beer is warm) without elaborating on all possible contents of the food box.\n- **C! Principle** does not directly apply.\n\nSince the provided scenario most closely relates to an implicit application of the spirit of the C% Principle's Minimalization Criterion, though not a direct match, the closest answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```\n\nThis choice aligns with interpreting the statement as an example of minimal communication, focusing on the key information (the beer's warmth) without detailing the full contents of the food box, which aligns with the principle of speaking as little as possible while effectively conveying the intended message.
