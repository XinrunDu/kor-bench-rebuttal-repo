This equivalence can be derived using the given rules. Here are the steps: \n     - Start with the left-hand side: (p&!q) | (!p&q)\n     - Using distribution (rule 5): (!p&q) ::=:: (!p|p) & (!p|q)\n     - Associative property (rule 4): (!p|p)&(!p|q) ::=:: !p|(p&q)\n     - De Morgan's law (rule 6): !((p|q)) ::=:: !(p|q)\n\n   Thus, we have shown that equivalence (2) is also valid.\n\n### Response Format\n\nBased on the provided instructions, the response should adhere to the following format: [[Answer1]; [Answer2]].

Understand the Form: The expression $(p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)^{(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)}$ is in the form of an exponential expression with two parts, which we need to analyze separately.\n\n2. Identify Base and Exponent:\n   - Base: $p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$\n   - Exponent: $\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$\n\n3. Find Paired Disjunctive Terms:\n   - For the Base: The variables in the base are $p, q,$ and $r$. To form a paired disjunctive term, we need each variable and its negation to appear exactly once. So, the paired disjunctive terms for the base are $[\\neg p \\vee q \\vee r, p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg r]$.\n   - For the Exponent: The variables in the exponent are also $p, q$, and $r$. Similarly, we form the paired disjunctive terms: $[p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r, \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r]$.\n\n4. Denote the Paired Disjunctive Terms:\n   - Base: The binary representation of the assignments for the first term $\\neg p \\vee q \\vee r$ is $101$, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 5$. So, this term is denoted as $M5$. The second term, $p \\vee \\neg q \\vee \\neg r$, is $001$ in binary, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 1$, denoted as $M1$.\n   - Exponent: Similarly, for the exponent, the first term $p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r$ is $110$ in binary, which is $\\text{hexadecimal} 6$, so it is $M6$. The second term, $\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r$, is $000$ in binary ($\\text{hexadecimal} 0$), denoted as $M0$.\n\n5. Final Expression:\n   The final expression can be denoted as:\n   - [[paired disjunctive terms: $M5, M1; M6, M0$];\n   - [denoted: Base: $M5, M1$, Exponent: $M6, M0$]]\n\nThis represents the paired disjunctive terms and their notation for the given expression, following the specified logical rules.",

To better illustrate this point, let's set up the following symbolic expression: \"Du Fu is a great poet\" as P and \"Du Fu is a person from the Tang Dynasty\" as Q, which makes the whole reasoning process into \"Either P or Q. Q, **erroneously denies** P.\" That is, the whole reasoning process denies the antecedent (what causes something), which is the fallacy of denying the premise.",
