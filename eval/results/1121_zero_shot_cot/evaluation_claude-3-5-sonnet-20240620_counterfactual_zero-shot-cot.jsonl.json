Current artificial intelligence does not have self-awareness.\n\nThe story mentions that Karen Plankton is a \"waterproof supercomputer\" and Plankton's \"sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula.\" This demonstrates that Karen, as an artificial intelligence, can autonomously devise and propose evil plans, but the story does not indicate that she has self-awareness or a higher moral standard than other intelligent entities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[B]]",

The story mentions that the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. It was operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\n\n2. However, in 2026, the Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage due to a coronal mass ejection storm beyond G5 level, resulting in the sacrifice of the six scientists.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that:\n\n- Artificial biospheres capable of resisting solar storms beyond G5 level have not been developed (option A is incorrect).\n- The Space Biosphere 1 station was self-sufficient in outer space for over 500 days, but not over 4 years (option B is incorrect).\n- Humanity has not yet been able to construct a space station that can be entirely self-sufficient in space (option C is correct).\n- There is no mention of biospheres being detected beyond Mars (option D is incorrect).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[C]]",
