C* Principle:\n   - (1) Speaker's Criterion: C's statement \"I managed to get the materials\" is not weaker in information than C's knowledge, as it implies that the process of obtaining the materials was not straightforward.\n   - (2) Hearer's Inference:\n     - CQ1: C's statement \"I managed to get the materials\" does not entail a stronger statement \"I easily got the materials,\" so the inference K~(\"I easily got the materials\") cannot be made.\n     - CQ2: C's statement \"I managed to get the materials\" does not entail the content of an embedded sentence \"I got the materials without any difficulty,\" and {easily, managed} form a contrast set, so the inference ~K(\"I got the materials without any difficulty\") can be made.\n\n2.
