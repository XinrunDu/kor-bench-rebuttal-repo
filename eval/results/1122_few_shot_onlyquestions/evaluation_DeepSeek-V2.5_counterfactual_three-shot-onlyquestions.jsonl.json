This aligns with the theme of agriculture and the importance of fertile land in Tolkien's Middle-earth, especially in the Shire.\n3. **Question 3**: The answer is [[D]], suggesting that \"The Ent-draughts\" are an effective way to resolve a water scarcity crisis.

Molecular level##D.Sophon level\n   - **Answer:** [[D]]\n   - **Observation:** The answer provided is \"D,\" which corresponds to \"Sophon level.\" This is likely correct based on the context of the question.\n\n3. **Question 3: \"What is society's general attitude toward alien civilizations?\"**\n   - **Options:** A.Fear##B.Angry ##C. Commiserative##D.Curious\n   - **Answer:** [[A]]\n   - **Observation:** The answer provided is \"A,\" which corresponds to \"Fear.\" This is a plausible answer, reflecting a common societal attitude.\n\n4. **Question 4: \"What is the greatest threat to world peace?\"**\n   - **Options:** A.Extinction of rare species##B.Alien invasion##C. Economic crisis##D. Nuclear weapons\n   - **Answer:** [[A]]\n   - **Observation:** The answer provided is \"A,\" which corresponds to \"Extinction of rare species.\" This suggests that the provided answer may not be aligned with the expected logic (i.e., the \"greatest threat to world peace\"). Correct answer should be [[D]] (Nuclear weapons).\n\n### Application to the Last Question\n\nGiven the pattern of the answers, it seems there might be an error in the provided answers for Questions 1 and 4, where \"A\" was chosen incorrectly. Therefore, the correct answers for these questions should be:\n\n- **Question 1:** [[C]] (Diamond)\n- **Question 4:** [[D]] (Nuclear weapons)\n\n### Final Answer for the Last Question:\n\n**Question: \"What is the greatest threat to world peace?\"**\nOptions: A.Extinction of rare species##B.Alien invasion##C.

Jews think other races that are not pure-blooded are even more inferior;\nC. Carnivores think Judy is unfit to be a police officer;\nD. light-skinned African-Americans think dark-skinned African-Americans lack culture.\n\nOption A fits the pattern of discrimination within a race, as it involves bias within the same species (herbivores within sheep).\n\nOption B involves discrimination between races, not within a race.\n\nOption C involves discrimination based on diet (carnivores vs. herbivores), not within a race.\n\nOption D involves discrimination within the same race (African-Americans), which fits the pattern established in the previous questions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the last question is:\n[[D]]",

During the Qin Dynasty, there were already war machines known as mechanical beasts, typically large in size, all of which required a person to sit on top to operate.\nB. Although the Qin Dynasty adopted some mechanical manufacturing techniques to produce weapons and military equipment, such as crossbows, there were no mechanical beasts capable of automatically locking onto and attacking targets.\nC.
