Here are the observations:\n\n1. **Conversion of Propositions to Symbolic Formulas:**\n   - The first question converts a proposition into a logical expression. The answer [[p1=~p2]] indicates that \"p1 if and only if p2 is false\" is symbolized as \\( p1 \\iff \\neg p2 \\).\n\n2. **Determination of Level and Type:**\n   - The second question categorizes **p1** into a level and type. The answer [[A];[C]] suggests that **p1** is of level A (Truth Formula level) and type C (Neither Truth Formula nor Falsehood Formula).\n\n3. **Truth and Falsity Values:**\n   - The third question assesses the truth and falsity values of a formula. The answer [[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]] provides a pattern of truth and falsity values for the given formula.\n\n4. **Level Determination of a Complex Formula:**\n   - The fourth question determines the level of a more complex formula. The answer [[D]] suggests that the formula is of level D.\n\nGiven these patterns, we can infer that the level determination is a systematic categorization based on the complexity and nature of the logical expressions. The levels seem to increment as the complexity of the formula increases.\n\n### Applying the Rules to the Last Question:\nThe last question asks for the level of a formula: \\(( \\neg(p1 \\implies \\neg p2) ) \\& ( (p3 \\lor p4) \\iff \\neg p1 )\\).\n\nThis formula is complex, involving multiple logical operations (negation, implication, conjunction, and equivalence). Based on the observed pattern of increasing complexity leading to higher levels (A, B, C, D, etc.), the level of this formula would be higher than the previous examples.\n\nGiven the pattern, the level would be incremented from the previous level D. Since the previous level was D, the next logical increment would be **E**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[E]]",

However, Method C seems to be about considering what is not included in the statement rather than what is included.\n\nConsidering the rule derived from the previous examples, the negation of \"tested by practice\" might be \"not tested by practice.\" However, since Method C seems to work more with binary negations (private/non-private, efficient/non-efficient), we need to rephrase the original statement to fit the pattern.\n\nA possible rephrase that fits the pattern could be: \"No genuine scientific theories are untested.\"\n\nApplying Method C:\n- Original Statement: \"No genuine scientific theories are untested.\"\n  - Transformed Statement: \"Some tested theories are genuine scientific theories.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[Sometestedtheoriesaregenuinescientifictheories.]]",

Therefore, they have an \"x relationship.\"\n- (2) The sentence \"The Brazil football team will definitely win the championship\" implies a stronger assertion than \"The Brazil football team may win the championship.\" This suggests a relationship where the stronger assertion implies the weaker one, which is not contradictory but rather a stronger to weaker relation, likely corresponding to an \"A\" relationship.\n\n**Answer:**\n[[D];[A]]",

In the first question, since all 15 sampled employees completed their annual training, we generalize this to the entire company of 200 employees, resulting in [[100%]].\n\n2. **P-Generalization Rule**: This rule is used when a proportion is observed in a sample and is generalized to the entire population. In the second question, 6 out of 8 hours had a defect rate below 2%, so we generalize this proportion to the entire factory, resulting in [[75%]].\n\n3. **C-Reasoning Rule**: This rule is used to compare proportions across different groups. In the third question, we compare the proportion of participants in Group A (120 out of 150) and Group B (80 out of 100) who consume at least 5 servings of vegetables per week. The resulting symbolization is [[IfC(V,120/150,80/100),thenPr(V,G1)≈Pr(V,G2)]], indicating that the proportions are roughly equivalent.\n\n4. **P-Generalization Rule for the last question**: In the last question, 2 out of 50 randomly selected products were defective. We generalize this proportion to the entire batch of 1,000 products. The calculation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Defect rate} = \\left(\\frac{2}{50}\\right) \\times 100 = 4\\%\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the answer is [[4%]].",

The answer is [[B]], indicating that the BC Paradox is when observed data contradicts a confirmed hypothesis.\n\n3. **LS Paradox**: The third question involves a logical contradiction in hypotheses about plant growth conditions. The answer is [[A]], indicating that the LS Paradox is when logical consequences contradict a hypothesis.\n\n### Application to the Last Question:\nThe last question asks about adding a new hypothesis that contradicts an existing ensemble of hypotheses. Based on the identified rules:\n\n- **GB Paradox**: Involves contradiction between two hypotheses.\n- **BC Paradox**: Involves contradiction between observed data and a confirmed hypothesis.\n- **LS Paradox**: Involves logical contradiction in hypotheses.\n\nThe scenario described in the last question involves logical inconsistency when adding a new hypothesis that contradicts the ensemble proposition.
