For the resolvability of clauses, it seems that the resolution of two clauses is possible if there is at least one pair of complementary literals (i.e., p and ¬p). For example, C1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q and C2 = q ∨ ¬r can be resolved because there are no direct complementary literals, but after analyzing other examples, it seems that resolution of two clauses occurs when there exists at least one pair of complementary literals that can be eliminated after resolution. C1 = p ∨ q and C2 = p ∨ r cannot be resolved because there is no common literal that can be eliminated.\n\n\n2.  The dispel(C1, C2) operation seems to remove the complementary literals from the clauses.

There will be two iterations in the cycle, as after the second iteration, no new clauses can be derived.\n\n\nThe output of the resolution algorithm for p∧(p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(q∨¬r)∧(q∨r) is [[Implausible];[2]].",

The resolution rule: If two clauses C1 and C2 contain a literal and its negation (e.g., p and ¬p), the resolvent of C1 and C2 can be obtained by removing the literal and its negation from the two clauses and combining the remaining literals. This rule is applied when the dispel function is used.\n\n   Example: If C1 = p ∨ ¬q ∨ r and C2 = ¬p ∨ q ∨ ¬r, then dispel(C1, C2) = (¬q ∨ r ∨ q ∨ ¬r).\n\n2. The resolution algorithm works as follows:\n\n   * S0 is always an empty set, representing the set of false statements.\n   * S1 is the set of initial clauses, which are the given statements.\n   * S2 is the set of clauses that can be obtained by applying the resolution rule to the clauses in S1.\n   * In each cycle, the algorithm checks if the set S2 is empty or not. If S2 is not empty, S1 is updated by adding the clauses in S2, and S2 is reset to an empty set.\n\n3. To determine if the resolution algorithm can resolve a set of clauses, we need to check if the empty clause can be derived from the clauses.

In this case, if an attribute is common to all observed cases and is also shared by a new case, then the reasoning follows the Ψ Method.\n\nFor the +Ψ attribute, it refers to an attribute that is commonly observed in previous cases and is being inferred for a new case. Examples include:\n\n* The bird's feathers being black.\n* The plant's fragrance being sweet.\n\nOn the other hand, the #Ψ attribute seems to refer to an attribute that is a prerequisite or a common characteristic for a particular phenomenon or outcome, but not the specific outcome itself. Examples include:\n\n* The gift being from Professor Van Emelen.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\nIn the question, \"being an established school\" is a common characteristic shared by F University and H University, and it is mentioned that H University and F University have reached a new level after reform. \n\nThe attribute \"being an established school\" is a common characteristic of the schools being discussed, and it is being inferred that H University can also reach a new level after reform because it shares this characteristic with F University.\n\nTherefore, \"being an established school\" is a #Ψ attribute.\n\nThe answer is: [[A]]",
