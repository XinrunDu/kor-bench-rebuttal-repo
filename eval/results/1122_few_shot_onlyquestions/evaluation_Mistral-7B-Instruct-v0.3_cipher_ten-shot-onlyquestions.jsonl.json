For special characters like \"$\", \"?\", \"*\" etc., reverse the ASCII value and encapsulate in double square brackets. For example, \"$\" has ASCII value 36, so the answer is \"[[D]]\"\n4. For multi-character plaintext (like \"FK\"), reverse the order of characters ASCII values, join them, and encapsulate in double square brackets. For example, \"F\" has ASCII value 70 and \"K\" has ASCII value 75, so the answer is \"[[^_]]\"\n5. For number representation, add 7 to each digit (to avoid using special characters), and encapsulate the answer in double square brackets.

The equation for each letter is of the form `k^a`, where `k` is a base and `a` is an exponent. Based on the given answers, it seems the base is 4.\n\nLet's calculate the exponents for each letter in the given plaintext:\n- Z (26): 26 (since nothing suggests any more complex operation than exponentiation here)\n- Y (14): 4^2 (since theEncrypted answers for \"Y\" is [[8^3]], where 8=64=4^3, so Y's exponent is 3 - 1 = 2)\n- R (18): 4^4 (since nothing suggests any more complex operations)\n- H (8): 4^3 (since the Encrypted answer for \"M\" is [[6^1]], so H's exponent is 3)\n- K (10): We don't have a specific encryption rule for the letter K. But since K's encryption is [[5^2]], we can infer that K means 4^(8-2) = 4^6 = 64^(1/3) = 2^6.\n- G (7): 4^5 (since nothing suggests any more complex operations)\n- N (11): 4^6 (since nothing suggests any more complex operations)\n- P (15): 4^6 (since the Encrypted answer for \"P\" is [[6^1]], so N's exponent is 6)\n- D (4): 4^7 (since nothing suggests any more complex operations)\n- L (12): 4^8 (since nothing suggests any more complex operations)\n\nNow, we can encrypt the plaintext using the encrypted answers as a guide for the format:\n```\n[[(((((((2^6))^4)^7))^(11))^(4^8))^(4^5))^(4^(8-2))]][[(((((2^6))^4)^(18))^(4^4))^(4^3))][[((((4^8))^12))^(4^9))]\n```\nFor decryption, bear in mind that the cipher works in such a way that:\n```\n[[d^(-e)]] = 1 / (d^e)\n```\nSince the encryption and decryption processes are reverse operations, we can use the same sequence of exponent operations to decrypt the given ciphertext. Keep in mind that all the operations are modulo the prime number 41 (since 41 is the smallest prime number greater than 40 = 2^4 * 5 and it simplifies the calculations). Now, we can decrypt the given ciphertext:\n```\n(((6^(8-2))^(4^(-3)))*((4^(-8))^(-7))*(4^(-12))^(-11)*((4^(-4))^(-18))*(4^(-5))^(-15)*(4^(-9))^(-12))\n```\nThis expression can be computed using a calculator with modulo 41 implemented.

In the earlier questions, the letters were encrypted by their ASCII values in decimal format (without considerating special characters or negative numbers). However, the last question deviates slightly. To understand that, let's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. \"A\" (ASCII value = 65) is encrypted to \"[[65]]\"\n2. \"B\" (ASCII value = 66) is encrypted to \"[[66]]\"\n3. \"C\" (ASCII value = 67) is encrypted to \"[[22]]\" (strange, but since there are no other rules provided for this case, we'll stick with it)\n4. \"D\" (ASCII value = 68) is encrypted to \"[[54]]\" (without a single pattern, both uppercase and lowercase letters in the ASCII table are mixed in this example)\n\nFrom this analysis, the pattern isn't straightforward, but we cannot assume that there is a specific rule to convert the letter back to its ASCII value using a simple integer operation like 67+1 or 67*-1, since the ASCII values of \"C\" and \"D\" are used in their original form in the given data.\n\nNow let's consider the last question with the plaintext: \"AYHYLFHYVYO\". To get a proper pattern, we will break the sequence of the given plaintext letter-by-letter and find their ASCII values (decimal form):\n\n1. \"A\" with ASCII value 65\n2. \"Y\" with ASCII value 89\n3. \"H\" with ASCII value 72\n4. \"Y\" with ASCII value 89\n5. \"L\" with ASCII value 76\n6. \"F\" with ASCII value 70\n7. \"H\" with ASCII value 72\n8. \"Y\" with ASCII value 89\n9. \"V\" with ASCII value 86\n10. \"Y\" with ASCII value 89\n11. \"O\" with ASCII value 79\n\nBut as we have already noticed, the given ciphertext patterns still deviate from using the ASCII values in decimal format, so for this last question, the starting routine will be to convert each decimal ASCII value into its 4-digit binary representation and then append all of them to form one single string, without any additional operations:\n\n1. 65 (decimal to binary): 01000001\n2. 89 (decimal to binary): 10101001\n3. 72 (decimal to binary): 01001000\n4. 89 (decimal to binary): 10101001\n5. 76 (decimal to binary): 01001110\n6. 70 (decimal to binary): 01010100\n7. 72 (decimal to binary): 01001000\n8. 89 (decimal to binary): 10101001\n9. 86 (decimal to binary): 1010110\n10. 89 (decimal to binary): 10101001\n11. 79 (decimal to binary): 01001111\n\nFinally, we are ready to assemble the binary representation of the ASCII values for the plaintext \"AYHYLFHYVYO\" to form the encrypted answer:\n\n[[010000011010100101001000101010010100111001010100010010001010100110101101010110110101111]]",

For question 11 (\"WG\"), the shift was applied separately to each letter (as \"W\" becomes \"U\" and \"G\" becomes \"H\").

Questions 14 to 16 were provided with the key (\"C\" encrypts to \"S\"), so the decryption is straightforward.

Start with the plaintext \"XTVITDXEHZS\".\n2. Using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 1, apply the shift to each letter of the plaintext:\n   - X becomes A\n   - T becomes S\n   - V becomes U\n   - I becomes R\n   - T becomes T\n   - V becomes F\n   - I becomes W\n   - T becomes U\n   - D becomes S\n   - X becomes Q\n   - E becomes D\n   - H becomes G\n   - Z becomes J\n   - S becomes O\n3. Because the provided ciphertext answers used double letters in their ciphertext (\"SS\", \"LL\"), it's a strong indicator that a Caesar cipher is being used, and the shift might be 1 based on the first few examples. But to be absolutely certain, you could test different shifts for consistency or look for additional clues to confirm the shift.\n4. Arrange the letters (because of the double letters in the provided ciphertexts, we can assume that the spaces between words have been removed):\n\n   A Z R Q F W U S J O I K P L N B M\n\n5.

For example, the pair \"B\"/\"K\" shifts the letters by 2 places forward (since 'B' is the 2th letter in the alphabet and 'K' is the 14th, and since we go around the alphabet, a shift of 24 becomes a shift of 2).\n\nThe provided ciphertext \"GMKWVQPNWTZ\" corresponds to \"SILENCE\" when applied with the key \"AP\" (or with \"CI\" shifted forward by 1).

In the English alphabet, the letters `A` and `B` correspond to numbers `1` and `2`. The shifted version will be `A-1` moving one position to the right, which equals `B`, and `B-1` moving one position to the right, which equals `A`.\n- When we consider the given pairs of plaintext and ciphertext, we can observe that `A=[[AF]]`, `S=[[DV]]`, `N=[[VX]]`, `P=[[VFVG]]`, `F=[[G]]`, `D=[[DDVA]]`, `X=[[E]]`, and `G=[[C]]`. This pattern confirms our assumption that the text has been shifted by one position to the left.\n- With this knowledge, let's look at the given ciphertext `AXVXGFAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA`.

However, there seems to be a small anomaly in the second rule answer, where the plaintext \"A\" is encrypted as \"2F\" instead of \"9A\". This could mean that there's an additional step in the encryption process, but the provided examples don't provide enough information to confirm this. For simplicity, I'll assume the rule is as stated for the provided questions.\n\nTo decrypt the provided ciphertext \"9A899986938C9784\", we can first shift the ASCII values of all characters back by 86:\n\n'9' -> 'R' (because '9' + 86 = 95 and 95 - 64 = 31 and ASCII value of 'R' is 31)\n'A' -> 'A' (because 'A' + 86 = 101 and 101 - 64 = 37 and ASCII value of 'A' is 37)\n'8' -> '2' (because '8' + 86 = 94 and 94 - 64 = 30 and ASCII value of '2' is 30)\nFollowing the same process for the other characters:\n'9' -> '9'\n'9' -> '9'\n'8' -> '6'\n'6' -> 'G'\n'9' -> '9'\n'7' -> '7'\n'8' -> '8'\n'4' -> '4'\n\nSo the decrypted answer for \"9A899986938C9784\" is [[RG]] or [[GR]] (as 'R' and 'G' are interchangeable).

Each pair seems to correspond to one plaintext character, as in the cases observed.\n\nIn order to decrypt this message, we will map each pair to its corresponding plaintext character using the above table:\n\n- 27 corresponds to T\n- b8 corresponds to [Unknown character] (Not found in the table)\n- 73 corresponds to s\n- 03 corresponds to [Unknown character] (Not found in the table)\n- 8e corresponds to [Unknown character] (Not found in the table)\n- 20 corresponds to S\n- 27 corresponds to T\n- f8 corresponds to [Unknown character] (Not found in the table)\n- 5f corresponds to _\n- ba corresponds to d\n- 0b corresponds to [Unknown character] (Not found in the table)\n\nTo fill in the unknown characters, we can find patterns in the available plaintext characters. For example, since T appears twice in the plaintext, the first occurrence of the unknown character pair (b8) should likely have a similar effect. Observing the ambiguous characters \"s\" and \"d\", it seems that they could be used to fill each other in an alternating pattern, with \"s\" standing for an unknown character and \"d\" standing for itself.\n\nApplying this pattern, we get the decrypted string \"T[s]sT_d[d]\", which, for the purpose of your question, can be encapsulated in double square brackets as [[TssT_dd]].
