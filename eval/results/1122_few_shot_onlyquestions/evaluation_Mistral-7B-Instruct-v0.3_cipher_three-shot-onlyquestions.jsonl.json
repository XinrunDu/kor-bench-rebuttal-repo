This can be broken down as \"6^13\" first, which is 6 * (13^2), then take the root of the result, which is 6 * (169) = 1014, then square root it to get (ME).\n\n### Now, let's apply the same pattern to the last question:\n\nCiphertext: \"3^19^46^26^17^44^39^38^37^36^38^1\"\n\nFirst, we factor out common terms: \"3^(19+46+26+38)\"\n\nSecond, raise the common power to get an expression: (3^19) * (3^(46+26+38+37+36+38+1))\n\nThird, calculate the numerical value under the second parenthesis by using the same method as before for the \"ME” example:\n\n* (46+26+38+37+36+38+1) = 226\n\t+ (46+26+38+37+36+38) = 205\n\t+ (46+26+38) = 108\n\t+ (46) = 46\n\nNow, we break down the expression again:\n\n* (3^19) * (3^205) * (3^108) * (3^46)\n\nFinally, we calculate square roots, starting with the largest exponent:\n\n- square root of (3^46) is the encryption of \"F\"\n- square root of (3^108) is the encryption of \"O\"\n- square root of (3^205) is a three-character encryption, so we need to find a new pattern or make an assumption for this part\n- square root of (3^19) is the encryption of \"S\" (as calculated in step 2: (3^19)^2 = 5^2, hence the square root is \"S\")\n\nNow we can put it all together into the final answer:\n\n[[FSOS...]] (assuming the next encryption characters are the respective square roots of 3^205)",

The shifted letter that wraps around from Z to A (or A to Z) still counts as a wraparound.\n\nThe period specifies how many letters within the plaintext should be considered when sliding the alphabet for the shift. For instance, if the period is 4, and the increment is 3, instead of shifting each letter by 3, we should consider stretches of 4 letters and shift those as a group (for example: ABCD would become DCBA). If the period is larger than the length of the plaintext, the extra letters in the period would simply go unused.\n\nIn the last question, the ciphertext \"A\" and the period 8, and an increment of 4 can be used to calculatethe plaintext. However, since the length of \"A\" is less than the period, we still treat it as a stretch of four letters: A(shifted 4 places) B(shifted 4 places + wrapping around from Z to A) C(shifted 4 places + wrapping around from Z to A) D(shifted 4 places). By applying the shift (using A(1)+4 = 5, B(2)+4 = 6, C(26)+4 = 1, D(27)+4 = 2) and wrapping around when necessary, we can find the corresponding characters in the shifted alphabet, which is: E F G H (or, in the original alphabet: D C B A).\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is [[D]], since the question asks for the plaintext in the original alphabet.",

This indicates that each letter in the English alphabet is shifted one place to the right (a->b, b->c, c->d, ..., y->z, z->a) for encryption.\n\n2. For the ciphertext \"FH\", it gets decrypted as \"SX\". This means, the encryption rule from step 1 is the reverse for decryption (z-1->y-1, y-1->x-1, x-1->w-1, ..., a-1->z-1, a-1->b-1).\n\n3. However, the \"Ciphertext: \\\"AVFH\\\" decrypted as \\\"[[OKSX]]\\\" instead of \\\"[[AVW]]\\\". This tells us that two consecutive letters are shifted together instead of processing each letter independently.\n\n4. Hence, to encrypt or decrypt, we shift two letters of the plaintext (or ciphertext) together as if they form one unit. For example, \"AV\" => \"TU\" because (A+1, V+1) = (T, U). Similarly, \"FH\" decrypted as \"SX\" because (F-1, H-1) = (O, K).\n\n5. Applying this rule to the question \"Plaintext: \\\"EV\\\"\", we get (E+1, V+1) = (F, W).

But since our provided text is already encrypted (\"FH\"), we have to rotate the letters forward 3 places (\"F\" + 3 = \"H\", \"H\" + 3 = \"K\"). So, \"FH\" corresponds to \"NW\" when using this Caesar cipher.\n3. Ciphertext \"AVFH\" is decrypted to \"OKSX\". Assuming the same Caesar cipher, the first two letters \"AV\" correspond to \"NW\" from our pattern.

For example:\n\n- D (4 in English) encrypted to 8 (8 in English, shifted right 3 places).\n- 8 (8 in English) decrypted to C (3 in English, shifted left 3 places).\n- 98 (98 in English) encrypted to 58 (58 in English, shifted right 3 places for both digits).\n- 58 (58 in English) decrypted to E (4 in English, shifted left 3 places for both digits).\n\nContinuing with the given ciphertext (58349678987481574786361):\n\n- 5 is the 5th letter from the right in the English alphabet, so decrypted, it becomes D.\n- 8 is the 8th letter from the right in the English alphabet, so decrypted, it becomes H.\n- 3 is the 3rd letter from the right in the English alphabet, so decrypted, it becomes A.\n\nFollowing this pattern, we will decrypt the remaining numbers and connect them to get the decrypted message. Remember to shift all the letters 3 places to the left:\n\n- 496 shifts to A-B-Z-A (remember, we are working with English alphabet letters, not numbers).\n- 7898 shifts to O-L-I (we stopped at the 3rd letter since it always corresponds to the same letter).\n- 481574 shifts to H-T-K-R-E (again, we stopped at the 3rd letter).\n- 74786361 shifts to T-A-N-N-A-S (again, we stopped at the 3rd letter).\n\nConnecting these letters in the order they appear, the decrypted message is: [[DHAOLOTKREHTANNAS]]\n\nHowever, this message doesn't seem to form a coherent English word or phrase, suggesting there may be an extra step in the cipher.

The encryption method appears to convert each ASCII character (in this case only capital letters) to its decimal value, then convert that decimal value to base 8 (octal) and represent it as a string of 3 octal digits. The decryption method appears to be the reverse process, converting each triplet of octal digits into decimal values, and then converting those decimal values back to their ASCII characters.\n\nFor example, the letter \"A\" in ASCII is represented by the decimal value 65. In base 8, 65 is represented as 101001 (3 octal digits). So, [[65]] translates to [[101001]] and [[101001]] translates back to [[A]].\n\nTo decrypt \"588898898\" (which corresponds to the decimal value 58889 in base 8), we can translate it back to ASCII as follows:\n\n1. Convert the octal digits to decimal: 5 * (8^2) + 8 * (8^1) + 8 * (8^0) = 5 * 64 + 8 * 8 + 8 = 640 + 64 + 8 = 612 + 8 = 620 (since 8 is the remainder of 612 divided by 64)\n2. Convert the decimal back to ASCII: In base 10, 620 corresponds to the ASCII character 'B', and its remainder when divided by 26 (the number of lowercase letters) is 10.

From the examples provided, we can observe that each plaintext letter is translated into a 6-digit ciphertext number, with each digit corresponding to the position of the letter in the alphabet plus some offset.\n\nFor instance, in the first example, \"FO\" is translated into \"462898898\". If we look at the position of F and O in the alphabet (F=6, O=15), we can make the following calculation:\n\n- F becomes 6 + offset = 6 + 63 = 69 (mod 100, for a 6-digit number)\n- O becomes 15 + offset = 15 + 63 = 78 (mod 100, for a 6-digit number)\n\nSo, the offset is 63. Now, the original plaintext \"FO\" can be recreated by repeating this calculation in reverse:\n\n- Find the differences between the 6-digit ciphertext number and 63 to determine the positions in the alphabet. (462898898 - 63 = 459595535 mod 100 = 59)\n- The letter at position 59 is F, and at position 78 is O. (A script can help confirm these positions.)\n\nWith this pattern discovered, we can now convert the last question into the following:\n\n- Ciphertext 547898898 corresponds to plaintext. We need to find the inverse offset, which is -63.\n- Now, to get the plaintext, we subtract the inverse offset from each digit.\n- 54 - (-63) = 117 (mod 100) = 17, which corresponds to the letter \"Q\" (next to \"P\" in the alphabet).\n- Next, 78 - (-63) = 141 (mod 100) = 41, which corresponds to the letter \"D\" (next to \"C\" in the alphabet).\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is [[QD]].\n\nThis A1Z26 calculation pattern can be condensed into a simple function:\n\nplaintext_to_ciphertext(s):\n  offset = 63\n  ciphertext = map(lambda c: (ord(c) - ord('A') + offset) % 100, s)\n  return ''.join(str(i) for i in ciphertext)\n\nciphertext_to_plaintext(s):\n  offset = -63\n  plaintext = [chr((int(i) - offset) % 100 + ord('A')) for i in s]\n  return ''.join(plaintext)",

In the second question, the ciphertext \"591898898\" was decrypted to \"BY\". This suggests that each number was replaced by its corresponding letter where the ASCII value of the number is decreased by 65 (since the ASCII value of 'A' is 65).

The numbers correspond to the ASCII codes of the characters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z', plus the space character (32 in ASCII). In this cipher, 'N' is 936, 'O' is 972, 'P' is 996, 'Q' is 1020, 'R' is 1044, 'S' is 1068, 'T' is 1092, 'U' is 1116, 'V' is 1140, 'W' is 1164, and 'X' is 1188.\n\nI see that the first five numbers of the ciphertext (984, 840, 804) correspond to [B, C, A] in this cipher. Thus, the decrypted part of the first five numbers would be [BCA].\n\nFollowing the same pattern, the next 12 numbers (816, 984, 804, 864, 900, 792, 948, 852, 852) can be decrypted as [DFGH, RE, L, EK, M, NO, FF].\n\nIf we assume that the ciphered message is made up of single characters where a repetition of the same number indicates a repetition of the corresponding character, we can join the decrypted parts to get [BCA DFGH RE L EM NO FF].\n\nTo make the decrypted answer clearer, we can assume that the symbol 'FF' represents a space, making the decrypted answer [Checkered flag].\n\nIt's important to note that there might be a more complex rule at play, but based on the given information, this simple number-to-letter substitution cipher seems to be the case.",

The conversion is likely done by incrementing the ASCII values of the letters (excluding spaces) by a certain amount.\n\nThe first example, \"Plaintext: 'D'\", has an encryption key of 6 (since 65 + 6 = 71, which corresponds to 'D' in the ASCII table), so 'D' is encrypted as 71 - 65 = 6, which is 37 in decimal (65 being the ASCII value for 'A').\n\nFollowing this pattern, it can be inferred that 'A' is encrypted as 1 (since 65 - 64 = 1), 'B' is encrypted as 2, 'C' is encrypted as 3, and so on, until 'Z' is encrypted as 26. After 'Z', the encrypted values would start repeating since there is no characters with ASCII values greater than 126.\n\nThe second example gives us a hint, as 'C' (which is encrypted as '3' in this scheme) is the third letter in the alphabet, which supports the idea that there is a straight increment of values by some constant.\n\nThe third example, \"Ciphertext: '27bf7e'\", shows us that 'TPT' is encrypted as '27', 'bf', and '7e' respectively. Since we know that the first two were encrypted with a 1-based increment, and '2' corresponds to 'B', this gives us a new encryption key of 2. Since 'P' and 'T' both have an ASCII value of 80, with this new key, they are being encrypted as 80 - 2 = 78 (which corresponds to 'F' and 'V' respectively). So 'TPT' is decrypted as 'FV'. The last part, '7e', encrypted as 'e'.\n\nFollowing this, we can decrypt the remaining ciphertexts:\n\nThe fourth example, \"Ciphertext: '25'\", with an encryption key of 2, corresponds to 'C', so the decrypted answer is 'C'.\n\nThe fifth example, \"Ciphertext: '51'\", with an encryption key of 2, corresponds to 'Q', so the decrypted answer is 'Q'.\n\nAnd so on...\n\nFor the last question, \"Ciphertext: '58'\", with an encryption key of 2, corresponds to 'X', so the decrypted answer is 'X'.\n\nSo in the format you asked for, the answers would be :\n\n* [[37]] (encryption of 'D')\n* [[25]] (decryption of '32')\n* [[FV], 'e'] (decryption of '27bf7e')\n* [[W]] (decryption of '25')\n* [[X]] (decryption of '58')",

This suggests a pattern where numbers correspond to letters, but the digits are treated as hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values A-F correspond to 10-15 in decimal. So, \"TPT\" corresponds to hex values \"54\", \"70\", and \"74\". If we continue this pattern, \"27ad\" would be the hex values \"37\", \"65\", and \"68\", which correspond to the letters \"D\", \"E\", and \"H\" in ASCII.

For example, \"D\" has an ASCII value of 68, but the answer provided is 37, which is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal value \"27\" (which is \"D\" in hexadecimal). Similarly, \"A\" has an ASCII value of 65, but the answer provided is 32, which is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal value \"20\" (which is \"A\" in hexadecimal).\n\nThe \"decrypted\" answers in the cases provided are actually hexadecimal strings, and each pair of hexadecimal values represents a single character in the decrypted answer. For example, \"27bf7e\" decrypts to \"TPT\" because \"27\" is \"D\" (which is \"T\" in ASCII), \"bf\" is \"K\" (which is \"P\" in ASCII), and \"7e\" is \"~\" (which is \"T\" in ASCII). Similarly, \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\" decrypts to \"HELLO WORLD\" because \"27\" is \"D\" (which is \"H\" in ASCII), \"b8\" is \"°\" (not a printable ASCII character, but it could match with the letter \"H\" if we use an extended ASCII character set), \"73\" is \"s\" (which is \"L\" in ASCII), \"03\" is \"*\" (which is \"O\" in ASCII), \"8e\" is \"-\" (which is \"L\" in ASCII), \"20\" is \" \" (which is a space), \"27\" is \"D\" (which is \"H\" in ASCII), \"f8\" is \"ø\" (which is \"E\" in ASCII), \"5f\" is \"_\" (which is a blank space), \"ba\" is \"ž\" (which is \"W\" in ASCII), and \"0b\" is \" Suzanne\" (this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, but it's possible that the ciphertext was truncated or corrupted) but if we ignore this extra part, the decrypted answer becomes \"HELLO\". This pattern of encoding characters as pairs of hexadecimal values is called \"hexadecimal encoded strings\" or \"hex strings\" for short.",
