For the first question:\n\t* \"p1 if and only if p2 is false\" translates to p1 <=-> ~p2 (where <=-> denotes logical equivalence). However, since we are requested to express the proposition as a symbolic formula in the form [[ ]], we can write it as [[p1=~p2]].\n2. For the second question:\n\t* The proposition is \"p1 if and only if p2 is false\". This statement doesn't implicitly indicate the level or type of p1, so we answer as [[A];[C]].\n3. For the third question:\n\t* Given the formula p1 =::> ~p2, we'll find the truth values (T) and falsity values (F) under different conditions:\n\t\t+ T: If p1 is true and p2 is false (p1=✓ and p2=×), then the implication p1 => ~p2 is true (✓). If we invert the implication, we get ~(p1 => ~p2) =: p1 & ~p2, which is also true (✓).\n\n\t\t+ F: If p1 is true and p2 is true (p1=✓ and p2=✓), then the implication p1 => ~p2 is false (×). If we invert the implication, we get ~(p1 => ~p2) =: p1 & ~p2, which is also false (×).\n\n\t* E.g.:\n\t\t+ When p1=true and p2=false, we have T: ✓,F: ✓\n\t\t+ When p1=false and p2=false, we have T: x,F: x\n\t\t+ When p1=true and p2=true, we have T: x,F: x\n\t\t+ When p1=false and p2=true, we have T: ✓,F: ✓\n\t* Answer: [[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]\n4. For the last question:\n\t* We'll analyze each sub-question separately:\n\n\t\t(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2:\n\t\t* If p1 => p2 is false (p1=true and p2=false), then ~(p1=::>p2) = true (✓), and thus the formula (1) gets the value ✓ (since p2=true).\n\t\t* If p1 => p2 is true (p1=false or p2=true), then ~(p1=::>p2) = false (×), making the formula (1) get the value ✗.\n\t\t* Answer: A (at least under the given conditions)\n\n\t\t(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n\t\t* If p1=p3=true and p2=false (true and no specific value for p2), then the left side of the formula (p1&p3) equals true (✓), and the right side (~p1&~p2) evaluates to false (×) since p1 is true (at least in this specific case).\n\t\t* If p1=p3=false, then the values for both sides are the same (false).\n\t\t* So, when evaluated with p1=true, p3=true, and p2 unspecified, the formula (2) is false (✗ under those conditions).\n\t\t* Answer: B (at least under the given conditions)\n5.

However, since it is not connected to any other gates, it is not utilized in determining the output O. Therefore, we would disregard the third input when answering questions involving only two inputs.\n\nGiven the final answer above for the circuit diagram representing (p∧q), and assuming that I1 is '+', I2 is '-', we would find the output as follows:\n\n[[+, -, -]; [-,-,+,+]; [-,-,-,+]; [-,-,+,-]; [-,-,+,+];[-,,-,+,-];[-,+,-,+];[-,+,-,-];[]]\nIn this case, the output O is represented by the first row: [+, -], indicating that the output is '+'.\n\nNow, we can create a circuit diagram for an AND gate as follows:\n\n[[I1, I2, O]; [+, +, +]; [-, +, -]; [-, -, -]]\nThis reflects the common definition of an AND gate as producing a 1 ('+') only when both inputs are 1 ('+'), and otherwise producing 0 ('-').",

To find the inputs that make the output O (which is \"-\") we can deduce the following from the circuit diagram in the previous questions:\n\n1. According to the circuit diagram [[I1,I2,I3,O];[+,+,+,-];[+,+,-,+];[+,-,+,-];[+,-,-,+];[-,+,+,-];[-,+,-,+];[-,-,+,-];[-,-,-,-]], when the output O is \"-\", at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied: p∧q∧¬r = false, ¬p∧q = false, p∨r = false.\n\n2. As the output O is \"-\", the expression (p∧q∧¬r) must be false since it is an AND operation:\n   - p = false OR q = false OR ¬r = true\n   - If p = false and q = false, then ¬r must be true\n   - If p = false and ¬r = false, then q must be true\n   - If ¬r = false and q = false, then p must be true\n\n3. Since the expression (p∧q∧¬r) is false, it means that we have found one of the three possible combinations that yield a false AND operation:\n   - p = false, q = false, ¬r = true\n   - p = false, q = true, ¬r = false\n   - p = true, q = false, ¬r = false\n\n4. Now, let's consider the second term of the OR operation, ¬p∧q:\n   - For our found combinations, the second term becomes:\n     - For p = false, q = false, ¬r = true: ¬p∧q = true∧false = false\n     - For p = false, q = true, ¬r = false: ¬p∧q = true∧true = true\n     - For p = true, q = false, ¬r = false: ¬p∧q = false∧false = false\n\n5. We've found that when p = false, q = true, and ¬r = false, both the first and second terms of the OR operation result in false, thus the third term of the OR operation must be evaluated, p∨r = false OR p = false and r must also be false:\n   - If p = false, r must also be false\n\n6.

Let's verify the second combination:\n   - For p = false, q = true, ¬r = false, r = false, the first output of our circuit is indeed \"-\":\n     - True AND True AND False = false\n     - True AND True AND Not(False) = True\n     - True AND Not(False) AND True = True\n     - (True OR False) AND True = True\n     - True OR False (since the first output is true, we evaluate the second term as False) = True\n     - Since the second term evaluates as false, we evaluate the third term, p∨r (False OR False) = False\n     - Output O is indeed \"-\"\n\n8. For the sake of completeness, let's verify the first combination as well:\n   - For p = false, q = true, ¬r = true, r = true (since ¬r is true, r must be false):\n     - True AND True AND Not(True) = false\n     - True AND True AND Not(True) = True\n     - True AND Not(True) AND True = False\n     - (True OR False) AND True = True\n     - True OR False (since the first output is true, we evaluate the second term as True) = True\n     - Since the second term evaluates as true, the third term is not evaluated\n     - Output O is indeed \"-\"\n\n9. The combination of inputs that satisfy the condition #p #q -r# r# are:\n   - [[[-,+,+,+],[-,+,+,-]];[-,+,+,-]]\n   - [[[-,+,+,+],[-,+,+,-]]], but it is not necessary to consider such combinations since '-r' implies 'r' is false (not true) in this logic expression\n\nTherefore, the multiple inputs that satisfy the condition with output O as \"-\" are:\n- [[[-,+,+,+],[-,+,+,-]]]",

In a syllogism, there are four figures (I-IV) and 15 moods (A-Q). The figures are determined by the arrangement of the middle term (M) between the major premise (A) and the minor premise (B), as well as its position in the conclusion (C). The mood tells us the relationship between the quality of the major and minor premise and the conclusion. The questions provide examples of the AAI (First Figure, Third Mood) and the A (First Figure, First Mood) mood, and the answer for the third question is MENS (First Figure, Eleventh Mood). The answer for the fourth question can be found by analyzing the given statements and determining the figure and mood that correspond to them. In this case, ∀P⇒M and ∃S⇒¬M imply a minor term (S) that is opposite to the major (P). Therefore, we have a minor premise (P) that implies a universal negative conclusion (¬P), and a major premise (∃M⇒¬S) that implies a particular negative conclusion (¬S).

Since the first and fourth terms are the same, and the second and third terms are related in the form \"All M are S\" as given in the question, this corresponds to the mood AAI (All A are M, Some M are S, Therefore, Some A are S).\n\nIn the question, there are no letters given for the first and fourth terms, so we fill in the blank with A because in the mood AAI, the first and fourth terms must be the same and given the format of Mood, Figure pairs, a blank A would be a good assumption as it represents the first and fourth terms.\n\nFor the second question, the figure and mood remain the same, but there are two blanks for the terms. In the Mood, Figure pairs, the first term of the figure (M) corresponds to the first blank in the argument, and the second term (S) corresponds to the second blank. So, we fill in the first blank with A (because in the Mood, Figure pairs, A is often used as a placeholder for the A term in the figure) and the second blank with P (because in the argument, S is related to P, and S itself is related to M, and in the Mood, Figure pairs, we know that the second term of the figure is related to the third term of the argument).\n\nFor the third question, the figure is determined in the same way as the second question, but there are four blanks for the terms. We fill in the first two blanks with A and E to correspond to the figure I (abaa or ebae) and the fourth and fifth blanks with M and U because the argument's structure resembles that of a syllogism (two premises followed by a conclusion), and in the conclusion, S is related to O (an O term in the figure).

There is no such thing as both a policy being definitely implemented and not being implemented at the same time, so we can say these sentences are contradictory or incompatible or represented by the symbol B (x relationship is for propositional logic, @ and % aren't used until the next question, and * represents tautology, which doesn't fit the current situation).\n\n3. Modal logic inference formulas: In modal logic, if A is necessarily true (represented by $◇A$), then it's not the case that A is not necessarily true ($◇◄A$). In this case, if early preparation leads to success, it cannot possibly NOT lead to success. The number of inference formulas is based on the number of instances in an if-then statement, and we have one instance here (1).\n\n4. Relationship between sentences (part 2):\n\n  - Sentence (1): The Chinese women's volleyball team being definitely victorious implies it may not not win, but the opposite doesn't hold. That means these sentences have an incompatible (B) relationship.\n  - Sentence (2): A project being definitely completed ahead of schedule and not being definitely completed ahead of schedule are contradictory or incompatible sentences (C).",

In the given examples of natural languages (Chinese, English, Russian, etc.), these are given as instances or examples of the concept \"natural language,\" without defining all the necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nFor Lexical Definitions, they are standard or dictionary definitions of words or phrases, often rooted in their historical or etymological origins. The Matthew Effect is originally derived from a Bible verse, and its initial use was rooted in its biblical context, so it fits the Lexical Definition.\n\nTherefore, the given definitions of \"Trademark registration,\" \"natural language,\" and \"Matthew Effect\" belong to the Intensional Definition, Extensional Definition, and Lexical Definition, respectively.",
