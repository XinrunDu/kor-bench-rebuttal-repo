The result was then expressed in the format: [[((a,b),(c,d))]], where a, b, c, and d are the elements in the resulting matrix.\n\nFor the last question, A multiplied by B gives:\n\nA[0][0]*B[0][0] + A[0][1]*B[1][0] = 1*0 + 2*1 = 2\nA[0][0]*B[0][1] + A[0][1]*B[1][1] = 1*1 + 2*3 = 7\nA[1][0]*B[0][0] + A[1][1]*B[1][0] = 3*0 + 4*1 = 4\nA[1][0]*B[0][1] + A[1][1]*B[1][1] = 3*1 + 4*3 = 19\n\nSo the result matrix is: [[((2,7),(4,19))]].
