A **Truth Formula** is one that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components (a tautology), while a **Falsehood Formula** is always false (a contradiction). Any formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is categorized as **Neither**.\n\nLet's analyze each formula:\n\n(1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n- The expression p1=::>p2 can be represented as ¬p1 ∨ p2.\n- Hence, ~(p1=::>p2) is equivalent to ~(¬p1 ∨ p2), which simplifies to p1 & ¬p2.\n- Therefore, the entire formula simplifies to (p1 & ¬p2) & p2.\n- This can be further simplified to p1 & (¬p2 & p2), which is a contradiction because ¬p2 & p2 is always false.\n- Thus, the formula is a **Falsehood Formula**.\n\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n- Simplify the expression to its logical equivalent:\n  (p1 & p3) ↔ (¬p1 & ¬p2)\n- To determine if this is a tautology or a contradiction, we can check a few truth values:\n  - If p1 is true and p3 is true, the left side (p1 & p3) is true. The right side (¬p1 & ¬p2) is false because p1 is true.\n  - If p1 is false and p2 is true, the left side (p1 & p3) is false irrespective of p3. The right side (¬p1 & ¬p2) is false because ¬p2 is false.\n  - If p1 is false and p3 is false, the left side (p1 & p3) is false. The right side (¬p1 & ¬p2) depends on p2; it can be true or false.\n  - In various cases, the truth values do not consistently match; hence it is **Neither** a tautology nor a contradiction.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[C]]",

This is similar to the definition of the \"Matthew Effect,\" which was categorized as a ℓ Definition.

They do not list specific examples but rather describe the characteristics that anything must have to fall under that concept.\n\n- **Extensional Definitions**: These definitions list specific examples that fall under the concept.\n\n- **Lexical Definitions**: These definitions explain the meaning of a term by providing a description or explanation of the word itself, often including its origin or usage.\n\nGiven the provided questions and answers, here's the reasoning for the last question:\n\nThe definition of \"Internet\" explains the origin of the term (transliteration and partial translation) and describes what it is (an international computer communication network). This fits the pattern of a Lexical Definition, specifically the type that explains the meaning of a term by providing a description and possibly the origin of the word.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[C]]",
