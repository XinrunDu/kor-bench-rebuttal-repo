The logical structure here involves some form of implication or exclusion.\n\n2. **Question:**\n   - According to the rules, are !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r equivalent? A. Yes B. No\n   - **Answer:** [[A]]\n\n   This implies the logical equivalence between the expressions `!(p & q) | r` and `!p | !q | r` as per certain rules of logical transformation. This seems related to De Morgan's laws or other equivalence rules.\n\n3. **Question:**\n   - Using the 16 Basic Equivalences, what is the simplest result obtained through equivalence derivation? p ⇑ q\n   - **Answer:** [[!p|!q]]\n\n   This indicates that the symbol `⇑` represents some form of logical operation resulting in `!p | !q`.\n\n4. **Question:**\n   - According to the 16 Basic Equivalences, is the equivalence below valid?

No\n   - (1) p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)\n   - (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))\n   - **Answer:** [[format]]\n\nTo solve the last sub-question, let's break down each part using the logical equivalences:\n\n- For (1): `p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)`\n  - This shows `p` can be expressed as the disjunction of `(p & q)` and `(p & !q)`. Given `p & (q | !q)` always holds true, this simplification is valid.\n\n- For (2): `(p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))`\n  - The left-hand side represents exclusive OR (XOR), and the right-hand side represents `(p or q) and not (p or q)` which is always false (a contradiction). Therefore, this does not represent a valid equivalence.\n\nThus, based on the rules derived:\n\n- Question 1 answer is A (Yes).\n- Question 2 answer is B (No).\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[B]]",

For the first equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)):\n   - The expression (p>q)&(p>r) can be rewritten using the implication equivalence (a>b)::=::(!a|b) as (!p|q)&(!p|r).\n   - Applying the distributive law, this simplifies to !p|(q&r), which is equivalent to p>(q|r) when reverted back to implication form.\n   - Therefore, the first equivalence is valid.\n\n2. For the second equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q):\n   - The expression !(p=q) can be rewritten using the equivalence !(a=b)::=::(a&!b)|(!a&b).\n   - This expands to (p&!q)|(!p&q), which can be seen as the exclusive or (XOR) operation.\n   - The expression (p|q)&!(p&q) represents the same XOR operation, where (p|q) includes all cases where at least one is true, and !(p&q) excludes the case where both are true.\n   - Therefore, the second equivalence is also valid.\n\nBoth equivalences are valid, so the answer is [[A];[A]].",

If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\nTo determine if the expression conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) or principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), we need to analyze its structure.\n\nThe expression (p∨r)∧(¬q∨r)∧(¬p∨q∨¬r) is a conjunction of disjunctions, which suggests it might be in PCNF.

(¬q∨r) - This does not include p or ¬p.\n3. (¬p∨q∨¬r) - This includes all variables, suggesting it could be part of PDNF or PCNF, but it's not sufficient alone.\n\nSince not all disjunctions include all variables or their negations, the expression does not conform to the principal conjunctive normal form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[B]]",

In the first cycle, it resolves all possible pairs of clauses from the initial set.\n\nGiven the formula (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r), we first convert it into a set of clauses:\n\nS0 = { {p, q}, {p, ¬q}, {¬p, r} }\n\nNow, let's find all possible resolvents (S2) at the end of the first cycle:\n\n1. Resolving {p, q} and {p, ¬q}:\n   Since there are no opposite literals, these two clauses cannot be resolved.\n\n2. Resolving {p, q} and {¬p, r}:\n   The resolvent is {q, r}.\n\n3. Resolving {p, ¬q} and {¬p, r}:\n   The resolvent is {¬q, r}.\n\nSo, S2 at the end of the first cycle is: {{q, r}, {¬q, r}}.\n\n### Answer:\n[{{q, r}, {¬q, r}}]",

The answer is [[A]], meaning the clauses can be resolved.\n\n2. **Question 2:** Involves determining the \"dispersion\" of C1 and C2 and lists multiple resolved clauses.\n\n3. **Question 3:** Asks for the output of the resolution algorithm for a given expression and the number of iterations it takes. The output is [[Implausible];[2]].\n\n4. **Question 4:** Similar to question 3, asks for the output of the resolution algorithm for a different expression and the number of iterations.\n\nGiven these patterns, we can deduce that the resolution algorithm works by repeatedly applying the resolution rule between clauses until no more new clauses can be generated or a contradiction is found. The number of iterations corresponds to the steps required to reach a conclusion.\n\n### Applying the rules to the new question:\nFor the expression \\((p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(¬p∨r)\\):\n\n1. **Convert to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):**\n   - \\((p∨q)\\)\n   - \\((p∨¬q)\\)\n   - \\((¬p∨r)\\)\n\n2. **Apply the resolution rule:**\n   - Resolve \\((p∨q)\\) with \\((p∨¬q)\\):\n     - \\(q \\vee ¬q\\) (tautology, discard)\n   - Resolve \\((p∨q)\\) with \\((¬p∨r)\\):\n     - \\(q \\vee r\\)\n   - Resolve \\((p∨¬q)\\) with \\((¬p∨r)\\):\n     - \\(¬q \\vee r\\)\n\n3. **Continue resolving new clauses:**\n   - Resolve \\(q \\vee r\\) with \\(¬q \\vee r\\):\n     - \\(r \\vee r\\) (simplifies to \\(r\\))\n\nAfter applying these steps, we do not find a contradiction (an empty clause), so the output of the resolution algorithm is \"Implausible.\" The number of cycles corresponds to the steps taken to reach this conclusion.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Implausible];[3]]",

Universal quantifiers are denoted by \\( A \\) (for all) and existential quantifiers by \\( E \\) (there exists). For example, \"Some students are smarter than all teachers\" translates to \\( Ex(F(x) \\& Ay(G(y) \\Rightarrow H(x, y))) \\).\n\n4. Statements involving properties of all elements in a specific set use the universal quantifier \\( A \\) with implication. For example, \"All odd numbers in D are greater than 0\" translates to \\( Ax(G(x) \\Rightarrow H(x)) \\).\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nIn first-order logic, symbolize the following propositions using 0-ary predicates:\n(1) Only 2 is a prime number, 4 is a composite number.\n(2) If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\n\nFor (1), define a unary predicate F(x): x is a prime number.\nThe proposition can be symbolized as?\n\nFor (2), define a binary predicate G(x, y): x > y.\nThe proposition can be symbolized as?\n\n### Answer:\nUsing the observed rules:\n\n1. The statement \"Only 2 is a prime number, 4 is a composite number\" implies that x being a prime number (F(x)) is specific to x being 2. This can be translated as \\( F(2) \\Rightarrow \\text{4 is a composite number} \\), but since we do not have a direct predicate for \"4 is a composite number\" in our rules, we focus on the specific statement \\( F(2) \\):\n\\[ [F(2)] \\]\n\n2. The conditional statement \"If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6\" directly translates to an implication using the binary predicate G(x, y):\n\\[ [G(5, 4) \\Rightarrow G(4, 6)] \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[ [[F(2)];[G(5,4)⇒G(4,6)]] \\]",

If the speaker uses a weaker form (e.g., \"believe\") instead of a stronger form (e.g., \"know\"), it suggests uncertainty or lack of commitment to the truth of the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle**: This principle often involves the use of common assumptions or stereotypes. For example, if someone says \"open the gift box,\" it is commonly assumed that the gift is inside the box.\n\n3. **C! Principle**: This principle relates to markedness, where using a more complex or lengthy expression typically indicates additional or unexpected information.\n\nLet's apply these principles to the questions:\n\n### Question 1:\nB’s response “She will do her best” is vague and suggests uncertainty about completing the project on time. This conforms to the C* Principle because it indicates a lack of full commitment to the truth of the statement that she will complete the project on time.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question 2:\n\"Please open the gift box\" implies that the gift is inside the box.

The first question uses specific cases (studies and surveys) to argue for a general conclusion (exercise has a positive impact on mental health), which corresponds to the E+ Method (argument by example).\n2. The second question uses universal propositions and syllogistic reasoning to reach a conclusion, which matches the Syl+ Method (syllogistic reasoning).\n3. The third question refutes a contrary proposition with evidence, aligning with the Contra- Method (refutation).\n\nThe last question states a claim (\"Light has mass\") and supports it with a reason (\"because light exerts pressure on the matter it strikes, and if light were massless, it would not generate such pressure\"). This involves the use of reasoning about the nature or properties of light to draw a conclusion, which is characteristic of the Metaph+ Method (metaphysical reasoning).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[C]].",
