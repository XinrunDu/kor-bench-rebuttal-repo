However, an issue arises with \"C\" to \"S\", which does not follow the single shift pattern directly.\n\nGiven the discrepancies, we need a more generalized approach or a potential alternative pattern for encryption which would explain \"C\" to \"S\".

For the first provided example, the plaintext \"G\" with the key \"WFLXNX\" results in the ciphertext \"V.\" Ignoring the differing key length variation momentarily, let's focus on the shift.\n   - If \"G\" (7th letter) is shifted to \"V\" (22nd letter), the shift appears to be +15 (taking into account the wrap around of the alphabet).\n\nNow for the decryption process we have observed:\n- For \"N\" to \"A,\" it seems like the same key format applies but in reverse. \"N\" (14th letter) and \"A\" as 1st letter suggest a backward shift based on the reversed formula of the key.\n\n### Suggested Calculation Method:\nGiven the variability in the key and the observed newline back to standard example:\n- Each letter shift suggests a modular arithmetic operation on the alphabet: Add the key-indexed shift to the alphabet position modulo 26 (for the encryption) and subtract for the decryption.\n\nFor \"SN\" with the key \"KVYSUU,\" to decrypt:\n- Key length \"KVYSUU\" doesn't match \"SN\" but suggests a repeating pattern till \"SN\" is fully decoded.\n\nLet's decrypt \"SN\":\n- \"S\" (19th letter, 18 with 0-based index)\n- \"K\" correlates to the alphabet index (11th, 10 with 0-based index). With the pattern of - (subtracting) the 0-based key alphabet from S,\n  - shift = (18 - 10) mod 26 => 8\n  - 8th letter = H\n- \"N\" (14th letter, 13 with 0-based index)\n- \"V\" corresponds to 21st letter (20 with 0-based); same subtractive decryption suggests:\n  - shift = (13 - 20) mod 26 => -7 mod 26 => 19 (wrap around handling)\n  - 19th letter within 0-based considering full wrap around into positive shift = T\n\n### Final answer:\n[[HT]]",

This hints that we are likely dealing with a conversion where two digits correspond to a letter, and we should pay attention to a pattern or particular sequence.\n\nGiven the structure of “88” and “98536”, the digits seem to consistently map into a set of letters, each formed from 2-digit pairs (with a potential exception in handling single digits for the last example):\n\n- \"98\" = \"E\", \"53\" = \"B\", \"06\" = \"W\"\n\nFor \"984\":\n- \"98\" = \"E\" (from previous pattern),\n- \"04\" = \"D\" (assuming a similar pattern as \"06\" for \"W\" inferring a mapping).\n\nTherefore, the complete decryption is:\n\n[[ED]]",

From \"GIMH\" to \"UD\":\n   - Moving to \"G\" (7th letter) → \"U\" (21st letter) and \"I\" (9th letter) → \"D\" (4th letter) seems to involve a different pattern. \"M\" (13th letter) and \"H\" (8th letter) to a pair of letters \"UD\" suggests a reordering or a mapping that isn't just a simple alphabetic shift.\n   \n3. From \"GIGH\" to \"UX\":\n   - Following a similar analysis, \"GIGH\" (7 9 7 8 letters) to \"UX\" (which resembles previous decryption).\n\nGiven this, the encryption or decryption possibly involves:\n- A mapping rule that is not immediately obvious with a simple shift.\n- It might be a rule involving pairs of letters, reordering or substitution based on a more complex scheme.\n\nTo decrypt \"WB\" under the same possibly complex mapping, we'll hypothesize about a method that can fit all the examples. Given the provided examples, \"WB\" (23rd and 2nd) should be decrypted following a similar less intuitive mapping:\n\nIf we analyze the earlier mappings and patterns like a pair-wise substitution, predicting directly could be tricky, but assuming a reverse-engineering similar complexity:\n- \"W\" might map to a very specific pair, and \"B\" might do the same, likely following an advanced substitution or a peculiar predefined function.\n\nConsidering the peculiar examples, \"WB\" might decrypt to some specific letters that according to the pattern identified could be [[BD]] (assuming a complex predefined rule).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[BD]]",

Decryption of \"XGVD\" resulted in \"EC\".

However, from the data given, a more concise and pattern-based interpretation is possible:\n\nA simple back deduction suggests that transforming \"A\" (1st in alphabet) to a ciphertext applies a rule that isn't immediately obvious from just the samples but we can use a reasonable guess that since \"Plaintext\" to \"Ciphertext\" transformation isn't revealed directly, we may use the clearer decryption to infer.\n\nUsing patterns observed from decryptions:\n- A straightforward cipher (like reverse complement in DNA) or shifted encoding could imply a strong positional reversal.\n\nGiven \"A\" is in the 1st position, reversing such operation might point to positioning at the end of the alphabet, but these are just assumptions based on patterns learned.\n\nSince direct guidelines weren't provided and typical schemas were extrapolated, the safest conjecture involves direct positional cipher or a similar reverse logic: \nThe simplest inferred response based on observed patterns could directly point us to consider an inverted or complement transformation that might map to Z.

The plaintext \"D\" is encrypted to \"37\". \"D\" is the 4th letter of the alphabet. However, the result \"37\" seems to be using a different scheme, likely a hexadecimal representation with a base shift. Considering common ASCII values, 'D' ASCII value is 68, which in hexadecimal is 44. If we add 3 (which aligns with some simple encryption shifts), we get \"47\" as hexadecimal (G in ASCII), but the given is \"37\", indicating a simpler direct relationship or different context.\n\n2. The ciphertext \"32\" decrypts to \"A\". The decimal value 32 translates to a space in ASCII. However, since \"A\" is the result, and recognizing \"A\" as the 1st letter of the alphabet, it might suggest subtracting 31 (to get from decimal 32 to 1). This hint at a possible modulo, shift, or specific cipher pattern.\n\n3. Ciphertext \"27bf7e\" decrypts to \"TPT\". Upon inspection, these hexadecimal values 27, bf, 7e don't directly translate to ASCII or extended ASCII that resembles \"TPT\". It might suggest the use of a different character encoding or a complex transformation, which would be clearer with more examples or explicit rules.\n\nGiven these examples and supposed patterns, in the case of \"3a\", it's hexadecimal for 58 in decimal.
