In addressing public unrest, [[C]] (Officer Jenny) was chosen over community leaders or local police, which could suggest a preference for specific named individuals over broader roles or groups, even in the context that the individual is from a fictional universe.\n\n3.

Given the context, Schopenhauer and Rousseau are noted philosophers where Schopenhauer is pessimistic and Rousseau can be more optimistic. Among the options, we aim to identify a character that can be associated with optimism or the choice that logically fits with an optimistic viewpoint.\n- Given the logic of previous questions and the aim to select based on accurate association (rather than extreme or unrelated concepts), option D (\"Rousseau\") fits the most as an optimist.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[D]]",
