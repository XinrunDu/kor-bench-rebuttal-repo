The \"all-even form\" is less standard but can be interpreted here as a form where each conjunctive (or disjunctive) term contains an even number of variables. Given that the formula A contains 4 propositional variables (let's denote them as p, q, r, s), we are looking for a basic form where each term contains an even number of variables.\n\nSince we need each term in a basic form to include all 4 variables, the only way to also satisfy the \"all-even form\" condition is to combine the variables such that they always pair up in negative-positive pairs or all in positive/negative form, maintaining an even number (which in this scenario means 4, the only even number possible given the requirement of including all variables).\n\nFor a basic conjunctive/disjunctive form, the total number of combinations considering the possibility of each variable appearing in its positive or negative form is \\(2^n\\), where n is the number of variables. Since we are given 4 variables, the total number of possible combinations is \\(2^4 = 16\\). However, for a basic form, all variables must be included in each term, making the 16 the number of terms in the pure basic form.\n\nSince the question narrows down to terms being both basic and all-even, and given that \"all-even\" in this context must mean each term must include 4 variables (which is true for all terms in a basic form with 4 variables), all 16 of the originally derived combinations qualify.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[16]].",

Symbol [[E]] is used for an Intensional Definition.\n  \n- **Extensional Definitions** (such as the definition of natural languages) involve a partial listing of the actual things or examples that the term applies to. Symbol [[B]] is used for an Extensional Definition.\n\n- **Lexical Definitions** (such as the Matthew Effect and Taiyi examples) describe the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of other simpler words or phrases known to the reader. The Lexical definition of Taiyi falls more closely under the category represented by the symbol [[A]], as it provides a straightforward explanation of the term based on its components and references to a familiar context (philosophical, historical terms). \n\nThus, the correct answer for the description of \"Taiyi\" is [[A]], aligned with its explanation as a Lexical definition.",
