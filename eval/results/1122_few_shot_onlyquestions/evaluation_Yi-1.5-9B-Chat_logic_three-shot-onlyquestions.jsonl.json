Since 'a' is not explicitly defined, we can infer that 'a' is the smallest element in the set of natural numbers, which is 0.\n\n3. **Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.**\n   - These are the binary operations defined on the set of natural numbers. 'fJ' is addition, and 'gJ' is multiplication.\n\n4. **Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.**\n   - This is the relation defined on the set of natural numbers.

In the first instance, we were tasked with symbolizing the proposition \"Using a phone in public places is not allowed\". We were told to let the variable 'p' represent the proposition 'Using a phone in public places'. The answer format was asked to be presented in '[]' and we found out that it's represented as '[[‽p]]', where '‽' symbolizes 'not allowed'. \n\n2. In the second part, the relationship between the two sentences \"It is allowed to take breaks during working hours.\" and \"Taking breaks during working hours is not allowed\" was sought. The correct relationship was found to be 'x' which denotes negation, so the answer format was '[[B]]'. \n\n3. For the third question, we were required to identify the canonical reasoning formulas that correspond to the inferences: \"There is an obligation to study\" from \"It is not allowed to not study\" and vice versa. The correct formula was identified as \"1\", indicating a contraposition, and hence the answer was presented as '[[1]]'.\n\n4. Finally, we had to find out what kind of relationship Modal Reasoning Formula 7 corresponds to. The correct relationship was identified as 'x', representing negation, so the answer format was '[[B]]'. \n\nThis pattern of rules implies that when presented with modal propositions (those asserting possibility, necessity, permission, obligation etc.), we are looking for negations ('x') or contrapositions (\"1\").",

The statement \"Lao Chen has always worked diligently in the past\" implies a consistent pattern of behavior in the past. Formula 5, when applied to this statement, would likely lead to an inference that negates any contrary claim about Lao Chen's past work ethic. Thus, option A correctly represents the inference that \"It is not the case that Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past,\" which reaffirms the consistent, diligent work ethic described in the original statement.

Given that the answer to the question about sequential commands is `[[[c1 ; c2 ]φ]]`, we use this format for `c1` followed by `c2`, which is `[[⟨c1 ; c2⟩φ]]`.\n\n2. **Choice Rule (c1 + c2)**: The plus sign (+) is used to denote that either `c1` or `c2` can occur.

Therefore, we apply the choice rule to the sequence of commands, resulting in `[[⟨(c1 ; c2) + c2⟩φ]]`, indicating that after the sequence of `c1` followed by `c2`, the condition `φ` remains true even if `c2` is executed independently afterward.",

In the examples given, when objects are in motion (rubbing hands, striking stones, hammering an iron block), heat is generated.

The children in the first group show higher levels of emotional intelligence, and the children in the second group have significantly lower emotional intelligence levels.\n\nBased on the rule derived from the ⸮ Method, the causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with the ⸮ method (option A), as the observations are consistent with cause-and-effect relationships without direct experimentation or random assignment.

The phrase \"submit the report\" in the first question indicates a directive, leading to the answer B.\n2. The phrase \"I → ✊\" in the second question indicates a promise or commitment, which falls under Commissives and hence the answer C.\n3. \"I'm sorry\" in the third question indicates an expression of feelings, making it an Expressive, and the answer D.\n4.
