When two numbers are combined using '⊕', the result is a complex number whose real part is the sum of the two numbers and whose imaginary part is the difference of the two numbers multiplied by 'i'. This can be represented as:\n   a ⊕ b = (a + b) + (b - a)i\n2. The '⊕' operation has a higher precedence than addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n3. To solve for an unknown variable using '⊕', the isolated term should also involve the '⊕' operation to ensure consistency in the rules.\n\nApplying these rules to your final question, I will solve it step by step:\n\n1. First, I calculate the value of (2⊕1):\n   2 ⊕ 1 = (2 + 1) + (1 - 2)i = 3 - i\n2. Next, I multiply this result by 3:\n   3 * (3 - i) = 9 - 3i\n3.

Assuming “◎” represents the standard complex multiplication, I will interpret and apply the rules as follows:\n\n1. According to the first question, (4 ◎ 1) + (2 ◎ 3) = 10 + 20i. This implies that the “◎” represents complex multiplication, and the 2◎3 means the multiplication of 3 by 2i, since only this operation results in a term with a nonzero imaginary coefficient.

In the second question, (2 ◎ 1) − (2 ◎ 2) = 3 − 4i. \n\nSo 2 ◎ 2 = 3 − 4i implies that 2 ◎ 1 = −4i.

Therefore, f □ g = [[\\frac{1}{x}+3x^2]].\n\nFor the second question, we are evaluating the composite function at a specific point:\nf(g(0)) = f(sin(0)) = e^(sin(0)) = e^0 = 2\nSo, the value of the composite function f □ g at x = 0 is [[2]].\n\nFor the third question, we are evaluating f(g(π/4)):\nf(g(π/4)) = sin(π/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\ng(π/4) = π/4\nNow, using the composite function rule, the value of f □ g at x = π/4 is f'(g(x)) * g'(x):\nf'(g(π/4)) = cos(g(π/4)) = cos(π/4) = \\sqrt{2}/2\ng'(π/4) = 1\nSo, f'(g(x)) * g'(x) = (\\sqrt{2}/2) * 1 = \\sqrt{2}/2\nTherefore, the value of f □ g at x = π/4 is [[\\sqrt{2}/2+1]].\n\nFor the fourth question, we again find f(g(x)) by substituting g(x) into f(x):\nf(g(x)) = sin(ln(x))\nSince the composition goes in the direction of g -> f, the derivative of the composite function will be f'(g(x)) * g'(x). The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = 1/x. To find f'(g(x)), we need to differentiate f(x) = sin(x), which gives us f'(x) = cos(x). So, f'(g(x)) = cos(ln(x)).\n\nTherefore, f □ g = [[\\cos(\\ln x)\\times\\frac{1}{x}]]",

The goal is to find the function that results from applying the input function $g(x)$ to $f(x)$.\n\nIn the first example, $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x^3$. To find $f ▽ g$, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6 \\]\n\nand the derivative function of $f ▽ g$ is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx} x^6 = 6x^5 \\]\n\nThen, to get the final answer, we add the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n\\[ 6x^5 + \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = 6x^5 + 3x^2 = x^2 (6x^3 + 3) \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = x^2 (6x^3 + 3)$. This does not match the provided answer, which suggests there might be an error or a missing step in the provided solution.\n\nFor the second question, $f(x) = e^x$ and $g(x) = \\ln(x)$, and you are asked to find $f ▽ g$. Again, we substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = e^{\\ln(x)} \\]\n\nUsing the identity $e^{\\ln(x)} = x$, we get:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = x \\]\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(g(x))$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx} x = 1 \\]\n\nNow, we add the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = 1 - \\frac{1}{x}$, which can also be written as $1 + \\frac{-1}{x}$ or $\\frac{x - 1}{x}$. This simplified form is different from the provided answer.\n\nIn the third example, you are asked to find the value of $f ▽ g$ when $x = 0$, where $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g(x) = x^4$. Substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = \\sin(x^4) \\]\n\nWhen $x = 0$, $g(0) = 0^4 = 0$, so:\n\n\\[ f(g(0)) = \\sin(0) = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $f ▽ g$ when $x = 0$ is indeed [[0]].\n\nFor the last question, you have $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g(x) = \\ln(x)$, and you are asked to find $f ▽ g$. Following the same steps as before, we substitute:\n\n\\[ f(g(x)) = \\sin(\\ln(x)) \\]\n\nTaking the derivative of $f(g(x))$ with respect to $x$, using the chain rule and the derivatives of sine and natural logarithm:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = \\cos(\\ln(x)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} \\]\n\nNow, adding the derivative of $g(x)$:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x)) + 1}{x} \\]\n\nSo, $f ▽ g = \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x)) + 1}{x}$.

For the first question, $f(x, y) = 1$ is a constant function, and the area of the rectangular region $D$ is simply its length times width, resulting in $2 * 3 = 6$ square units. Since the function value is constant and equals 1, the integral is simply the area, which is 6, and then divide by 3 to get the final answer of 2.\n\n2. In the second question, $f(x, y) = xy$ is integrated over the same rectangular region $D$. The integral of $xy$ over this region can be calculated by integrating with respect to $x$ first, treating $y$ as a constant, and then integrating the resulting function of $y$ over the specified range. This results in $\\int_{1}^{2}\\int_{1}^{3} xy \\, dx \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{1}{2}xy^2 \\Big|_1^2 \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} (2y^2 - \\frac{1}{2}y^2) \\, dy = \\int_{1}^{3} \\frac{3}{2}y^2 \\, dy = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}y^3 |_1^3 = 6$.\n\n3. The third question involves integrating $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ over the same domain $D$.

The rule is to compute the definite integral of the given function across the given domain.\n\nIn the third question, the function provided is a polynomial function, so the double integration can be solved by integrating term by term.\n\nIn the last question, the function is an exponential function. For evaluating the double integral of an exponential function, we can apply the property of integrating in any order, meaning that it does not matter whether we integrate over x first and then y or vice versa. This allows us to perform the integration one variable at a time, which is often simpler.\n\nHere's how we can solve the last prompt's double integral step by step:\n1. Integration over x: The integral of the exponential function $e^{x + y}$ with respect to x from 0 to 1 is $e^{x + y}|_{x=0}^{x=1} = e^{1 + y} - e^y$.\n\n2. Integration over y: Now, we integrate the result from step 1 with respect to y from 0 to 2. This gives us the double integral:\n$\\int_{0}^{2} (e^{1 + y} - e^y) dy = [e^{1 + y} - e^y]|_{y=0}^{y=2} = e^3 + e^2 - e^2 - 1 = e^3 - 1$.\n\nSo, the answer is the numerical representation of $e^3 - 1$, which is: \n[[4.48168899]]",
