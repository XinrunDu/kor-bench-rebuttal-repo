Single-character plaintext is encrypted by replacing each character with a 16-character hexadecimal string.\n2. The encrypted string follows a consistent pattern, where the first two characters represent a value derived from the plaintext character, and the remaining 14 characters are constant.\n3. The decryption process involves taking the 16-character hexadecimal string and extracting the first two characters, which represent the decrypted character.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\nPlaintext: \"VNSEFNGHKUY\"\n\nTo encrypt this plaintext, we need to apply the encryption rule to each character:\n\n'V' -> [[36959986938C9784]]\n'N' -> [[299C9986938C9784]]\n'S' -> [[9E9C9986938C9784]]\n'E' -> [[78959986938C9784]]\n'F' -> [[75959986938C9784]]\n'N' -> [[299C9986938C9784]]\n'G' -> [[2B9C9986938C9784]]\n'H' -> [[79959986938C9784]]\n'K' -> [[33959986938C9784]]\n'U' -> [[41959986938C9784]]\n'Y' -> [[8C9C9986938C9784]]\n\nCombining these encrypted values, the final encrypted answer is:\n\n[[36959986938C97842999E9C9986938C978478595986938C97847599598693\n8C97842999598693809784799599598693809784339599598693819784419599598\n693809784]]",
