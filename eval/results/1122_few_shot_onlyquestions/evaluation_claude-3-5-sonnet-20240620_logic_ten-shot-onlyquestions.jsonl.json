In such a scenario, the appropriate action is to reassess the plausibility of all the hypotheses, including the new one, rather than simply accepting the new hypothesis as the new truth or ignoring it.\n\nThe key principles underlying this rule are:\n\n1. Holistic evaluation: When a new hypothesis contradicts the existing ensemble of plausible hypotheses, it suggests that the overall logical consistency of the hypotheses needs to be re-evaluated.\n\n2. Systematic review: Instead of focusing on a single new hypothesis or dismissing it, the appropriate approach is to thoroughly review all the hypotheses to determine their relative plausibility and identify any potential issues or conflicts.\n\n3.

[[[c1+c2]φ]]: If executing either command c1 or c2 necessarily results in φ being true, this can be expressed using the logical expression [[[c1+c2]φ]].\n\n4. [[[c*]φ]]: If a loop command c* will continue to execute until the proposition φ is true, this can be expressed using the logical expression [[[c*]φ]].\n\n5. [[[c]open]]: If executing the command c results in the proposition open being necessarily true, this can be expressed using the logical expression [[[c]open]].\n\n6. [[[d]φ]]: If commands c and d are equivalent according to the Substitution Rule, then [c]φ is equivalent to [[[d]φ]].\n\n7. [[⟨c1+c2⟩φ]]: If there is a possibility that executing either c1 or c2 will result in φ being true, this can be expressed using the logical expression [[⟨c1+c2⟩φ]].\n\n8.
