In the second scenario, the researcher observed that patients who took the new drug and had a specific lifestyle showed a reduction in blood pressure, and patients who did not take the new drug but had the same lifestyle also showed a reduction in blood pressure.

In the third scenario, the policy analyst observed that investment in education, infrastructure, and healthcare all had a positive impact on economic growth.
