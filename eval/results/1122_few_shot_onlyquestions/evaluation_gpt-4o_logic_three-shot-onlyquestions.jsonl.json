Since Person B stated this, C1 = p & !q.\n\n- **C2:** Person B's statements are partially correct. This means the disjunction of one true part and one false part. Since Person B claims both, the expression becomes (!p & !q) | (p & q).\n\n- **C3:** Person B's statements are entirely incorrect. This means they contradict reality, so !p & q.\n\n### Person C:\n\n- **D1:** Person C's statements are entirely correct, meaning !q & !r. Since Person C stated this, D1 = !q & !r.\n\n- **D2:** Person C's statements are partially correct. This involves one true and one false part.

(Typically, if everything is affirmed, then partial rejection isn't true).\n- If the proposition SIP is true, then the proposition SEP is false. (Particular affirmation suggests not all are negated but specific predicates hold true).\n- If the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SEP is not deterministically true without context. We can hypothesize it leans to possibly true, given no affirmation, but can't be mathematically determined.\n- If the proposition SOP is false, then the SAP can be argued as true if contextually complete; however, categorical logic traditionally doesn't enforce such direct conversion unless rules are known in context.\n\nHence, considering the logical reasoning of affirmation, negation, contradiction, and logical dependence, the completed final answer is:\n\n[[false];[true];[true];[true]]",

Both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true.\n2. Both \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) are true.\n\nLet's analyze all possible input combinations for three inputs, \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\), and determine the output for each combination according to the expression \\((p∧q)∨(p∧r)\\).\n\n1. When \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) are all true (\\(+,+,+\\)), both \\(p∧q\\) and \\(p∧r\\) are true, so the output is true (\\(+\\)).\n\n2. When \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true, but \\(r\\) is false (\\(+,+,-\\)), \\(p∧q\\) is true and \\(p∧r\\) is false, thus the output is true (\\(+\\)).\n\n3. When \\(p\\) is true, \\(q\\) is false, and \\(r\\) is true (\\(+,-,+\\)), \\(p∧q\\) is false and \\(p∧r\\) is true, resulting in a true output (\\(+\\)).\n\n4. When \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\) are not all true (\\(+,-,-\\)), both \\(p∧q\\) and \\(p∧r\\) are false, yielding a false output (\\(-\\)).\n\n5. When \\(p\\) is false, \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) are true (\\(-,+,+\\)), neither \\(p∧q\\) nor \\(p∧r\\) can be true, so the output is false (\\(-\\)).\n\n6. When \\(p\\) is false, \\(q\\) is true, but \\(r\\) is false (\\(-,+,-\\)), neither conjunction is true, resulting in a false output (\\(-\\)).\n\n7.

This suggests a transformation where \"if and only if\" is represented by an equality sign, and \"p2 is false\" by \"~p2\".\n\n2. **Second example**: \n   - The statement is assessed to determine its type and level. The answer is formatted as [[level];[A/B/C]].

Format here [[T:...];[F:...]] suggests a partitioning for true and false scenarios.\n\n4. **Fourth example**:\n   - Describes multiple formulas, with expected output only for falsity values in the format [[F:...];[F:...];[F:...]]. The logic pattern applied within formulas and result analysis hints towards possible conditions or scenarios when falsity holds.\n\nConsidering these interpretations, to solve the last question about finding falsity values, systematically analyze each formula:\n\n- Evaluate the formula structure.\n- Apply negation and logical operations.\n- Identify logical combinations (✓ | x) where they evaluate false for given propositions.\n\nYet, given no specific logical context in the prompt, we can't derive specific symbolic evaluations definitively. This demands hypothetical symbolic computation, considering peer examples somewhat align under this stipulated logic structure.\n\nIt's advisable to first convert each formula to a standard symbolic format, then identify falsifying conditions. Therefore, let's push assumptions from premisely outlined patterns:\n\n1. Analyze provided logical propositions.\n2. Derive where conjunction/disjunction, negation matter, e.g.:\n   - ~(~p1&p2)||~p3 usually checks for negations/contradictions.\n   - (~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2) checks under what conditions entire construct fails.\n   - (p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1) analyzes through conjunction intersection.\n\nHowever, specific T/F deterministic allocation remains moderatively speculative without full operational definitions or logical contextualization written within this scenario directly.

Since \\( f(x, y) = x + y \\), we can achieve \\( x + y = z \\) simply by choosing \\( z = x + y \\), which is always possible.\n\nHence, the logical equivalent of this formula is always true and doesn't impose conditions on \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[\n[[\\text{True}]]\n\\]\n\n### Formula (2): \\( \\exists x F(f(x, y), g(x, z)) \\)\n\nThis asks if there exists an \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x, y) = g(x, z) \\). With the definitions, this translates to:\n\\[ \nx + y = x \\cdot z \n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\\[ \ny = x \\cdot z - x \n\\]\n\nor factorizing:\n\\[ \ny = x(z - 1) \n\\]\n\nHence, the condition is that \\( y \\) must be a multiple of \\( x \\) when \\( z - 1 \\neq 0 \\) (or \\( z \\neq 1 \\)).
