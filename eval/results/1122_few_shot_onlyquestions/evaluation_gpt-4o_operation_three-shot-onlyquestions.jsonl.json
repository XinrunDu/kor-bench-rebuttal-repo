The derivative of \\( x \\) is 1, so the expression \\(\\sqrt{2}/2 + 1\\) is the correct result.\n\nFollowing this observation, it seems that \\( f□g \\) involves evaluating the derivative of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and the derivative of \\( g \\) with respect to \\( x \\), and then adding them together.\n\nNow, let's solve the last question:\n\n**Question**:  \n\\( f(x) = \\cos(x), \\, g(x) = x^3, \\) compute \\( f□g \\).\n\n1.
