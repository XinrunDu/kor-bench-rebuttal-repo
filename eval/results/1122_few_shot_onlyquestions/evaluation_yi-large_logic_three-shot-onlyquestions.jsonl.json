To express \"Blue and yellow are both common colors,\" we use the logical conjunction (AND) operator, `&`, between `p1` (Blue is a common color) and `p2` (Yellow is a common color), resulting in `[p1 & p2]`.\n\n2. To express \"Either `√3` or `5` is irrational,\" we use the logical disjunction (OR) operator, `||`, between `p3` (`√3` is irrational) and `p4` (`5` is irrational), resulting in `[p3 || p4]`.\n\n3. To express \"Exactly one of `√3` and `5` is irrational,\" we need to capture the idea that one is true and the other is false. This is done by saying \"not both `p3` and `p4` are true, but at least one of them is true.\" This translates to `[~(p3 & p4) & (p3 || p4)]`. This formula ensures that not both `p3` and `p4` are true (using the negation of their conjunction, `~(&)`), and that at least one of them is true (using their disjunction, `||`).\n\nGiven the rules and examples provided, the last question is answered in the required format.",

The level is given as a single letter (possibly followed by a number), and the type is given as A, B, or C.\n\n3. **Truth Values**: The third question introduces a format for expressing truth (`T`) and falsity (`F`) values of a formula. The values are given as a series of symbols separated by `|`, with `✓` indicating truth and `x` indicating falsity.\n\n4. **Symbolizing Propositions**: The fourth question does not have an answer provided, but we can infer the rules from the question format and the examples given. We need to symbolize each proposition using logical connectives and represent multiple propositions within `[[ ]]` separated by `[ ]`.\n\nGiven these rules, let's symbolize the given propositions:\n\n(1) Only if 4 is even, 5 is odd.\nThis can be interpreted as \"5 is odd only if 4 is even\". Using `p1` for \"4 is even\" and `p2` for \"5 is odd\", this translates to `p2 =::> p1`.\n\n(2) If 4 is even, then 5 is even.\nThis directly translates to `p1 =::> ~p2`, where `~p2` represents \"5 is even\".\n\n(3) Only 4 being even makes 5 even.\nThis suggests that if 4 is not even, 5 cannot be even. This can be symbolized as `(~p1 =::> ~p2) ^ (p1 =::> p2)`, but simplifying it to match the given format, it's similar to saying \"4 being even implies 5 is even, and 4 not being even implies 5 isn't even\", which can be `p1 =::> p2`.\n\n(4) 4 is even if and only if 5 is odd.\nThis is a biconditional statement, translating to `p1 =~ p2`.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question, following the given format, is:\n\n`[[ p2 =::> p1 ];[ p1 =::> ~p2 ];[ p1 =::> p2 ];[ p1 =~ p2 ]]`\n\nPlease note that the interpretation for (3) could vary, but based on the given examples and the context of logical implications, this seems to be the most fitting symbolic representation within the constraints of the format.",

The format for this is `[[level];[A/B/C]]`.\n\n3. **Truth and Falsity Values**: The truth values are denoted by `✓` and falsity values by `x`, separated by `|`.

It's false (`x`) if all are true. Given `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` can each be true (`✓`) or false (`x`), the truth table for the formula can be constructed. The formula is true (`✓`) when at least one of `p1`, `p2`, or `~p3` is false, which happens in the following cases: `✓|x,x|✓,x|x`. The formula is false (`x`) when all are true (`✓|✓,x|x`).\n\n(2) (~p1 &p2) =::> (p1 =p3)\n- This formula reads as \"if not p1 and p2, then p1 if and only if p3\". To be false (`x`), the left side must be true and the right side false. This happens when `p1` is false, `p2` is true, and `p1` and `p3` have different truth values. When `p1` is false and `p2` is true, and `p3` is true, the formula `p1 =p3` is false, making the implication false. Similarly, when `p1` is false, `p2` is true, and `p3` is false, the formula `p1 =p3` is true, making the implication true. Thus, the falsity condition is met only in the case where `p1` is false, `p2` is true, and `p3` is true, denoted as `x|x,✓,✓`. The formula is true in all other cases, denoted as `✓|x,x,x,x|✓,x,x,x|✓,x,✓`.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n`[[T:✓|x,x|✓,x|x;F:✓|✓,x|x];[T:✓|x,x,x,x|✓,x,x,x|✓,x,✓;F:x|x,✓,✓]]`\n\nNote: The commas in the final answer separate different combinations, and the `x` and `✓` represent the truth values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` from left to right in each combination.",

The operator '=~' seems to represent 'if and only if not', '=::>' represents 'implies', '||' represents 'or', '&&' represents 'and', and '~' represents 'not'.\n\n2. **Level and Type**: The level is given as 'A' if the proposition involves a truth formula, and the type is given as 'C' if it's neither a truth nor a falsehood formula by itself but rather a conditional or complex formula.\n\n3. **Truth and Falsity Values**: The truth values are represented as '✓' for true and 'x' for false. The falsity values are represented similarly but are explicitly asked for in the context of given formulas.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nFind the falsity values of the following formulas:\n(1) ~(~p1 & p2) || ~p3\n(2) (~p2 || p3) & (p1 =::> p2)\n(3) (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n\nThe answer format is [[F:...];[F:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in F, they should be separated by commas (,). For example, [[F:x|x|x];[F:✓|✓|✓];[F:x|x|x,✓|✓|✓]]\n\n### Answer:\n\nTo find the falsity values, we need to determine when each formula is false. Let's break it down:\n\n(1) ~(~p1 & p2) || ~p3\n- This is false when what's inside the outer '~' is true and p3 is true. So, it's false when (~p1 & p2) is true and p3 is true. This happens when p1 is false, p2 is true, and p3 is true.\n\n(2) (~p2 || p3) & (p1 =::> p2)\n- This is false when one of the parts is false. The left side is false when p2 is true and p3 is false. The right side (p1 =::> p2) is false when p1 is true and p2 is false. So, it's false when either (p2 is true and p3 is false) or (p1 is true and p2 is false).\n\n(3) (p1 =::> p2) & (~(p1 & p3) || p1)\n- The left side is false when p1 is true and p2 is false. The right side is false when (p1 & p3) is true and p1 is false, but that's a contradiction since p1 can't be both true and false. So, it's only false when p1 is true and p2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the falsity values for each formula are:\n- (1): [[F:x|✓|✓]]\n- (2): [[F:x|✓|x,✓|x|✓]] (Removed redundant '✓|x' from the example to avoid confusion; it's about falsity, not truth.)\n- (3): [[F:✓|x|x]]\n\nCombining these, the final answer is:\n\n[[F:x|✓|✓];[F:x|✓|x,✓|x|✓];[F:✓|x|x]]\n\nPlease note that the format and logic have been applied based on the examples provided.

The answer `[[A];[C]]` suggests that `p1` is at level A and is Neither a Truth nor Falsehood Formula.\n\n3. **Question 3** introduces a formula `p1 =::> ~p2` and asks for its truth values and falsity values. The answer format and the provided answer `[[T:✓|x,x|x,x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]` seem to be a bit unclear, potentially due to a formatting issue. However, interpreting it as `[[T:✓,x,x,x,✓];[F:✓,✓]]` might suggest the truth table for `p1 => ~p2`, listing all possible combinations of truth values for `p1` and `p2` and the corresponding truth value of the formula. The actual answer seems to indicate that the formula is true when either both `p1` and `p2` are true, or both are false, which aligns with how a material implication (`=>`) works with negation (`~`). However, the expected format might be misunderstood here, so we'll correct our interpretation: the formula is true when `p1` is false or when both `p1` is true and `p2` is false.\n\n4. **Question 4** asks for the level of the formula `(~p1 & p2) =::> p3`. From the previous answers, `=::>` seems to be a symbol used for implication (`=>`), and the structure of the formula suggests it's a conditional statement. The question's answer format simply asks for the level, without the type.\n\nGiven the pattern and assuming `=::>` means implication (`=>`), the formula `(~p1 & p2) =::> p3` is a compound proposition that involves negation (`~`), conjunction (`&`), and implication. The level of a formula can be seen as its complexity or the number of operations involved. Since the formula involves three propositions (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) with negation, conjunction, and implication, it's at a complexity level higher than that of a simple conditional (`p1 => ~p2`) as seen in Question 3, which was given level A. If we follow a simple progression, the next level would be `B`.\n\nHowever, considering the complexity and the introduction of both conjunction (`&`) and implication (`=>`), the formula might be considered at a level that involves more steps of logical reasoning. If `B` represents a simple conjunction or implication, then this formula, involving both and a negation, could be seen as next in complexity. Given the pattern and assuming `A` represents the simplest level, and considering the actual complexity introduced by the combination of connectives, we might consider this formula at level `C`. This is because it introduces a nested structure (`~p1 & p2`) before the implication, making it more complex than what we've seen so far.\n\nThus, the answer to the last question, following the provided pattern and interpretation, would be:\n\n```\n[[C]]\n```\n\nThis interpretation is based on the assumption that the letter denotes the complexity level of the formula, with `A` being the simplest, and each subsequent letter indicating a higher level of complexity. Since the formula in question is more complex than those previously classified as `A` and could potentially involve more steps to evaluate, it is classified as `C`. This classification aligns with the pattern suggested by the progression from simple propositions to compound ones involving multiple logical operations.",

The second question and answer pair introduces a classification system for propositions: A level indicates they are truth formulas, B level indicates they are falsehood formulas, and C level indicates they are neither. The given answer suggests that \"p1\" by itself is at the A level (a truth formula) but is categorized as C (neither a truth formula nor a falsehood formula) when considering its type without additional context. This implies that individual propositional variables like \"p1\" are considered neutral or indeterminate in terms of truth value without further logical operations.\n\n3. The third question and answer pair provides a format for listing truth values (T) and falsity values (F) of a formula. The formula \"p1 =::> ~p2\" is a conditional statement where \"=::>\" represents the material implication. The answer format shows that the formula is true in two cases (✓|x, x|x, x|✓) and false in one case (✓|✓), indicating the rows of a truth table where the formula is true or false, respectively.\n\n4. The fourth question asks for the level of a more complex formula: \"(~(p1 =::> ~p2)) & ((p3 || p4) = ~p1)\". This formula involves negation, implication, disjunction, and conjunction. None of the propositions (p1, p2, p3, p4) are simple propositions; they are all part of more complex logical expressions. Since the formula combines several propositions with logical connectives, it does not represent a simple truth or falsehood but rather a compound statement whose truth value depends on the truth values of its components. Therefore, following the pattern established, this formula would be classified at a higher level than A, as it involves more complex logical structure. The next level after A would be D (since C was used to denote \"neither\" in the context of simple propositions).\n\nThus, the level of the formula \"(~(p1 =::> ~p2)) & ((p3 || p4) = ~p1)\" is D.",

Since `p1` being true is sufficient for the entire disjunction to be true, this statement is always true regardless of the truth values of `p2` and `p3`. Therefore, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) `(p1 =::>~p1 )=::>~p2`\n\nThis formula states that if `p1` implies not `p1`, then `p2` must be false. However, `p1` implying not `p1` is a contradiction, and a contradiction implies anything (principle of explosion in classical logic). Thus, when `p1` is false and `~p1` is true, the premise is true, and since the premise being true leads to the conclusion being true (`~p2`), the overall formula is true. When `p1` is true, leading to `~p1` being false, the premise is false, making an implication with a false premise true regardless of the conclusion.

The level and type of `p1` are determined to be `[[A];[C]]`, where `A` is the level (Truth Formula), and `C` is the type (Neither truth nor falsehood formula).\n\n3. The truth values and falsity values of the formula `p1 =::> ~p2` are given in the pattern `[[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]`. Here, `=::>` seems to represent implication (\"if... then\"), and `|` separates the possible outcomes of `p1` and `p2` (where `✓` indicates truth and `x` indicates any value). The pattern suggests that the formula is true in all cases except when `p1` is true and `p2` is true.\n\n4. Given that `(p1 =::>(p1 ||p2 ))&((p1 &p2 )=::>p1 )` is a Truth Formula, we are asked to determine the type of two sub-formulas.

This is always true because if `p1` is true, then `p1` or `p2` is true; if `p1` is false, the implication still holds (since an implication is true if the antecedent is false). Thus, it is a Truth Formula (`A`).\n    \n    - For `(2) (p1 &p2 )=::>p1`, this says \"(p1 and p2) implies p1\". This is also always true because if `p1` and `p2` are both true, then `p1` is true; if either `p1` or `p2` is false, the implication again holds (for the same reason as above).

The second question and answer indicate that the two expressions `!(p & q) | r` and `!p | !q | r` are equivalent.

This is a basic equivalence for the NAND operation, as `p ⇑ q` is true when at least one of `p` or `q` is false.\n\nNow, applying these principles to the last question:\n\nGiven: `(p > q) > r`\n\nApplying the equivalence for `>` (`p > q` is equivalent to `!p | q`):\n\n`(!p | q) > r`\n\nApplying the equivalence again:\n\n`!(!(!p | q)) | r`\n\nSimplifying inside the inner negation:\n\n`!(p & !q) | r`\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws to express the negation of a conjunction as a disjunction of negations:\n\n`!p | !!q | r`\n\nSince `!!q` simply negates the negation of `q`, it is equivalent to `q`:\n\n`!p | q | r`\n\nGiven the rule to avoid unnecessary brackets and that `|` (OR) is commutative and associative, we can write the simplest logical expression without changing the meaning:\n\n`!p | q | r`\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question, formatted as required, is:\n\n`[[!p | q | r]]`",

The first question and answer show that removing all occurrences of '>' (which is likely representing implication or \"if-then\" in logic) in '(p > q) & (p > !q)' results in '!p'. This suggests that 'p > q' can be simplified to '!p | q' (since 'p > q' is logically equivalent to '!p | q' according to the basic equivalences in propositional logic), and thus '(p > q) & (p > !q)' simplifies to '(!p | q) & (!p | !q)', which further simplifies to '!p'.\n\n2. The second question and answer indicate that '!(p & q) | r' and '!p | !q | r' are equivalent. This is consistent with the basic equivalences in propositional logic, such as De Morgan's laws and distributivity.\n\n3. The third question and answer show that 'p ⇑ q' simplifies to '!p | !q'. The symbol '⇑' is not standard in logic but seems to be interpreted in a way that leads to '!p | !q', which is equivalent to '!(p & q)' according to De Morgan's laws.\n\n4. The fourth question asks whether '(p>q)>r' and 'p>(q>r)' are equivalent. Given what we know about '>', it represents implication. So, '(p>q)>r' means '!(p>q) | r', and 'p>(q>r)' means '!p | (q>r)'. \n\nTo answer whether '(p>q)>r' and 'p>(q>r)' are equivalent, we need to apply the rules of propositional logic:\n\n- '(p>q)>r' can be rewritten as '!((!p | q)) | r', which is logically equivalent to '!(!p | q) | r', and then to '(p & !q) | r' using De Morgan's laws.\n- 'p>(q>r)' can be rewritten as '!p | (!q | r)'.\n\nThese two expressions are not the same. For example, consider the case when 'p' and 'r' are false and 'q' is true:\n- '(p & !q) | r' evaluates to false.\n- '!p | (!q | r)' evaluates to true since '!p' is true.\n\nTherefore, according to the rules applied in the previous questions, '(p>q)>r' and 'p>(q>r)' are not equivalent.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]",

So, `(p > q) & (p > !q)` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | !q)`, which simplifies to `!p` because `p` cannot be true if it implies both `q` and `!q`.\n\n2. **Equivalence of expressions**: The question checks if `!(p & q) | r` is equivalent to `!p | !q | r`. Using De Morgan's laws, `!(p & q)` is equivalent to `!p | !q`, so `!(p & q) | r` is indeed equivalent to `!p | !q | r`.\n\n3. **Simplest result through equivalence derivation**: The symbol `⇑` seems to be a typo or a specific notation not widely recognized in standard logic texts. However, considering the context and the answer provided, it seems to imply a form of NAND operation or a negation of conjunction, leading to an interpretation where `p ⇑ q` could be understood as `!(p & q)`, which simplifies to `!p | !q`.\n\n4. **Validity of equivalences**: The question asks to verify the validity of two equivalences using the 16 Basic Equivalences. The format for the answer is to provide a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer for each sub-question in the format `[[A]];[[B]]`, where `A` and `B` are replaced with `A` for \"Yes\" and `B` for \"No\".\n\n### Applying the Rules to the Last Question\n\n- **(1) p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)**: This equivalence states that `p` is equivalent to `(p&q)|(p&!q)`. This is true because `p` is true only when `p&q` is true or `p&!q` is true, covering all possible conditions for `p` given `q` or `!q`.\n\n- **(2) (p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))**: This equivalence is not valid. The left side expresses exclusive or (XOR), where `p` is true and `q` is false, or `p` is false and `q` is true. The right side incorrectly attempts to capture this but fails because `(p|q)&(!(p|q))` is always false due to a contradiction: `p|q` must be true for the conjunction to hold, but `!(p|q)` requires `p|q` to be false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the analysis, the answers to the sub-questions are:\n\n- For the first equivalence `p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q)`, the answer is `[[A]]` (Yes).\n- For the second equivalence `(p&!q)|(!p&q)::=::(p|q)&(!(p|q))`, the answer is `[[B]]` (No).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\n[[A]];[[B]]\n```",

The first question asks to remove all occurrences of `>` in `(p > q) & (p > !q)` and ends up with `!p`. This suggests that `p > q` is equivalent to `!p | q` (Material Implication) and that when `p > q` and `p > !q` are both true, it implies `!p`, as `q` and `!q` cannot both be true, so `p` must be false.\n\n2. The second question affirms that `!(p & q) | r` is equivalent to `!p | !q | r`, which can be seen as applying De Morgan's laws and Distribution of Disjunction over Implication, simplifying `!(p & q)` to `!p | !q`.\n\n3. The third question simplifies `p ⇑ q` (Equivalence operator, true if both `p` and `q` are the same) to `!p|!q`, which is achieved through the understanding that `p ⇑ q` is true if `p` and `q` are both false or both true (equivalent to `(!p & !q) | (p & q)`), which can be further simplified to `!p|!q` using Distributive Laws.\n\nNow, let's apply these understandings to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the 16 Basic Equivalences, is the equivalence below valid? A. Yes B. No\n(1 ) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2 ) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n#### (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\nThis equivalence is saying that `(p > q) & (p > r)` is equivalent to `p > (q | r)`. This statement is valid under the Material Implication redefinition:\n- `p > q` means `!p | q`\n- `p > r` means `!p | r`\n- `p > (q | r)` means `!p | (q | r)`\nGiven `!p | q` and `!p | r` are both true, it must mean `!p` is true or both `q` and `r` are true, which simplifies to `!p | (q | r)`. Therefore, the equivalence is **valid**.\n\n#### (2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThis equivalence is checking if the negation of `p=q` (Equivalence) is the same as `(p|q)&!(p&q)`. The negation of `p=q` is `p ⇑ q`, which is true when `p` and `q` have different truth values. This is indeed equivalent to `(p|q)&!(p&q)` because:\n- `p|q` is true if at least one of `p` or `q` is true.\n- `!(p&q)` is true if `p` and `q` are not both true.\nThus, the expression is true when `p` and `q` are different, which matches the condition for `p ⇑ q`.

The first question and its answer indicate that when dealing with expressions involving '>', which seems to represent a logical operation, we aim to simplify the expression by removing '>' entirely. The outcome for the given expression (p > q) & (p > !q) becomes !p, suggesting that '>' implies some form of implication or relation that, when held in conjunction for opposite values of q, reduces the expression to the negation of the common term, p.\n\n2. The second question and its answer, [[A]], suggest that the given expressions !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r are equivalent, which aligns with one of De Morgan's laws and the property of distributivity of disjunction over conjunction (or vice versa, depending on how one views the transformation). Essentially, it confirms that certain basic logical equivalences are in play, such as the distribution of negation over conjunction/disjunction.\n\n3. The third question and its answer indicate that p ⇑ q simplifies to !p|!q, suggesting that ⇑ represents a form of NAND or similar operation where the output is true only when both inputs are false (or, equivalently, the negation of a conjunction).\n\n4. Based on the provided structure and the inferred understanding of ⇓ and ⇑, we can deduce that ⇓ likely represents a form of logical operation akin to NOR or equivalent, given its parallel structure to ⇑ in the context of logical operations. Given this, the question pertains to the associativity of these operations, as indicated by the ::=:: symbol (assumed to mean equivalent to, due to the context in which it's used).\n\n- For the first part of the question, (p⇓q)⇓r::=::p⇓(q⇓r), it's asking if the operation ⇓ is associative. Given that ⇓ potentially represents a NOR or equivalent operation, and assuming basic equivalences hold, NOR is indeed associative, but the structure of the operation (being a form of combination that is TRUE only when all inputs are FALSE), suggests a mismatch if directly related to the given transformation. The given transformation seems to imply a distributive property rather than associativity directly; hence, based on the structure of the operation (akin to NOR), the direct transformation as given is not valid. Thus, the answer should be [[B]].\n\n- For the second part of the question, (p⇑q)⇑r::=::p⇑(q⇑r), it's asking if the operation ⇑ is associative. Given that ⇑ potentially represents a NAND or equivalent operation, and knowing that NAND is indeed associative, the transformation as given directly aligns with the associative property of operations like NAND. Hence, the answer should be [[A]].\n\nThus, the final answer, adhering to the question structure and based on the interpretation of the operations ⇓ and ⇑, is [[B];[A]].",

Therefore, the second scenario (p & !q & r) is not possible because it would require both p and r to be true, which contradicts the rule that only one can be true.

The subscript number is determined by the truth table position where the term evaluates to true, following the convention:\n   - The rows are numbered starting from 0.\n   - The numbering follows the binary order where the rightmost variable (usually \\(r\\)) is the least significant bit, followed by \\(q\\) and then \\(p\\), reading them as binary values.\n   - For example, \\(p \\land \\lnot q \\land r\\) corresponds to \\(m_2\\) because in the truth table, this term is true only in row 2 (010 in binary, where 0 represents false and 1 represents true for \\(p, q, r\\) respectively).\n\n3. **Paired Disjunctive Terms**: These are the individual terms connected by a disjunction (OR, ∨) in each part of a conjunction (AND, ∧).\n\n4. **Denotation for Disjunctive Terms**: Similar to conjunctive terms, the denotation uses \"M\" followed by a subscript number to represent each paired disjunctive term in a conjunction.

The paired conjunctive terms are `p∧¬q∧r` and `¬p∧q∧¬r`. These terms are denoted using the minterm notation, where `m2` and `m5` correspond to the binary representations of the terms (with `p` being the most significant bit and `r` being the least significant bit).

The entire expression is then denoted as `M2 ∧ M5`.\n\n3. In the third example, the expression `p∧q∧r` was identified as an all-odd formula because it contains an odd number of positive literals (three positive literals).

Then, we convert this binary representation into a decimal number to find the corresponding maxterm (`M`).\n\n1.

The subscript is derived by treating the positive literals as 1 and the negated literals as 0, then converting this sequence to a binary number, and finally to a decimal. The overall expression is denoted by listing these \"m\" terms separated by \"∨\".\n\n2. **Paired Disjunctive Terms and Denotation**: Similarly, when dealing with a disjunction (OR, ∨) of literals within parentheses joined by a conjunction (AND, ∧), we identify each group of disjunctive terms and denote them using the \"M\" notation, with the subscript derived in the same way as for the \"m\" notation, but typically representing the complement of the pattern (i.e., what would be the \"m\" subscript for the complementary term). The overall expression is denoted by listing these \"M\" terms separated by \"∧\".\n\n3. **Identification of Formulas**: We classify formulas based on their structure and the distribution of negations among the literals:\n   - **All-odd formula**: All literals are negated. This corresponds to a formula that would be true only for the truth table row with all inputs false (000 in binary, or 0 as a decimal, thus \"m0\", but identified under the \"all-odd\" rule).\n   - **Basic formula**: This likely refers to any formula that can be expressed directly in terms of literals (variables or their negations) without further logical operations.\n   - **All-even formula**: This would be the complement of an all-odd formula, where none of the literals are negated.

In the first example, the given expression is a disjunction (OR) of two conjunctive (AND) clauses. Each clause is converted into a term using the m-notation, where the subscript is based on the positions of the negated and non-negated literals in the clause (0 for a negated literal, 1 for a non-negated literal).

The resulting terms are then combined with a conjunction (∧).\n\n3. The third example classifies a basic formula (p∧q∧r) as an all-odd formula, which means that all literals in the formula are non-negated (they have an odd number of negations, in this case 0, which is considered an even number plus one, thus making it odd in this context).\n\n4. The fourth example involves a formula that is a disjunction of two conjunctive clauses, each with a mix of negated and non-negated literals.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nIdentify (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨ (p∧q∧r) as: (select all that apply)\nA.

Each clause has one non-negated literal (r in the first clause and p, q, and r in the second clause) and two negated literals (¬p and ¬q in the first clause). Since the formula consists of a mix of negated and non-negated literals, it is not a tautology, contradiction, all-even, or all-odd formula. It is a basic formula because it combines literals using conjunction and disjunction without additional logical operators.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is:\n\n[[C]] - Basic formula.\n\nThe formula is not a tautology because it is not always true, nor is it a contradiction because it is not always false. It is not an all-even or all-odd formula because the number of negations is not consistent across all literals in the formula. The formula is basic because it is a combination of literals using conjunction and disjunction. The fact that it involves a mix of negated and non-negated literals does not change its basic nature, as the classification of all-even and all-odd specifically relates to the pattern of negations, which this formula does not fit.",

The paired terms themselves are conjunctive (using ∧) or disjunctive (using ∨) combinations of literals.\n\n2. **Denotation**: The denotation for conjunctive terms uses \"m\" followed by a subscript, and for disjunctive terms, it uses \"M\" followed by a subscript. The subscript is determined by the literals in the term, but the specific rule for this conversion is not explicitly given in the examples. However, we can infer that the subscript likely corresponds to a binary interpretation of the literals' presence (1 for positive literal, 0 for negation) read from left to right, assuming 'p' corresponds to the least significant bit, 'q' to the middle, and 'r' to the most significant bit, given the example denotations.\n\n3. **Formula Classification**: Formulas are classified based on their structure and the distribution of negations among their literals. The categories include being a tautology, contradiction, basic formula, all-even formula, all-odd formula, or none of the above.\n\n   - **Tautology**: Always true.\n   - **Contradiction**: Always false.\n   - **Basic formula**: A single literal or its negation.\n   - **All-even formula**: Contains an even number of negations.\n   - **All-odd formula**: Contains an odd number of negations.\n\n4. **Principal Disjunctive/Conjunctive Normal Form**: A formula is in principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) if it is a disjunction of all possible mutually exclusive minimal conjunctions that imply the formula. Similarly, it is in principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) if it is a conjunction of all possible mutually exclusive minimal disjunctions that imply the negation of the formula.\n\nGiven these rules, let's analyze the last question:\n\n**Question**: Determine whether \\((¬p∧¬q∧¬r)∨(¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(¬p∧q∧r)∨(p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r)\\) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\n\nThis expression is a disjunction of several conjunctive terms. Each conjunctive term is a minimal conjunction because each contains exactly three literals with no redundancy. Furthermore, the terms are mutually exclusive because each assigns a unique truth value to at least one of the variables 'p', 'q', or 'r'.\n\nSince it is a disjunction of all possible mutually exclusive minimal conjunctions, it indeed conforms to the **principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF)**.\n\nNow, let's denote this expression using the subscript notation inferred earlier. The subscript should correspond to the binary interpretation of the literals' presence, with 1 for positive literal, 0 for negation, read from 'p' (least significant bit) to 'r' (most significant bit):\n\n- \\(¬p∧¬q∧¬r\\) corresponds to 000, so it's \\(m0\\).\n- \\(¬p∧¬q∧r\\) corresponds to 001, so it's \\(m1\\).\n- \\(¬p∧q∧r\\) corresponds to 011, so it's \\(m3\\).\n- \\(p∧¬q∧r\\) corresponds to 101, so it's \\(m5\\).\n- \\(p∧q∧r\\) corresponds to 111, so it's \\(m7\\).\n\nThus, the denoted expression is \\(m0∨m1∨m3∨m5∨m7\\), and the answer format should be:\n\n**Answer**:\n```\n[[A];[denoted expression: m0 ∨m1 ∨m3 ∨m5 ∨m7]]\n```\n\nPlease note, the denotation could vary slightly depending on the exact subscript assignment rule, but the method of converting based on the binary interpretation of the literals' presence is a reasonable inference from the examples provided.",

The simplest tautology in basic form for 4 propositional variables \\(p, q, r, s\\) would involve all possible combinations of these variables that result in a true value.\n- For 4 variables, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible combinations, but we want a basic form, so we list all the conjunctive terms (\\(m_i\\)) that correspond to true values in their simplest form. However, since it's a tautology, every possible combination evaluates to true.\n\nThus, the formula A, being a tautology and in basic form, would involve all \\(m_i\\) terms from \\(m_1\\) to \\(m_{16}\\) because it needs to cover all possible truth conditions for the 4 variables.\n\nSo, the denoted form would be the disjunction of all these basic conjunctive terms:\n\n\\[m_1 \\lor m_2 \\lor m_3 \\lor m_4 \\lor m_5 \\lor m_6 \\lor m_7 \\lor m_8 \\lor m_9 \\lor m_{10} \\lor m_{11} \\lor m_{12} \\lor m_{13} \\lor m_{14} \\lor m_{15} \\lor m_{16}\\]\n\nHowever, since we're asked for a compact notation that indicates it's a tautology and in basic form, and given the pattern observed where \\(E\\) denoted an all-odd formula, we might infer a similar notation for a formula that includes all terms (both even and odd), especially since it's a tautology covering all possible scenarios. There isn't an explicit notation for this in the given examples, but following the logic:\n\n- For an all-even formula (not the case here), one might infer a notation like \\(E_{all}\\).\n- For an all-odd formula, the examples use \\(E\\).\n- For a formula that includes all terms (both even and odd), covering all possible combinations as a tautology does, a fitting notation, while not explicitly covered, could logically be something like \\(T_{all}\\) or simply \\(T\\), since it's the most straightforward representation of a tautology involving all terms in their basic form.\n\nTherefore, the answer format [[]] for a formula that is both a tautology and in basic form, especially given the context of 4 propositional variables, could be:\n\n\\[[T_{all}]\\] or perhaps just \\[[T]\\]\n\nThis choice aligns with the idea that we're denoting a formula that encompasses all possible scenarios (all terms) and is always true (a tautology).",

In the first question, the conjunctive terms `p∧¬q∧r` and `¬p∧q∧¬r` are denoted using the shorthand `m2` and `m5`, respectively, where the subscript indicates the binary representation of the negations (e.g., `p∧¬q∧r` corresponds to 011 in binary, which is 2 in decimal). The second question uses capital `M` to denote disjunctive terms, following the same subscript logic.\n\n2. **Classification of Formulas**: The third question classifies `p∧q∧r` as an \"All-odd formula\" (E), which suggests that a formula is considered \"all-odd\" if it contains all literals positively (no negations) and has an odd number of variables (in this case, 3).\n\n3. **Counting Formulas**: The fourth question asks for the count of formulas that are both a basic form and an all-even form. Given that an all-even formula likely refers to a formula with an even number of variables (opposite of all-odd), and a basic form suggests all literals are present in each term without repetition, we can infer the process to calculate such counts.\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\n\n### Analysis:\nFor a formula to be an all-even form with 4 propositional variables, it means that all literals must appear exactly once in each term (since \"all-even\" likely refers to the presence of an even number of variables in each term, and \"basic form\" suggests no repetition of literals). However, the combination of \"all-even\" and \"basic form\" is a bit ambiguous based on the provided examples, as \"all-even\" was not explicitly defined in the context of the examples. Given the pattern, we'll interpret \"all-even\" in the context of \"all true\" or \"no negation,\" since `p∧q∧r` was classified as \"all-odd\" due to having no negations and an odd number of variables. Thus, for a formula to meet the criteria of being both a basic form and all-even, it must contain all 4 variables without negation, ensuring it's a basic form (no repetition, all variables present) and all-even (no negations, even number of variables).\n\n### Answer:\nSince there is only one way to write a formula with all 4 variables without negations (i.e., `p∧q∧r∧s`), there is exactly **1** formula that satisfies the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n`[1]`\n\nThis interpretation assumes that \"all-even\" refers to formulas without negations and with an even number of variables, following the pattern hinted at in the classification of `p∧q∧r` as an \"all-odd\" formula.",

Each minterm corresponds to a possible selection:\n   - `(¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)`: Neither A nor B goes, but C goes.\n   - `(¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r)`: A does not go, but B and (¬C) go.\n   - `(p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)`: A and C go, but B does not.\n\n3. To denote this formula according to the pattern in the previous answers, we use the minterm indices:\n   - `(¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)` corresponds to minterm `m1` (since it matches the pattern `¬p ∧ ¬q ∧ r`).\n   - `(¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r)` corresponds to minterm `m2` (since it matches the pattern `¬p ∧ q ∧ ¬r`).\n   - `(p ∧ ¬q ∧ r)` corresponds to minterm `m4` (since it matches the pattern `p ∧ ¬q ∧ r`).\n\nSo, the denoted expression is `m1 ∨ m2 ∨ m4`.\n\n4. Regarding the classification of the formula:\n   - It is not a tautology because it is not true for all possible assignments of `p`, `q`, and `r`.\n   - It is not a contradiction because there are true assignments for it.\n   - It is not a basic formula in the context of this question because it is a disjunction of three minterms, not a single minterm.\n   - It is not an all-even form because the minterm indices `1`, `2`, and `4` are not all even.\n   - It is not an all-odd form because the minterm indices `1`, `2`, and `4` are not all odd.\n\nThus, the formula belongs to \"None of the Above\" (F).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question is:\n\n```\n[[denoted expression]: m1 ∨ m2 ∨ m4; [options]: F]\n```\n\nSo, the final answer should be formatted as:\n\n```\n[[denoted: m1 ∨ m2 ∨ m4]; [options: F]]\n```",

The output is 'Implausible' because the formula contains both a literal and its negation directly (i.e., `p` and `¬p`, and `q` and `¬q`), which means it's a contradiction.

For `p ∨ ¬q ∨ r` and `¬p ∨ q ∨ ¬r`, the complementary literals are `p` and `¬p`, `¬q` and `q`, and `r` and `¬r`.

Notice that the first two clauses, ¬p ∨ q and p ∨ q, can be resolved by the complementary literals p and ¬p, resulting in a new clause {q}. However, since {q} is already in S0, adding it again doesn't change the set. Thus, S1 remains the same as S0 because no new unique clauses can be derived.\n  \n  So, S1 = {¬p ∨ q, p ∨ q, q}\n\n- **S2**: The move from S1 to S2 involves another round of resolution, considering all possible pairs.

The resolution process eliminates this complementary pair of literals and combines the remaining literals into a new clause. The first question's answer indicates that clauses `C1 = ¬p ∨ ¬q` and `C2 = q ∨ ¬r` can be resolved, presumably because they share a complementarity (though not directly visible in `q` and `¬q` due to the way the question is phrased, the principle is that a resolution is possible).\n\n2. **Dispelling Clauses**: When asked to dispel two clauses, it seems we are listing all possible resolvents without simplification (e.g., `r ∨ ¬r` is not simplified to `TRUE`). The operation keeps all literals but the complementary pair in each resolvent.\n\n3. **Output of Resolution Algorithm**: The algorithm outputs \"Implausible\" when a contradiction is found, indicating the initial clauses are unsatisfiable (as in the case of `:p^(¬p∨¬q)^q`, where `p` and `¬p` lead to a contradiction, taking 2 cycles to derive).\n\nGiven these rules, let's address the last question:\n\n> For `(¬p ∨ q)∧(p ∨ q) ∧ (q)`, what is the output of the resolution algorithm? How many cycles will it iterate?\n\nFirst, observe the clauses:\n- `C1 = ¬p ∨ q`\n- `C2 = p ∨ q`\n- `C3 = q`\n\nNotice that `C3` is just `q`, which is already present in both `C1` and `C2`. This means that resolving `C1` and `C2` against `C3` directly won't provide additional information since `q` is subsumed in both. However, resolving `C1` and `C2` against each other using `q` as the complementary literal yields `p ∨ ¬p`, which simplifies to `TRUE`, indicating that there's no contradiction in these clauses regarding the `q` literal. The `q` in `C3` does not directly cause a contradiction with `C1` or `C2`; it's merely redundant information.\n\nSince no contradiction arises from resolving around `q`, we need to consider the resolution of `¬p` and `p`. Directly resolving `C1` and `C2` on `p` and `¬p` yields `q ∨ q`, which simplifies to just `q`. This resolution step effectively combines `C1` and `C2` into a form that is equivalent to `C3`, indicating consistency and providing no contradiction.\n\nThus, the output of the resolution algorithm is not \"Implausible\" because no contradiction is found. Instead, the clauses are satisfiable. The algorithm iterates 1 cycle (considering the resolution of `C1` and `C2` on `p` and `¬p` as the necessary step towards checking for contradiction, which doesn't lead to one).\n\nTherefore, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n### Answer:\n[[Satisfiable]; [1]]",

This suggests that the presence of complementary literals is not necessary for resolution to be deemed possible in the context of these questions, but rather the absence of complementary literals would make resolution impossible.\n\n2. **Dispel Function**: The second question introduces a function `dispel(C1, C2)` that seems to take two clauses and generate new clauses by removing complementary literals between them. However, the output contains all possible combinations of literals from both clauses without actually removing any literal, suggesting that `dispel` is not about finding a unique minimal resolution but rather generating all possible combinations of literals from the two clauses.\n\n3. **Resolution Algorithm Output and Iterations**: The third question involves a logical formula `:p^(¬p∨¬q)^q`, where `:` likely stands for \"if\" based on the context (although in formal logic, `:` is not standard notation for implication; `→` or `⊃` is used). The resolution algorithm outputs \"Implausible\" after 2 iterations. This suggests that after two cycles, the algorithm detects a contradiction or an implausible outcome, possibly because `p` and `¬p` are both derived, along with `q` and `¬q`, which is a sign of inconsistency.\n\n4. **States of the Resolution Algorithm**: The fourth question asks for the states `S0`, `S1`, and `S2` of the resolution algorithm before the second cycle for a given formula.

The clauses `¬p ∨ ¬q` and `q ∨ ¬r` do not have complementary literals, but the resolution is answered as \"Yes\" (option A). This suggests that the resolution process is being considered in a broader sense, where the combination or further steps of resolution might involve these clauses, even if they themselves do not directly resolve.\n\n2. **Dispel Function**: The second question introduces a `dispel(C1, C2)` function, which seems to take two clauses and return all possible ways to combine them by eliminating a pair of complementary literals if present, otherwise, it appears to return the union of the two clauses with each possible pair of literals considered, regardless of complementarity.\n\n3. **Resolution Algorithm Output and Cycles**: The third and fourth questions ask for the output of the resolution algorithm and the number of cycles it iterates. The third question's formula `:p^(¬p∨¬q)^q` is implausible because it contains both `p` and `¬p`, indicating a contradiction. The resolution algorithm outputs \"Implausible\" and requires 2 cycles to determine this. The fourth question's formula involves several clauses that can be resolved to find a contradiction or plausibility. However, since the clauses involve both `q` and `¬q` and `r` and `¬r` without direct contradiction within a single clause, resolution might proceed to find plausibility through multiple steps.\n\nGiven these patterns, let's address the last question:\n\nFor `p∧(p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)∧(q∨¬r)∧(q∨r)`, the resolution algorithm would look for contradictions or resolve clauses to find a direct implausibility or plausibility. However, the given formula contains both `q` and `¬q`, and `r` and `¬r` within different clauses, which can lead to a contradiction if resolved properly. However, since there's no direct contradiction within a single clause or a pair of clauses without involving all the other variables, the resolution process would involve several steps to derive a contradiction, leading to an \"Implausible\" output. The process would take multiple cycles because it involves resolving at least `(q∨¬r)` with `(q∨r)` to eliminate `q`, and then combining the results with `(p∨q)` and `(p∨¬q)` to find a contradiction involving `p`.\n\nGiven the complexity and the requirement to resolve multiple pairs before finding a contradiction, the resolution algorithm would iterate more than the previous examples.

This gives us \\((\\neg q \\lor r)\\).\n\n4. **After First Cycle**: We keep all original clauses that were not involved in the resolution step and add the newly derived clause. Thus, \\(S2\\) contains \\(C1\\), \\(C3\\), and the new clause: \\(\\{p \\lor q, \\neg p \\lor r, \\neg q \\lor r\\}\\).\n\n### Answer Format:\n\\[[\\{\\neg q \\lor r, \\neg p \\lor r, p \\lor q\\}]\\]\n\nNote that the order of clauses within the set doesn't matter, as sets are unordered. The output format also suggests using set notation `{}` for the collection of clauses, with `∅` for an empty set, which doesn't apply here since we have derived a non-empty set of clauses.",

The output is \"Implausible\" if the given clauses lead to a contradiction, and the number indicates how many cycles (or steps) it takes to reach this conclusion or to resolve all possible pairs without contradiction.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nFor `(p∨q) ∧ (p∨¬q) ∧ (¬p∨r)`, what is the output of the resolution algorithm? How many cycles will it iterate? Please provide the answer in the format `[[output];[number]]`.\n\n### Answer:\n\n1. **Resolve `(p∨q)` with `(p∨¬q)`**: Since `q` and `¬q` are complementary, they can be resolved, leaving `p` as the resolved clause. No new clauses are generated here, as `p` already exists.\n\n2. **Resolve `(p∨q)` with `(¬p∨r)`**: We can resolve `p` and `¬p`, leaving `q ∨ r`.\n\n3. **Resolve `(p∨¬q)` with `(¬p∨r)`**: Again, resolving `p` and `¬p`, we get `¬q ∨ r`.\n\nAfter these steps, we have the following clauses: `{p, q ∨ r, ¬q ∨ r}`. There are no more complementary pairs between these clauses that haven't been resolved already. Thus, the algorithm stops with no contradiction found.\n\nThe output is not \"Implausible\" since no contradiction is derived. The number of cycles is `3` (one for each resolution performed).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n`[[p; q ∨ r; ¬q ∨ r];[3]]`\n\nNote that the output clauses are not simplified further because the question format seems to keep them distinct as results of each resolution step, and we directly counted the number of resolution steps as cycles.",

In each case, the expressions and predicates are applied within the context of the given set of entities and functions, and the answer is provided in a way that directly translates the formula into an expression that reflects the specific choices of functions and predicates given in each question part (a-d).\n\nGiven the question parts:\n\n(a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n(b) a′ = 0 .\n(c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n(d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nThe formula to implement under J is:\n∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y)\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n1. The predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n2. The function gJ(x, y) is defined as x * y.\n3. The constant a′ is given as 0, so any reference to a in the functions or predicates should be replaced with 0.\n\nApplying these to the formula:\n\n∀xF(g(x,a),x)→F(x,y)\n\nFirst, substitute a with 0 in g(x, a) to get g(x, 0), which, given gJ(x, y) = x * y, translates to x * 0, which is 0. So, F(g(x, 0), x) becomes F(0, x), and since FJ(x, y) denotes x = y, we have 0 = x.\n\nThe formula now reads:\n∀x(0=x)→F(x,y)\n\nSince for any natural number x, it is not the case that 0 = x (except when x is 0, but the formula is under a universal quantifier), the implication holds only if the consequent F(x, y) is true for all x. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n\n∀xF(x,y)\n\nGiven FJ(x, y) denotes x = y, this becomes:\n\n∀x(x=y)\n\nThis expression, however, is not fully resolved because y is a free variable. The original formula seems to imply that if for all x, x * 0 = x (which is not true universally except for x=0), then x = y. But since the antecedent is not universally true (except for x=0), the implication is somewhat vacuous for any x ≠ 0. However, the [[]] format seems to ask for a direct translation of the formula applying the given functions and predicates, without further logical simplification that might lead to a contradiction or vacuous truth. Thus, translating the formula directly, we focus on the implication structure and the application of FJ(x, y) in the consequent:\n\n[[∀x(x*0=x)→(x=y)]]\n\nAdjusting this to reflect that x*0 can never equal x for all x in N (except when x is 0), and acknowledging the unusual nature of the implication here, we might express the consequent in terms of the predicate given, aiming to stay as close to the original structure and intent as possible:\n\n[[∀x(F(g(x,0),x))→F(x,y)]]\n\nGiven g(x,0) = x*0 = 0, and F(x,y) means x=y, we can finally express the answer preserving the logical structure intended:\n\n[[∀x(F(0,x))→F(x,y)]]\n\nHowever, since the antecedent is only true when x is 0, and the consequent talks about all x being equal to y (which is a free variable and cannot be universally quantified in this context without further clarification), the formula's logical structure implies something that is neither generally true nor straightforwardly translatable without additional context for y. The spirit of the [[]] format seems to be about a direct translation, so understanding the logical oddity here, the answer aligning with the previous examples' pattern would be:\n\n[[∀x(x*0=x)→(x=y)]]\n\nOr, more directly and mechanically translating the formula parts into the expression, acknowledging the logical implications might not hold universally without further constraints on y:\n\n[[∀x(F(g(x,0),x)→F(x,y))]]\n\nThis final expression is the most technically accurate translation based on the formula parts, reflecting the structure of the original formula and the definitions of E, a′, fJ, gJ, and FJ, but it's important to note the logical and mathematical nuances at play here, particularly around the quantification and the nature of the implication under the given definitions.",

For the second formula, ∃xF(f(x,a),y)→∃yF(f(y,a),x), we apply the same substitution principles:\n\n   - fJ(x, y) = x + y\n   - a′ = 2 (so f(x,a) = x + 2)\n   - FJ(x, y) denotes x = y\n\n   Substituting these into the formula:\n\n   ∃x(x + 2 = y)→∃y(y + 2 = x)\n\n   However, the original formula is in terms of x and y without specifying what y is, so we can't directly simplify it based on x + 2 = y because y is not explicitly defined in the formula. The arrow (→) indicates implication, so the formula reads: \"If there exists an x such that x + 2 equals y, then there exists a y such that y + 2 equals x.\"\n\n   Since the formula is about existence and implication, we can't simplify it further without losing its intent, so the translation respects the structure:\n\n   ∃x(x + 2 = y)→∃y(y + 2 = x)\n\n   However, if we interpret y as just another variable without a specific value, then the formula is trying to express a relationship between x and y, and we could write it in a more simplified form just to express the relationship, though this is a bit of an interpretation:\n\n   ∃x(x + 2 = y)→∃y(x = y - 2)\n\n   But the original structure and intent are best preserved by:\n\n   ∃x(x + 2 = y)→∃y(y + 2 = x)\n\nThus, the final answer in the requested format [[];[]] is:\n\n[[∀x(x = x)]; [∃x(x + 2 = y)→∃y(y + 2 = x)]]\n\n(Note: The first part, ∀x(x = x), strictly follows the translation rule but simplifies the original formula's intent too much.

The second question involves identifying the relationship between two statements using specific symbols:\n   - A, B, C, and D represent different logical relationships.\n   - The relationships are between pairs of statements, not individual elements.\n\n3. The third question is about identifying the type of categorical proposition (SAP, SEP, SIP, SOP), where:\n   - SAP stands for \"Some S are P\" (particular affirmative).\n   - SEP stands for \"No S are P\" (universal negative).\n   - SIP stands for \"Some S are P\" (particular affirmative).\n   - SOP stands for \"Some S are not P\" (particular negative).\n\nApplying these rules to the last question:\n\n\"All mammals are warm-blooded animals.\"\n\n1.

[3] universally excludes the subject from the predicate, while [4] particularizes an inclusion of the subject in the predicate. This is a direct contradiction, similar to the first pair, but the form here is more akin to the contradiction between \"Some people are doctors\" (#1) and \"Some people are not doctors\" (#2), which was classified as **C** (&).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question in the given format is:\n\n[[B];[C]]\n\nThis means that the relationship between [1] and [2] is type **B** (#), and the relationship between [3] and [4] is type **C** (&).",

The second question and its answer show how to classify relationships between statements. The relationship between \"Some people are doctors\" ([1]) and \"Some people are not doctors\" ([2]) is **C**, which suggests they are subcontraries (they can both be true, but both cannot be false). The relationship between \"All people are doctors\" ([3]) and \"No people are doctors\" ([4]) is **B**, which suggests they are contradictories (one must be true, and the other must be false).\n\n3. The third question and its answer classify the type of categorical proposition \"No cats are dogs\" as **SEP** (Simple Exclusive Proposition), which is a universal negative proposition (no members of the subject class are members of the predicate class).\n\n4. The fourth question, \"All pencils are not pens,\" is a negative proposition because it denies the inclusion of the subject (\"pencils\") in the predicate (\"pens\"). However, it is not a universal negative proposition like the SEP, because it does not say \"no pencils are pens.\" Instead, it uses a construction that effectively means \"some pencils are not pens,\" given the nature of existential import in traditional logic (i.e., it implies the existence of at least one pencil that is not a pen). Thus, it is a particular negative proposition, which corresponds to **SOP** (Simple Overlapping Proposition).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the last question, asking for the type of proposition \"All pencils are not pens,\" is **[[SOP]]**.",

        "response": "To answer the last question, we first need to understand the rules and patterns from the previous answers. Let's analyze each question and its answer:\n\n1. **Identifying Parts of a Statement (S, P, C, Q)**\n   - **Question:** \"All birds can fly.\"\n   - **Answer:** `[[A];[C];[D];[B]]` denotes that in the statement structure, `A` (birds) is the subject `S`, `C` (fly) is the complement `C`, `D` (can) is the qualifier `Q`, and `B` (all) is the predicate `P`.\n\n2. **Relationship Between Statements (1, 2, 3, 4)**\n   - **Question:** Asks for the relationship between statement pairs.\n   - **Answer:** `[[C];[B]]` suggests that the relationship between [1 ] and [2 ] is `C`, and between [3 ] and [4 ] is `B`. Without explicit definitions of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` in this context, we infer that `C` likely represents a form of contradiction or difference, as [1 ] and [2 ] are contradictory (\"Some people are doctors\" vs. \"Some people are not doctors\"). Similarly, `B` represents another form of relationship, possibly a direct contradiction, given that [3 ] and [4 ] state opposite universal conditions (\"All people are doctors\" vs. \"No people are doctors\").\n\n3. **Type of Proposition**\n   - **Question:** Asks for the type of the statement \"No cats are dogs.\"\n   - **Answer:** `[[SEP]]` indicates that the statement is a type of SEP proposition, which means \"No S are P\" (in this case, \"No cats are dogs\").\n\n4. **Truth Values Based on Other Propositions**\n   - **Question:** Asks for the truth values of related propositions based on the truth of certain given propositions.\n   - No direct answer is provided, but we can infer the logic:\n     - If SAP (Some A are P) is true, then SOP (Some A are not P) must be undetermined without more information, but given the typical logical interpretations, it would generally be considered false, as SAP's truth usually precludes the possibility of SOP under the same conditions.\n     - If SIP (Some A are P) is true, then SEP (No A are P) must be false, as they directly contradict each other.\n     - If SIP is false, then SEP could be true, false, or undetermined, depending on whether any A exists and what proportion is P. However, under strict logical interpretations, knowing only that SIP is false doesn't necessarily imply that SEP is true, but it doesn't strictly imply it's false either. Without further information, we might lean towards undetermined, but given the binary choice, the implication might be towards true since if there's no evidence of some being true, then the possibility of none being true opens up.\n     - If SOP (Some A are not P) is false, then SAP (Some A are P) must be true, as SOP's falsehood implies that all A could potentially be P.\n\nGiven these analyses, the answer to the last question, based on the inferred logic and patterns, should be:\n\n### Answer for the Last Question:\n`[[false];[false];[true];[true]]`\n\nThis answer follows the logical implications of the relationships between SAP, SEP, SIP, and SOP propositions based on their truth values and the standard interpretations of categorical propositions.",

The first question is about identifying parts of a sentence that express a universal affirmative proposition in a specific order. The answer format is a list of options from a given set.\n\n2. The second question is about identifying the relationship between pairs of statements. It uses a different set of options, each representing a type of relationship.\n\n3. The third question is about identifying the type of categorical proposition from a given statement. It uses a specific format for the answer.\n\n4. The fourth question is about the truth values of categorical propositions based on the truth values of others. It requires understanding the relationships between the types of propositions (SAP, SEP, SIP, SOP) and their truth values.\n\nGiven the pattern, the last question seems to be asking for the truth values of propositions based on the truth values of other related propositions, similar to the fourth question. However, the format expected in the answer is not explicitly stated but should follow the pattern of the fourth question, which is a list of `true` or `false` values for each condition.\n\n### Answer to the last question:\n\n- If the proposition SIP is false, then the proposition SOP is `true`. This is because SIP (\"Some S are P\") and SOP (\"Some S are not P\") are subcontraries, meaning they cannot both be false, but can both be true. If one is false, the other must be true.\n\n- If the proposition SOP is false, then the proposition SIP is `true`. This follows from the same reasoning as above.\n\n- If the proposition SAP is true (\"All S are P\"), then the proposition SEP (\"No S are P\") is `false`. SAP and SEP are contradictories; they cannot both be true or both be false.\n\n- If the proposition SEP is true, then the proposition SAP is `false`. Again, this follows from their contradictory relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the expected format is:\n\n```\n[[true];[true];[false];[false]]\n```\n\nThis format is consistent with the fourth question's answer format, providing the truth values for each condition based on standard logic relationships between the types of categorical propositions.",

Let's analyze them:\n\n1. **Question 1** (All birds can fly):\n   - The answer format and the provided answer suggest a direct correspondence between the components of the original statement and the letters A, B, C, D. Here, A corresponds to the subject (birds), C to the predicate (fly), D to the copula (can), and B is not used in this context.\n\n2. **Question 2** (Relationships between statements about people and doctors):\n   - The symbols *, #, &, % are used to represent different types of relationships. From the answer, we can infer that the relationship between \"Some people are doctors\" and \"Some people are not doctors\" is represented by &. Similarly, the relationship between \"All people are doctors\" and \"No people are doctors\" is represented by B. This suggests that & represents a contrast or contradiction (since \"Some...are\" contradicts \"Some...are not\"), and B represents a direct contradiction (\"All...are\" contradicts \"No...are\").\n\n3. **Question 3** (Statement about \"No cats are dogs.\"):\n   - The statement is classified as an SEP proposition, which stands for a type of categorical proposition where the subject (cats) is excluded from the predicate (dogs). This follows the standard categorization of categorical propositions: A (universal affirmative), E (universal negative), I (particular affirmative), and O (particular negative). The provided statement is a universal negative (E) proposition because it universally denies the predicate of the subject.\n\n4. **Question 4** (Relationship between statements about computer typing):\n   - We are asked to determine the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C. Student B said, \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer,\" which is a particular affirmative (SIP) proposition. Student C said, \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer,\" which is a particular negative (SOP) proposition. These statements are not directly contradictory; they can both be true at the same time (some know how to type, some do not), which is a characteristic of particular propositions. Based on the pattern established in Question 2, the relationship between these two statements is contrasting but not contradictory, similar to the relationship between \"Some people are doctors\" and \"Some people are not doctors,\" which was labeled as &.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C is &, and the answer should be:\n\n```\n[[&]]\n```",

Method A seems to negate the entire sentence by applying a \"not\" to each part, essentially creating a double negative that logically converts the statement into its logical inverse. For example, \"All algorithms are efficient\" is transformed to \"[All algorithms are] [not non-efficient]\", which simplifies to \"All algorithms are not inefficient\" (i.e., all algorithms are efficient, preserved in a negative form).\n\n2. Method B appears to swap the subject and object of the sentence, keeping the structure largely intact but changing what is being described about what. For example, \"Some apps are free apps\" is transformed to \"[Some free apps are] [apps]\", essentially focusing on the nature of the apps as being part of the larger category of apps.\n\n3. Method C seems to change the sentence's quantifier and negate the object, effectively rewording the sentence to convey the same meaning in a different structure. For example, \"No social media platforms are private\" is transformed to \"[Some non-private platforms are] [social media]\", changing the \"No\" to \"Some non-\" and moving parts of the sentence around, but keeping the original meaning.\n\nGiven the transformation from \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" to \"All people who are not upright and open are not true revolutionaries,\" the method used involves changing the quantifier (\"All\" to \"All... not... are not\"), negating the subject (\"true revolutionaries\" to \"not true revolutionaries\"), and altering the structure to focus on the characteristics of the subject rather than the subject itself (i.e., what qualities apply to people versus starting with the group \"true revolutionaries\"). This aligns most closely with Method C's pattern of altering quantifiers, negating elements, and restructuring the sentence while retaining its meaning.",

This is a logical conversion where the original statement is rewritten in a way that emphasizes the negation of the opposite of the property, but the meaning remains logically the same.\n\n2. **Method B** takes a sentence in the form \"Some X are Y\" and switches the positions of X and Y to form \"Some Y are X\". This maintains the original meaning since the quantifier \"some\" is symmetric in this context.\n\n3. **Method C** takes a sentence in the form \"No X are Y\" and changes it to \"Some non-Y are X\". This is a logical transformation where the original statement is converted into one that emphasizes the existence of X among things that are not Y, which is logically equivalent.\n\nGiven the sentence \"All correct reasoning is formally correct reasoning\", we are asked to identify which method should be used to infer a proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.

The second answer, `[[A]]`, fills in the blank in `S()M ∴SAP` to make it `SAM ∴SAP`, which follows the rule that if something is predicated of all of a term (M) and then another term (S) is predicated of that term (M), then the second term (S) is also predicated of the third term (P) in the same way (All S is M, All M is P, therefore All S is P).\n\n3. The third answer, `[[A];[P]]`, fills in the blanks in `MOP M()S ∴SO()` to make it `MOP MAS ∴SOP`, which indicates that if something (M) is predicated of only part of another term (P) and then a third term (S) is predicated of all of the first term (M), then the third term (S) is predicated of part of the second term (P) (Some M is P, All M is S, therefore Some S is P).\n\nNow, applying these patterns to the last question:\n\n`()AP MI() ∴SIP`\n\nHere, we have `AP` as the first premise, indicating that All is affirmed of P. The second premise starts with `MI`, indicating that M is related to something else in an affirmative way. The conclusion is `SIP`, indicating that Some is affirmed of P.\n\nTo fit the logical flow:\n\n- The first blank should be filled with a term that, when affirmed of P, leads to the conclusion that Some S is P.

Thus, the first blank should be `A` for \"All\", making the first premise `AAP`.\n\n- The second blank should be filled in a way that connects M to S or P in an affirmative manner, considering the conclusion.

The third question, \"MOP M()S ∴SO()\", is answered with `[[A];[P]]`.

For an O conclusion, the premises must contain at least one negative premise (E or O), and the middle term (M) must be distributed at least once. Since the conclusion is negative, one of the premises must be negative. Given that our options are MAP (universal affirmative for P->M) and SAM (or SOM for particular), the only way to introduce negation that fits the observed patterns is to have the second premise be negative (E) and the first premise remain affirmative.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n- For P()M, since P is affirmed of all M, this should be an A proposition.\n- For M()S, to introduce the necessary negation and ensure a valid syllogism that concludes with an O proposition, this should be an E proposition.\n\nThus, the answer is `[[A];[E]]`.

This follows the second figure, where `M` is the predicate in both premises, resulting in a mood of AAI, but the conclusion's quality is particular (P) because the minor premise is affirmative.\n\nNow, let's apply the logic to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nPlease fill in the parentheses below\nMIP\nM()S\n∴S()P\n\nProvide the answer in the format of [[];[]].\n\nTo solve this, we need to determine the missing term between `M` and `S`, and the quality of the conclusion between `S` and `P`.\n\n- The premise `MIP` tells us that the middle term `M` is distributed in the major premise as the subject with a particular affirmative proposition (I).\n- The conclusion `∴S()P` indicates that we are looking for a particular conclusion, as the middle term does not distribute both premises universally.\n\nGiven the premise `MIP`, and knowing that `M` is the subject in the major premise, the figure is likely to be the first (I) or third (III). However, since the conclusion must be particular and the minor premise must have `M` as the predicate to align with the pattern we've seen, we can infer the figure is the first (I).\n\n- In the first figure, to have `M` as the predicate of the minor premise, the minor premise must be `MAS` to allow for a particular conclusion (since `M` is not distributed in both premises), which is consistent with having `MIP` as the major premise and `SAP` as the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the missing term is `A`, and the conclusion's quality is `P`, following the pattern of having a particular conclusion due to the distribution of the middle term.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[P]]",

Given the use of \"cannot\" in \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour,\" and the instruction to use \"p\" for \"Science is a human endeavour,\" we can infer that we're dealing with a negation of the original proposition. The task is to express \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" in a format that reflects the impossibility (or necessity of the opposite) of the event, mirroring how \"cannot possibly not\" was handled in the third example.\n\nGiven these patterns, to symbolize \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" using \"p\" for \"Science is a human endeavour,\" we need to capture the necessity (or impossibility) of \"p\" (considering a \"one-man endeavour\" is the opposite of a \"human endeavour\" in this context). The use of \"$\" in the first example suggests a possibility, which doesn't fit the necessity we're expressing here. Instead, we need a symbol that represents necessity or impossibility, similar to the inference in the third example where necessity was implied.\n\nAssuming \"@\" in the options for relationships in the second example implies a necessary relationship (given \"B\" represents contradiction, and there's often a set of symbols for different modal relationships in such exercises), and considering the format and logic used in the examples:\n\n- The statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" suggests it's necessarily not a one-man endeavour, or necessarily a human endeavour (given our symbol \"p\" denotes \"Science is a human endeavour\").\n- We would typically use a symbol or prefix that indicates necessity for this, and given the set of symbols used in the relationship classification (A, B, C, D), \"@\" seems to be a reasonable candidate if it represents a necessary relationship or inference.\n\nThus, following the pattern and given the conventions seemingly at play here, the answer for symbolizing \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" using \"p\" for \"Science is a human endeavour\" and inferring \"@\" to represent necessity would be:\n\n### Answer:\n[[@p]]\n\nThis format expresses the necessary truth of \"p,\" which directly corresponds to the necessity implied in \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour.\"",

They are not contradictory but rather the certainty statement implies the possibility, suggesting a `B` relationship if `B` were to mean a form of implication or a subset relation, or an `A` relationship if `A` represents a form of compatible inclusion (since the possibility statement is a weaker form included in the certainty statement).

Given the format `[[]]` and applying the rules, the answer would be:\n\n### Answer:\n[[p][‽q]]\n\nThis format places `p` inside the brackets to affirm the statement about reasonable collisions in football and applies `‽` to `q` to negate or indicate the prohibition of collisions in movies.",

The relations `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` likely stand for different logical connections between pairs of sentences. From the answer `[[B]]` given for the second question, we can infer that `B` relation likely represents a contradiction or negation between the two sentences (since one allows an action and the other does not allow the same action).\n\n3. The answer `[[1]]` to the third question suggests that there's a direct inference between an obligation to perform an action and the prohibition of not performing that action. This points to a deontic logic rule where obligation and prohibition are logically linked.\n\n4. For the fourth question, we need to identify the relations for each pair of sentences based on the previous understanding:\n\n   - For the pair \"In public places, smoking is prohibited.\" and \"In public places, smoking is mandatory.\" These sentences are contradictory, as one mandates an action and the other prohibits it. This matches the pattern observed in the second question, where we identified the `B` relation representing contradiction or negation.\n\n   - For the pair \"Not fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" and \"Fulfilling the contract is allowed.\" These sentences are not directly contradictory in the logical sense identified earlier. However, given the context and the understanding that `B` relation represents a form of negation or contradiction in terms of permission or obligation, and since these two sentences effectively negate the obligation or necessity of the other (if not fulfilling is allowed, then there's no obligation to fulfill, and vice versa), we can infer that they also represent a `B` relation, albeit in a slightly different manner compared to the first pair.\n\n### Answer:\n\nGiven these observations, the answer to the last question should be:\n\n`[[B];[B]]`\n\nThis indicates that both pairs of sentences are related by the `B` relation, which, based on the previous examples, represents a contradiction or logical negation in the context of permission, obligation, or prohibition.",

The relation `B` is used to describe the relationship between \"It is allowed to take breaks during working hours.\" and \"Taking breaks during working hours is not allowed.\" These sentences are logical inverses of each other, one affirming what the other denies.\n\n3. The answer `[[1]]` suggests that there is a direct inference between \"There is an obligation to study\" and \"It is not allowed to not study.\" This points to a rule where there's a logical equivalence between obligation statements and their negative counterparts prefixed with \"It is not allowed to not...\" This likely corresponds to the deontic logic rule where obligation (`O`) is equivalent to the prohibition of the negation of the act (`P~`), or `O p ≡ P ~p`.\n\n4. For the last question, we are asked to determine the relationship between pairs of sentences. The first pair deals with the protection of citizens' rights, where one affirms an obligation and the other suggests that the opposite action (not protecting) is allowed. This is similar to the relation described in point 3, where there's a logical contradiction between affirming an obligation and stating its violation is permitted. This should be classified as relation `B`.\n\nThe second pair discusses caring for the growth of the next generation. One states it is mandatory, and the other says it is allowed. These are not contradictory; instead, the second statement is a weaker form of the first. If something is mandatory, it is necessarily allowed, but the converse does not hold. This relation, where one statement is stronger (mandatory) and the other weaker (allowed), does not fit the pattern of direct contradiction (`B`) or the other explicitly described relations (`A`, `C`, `D`). However, given the context and absence of a better fit among the provided options, and considering the principle of charity in interpretation, we might infer that this is not a direct relation of inference or contradiction but rather one of implication where the stronger statement implies the weaker one. Yet, since `D` seems not yet defined explicitly in the examples, and considering there's no perfect match among `A`, `B`, and `C` for this relation, we might tentatively assign `D` to this second relation, understanding it as a relation of implication or entailment where the stronger statement entails the weaker.\n\nThus, the answer follows the format `[[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]]` and based on our analysis, it should be:\n\n### Answer:\n`[[B];[D]]`\n\nThis assumes a speculative interpretation for `D` as a relation of entailment or implication, given the context and the lack of a perfect fit among the explicitly defined options for the second pair of sentences.",

The inference relationship between \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" and \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" is asked in the last question. Here, we see a similarity in structure between the statements about widows and the earlier example about studying.

The correct inference is that if an action is prohibited, its negation (not performing that action) is implicitly allowed.\n\nGiven these rules, let's apply them to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nAccording to Modal Reasoning Formula 10, what can be deduced from \"loud noises are prohibited in the reading room\"?\n\nA: Disallow not making loud noises in the reading room.\nB: Allow not making loud noises in the reading room.\nC: Prohibit not making loud noises in the reading room.\nD: Prohibit making loud noises in the reading room.\n\nThe statement \"loud noises are prohibited in the reading room\" directly corresponds to option D, which explicitly states the prohibition of loud noises.

Given the previous examples and the structure of the answers, we can infer that each letter (A, B, C, D) represents a different type of relationship. Since 'B' was used for the negation relationship in the second answer, and considering the pattern and the fact that Modal Reasoning Formula 7 seems to involve a specific modal relationship (given its numbering), it is reasonable to assume that each letter corresponds to a distinct modal relationship. The options are '*', 'x', '@', '%' relationships, and we've already used 'x' for negation. The question about Modal Reasoning Formula 7 does not suggest a simple negation but rather a specific modal relationship, which is likely to be distinct from the previous ones. Therefore, the answer should be one of the remaining symbols, and given the progressive nature of the questions and answers, '@' (option C) seems to be the next logical choice for a specific modal reasoning formula that is neither a simple negation ('x') nor the obligation-permission relationship ('B').\n\nThus, the answer for the last question, based on the pattern and the types of relationships introduced, is [[C]], indicating that Modal Reasoning Formula 7 conforms to the '@' relationship.",

The second example introduces a classification of relationships between two sentences, where \"A\" is chosen as the relationship between \"The company will launch a new product in the future\" and \"The company will not launch a new product at some point in the future.\" Without further context, we can assume \"A\" stands for a logical relationship such as contradiction or opposition, as the two statements negate each other.\n\n3.

However, since we are using \"p\" for ordinary propositions and are asked to use the same format, we can infer that this should be symbolized in a way that reflects the past, but since it's a general statement about the past without a specific duration, we can use \"Hp\" to represent it happened in the past, parallel to the first example's usage, but noting it's different in nature from the first proposition in this question.\n\nThus, the answer for the last question, following the given format [[];[]], would be:\n\n[[Hp];[Hp]]\n\nThis symbolization is based on the examples provided, where \"Hp\" is used for past events, and the distinction in the nature of these past events (specific duration vs. general past fact) is not explicitly differentiated in the symbolization due to the constraints of the format and the examples given.

Using the established pattern, this would be represented as `Gp`.\n\n2. **Xiao Qian will permanently settle in England.** This statement is about a future event, but it implies a continuous or ongoing state rather than a specific event at a point in time. It's about a future period that extends indefinitely. Given the pattern, this doesn't perfectly fit the `Gp` notation (since `Gp` is used for a defined period), but it's not about a specific point either, so it's not `Hp`. However, since `Gp` is the closest and is used for future events, we might infer that in the context of these options, it would be represented as `Gp`, understanding it as a future state that extends over time.\n\nThus, the answer following the pattern would be:\n\n`[[Gp];[Gp]]`\n\nThis is an educated guess based on the patterns provided, acknowledging that the second proposition's representation might vary in a more nuanced logical framework, but within the constraints set by the examples, `Gp` seems to be the best fit for both.",

This suggests a convention where `H` prefixes refer to specific points in time, and `G` prefixes refer to periods.\n\n2. **Identifying Relationships Between Sentences**:\n   - The relationship marked as `※` in the format `[[A]]` suggests a direct contradiction or negation between the sentences. This is because the first sentence talks about a future event happening, and the second sentence negates that event happening at some point in the future.\n\n3. **Canonical Reasoning Formula**:\n   - The identification of a specific formula, `[[9]]`, suggests a rule or principle that captures the logical transition from a general statement to a more specific instance. In this case, from \"The city was experiencing a lot of rain in the past\" to \"At some point in the past, the city experienced a lot of rain.\" This transition is from a general past condition to a specific instance within that past, which could correspond to a principle of instantiation or specification.\n\nGiven these patterns, let's address the final question:\n\n> What relationships do the following sentences have?\n\n(1) \"Old Li's health was good in the past\" and \"At some point in the past, Old Li's health was not very good\"\n\n(2) \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and \"Allow the execution of contracts\"\n\nFor (1), the first statement makes a general claim about Old Li's health in the past, while the second statement contradicts it by specifying a point in the past where this general claim does not hold.

Similarly, \"They will move to a new house during a future period\" is symbolized as `Gp`, where `G` likely stands for a future event.\n\n2. **Relationship between Sentences**: The relationship between \"The company will launch a new product in the future\" and \"The company will not launch a new product at some point in the future\" is classified as `A`, which could stand for a contradiction or an opposite relationship since one sentence affirms a future event and the other negates it.\n\n3. **Canonical Reasoning Formula**: The inference from \"The city was experiencing a lot of rain in the past\" to \"At some point in the past, the city experienced a lot of rain\" is identified as formula `9`, which suggests a generalization from a continuous past event to a specific past instance.\n\n4. **Inference from a Past Statement**: Given reasoning formula `5`, we are to infer from \"Lao Chen has always worked diligently in the past.\" The options are:\n   - A. It is not that Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past.\n   - B. Mr. Chen has always been serious about his work in the future.\n   - C. Mr. Chen will start working seriously in March next year.\n   - D. Mr. Chan has not been working seriously in the past.\n\nFrom the context of formula `5` and the given examples, formula `5` likely deals with consistency or persistence over time. Since the statement affirms Lao Chen's diligence in the past, the inference should be consistent with this information. Option A negates the negation of the original statement, essentially affirming Lao Chen's past diligence, which aligns with the idea of persistence or consistency. Option B projects the statement into the future without sufficient ground, while option C specifies a future event without a clear link to the past context, and option D directly contradicts the given statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the patterns observed and the inference logic, the correct answer that aligns with reasoning formula `5` is:\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\nThis choice reaffirms the original statement in a way that is consistent with the idea of a past persistent condition.",

Given the context, this likely represents a contradiction (e.g., \"A and not A\" at the same time) or an uncertain relationship due to the conflicting futures described.\n\n3. The third question-answer pair points to a specific reasoning formula, \"9,\" which connects a general past condition (\"The city was experiencing a lot of rain in the past\") to a specific past instance (\"At some point in the past, the city experienced a lot of rain\"). This suggests that formula \"9\" likely deals with general statements in the past implying specific instances in the past.\n\n4. The fourth question-answer pair refers to \"Reasoning Equation 21\" and asks what can be deduced from a future-oriented statement.

For `c2`, the condition `φ` being true at some point in the future after execution implies a conditional relationship where the effect (truth of `φ`) might depend on additional factors or timing but is still guaranteed by the system.

In the second scenario, the reduction in blood pressure is observed in both patients who took the new drug and those who did not, but shared the same lifestyle, suggesting that the lifestyle factor, rather than the drug, might be the cause of the reduction in blood pressure.

In the last scenario, the discovery of Neptune involved calculating the effects of known objects on Uranus's orbit and then observing a deviation from the expected orbit. This deviation led to the inference that an unknown object (Neptune) was causing the gravitational disturbance. This method involves observing a discrepancy between expected and observed outcomes and inferring a cause for that discrepancy. This is similar to the first scenario where a common factor (Training Program X) was inferred to be the cause of observed improvements.

This process of inferring an unseen cause from residual effects (the discrepancy between predicted and observed orbits) is characteristic of the residual method, which was mentioned in the question as the method used in the discovery of Neptune.

Here, we have a situation where two accepted hypotheses lead to a logical contradiction, similar to the third question where two premises led to the LS Paradox. \n\nThus, applying the pattern observed, the paradox in this last question is the LS Paradox, as it involves a logical contradiction arising from accepted hypotheses.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]",

This suggests that when two seemingly beneficial conditions for an outcome contradict each other, it points to the GB Paradox.\n\n2. The second question describes a situation where a researcher's hypothesis is contradicted by new observations.

This suggests that when logical consequences of observations lead to a contradiction with a stated hypothesis, it points to the LS Paradox.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the last question:\n\n- The scenario involves a universal statement about all x where if R(x) then B(x), and the simultaneous truth of R(a) and B(a) for a specific case.\n- The logical equivalence ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) ≡ ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)) is stated, which is a logical principle and does not inherently suggest a paradox.\n- However, the key part is ¬B(b) ∧ ¬R(b) → ∀x(R(x) → B(x)), which suggests that even when B(x) and R(x) are both false for some b, the universal statement ∀x(R(x) → B(x)) should still hold. This is a form of the LS Paradox, as it involves a logical contradiction in the implications of the observations and the universal statement that is supposed to hold based on those observations.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern and the information provided, the scenario in the last question best fits the LS Paradox.\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]",

This principle is not observed in the question about love and liking, as the response does not provide additional marked information about the process of feeling, but rather provides a direct answer with a weaker statement that implies the stronger statement is not true.\n\nTherefore, based on the patterns observed in the examples, the C* Principle best fits the situation described in the last question.",

It is about inferring a not-entirely-positive conclusion from a non-committal statement.\n- **C% Principle:** This principle appears to involve drawing conclusions based on indirect information or implications, such as inferring the existence or state of something from an action or request related to it. It is about making inferences from indirect hints.\n- **C! Principle:** This principle seems to concern the use of marked or lengthy expressions that provide additional, often non-essential, information beyond what is asked or required. It is about going beyond the call of the question to add emphasis or context.\n\nIn the last question, B's and C's responses do not directly answer A's question about completing the project on time. Instead, they describe the state of the project's progress. C's response, in particular, uses a euphemistic and optimistic expression (\"essentially wrapped up the project\") that implies a high likelihood of success while leaving some room for unforeseen additional work. This response gives an indirect indication of the project's status by focusing on the level of completion rather than a definitive yes or no to the question at hand.

Principle**: This principle seems to involve the use of a marked, lengthy expression that provides extra information or background, implying a non-standard or challenging process to the outcome stated.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the last question:\n\n### Question:\nThe baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up. → The mother is the baby's mother. (Attributive inference type)\n\nThis statement involves an inference from the behavior (the mother picks up the crying baby) to a relationship (the mother is the baby's mother). There is no vagueness, non-directness, or marked expression providing additional context beyond the inference. The inference is directly from the action to a relationship, which is a standard, straightforward attribution without the need for additional information to explain the action.\n\nGiven the understanding of the principles, this scenario does not fit neatly into any of the provided principles as it stands. However, if we consider the broader context and the type of inference described as \"Attributive inference type,\" this scenario might be seen as implicating a relationship that is not explicitly stated, based on typical or expected behavior. This is somewhat akin to the C% Principle, where an implicit inference is made based on the context, but it's not about a precondition for an action as much as it is about inferring a relationship from observed behavior.\n\nGiven the constraints of the principles as understood from the examples and the need to choose one, the closest fit would be the **C% Principle**, as it involves drawing an implicit conclusion from the situation described. However, this is a nuanced application, as the examples for C% Principle provided were different in nature, focusing on preconditions for actions rather than inferring relationships.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]] (Assuming the question seeks to apply these principles in a manner that fits best the examples provided, even with some nuance.) \n\nIf the principles were strictly defined and none perfectly fit the scenario due to the nature of the inference, then we might conclude that none of the principles exactly match. However, given the structure of the task and the need to select one, C% is the closest fit based on the implicit inference made from the observed behavior to a conclusion not explicitly stated.",

This conforms to the **C* Principle**, which involves implicature or indirect speech.\n\n2. **Second Example**: \"Please open the gift box.\" → The gift has a box. This is a straightforward inference that since the person is asked to open the box, there must be a box to open. This inference is based on the literal meaning of the statement, suggesting a conventional or literal interpretation. This conforms to the **C% Principle**, which involves conventional or literal meaning.\n\n3. **Third Example**: B's response, \"I finished the report,\" is a direct and conventional answer, indicating that B has successfully completed the report. In contrast, C's response uses a lengthy and marked expression to emphasize the hardships encountered during the process, providing extra information and background. This is an example of using a marked expression to convey additional meaning beyond just the literal completion of the report. This conforms to the **C!

The third question and answer pair demonstrates that when a definition is derived from a specific source or quote, it is classified as \"B. ℓ Definition.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these patterns to the last question:\n\nThe definition of \"Internet\" provided is a combination of transliteration and partial translation, explaining the term's origin and its global nature. This definition does not follow the pattern of a legal or formal process, nor does it list examples to illustrate the concept. Instead, it leans towards explaining the term itself by providing its linguistic derivation.\n\nTherefore, following the pattern established in the third question and answer pair, the definition of \"Internet\" would most likely be classified under \"B. ℓ Definition\" since it describes the term's origins and meaning rather than providing a mathematical formula, a set of examples, or a conceptual framework.\n\nSo, the answer to the last question is:\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\nPlease note that the symbols and letters used in the format (e.g., \"ℵ,\" \"ℓ,\" \"∇\") do not directly correspond to the patterns we've identified from the given examples.
