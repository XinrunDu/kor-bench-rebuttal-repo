It does not use other connectives like implication (\\(\\rightarrow\\)) or equivalence (\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form is a formula where every propositional variable appears an even number of times. This means that if a variable \\(p\\) appears in the formula, it must appear 2, 4, 6, etc., times.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's reason through the problem:\n\n- A formula with 4 propositional variables (let's call them \\(p, q, r, s\\)) can be constructed using only the basic connectives AND, OR, and NOT.\n- For the formula to be an all-even form, each of the 4 variables must appear an even number of times. The simplest way to ensure this is to have each variable appear exactly twice (since 2 is the smallest even number greater than 0).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations:\n- We can pair each variable with itself (e.g., \\(p \\land p\\), \\(q \\land q\\), etc.), which satisfies the all-even condition.\n- Alternatively, we can pair different variables (e.g., \\(p \\land q\\), \\(r \\land s\\)), but this might complicate the formula structure.\n\nHowever, the simplest method is to pair each variable with itself. This ensures that each variable appears exactly twice, satisfying the all-even condition.\n\nGiven this, the simplest basic form that meets the all-even condition for each variable is:\n\\[ (p \\land p) \\land (q \\land q) \\land (r \\land r) \\land (s \\land s) \\]\n\nThis formula is a basic form because it uses only the AND and NOT connectives, and it is an all-even form because each variable appears exactly twice.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly **one** formula that satisfies both conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

The derived statement \"Dr Lee has been working on farms at some time in the past\" is a more general assertion that captures the same idea but with less specificity (\"in the past\" vs. \"at some time in the past\").\n\nThis type of inference is a form of generalization, where a specific statement is made more general without losing its essential meaning. The logical structure here involves taking a specific temporal property (\"in the past\") and reducing it to a more general one (\"at some time in the past\"), while retaining the core assertion about Dr. Lee's activities.\n\nThe inference formula that corresponds to this process is typically captured by a form of logical generalization or existential quantification. Specifically, it might be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\exists t \\in \\text{Past} : \\text{Dr Lee worked on farms at time } t \\]\n\nThis formula asserts that there exists some time \\( t \\) in the past such that Dr. Lee worked on farms at that time. This matches the derived statement's meaning.\n\nTherefore, the inference formula that corresponds to the given statement and its derivation is:\n\n[[1]] Generalization or existential quantification.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified logical explanation, and the exact structure of the inference formula might vary depending on the specific logical system or framework being used.",
