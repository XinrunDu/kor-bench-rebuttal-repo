Since the pattern seems to repeat every nine numbers, I'll assume it's a rotation of 9.\n\nFirst, let's convert the numbers to alphabetic characters. Keep in mind that the ASCII values for numbers are higher than those for letters, so we'll add 26 to each number to bring the numbers back to the range of letters:\n\n35 + 26 = 61 (A)\n13 + 26 = 39 (P)\n45 + 26 = 71 (S)\n21 + 26 = 47 (G)\n43 + 26 = 69 (I)\n14 + 26 = 40 (D)\n53 + 26 = 79 (M)\n12 + 26 = 38 (N)\n24 + 26 = 50 (Z)\n44 + 26 = 70 (F)\n13 + 26 = 39 (P)\n5 + 26 = 31 (T)\n\nNow, I'll rotate each character nine places to the left. However, since the rotation goes beyond the beginning of the alphabet, I'll wrap around to the end:\n\nA (from 61) becomes O (61 - 9 = 52)\nP (39) becomes F (10 + 39 = 49)\nS (71) becomes T (71 - 9 = 62)\nG (47) becomes H (47 + 9 = 56)\nI (69) becomes B (69 - 9 = 60)\nD (40) becomes C (40 + 9 = 49)\nM (79) becomes L (79 - 9 = 70)\nN (38) becomes K (38 + 9 = 47)\nZ (50) becomes Y (50 - 9 = 41)\nF (70) becomes E (70 - 9 = 61)\nP (39) becomes R (18 + 39 = 57)\nT (31) becomes S (19 + 31 = 50)\n\nNow, let's convert the numbers back to their ASCII values and join the results:\n\nOATSHBCEMYREST\n\nFinally, I have to address the fact that this technique should be used with a regular English dictionary, as the number of rotations (9) seems too large for common English text to still make sense. Consider that this method treats each character as an independent shift. If it were an actual cipher, you'd also need to consider spaces, punctuation, and capitalization to get a correct solution.\n\nIn light of all these limitations, the decrypted text for your ciphertext would be: [[OATSHBCEMYREST]].

It works by shifting the letters by some constant value. To solve this, let's start by trying a shift of 1, the second letter in the English alphabet.\n\nCiphertext (Shift 1): \"EBPMZDAAFNM\"\n\nComparing the ciphertext to the normal English alphabet, we don't see many recognizable words, so the shift is not likely to be 1.\n\nLet's try a shift of 2:\n\nCiphertext (Shift 2): \"CTQLOYSBAKLN\"\n\nHere, we can potentially see \"CT\" and \"LB\", which don't correspond to any known common English words. So let's try a shift of 3 instead:\n\nCiphertext (Shift 3): \"SZNERPZODJKM\"\n\nComparing this to the English alphabet, we find some recognizable letters and words such as \"SZ\" and \"M\". Continuing this analysis, words like \"NPN\" and \"RZD\" don't correspond to any common English words, and \"DJK\" is not an easily understandable English word either.\n\nNow, let's try a different approach: consecutive shifts of 1. We'll write each encrypted letter along with its corresponding decrypted letter:\n\nD (A) J (G) W (Q) N (J) C (D) Y (F) E (E) V (V) V (N) N (B) B (I)\n\nTaking a close look at the correspondences between the ciphertext letters and their guessed decrypted letters, we notice some discrepancies, such as \"J\" and \"G,\" \"N\" and \"J,\" and \"B\" and \"I.\" However, if we shift each letter by -3 (backwards) instead of 1, we get the following:\n\nD (H) J (E) W (X) N (H) C (A) Y (R) E (D) V (W) V (T) N (S) B (O)\n\nWith consecutive shifts of -3, we find clearer correspondences between the ciphertext letters and decrypted letters, such as \"D\" and \"H,\" \"J\" and \"E,\" and \"B\" and \"O\". This suggests that this may be the correct decryption method.\n\nFor the final case, we sum every shift applied to the original ciphertext letters:  -3 + (-3) + (-3) + ... + (-3) = -(3 * 10) = 30. To find the actual decrypted letters, we subtract the sum of the shifts from the corresponding shift3 results, letter-by-letter:\n\nD: (H) - 30 = A\nJ: (E) - 30 = A\nW: (X) - 30 = R\nN: (J) - 30 = K\nC: (D) - 30 = R\nY: (F) - 30 = L\nE: (E) - 30 = A\nV: (V) - 30 = V\nV: (N) - 30 = M\nN: (S) - 30 = D\nB: (O) - 30 = C\n\nHence, [[RA-LA-RK-DR-RL-LA-VA-VM-MD-C]] is the decrypted answer.",

For a repeating-key XOR cipher, the key repeats after its length. In this case, we can use a short, non-repeating key for simplicity.\n\nFor example, let's try key \"AB\" (65 and 66 in ASCII):\n\nKey: [65, 66]\n\n```\n547898898\n^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^\n65 - 65 - 62 - 65 - 65 - 62 - 65 - 65 - 62 - 65 - 65\n59  -  1  3  -  5  -  1  -  3  -  5  -  1  -  3\n```\n\nSince XOR is commutative, we can see that all digits from the ciphertext XOR'd with 65 result in ASCII numbers from 59 to 64. As ASCII values range from 33 to 126, these values are equivalent to numbers from 6 to 9, which if you concatenate the resulting digits for each ciphertext digit, you get:\n\n[[1 2 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1]]\n\nAgain, this might be a coincidence, and there may be other possible solutions for this cipher.

For example, A is replaced with Z, B with Y, C with X, and so on.\n\nNoticing that the given cipher text consists of only numbers and doesn't fit any conventional number-based ciphers, I assumed the text was a numerical representation of the alphabet.\n\nTo convert these numbers back to letters:\n- 27 corresponds to the 5th letter from the end of the alphabet, which is G.\n- a corresponds to the 1st letter from the alphabet, which is A.\n- d corresponds to the 4th letter from the alphabet, which is D.\n\nSo, arranged in order, the decrypted text is \"GAD\". The original message in English could be a name, so a possible answer could be [[GAD (name)]]. However, without more context, it's hard to determine exactly which name it could be. Further investigation would be required to determine the specific name.",

However, without knowing the encoding/cipher, it's difficult to provide an accurate response. Common encryption methods include Caesar Cipher (shift), Base64, Rot13, etc. If you have more details about the encryption method, I'd be able to help better.\n\nIn case you provide the encryption method, I can try to decode the given plaintext for you. For instance, if it's a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3, the decoded message would be: \"MERRYCHRISTMAS\". But as mentioned earlier, without knowing the specific encryption method, this is not currently possible.\n\nIf you need help with basic decryption methods like Caesar Cipher or atbash cipher, feel free to ask!\n\n[[[Encrypted answer not provided, as the encryption method is unknown.]]]",

Here's the result:\n\n[[I love you]]\n\nThe reasoning for this is as follows: when converting the hexadecimal string to ASCII, we get the string \"Il ov y\". The spaces were omitted because they don't have a hexadecimal representation in this form. However, as English text, it's proper to have spaces between words.
