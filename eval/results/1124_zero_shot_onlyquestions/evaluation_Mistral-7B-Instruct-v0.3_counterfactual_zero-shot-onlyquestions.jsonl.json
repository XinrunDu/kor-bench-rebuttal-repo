However, since this question asks for a fictional scenario, it is not appropriate to apply real-world principles. As a result, I can't provide a definitive answer based on the given options.\n\nIn fictional scenarios, the methods used for violation control can vary greatly and are not always as straightforward as carrying a gun with you or using magical devices like the sling ring.

It also stimulates the production of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters and painkillers. Regular exercise can help increase your energy levels overall. However, it's important to find a balanced approach and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns about starting an exercise regimen.
