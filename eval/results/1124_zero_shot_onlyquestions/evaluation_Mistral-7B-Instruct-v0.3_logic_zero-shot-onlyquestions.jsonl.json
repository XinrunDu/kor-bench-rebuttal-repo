Since both \\sqrt{3} and 5 are irrational, the proposition is true.\n\n(3) This proposition is a bit more complex. The negation of the proposition (\"Exactly one of \\sqrt{3} and 5 is not irrational\") would be represented as [[~p3 && ~p4]]. However, since \\sqrt{3} and 5 are both irrational and it's not possible for both to be non-irrational at the same time, this negation would be a false statement. Therefore, the original proposition (\"Exactly one of \\sqrt{3} and 5 is irrational\") is a true statement. Its logical representation would be the negation of its negation, or [[~(~p3 && ~p4)]]. This simplifies to [[p3 && p4]], but since we're dealing with negations, we can negate this back to [[~(p3 && p4)]], which is equivalent to [[p3 || p4]]. However, since we want to represent \"Exactly one\", not \"At least one\", we need to add the restriction that if one is true, the other must be false. This can be done with the \"XOR\" operator, represented as \"^\" in some logical systems. So, the final representation of this proposition would be [[p3 ^ p4]]. This shows that exactly one of \\sqrt{3} and 5 is irrational, as neither can be both irrational or non-irrational at the same time.",

The third formula is the converse implication.\n\n(3) Only 4 being even makes 5 even (material implication): When the truth of one statement implies another, but not necessarily directly. \"4 being even is the only factor that makes 5 even.\" The second formula represents the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n(4) 4 is even if and only if 5 is odd (biconditional or iff): When two statements are equivalent, both true and false at the same time, or one implies the other. \"4 is even if and only if 5 is odd\" means that both statements are true at the same time.

Since M is part of the first figure (I), and S is part of the third figure (III) but we need two premises with the same figure, we move S from the III figure to the II figure to have two premises in the I figure.

Contraposition states that if A implies B, then not-B implies not-A. Applying the contraposition rule to statement 3, we get:\n\n3'.
