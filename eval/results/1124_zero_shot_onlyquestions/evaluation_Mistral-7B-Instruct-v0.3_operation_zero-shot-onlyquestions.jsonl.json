This equation does not apply in this situation.\n\n2) When 42 is a multiple of 14, we have a = 42 and b = 14. The rule gives us 14 ※ 42 = 42 / 14 + C = 3 + C. But since 14 ※ 42 = 4, we have 3 + C = 4, so C = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, since 14 is not a multiple of 42, we cannot use the rule in its current form to calculate C. Instead, we can use the fact that 14 ※ 42 = 4 and whenever a is not a multiple of b, b is not a multiple of a, a [control_96]istrzewicza 42 becomes C. The reasoning is as follows: when a is not a multiple of b, b is not a multiple of a, a äst b = 24. Therefore, since 14 is not a multiple of 42, 42 äst 14 = 24, and because we know that 14 äst 42 = 4, we can conclude that 24 = 42 - 4 * (42 / 14), which gives us C = 42 - 4 * 3 = 42 - 12 = 30.

Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   - (X⊕2) + (1⊕3) means ((X XOR 2) XOR (1 XOR 3))\n   - Since XOR is associative (A XOR (B XOR C) = (A XOR B) XOR C), we rearrange the equation like this: (X XOR 2) XOR ((1 XOR 3))\n\n3. Evaluate XOR operations:\n   - For (X XOR 2), since XOR is the same as adding for 0,1 and subtracting for 2 values, X XOR 2 equals X - 2 (modulo 2) or X + 2 for the binary representation if X is 0, 1 or 2. This can also be written as 2X - 2\n   - For (1 XOR 3), since 1 XOR 3 equals 2, this is 2\n\n4.

Consider the right side of the equation, 4 + 5i. Since this is a complex number, we'll need to have a complex solution.

Let's simplify the imaginary part of the equation since we know i * i = -1 and the imaginary part on both sides should equal each other.\n\nThe imaginary part is 3i, so either side with real numbers should be zero because, on the left side, the number should be equal to a real number minus another real number, while on the right side, it is exactly 3i.

In binary form, where 0 represents false and 1 represents true, XOR results in 1 if the two inputs are different and 0 if they are the same.\n\nMultiplication and addition hold the same mathematical properties, so we will simplify the given equation by calculating each operation separately first.\n\n1. Solve for (2⊕3):\nsince 2 in binary is 10 and 3 in binary is 11, ⊕ results in the binary representation of the number where the two inputs differ: the first bit (journal or carry) is inverted, and all subsequent bits are copied. Thus, 2⊕3 = 1 (binary), or 1 in decimal form.\n\n2. Solve for (1⊕X):\nWe don't know X's binary representation yet, but since we want to find X, we assume X is one bit at a time. We can find the binary representation by calculating XOR recursively with 1 until we get a number we already know or reach a base case (X=0).\n\nUsing the residue method: if X is even, X⊕1 will be odd, and if X is odd, X⊕1 will be even. If X⊕1 equals the value we have already calculated (1), then it means that the bit we are calculating is different from the bit in that position in the binary representation of 1.\n\nSo, in order to find X's binary representation, we keep XORing 1 with X until we get 1 again. If X is initially odd, we will is X⊕1 = 0 once (getting an even number), and if X is even, we will keep XORing 1 with X until we get 1 (getting the 1 from the first bit flip).\n\n3. Solve for the multiplication and addition step by step:\nSince we don't know X's binary representation yet, we assume it as a binary number initially and set it equal to the multiplication result to find its value:\n\n(1) * (X) = -10 + 11i\n\nwhere X is given in binary form: X = X_n * 2^n + X_(n-1) * 2^(n-1) + ... + X_1 * 2^1 + X_0\n\nRecall that when multiplying Boolean values with 0 and 1, respectively, it equals 0 and the original value, and when adding complex numbers, it follows the regular addition rules: a + bi + c + di = (a + c) + (b + d)i\n\n4. Simplify the equation and find X:\n\n(1) * (X) = (-10 + 11i)\n\n(1) * (X_n * 2^n + X_(n-1) * 2^(n-1) + ... + X_1 * 2^1 + X_0) = (-10 + 11i)\n\nNoticing that the multiplication of 1 with each individual bit power presents an absurd case where taking any power of 1 would still be 1. We want the sum of these multiplication parts to equal -10 for the real part and 11 for the imaginary part.\n\nConsidering each term in the sum:\n\n-EXAMPLE:\nIf X = 1010, we have:\n1=(-10) + 2*(-10) + 2^2*1 + 2^3*0 + 2^4*0 = 1\nbut remember that the real part should be -10. We can see that this value doesn't work.\n\n-EXAMPLE:\nIf X = 10011, we have:\n1=(-10) + 2*0 + 2^2*1 + 2^3*0 + 2^4*1 = -4 + 4i\nAlthough the imaginary part is close, the real part is not -10.\n\nNow let's find X as follows:\n\na) Consider X_n (most significant bit in the binary representation): multiplying 2^n with 1 equals 0, whether we add it to the real part or the imaginary part, it doesn't affect our goal of reaching -10 and 11. Thus, we can discard it.\n\nb) Now use the residue method again, but this time, use it to find the position of the most significant odd bit (if it exists). Start by XORing 1 with the initial odd number we have found (1, in this case) since an odd number always has an odd parity, and an even number has an odd parity. Continue XORing 1 with the current result (that is odd itself) until you get another odd number that doesn't repeat. This will represent the position of the first odd bit.\n\nIf the result is 1, it means that the two bits are the same, so we'll increment X_n by 1 and keep searching for the next odd bit.\n\nIf the result is odd, it means that the two pieces of the representation differ, so we found the first odd bit. In this case, the bits should alternate between 0 and 1 starting from that position and for the remaining bits.\n\nc) After finding the position of the first odd bit (X_n), choose X_(n-1) in such a way that multiplied by 2^(n-1) results in adding 5 to the real part (-10+5=-5). Do the same thing for the rest of the bits to finalize X.\n\nIn this case, considering the position of the first odd bit (e.g., X_3) and following the given example, we can find the binary representation of X, which gives us:\n\nX = 10011\n\nPlugging X back into the equation, we can verify that X solves the given equation:\n\n(1) * (X_3 * 2^3 + X_2 * 2^2 + X_1 * 2^1 + X_0) = (-10 + 11i)\n(1) * (0*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1) = (-10 + 11i)\n(1) * (2) = (-10 + 11i)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n[[X = 10011]] or [[X = 13]] in decimal form.",
