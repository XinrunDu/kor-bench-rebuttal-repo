Common digit \\( Z \\) must be even.\n\nOne possible solution is:\n\n- \\( N = 4 \\)\n- \\( U = 9 \\)\n- \\( M = 2 \\)\n- \\( B = 2 \\)\n- \\( E = 8 \\)\n- \\( P = 9 \\)\n- \\( Z = 4 \\)\n\nSo the assignment would be:\n\n\\[ [[N=4, U=9, M=2, B=2, E=8, P=9, Z=4]] \\].\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[ 49228 + 49228 = 98456 \\]\n\nThis satisfies the equation NUMBER+NUMBER=PUZZLE.",

One is by Rubicorp and one is by Techtrin.\n2. The Cornick is not developed by Rubicorp since if it were, it would launch in March, and that contradicts point 3, where Athios launches 1 month before the Cornick.\n3. Therefore, the Cornick is made by Techtrin and launches in March.\n4. Athios, therefore, launches in February since it is 1 month before the Cornick (March).\n5. The rocket developed by Rubicorp is neither the Cornick nor the one that launches in March. Hence, Rubicorp's rocket launches in April, given that no other conditions contradict this.\n6. The Gralax will launch 1 month after Rubicorp's rocket, which places it in May, but we only need to consider up to April based on the output requirements.\n7. The Exatris is developed by SpaceZen. Since no other rockets are specified for January, it must launch in January.\n\nSo, let's list the entries in chronological order:\n- Exatris (January, SpaceZen)\n- Athios (February, unknown but not specified in the question)\n- Cornick (March, Techtrin)\n- Rocket (April, Rubicorp)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[[January SpaceZen Exatris, February Athios, March Techtrin Cornick, April Rubicorp]]",

We know that Rosalie and the Haynes Inc. hire (Cynthia) were hired on March 18th and March 21st, but we don't know which date goes to which person yet.\n2. Rosalie was hired 3 days after the Green & Hayes hire. Since there's no other information about the Green & Hayes hire, we need to deduce the hiring date for Rosalie first.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- Rosalie was hired 3 days after the Green & Hayes hire.\n- One date is March 18th, and the other date is March 21st for Rosalie and Cynthia.\n\nSo, if Rosalie were hired on March 18th, the Green & Hayes hire would have been on March 15th. If Rosalie were hired on March 21st, the Green & Hayes hire would have been on March 18th. But March 18th is already taken by either Rosalie or Cynthia, so Rosalie must have been hired on March 21st, and the Green & Hayes hire must have been on March 18th.\n\nSince we know Cynthia was hired by Haynes Inc. and the hire on March 18th cannot be Rosalie, it must be Cynthia.\n\nSo here is the order of entries:\n- March 12th: (No information given, so this entry will be left empty)\n- March 15th: Green & Hayes hire\n- March 18th: Cynthia Haynes Inc.\n- March 21st: Rosalie (no firm mentioned)\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n[[12th , , ], 15th Green&Hayes , , 18th Cynthia HaynesInc , 21st Rosalie , ]]",

Therefore, the number directly above 4 should be 42 (since 42 - 4 = 38).\n\nLet's continue with this pattern and fill in the missing numbers:\n\nFor the second column:\n```\n2\nX\n5\n14\n33\n```\nThe difference between X and 5 should be 33. Therefore, the number directly above 5 should be 38 (since 38 - 5 = 33).\n\nFor the third column:\n```\n6\nX\nX\n3\n34\n```\nThe difference between X and 3 should be 34. Therefore, the number directly above 3 should be 37 (since 37 - 3 = 34).\n\nFor the fourth column:\n```\nX\n1\n13\nX\n31\n```\nThe difference between X and 13 should be 31. Therefore, the number directly above 13 should be 44 (since 44 - 13 = 31).\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid with the numbers we've found:\n\n```\n42  38  37  44  33\n4  X  X  1  26\nX  5  X  13  42\nX  14  3  X  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\n\nContinuing to fill in the remaining X's based on the same pattern:\n\nFor the second row, first X (after 4):\n```\n4  X  X  1  26\nX  5  X  13  42\nX  14  3  X  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\nThe difference between X and 5 should be 14. Therefore, the number directly above 5 should be 19 (since 19 - 5 = 14).\n\nFor the second row, second X (after 19):\n```\n4  19  X  1  26\nX  5  X  13  42\nX  14  3  X  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\nThe difference between X and 1 should be 34. Therefore, the number directly above 1 should be 35 (since 35 - 1 = 34).\n\nFor the third row, first X (after 4):\n```\n4  19  35  1  26\nX  5  X  13  42\nX  14  3  X  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\nThe difference between X and 14 should be 31. Therefore, the number directly above 14 should be 45 (since 45 - 14 = 31).\n\nFor the third row, second X (after 45):\n```\n4  19  35  1  26\nX  5  45  13  42\nX  14  3  X  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\nThe difference between X and 3 should be 33. Therefore, the number directly above 3 should be 36 (since 36 - 3 = 33).\n\nFinally, we have the complete grid:\n```\n42  38  37  44  33\n4  19  35  1  26\n45  5  45  13  42\n42  14  3  36  35\n38  33  34  31\n```\n\nWrapping the final answer in double square brackets:\n\n[[42  38  37  44  33, 4  19  35  1  26, 45  5  45  13  42, 42  14  3  36  35, 38  33  34  31]]",

For simplicity, let's first simplify and solve with positive sums.\n\n### Simplest Assumption and Initial Check:\n\nTo find a starting solution, we assume values as:\n- X values should sum to respective targets.\n\nRefinements and solving iteratively through trial lead to:\n\n\\\\[\n\\text{X11 = 15, X12 = ?, X13 = ?, X14 = ?, X15 = ?, X16 = 13}\n]\nOverall approach involves setting and solving cumulatively:\n\n**Final Grid Assuming Simplified Sums**:\n\\\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n  6 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  3 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n  5 & 4 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\\\\n  4 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n  7 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\\\]\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n```\nStarting Row:\n6 3 2 3 1 1\n3 1 2 2 3 1\n5 4 2 1 1 3\n4 2 3 3 2 1\n7 1 2 3 2 3\n0 0 0 0 0 10\n```\n\nEncapsulating final answer:\n```\n[[\n6 3 2 3 1 1,\n3 1 2 2 3 1,\n5 4 2 1 1 3,\n4 2 3 3 2 1,\n7 1 2 3 2 3,\n0 0 0 0 0 10\n]]\n```\n\nThis solution encodes potential space-adhering linear set sums for respective constraints assessed.",

However, if we look at the ends of each row, we see an increasing pattern down the columns:\n- The first number of each row: 35, 32, 29, 22, 19, 2, and 1.\n- The last number of each row (excluding X): 51, 56, 79, 80, 81, 70, and 71.\n\nGiven this information, the pattern is not immediately clear, so let's attempt to fill in the missing numbers by extending the observed trends.\n\nLet's start by filling in the numbers in the rows based on the provided values:\n\nSecond row:\n- 35, 34, 43, 42, 47, 50, 51\n\nThird row:\n- 32, [31, 40, 39, 44, 47, 48], 56\n\nFourth row:\n- 29, [28, 37, 36, 41, 44, 45], 79\n\nFifth row:\n- 22, [21, 30, 29, 34, 37, 38], 80\n\nSixth row:\n- 19, [18, 27, 26, 31, 34, 35], 81\n\nSeventh row:\n- 2, [1, 10, 9, 14, 17, 18], 70\n\nEighth row:\n- 1, 8, 11, 14, 65, 68, 71\n\nNow, let's fill in the numbers in the grid:\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\nX  35  34  43  42  47  50  51  X\nX  32  31  40  39  44  47  48  56  X\nX  29  28  37  36  41  44  45  79  X\nX  22  21  30  29  34  37  38  80  X\nX  19  18  27  26  31  34  35  81  X\nX  2  1  10  9  14  17  18  70  X\nX  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n\nThe final filled grid, listing the numbers from left to right and top to bottom, is:\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X,\nX  35  34  43  42  47  50  51  X,\nX  32  31  40  39  44  47  48  56  X,\nX  29  28  37  36  41  44  45  79  X,\nX  22  21  30  29  34  37  38  80  X,\nX  19  18  27  26  31  34  35  81  X,\nX  2  1  10  9  14  17  18  70  X,\nX  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X,\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n\nWrapping the final answer in double square brackets:\n```\n[[X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X,\nX  35  34  43  42  47  50  51  X,\nX  32  31  40  39  44  47  48  56  X,\nX  29  28  37  36  41  44  45  79  X,\nX  22  21  30  29  34  37  38  80  X,\nX  19  18  27  26  31  34  35  81  X,\nX  2  1  10  9  14  17  18  70  X,\nX  1  8  11  14  65  68  71  X,\nX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X]]\n```",

The sequence of numbers in the second row suggests a repeated operation:\n   ```\n   X  71  X  75  X  53  X  49  X\n   ```\n   There doesn't seem to be an immediate arithmetic sequence, as 71, 75, 53, and 49 do not follow a simple progression or regression.\n\n2.

The sequence from the first row alternates between two groups:\n    - Group 1: 19, 18, 11, 10 decreases by 1 until it hits a reset point.\n    - Group 2: 79, 80, 73, 72, 71 mixes increasing and decreasing numbers.\n\n2.

The last column decreases sequentially with some gaps:\n    - 70, 69, 68, 67, 62, 61, 56.\n\nBased on these observations, we should try to fill in the numbers by following the patterns identified.

Let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the first row\nThe first row has a fixed value `4` in the first position and `1` in the third position. Let’s denote the X values in the second and fourth positions as `X1` and `X2`:\n```\n4 X1 1 X2\n```\n### Step 2: Analyze the second row\nThe second row has a fixed value `3` in the last position. We denote the X values in other positions as `X3`, `X4`, `X5`, and `X6`:\n```\nX3 X4 X5 X6 3\n```\n### Step 3: Analyze the third row\nThe third row has a fixed value `2` in the third position. We denote the X values in other positions as `X7`, `X8`, `X9`, and `X10`:\n```\nX7 X8 2 X9 X10\n```\n### Step 4: Analyze the fourth and fifth rows\nThe fourth and fifth rows have no fixed values, all positions are denoted as `X11` to `X15` in the fourth row and `X16` to `X20` in the fifth row:\n```\nX11 X12 X13 X14 X15\nX16 X17 X18 X19 X20\n```\n### Step 5: Determine the values of unknowns\nGiven the general constraints and without any additional rules or givens, it is hard to determine specific values for the remaining X positions. Thus, we simplify to best-case matching or viewed by common matrix numeric patterns.\n\nIf we were to further assume or reference, we'd require additional fixed points or given sum rules.

Let's fill in the third row first:\n   - 2, 2, X, 4, X\n   - Since '4' is 2x2, the next logical step is '6' (3x2), which fills the missing spot:\n   - 2, 2, 6, 4, X\n\n3.

The only 4-letter empty spaces are:\n   - (0,1) to (0,4)\n   - This fits because each row can start from column 0.\n\n   FAR can only fit into a 3-letter space horizontally.
