This means that every 8th letter of the plaintext will form a group, and each group will be shifted by 4 places in the alphabet.\n\nGiven that the ciphertext is \"A\", which is the first letter of the alphabet, we apply the increment directly after accounting for the period. Since A is the first letter, and we are applying a shift of 4, we loop the alphabet and add 4 to the position of A.\n\nTo find the shift:\n- A is 1st in the alphabet.\n- Adding 4 to 1 gives us 5.\n\nNow, to find the plaintext letter that corresponds to this ciphertext letter, we：\n1. Identify the shift as 5 positions from A (which is the first letter).\n2. Locate the letter on the alphabet that is 5 positions from \"A\".\n3. In the cycle given by the period (considering only the part of the alphabet that fits into 8 letters), we are essentially interested in a position that represents \"A\" in the sequence of every 8th letter considering the increment.\n\nGiven there are 8 positions, each 1 letter apart, when considering a group (8th line), we are essentially splitting the alphabet to view it as a sequence in this unique way. \n\nShift `4` can be analyzed as:\n- In the context of a single cycle (for a clearer view): A->E\n- Considering the specific method as if it were a form of modulus operation (as it were applied every 8th letter) while looking for correlation in the overall alphabet due to incrementing the shift method across lines (objectively represented cyclically considering the text as continuous):\n- `A` to `E` places context around 4 positions shifting in a repetitive yet logically separated view according to the given constraint.\n\nSince the increment is applied cyclically over 'A' (where 'A' maps to every 8th letter considering logical position, seen as the starting point when the pattern is modular and cycled based on the instruction rather than physically breaking the alphabet into 8 sections for each letter),\n- As we make a complete cycle (considering going forward in the alphabet with the increment applied cyclically across 'A' to represent where 'A' logically maps in the pattern), 'A' in this scenario (controlling cycle accordingly within given constraint for the start) maps to:\n\nConsidering cycles:\n- Imagine a visual cycle or a conceptual diagram where 'A' marks the start, but in each cycle, 'A' itself shifts in mapping, having its position incremented by the stated 4. 'A' logically maps directly here in our concept for simplicity, referencing existing - not physically transforming vertically within a section but understanding 'A' as starting a complete sequence in this pattern that is effectively propagated as cyclic across the alphabet.\n\nGiven this analysis from the conceptual function of incrementing a position every 8th cycle (considering 'A' as a reset in a conceptual underline for this problem’s specific style of mapping back to the alphabet's first letter to direct a pattern position, seemingly circularly referenced due to its foundational shape with respect to the defined parameters across letters applied periodically through the alphabet but understood here with 'A' as a base.):\n\nTherefore, in decryption, while considering theoretically:\n- The original mapping of pattern as starting at 'A' corresponds 'A' with the listed increment shifting formula leading back to 'A' since the positions loop around, conceptually reaffirming 'A' as the decryption when applied into understanding the mirrored implication upon initial instruction into decryption logic effectively tangent on the algebraic rotation of 'A', considering how the encoded shift of a '4' when first analyzed (from the analogue perspective) remains relative within its decrypted form following the request since:\n- The initial principle of decryption invoking 'A' as the cipher's starting point under designed parameters corresponds directly to maintaining 'A' in the decrypted state given the constraints laid out specifically, as the instruction’s key parameters direct effectively on circular or relative rotating patterns of decipherment.\n\nThus considering the direct application across conceptual implementation to guide decryption in line with specification:\n\nThe **decrypted answer** is **[[A]]**.",

The presence of numbers and special characters suggests that this might be a custom substitution or a mix of various substitution methods.\n\nAssuming a naive approach where we replace each unique character with the next character in the alphabet, the decryption process would be as follows:\n\n1. \"RE\" becomes \"SF\",\n2. \"#\" becomes \"&\",\n3. \"*\" becomes \"(\",\n4. \"TYY\" becomes \"VZZ\",\n5. \"XO\" becomes \"YQ\",\n6. \"FD\" becomes \"HH\",\n7. \"YO\" becomes \"ZO\",\n8. \"*\" becomes \"(\",\n9. \"X\" becomes \"Y\",\n10. \"D\" becomes \"F\",\n11. \"#/3MQR\" (with \",\" replaced and then applied the substitution cipher to the string \"MQR\") becomes \"@/5NTS\".\n\nThis is only a speculative decryption based on a simple substitution cipher and might not match the intended solution. Therefore, the decrypted answer would be incoherently represented, and cannot be reliably determined beyond the assumption here.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the format requested in the question, the \"decrypted answer\" might not actually make sense given this speculative method.

The provided ciphertext appears to be encrypted using a Caesar cipher with some non-alphabetic characters present, which could be part of a keyword or simply a placeholder. However, without knowing the exact shift used, we can only provide a general decryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a specific number of places in the alphabet.\n\nSince I cannot see the shifting pattern, I will provide a step-by-step decryption using a few likely methods:\n\n1. **Character and Number Separation**: Separate numbers and actual characters. Numbers might indicate shift sizes or positions, while characters need to be decrypted.\n\n```plaintext\nBF#V#Z#H#*FS#XF#N#D#SC#*ET#Z#Y#K#NU#CB#*SK#S#R#Z#MG#F#*P#V#D#*\n```\n\n2. **Keyword Possibility**: Not provided, but could influence decryption.\n\n3. **Caesar Cipher Decryption**: Assume each letter is shifted back by a certain number.\n\n4. **Manual or Automated/Online Solution**: I typically use a Caesar cipher decryption tool or manually try shifting letters. However, without specific tools or knowing common shifts, I'll manually try common shifts.\n\nLet's manually shift letters back by 1, 2, and 3:\n\n**Shift by 1**:\n```\nAI#W#Y#G#*FT#G#M#C#RB#*DS#T#X#B#LU#DA#*TI#T#U#G#ME#E#*O#W#C#*\n```\n\n**Shift by 2**:\n```\nCI#X#Y#E#*FU#H#L#A#RC#*DT#U#W#I#LV#EB#*UI#S#V#F#NF#F#*P#X#B#*\n```\n\n**Shift by 3**:\n```\nEI#V#X#B#*FO#K#I#Y#QB#*CV#T#T#E#LZ#DA#*TF#R#W#D#MH#E#*N#Z#A#*\n```\n\n5. **Decryption Attempt**: Looking for meaningful English words, some shift might be more plausible than others based on English words' frequency in common decrypts.\n\nGiven the manual nature of the attempt and lack of automation, I will assume an intuitive shift might reveal the answer. Typically, we would use a decryption tool or encryption logic more rigorously.\n\n**Intuitive Attempt**: Let's try a shift of 3 manually as a common starting point:\n\nDecrypted text: `EI V X B *FO K I Y Q B *CV T T E LZ DA *TF R W D MH E *N Z A *`\n\nConsidering common English words and cryptic patterns, the structure suggests common English words. Let's correct grammar and punctuation for readability:\n\n`EVS speculate * C.annotation *`\n\nPossible meaningful decrypted text: **[EVS speculate: C.annotation]**\n\n**Important:** This plaintext is highly speculative and manually derived from the given ciphertext. Actual decryption would require decryption tools or algorithms that use the context and shifts accurately. UFC or similar organizations do not publish their websites with the given structure or content based on the decrypted text. The actual decryption should be verified with decryption algorithms.",
