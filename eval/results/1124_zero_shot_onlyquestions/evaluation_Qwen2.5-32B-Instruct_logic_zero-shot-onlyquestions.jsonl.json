The implication p>q is equivalent to !p|q (the contrapositive form). So, p>(p|q) is equivalent to !p|(p|q). Since (p|q) is True whenever p or q is True, it follows that !p|(p|q) is always True because if p is False, !p is True and the whole expression is True. If p is True, then (p|q) is True, so !p|(p|q) is True. Therefore, !(p>(p|q)) simplifies to !True, which is False. So, the entire expression !(p>(p|q))&r simplifies to False&r. Since False&r is False, the simplest result is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[\\text{False}; \\text{False}]} \\]\n\n### Expression (2): p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)\n\nThe original expression can be simplified by focusing on the inner expression first: ((p|q)&!p)>q. Looking at ((p|q)&!p):\n- (p|q)&!p is True only if both parts are True. However, if !p (the negation of p) is True, then p must be False, and thus (p|q) simplifies to (False|q), which just simplifies to q. Therefore, ((p|q)&!p) simplifies to (q&!p).\n- So, the expression ((p|q)&!p)>q simplifies to (q&!p)>q. Using the equivalence that (a>b) is equivalent to !a|b, (q&!p)>q simplifies to !(q&!p)|q, which simplifies further to (!q|!(!p))|q, which is equivalent to (!q|p)|q.\n- The expression (!q|p)|q simplifies to p|q because !(q|!p) is logically equivalent to (!q|p), and by adding the '|' with q, it encompasses all possibilities, simplifying to p|q (since the disjunction covers all cases where p is True or q is True).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression p&(((p|q)&!p)>q) simplifies to p&(p|q). Since p&(p|q) is logically equivalent to p, the simplest result is just p.\n\\[ \\boxed{[p; p]} \\]\n\nThis is based on the simplification rules and equivalences in logical expressions.",

However, the right side (p>(q|r)) suggests that if p is true, then either q or r (or both) must be true.\n\nIn classical propositional logic, the left side ((p>q)&(p>r)) is equivalent to p>(q&r), not (p>(q|r)), because for both conditions to hold when p is true, q and r must both hold true. Hence, there's an inherent difference: one requires both q and r to be true if p is, whereas the other requires merely one of q or r to be true if p is. Thus, the equivalence in (1) is not valid according to the 16 Basic Equivalences.\n\nNext, look at the second equivalence:\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nThe symbol “=” often denotes biconditional (if and only if), and “!” indicates negation. So, !(p=q) would mean that p and q are not equivalent, i.e., either p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true.\n\nOn the right side is (p|q)&!(p&q). This means p or q is true, but not both, which indeed captures the essence of saying p and q are not equivalent. Therefore, this statement aligns with the concepts found in the 16 Basic Equivalences, marking this equivalence as valid.\n\nCombining both findings:\n\n- The first equivalence is invalid (B).\n- The second equivalence is valid (A).\n\nThus, the answer is [[B];[A]].",

For example, in arithmetic, both addition and multiplication are associative.\n\n1.

In other words, no matter what values (true or false) are assigned to the variables, the tautology evaluates to true.\n\n3. **Basic Form**: This term isn't standard in logic; however, in the context of this question, it might refer to a simple or canonical tautology. A simple or canonical tautology for propositional logic that uses all variables could be an expression that always evaluates to true regardless of the variables' truth assignments.\n\nGiven that formula A has 4 propositional variables and is a tautology, one simple tautology would be a disjunction that includes a variable and its negation, such as (p ∨ ¬p), for each variable. However, since the question asks for a basic form and A is supposed to include all four variables, a common basic form that is both a tautology and includes all four variables could be a disjunction of each variable and its negation. Thus, a form such as (p ∨ ¬p) ∧ (q ∨ ¬q) ∧ (r ∨ ¬r) ∧ (s ∨ ¬s) would serve as a simple and canonical tautology involving all 4 variables.\n\nHowever, because the question specifies \"basic form\" and a desired format, the answer might be looking for a single universal truth construct.

However, the term may vary in meaning depending on the context. For this answer, let's assume it means that the propositional variables can appear in any combination of negated and unnegated forms.\n\n- **All-even form**: This means that each propositional variable appears an even number of times within the formula. Given that we are talking about a formula that only contains the propositional variables in some form (negated or unnegated), achieving an all-even situation means having each variable pair up, or in the case of four variables, means each must appear either 0 or 2 times in some form (negated or unnegated).\n\nGiven that the formula contains 4 propositional variables, and must be an \"all-even form,\" we consider only configurations where each variable appears either not at all, or exactly twice. Since the logical connectives themselves don't concern this aspect of evenness, we focus on how these 4 variables can be paired up or not included at all.\n\nThe total number of such configurations can be calculated by determining the combinations in which each variable can be paired up. This is the same as figuring out how to partition 4 elements into sets of pairs, including the possibility of no elements being included.\n\nFor 4 variables (let’s name them A, B, C, D), we can have the following pair-ups (that's considering the variational independence):\n\n- All variables are paired: There’s only 1 such scenario, i.e., (AB)(CD).\n- Pairs can form for any pair of variables, with the others not appearing, leading to pairings like: (AB), (AC), (AD), (BC), (BD), and (CD). There’s a total of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) scenarios.\n- All variables do not have any pairings, i.e., they do not appear, leading to 1 scenario.\n\nAdding these, we get \\(1 + 6 + 1 = 8\\) scenarios where all variables either appear twice or not at all.\n\nThus, the number of such formulas is given by \\([[8]]\\).",

The C-Reasoning Rule typically focuses on identifying a collective attribute or feature across different subjects (in this case, schools).\n\nThe attribute 'student satisfaction' (F) varies in proportion in each school. Hence, to symbolize the 'whole', we combine the satisfied students and the total students from both schools into one calculation to understand the general satisfaction level.\n\nIn a general format, it would be symbolized as the combined satisfaction divided by the combined total number of students. So, in terms of representation:\n\n- Total satisfied students (F) from both schools = 180 + 210 = 390.\n- Total students (T) from both schools = 200 + 300 = 500.\n- Combined satisfaction [F] = 390 / 500.\n\nThus, symbolizing the 'whole' to denote combined student satisfaction:\n\n[[F = 390 / 500]]",
