For simplicity, let's assume we are dealing with DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form), which is a disjunction (OR) of conjunctions (AND) of literals.\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: An all-even form means that each clause in the DNF must contain an even number of literals.\n\nGiven that the formula contains 4 propositional variables, let's denote these variables as \\( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Counting Clauses with Even Number of Literals**:\n   - A clause can have 0, 2, or 4 literals to be even.\n   - For 0 literals, there is only one such clause: the empty clause.\n   - For 2 literals, we choose 2 out of 4 variables, and each chosen pair can be either positive or negative. The number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 is \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\). Each pair can be positive or negative, so there are \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) combinations for each pair. Therefore, the total number of 2-literal clauses is \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\).\n   - For 4 literals, we choose all 4 variables, and each can be positive or negative. The number of ways to choose 4 out of 4 is \\( \\binom{4}{4} = 1 \\). Each combination can be positive or negative, so there are \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) combinations. Therefore, the total number of 4-literal clauses is \\( 1 \\times 16 = 16 \\).\n\n2. **Counting DNF Formulas**:\n   - A DNF formula is a disjunction (OR) of these clauses. Each clause can either be included or not included in the DNF formula.\n   - The total number of possible DNF formulas is the sum of the number of ways to include or exclude each type of clause.\n\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the empty clause is \\( 2^1 = 2 \\).\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the 24 2-literal clauses is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n   - The number of ways to include or exclude the 16 4-literal clauses is \\( 2^{16} \\).\n\n   Therefore, the total number of DNF formulas is:\n   \\[\n   2^1 \\times 2^{24} \\times 2^{16} = 2^{1 + 24 + 16} = 2^{41}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n[2^{41}]\n\\]",

Therefore, \\( \\neg (\\neg p) \\) is true.\n6. **Therefore, p** - Since \\( \\neg (\\neg p) \\) is true, \\( p \\) must be true.\n\nThis is a classic proof by contradiction, where assuming the negation of the statement to be proven leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.
