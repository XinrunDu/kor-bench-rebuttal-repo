Start by dividing both sides of the equation by the product of the numbers multiplying X:\n\n(19 * 28 * 4 * 13) * X = 3 / (19 * 28 * 4)\n\nNow, to solve for X, divide both sides by the product of the numbers not involving X:\n\nX = 3 / (19 * 28 * 4 * 13)\n\nLet's calculate the value of X:\n\nX = 3 / (19 * 28 * 4 * 13)\nX = 3 / (19 * 364 * 4)\nX = 3 / (7016 * 4)\nX = 3 / 28064\n\nTherefore, X is a very small fraction.

Since the result of the operation is 4, and the operation's default outcome for non-multiple numbers is 24, we can infer that the operation was altered by the parameter C.\n\nThe rule for non-multiple numbers is: if a is not a multiple of b, and b is not a multiple of a, then a ※ b = 24.

Since this symbol is not a standard operator in basic arithmetic, algebra, or common mathematical functions, it's important to make an assumption about what this operation means, as the question does not provide a clear definition. \n\nA common interpretation of such symbols in puzzle-type questions is that they represent a specific operation or function. However, without a defined operation, we can't directly apply algebraic manipulation as we might to a standard equation like ax + b = c.\n\nLet's assume for the sake of solving this puzzle that \"∞\" represents some operation that, when applied to a number X with 5 as the operand, results in 41. Since the operation is not standard, we might approach this through guess and check with functions that could make sense in a mathematical context. However, given the lack of a standard interpretation, we'll use a creative approach by considering the operation might involve some sort of transformation based on the number 5 leading to 41.\n\nOne creative interpretation could be that the operation \"∞\" signifies a transformation function that, given the number 5, yields 41. A simple, albeit speculative, interpretation could be a function that adds a specific value to 5 to get 41. Given the simplicity and the need to bridge the gap from 5 to 41, a linear transformation seems a reasonable first guess.\n\nIf we interpret X∞5 = 41 as a linear transformation where X is the coefficient of this transformation with respect to the number 5, we can set up the equation:\n\nX * 5 + Y = 41\n\nHere, X represents the multiplication factor (or transformation coefficient), and Y represents any additional constant value needed to reach 41 from 5 through the operation defined by \"∞\". To find X, we need to understand what additional value Y is. Since we're looking for X given the equation results in 41, and given the simplicity of the operation, a straightforward approach is to reverse-engineer the operation without delving into complex functions.\n\nGiven the linear interpretation, to find Y, we subtract 5 from 41:\n\n41 - 5 = 36\n\nNow, we have:\n\nX * 5 = 36\n\nTo find X, we divide 36 by 5:\n\nX = 36 / 5\nX = 7.2\n\nSince the answer is expected as a number and the operation is not standard, the interpretation here is speculative, based on assuming a simple linear transformation.

Since 3.5 is not a whole number, we cannot directly apply the ♂ operation in the way we initially intended.\n\nGiven the rules as provided, and the condition that decimals are not allowed, we must interpret the operation's definition strictly within the context of whole numbers. Therefore, the operation 4 ♀3 = 3.5 is a singular instance that differs from the general rule defined for the ♂ operation, serving as a piece of input data that does not adhere to the typical form of the operation.\n\nGiven this strict interpretation, the operation 2 ♂(4 ♀3 ) is not directly computable using the ♂ operation's definition provided, as it requires a whole number input and inherently does not accommodate the decimal output of 4 ♀3 = 3.5 for subsequent operations with the ♂ operation.\n\nHowever, if we were to bend the rules slightly and assume that the operation ♀, as exemplified by 4 ♀3, is a separate operation defined by the output of 3.5 and not directly related to the multiplication by 4 and addition as defined by ♂, then the question itself becomes a paradox within the strict context provided.\n\nIn a strictly logical and adherent-to-given-rules scenario, the task is ill-defined because it seeks to use a decimal result as an input for an operation that expects a whole number.

This suggests that ♂ is not simply the addition or average operation but a different operation that when applied to 5 and 6 gives the result 26.\n\nSince the direct association of ♂ with the average operation doesn't match the provided example, we need to approach the problem directly based on the instructions given, acknowledging there might be an error or misunderstanding in the sequence of operations as traditionally understood (like ♀ representing just the average of its operands).\n\nGiven the unique outcome of 5 ♂6 = 26, we proceed with the task at hand:\n\n5 ♂(4 ♀8 )\n\nFirst, let's perform the operation within the parentheses (4 ♀8):\n\n4 ♀8 = (4 + 8) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nNow we have:\n\n5 ♂(6)\n\nGiven that the operation ♂ transforms 5 and 6 into 26, we can't straightforwardly apply a simple operation like addition or multiplication based on the average of 5 and 6 (which is 5.5) to get 26. Since the direct interpretation of ♂ as an operation that follows the average mathematical procedure does not align with the provided example (as it should yield 5.5 for 5 ♂6 based on the average operation but is given as 26), we must assume there's a specific rule for ♂ that is not conventional (i.e., it's not just a matter of applying a standard mathematical operation like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division in a straightforward way based on the average result we just calculated).\n\nHowever, the task requires us to compute 5 ♂(4 ♀8) using the given pattern/rule that we have, which seems to be a non-standard operation based on the example provided.

Thus, following the pattern strictly as given and acknowledged for the unique operation of ♂:\n\n5 ♂(4 ♀8) = 5 ♂6 = 26\n\nThis answer is based on the unique instruction provided for the operation ♂, acknowledging the discrepancy from a conventional operation perspective, which asks us to interpret ♂ in a manner that yields 26 when applied to 5 and 6, a pattern we then apply directly to find the result of applying ♂ to numbers derived through other operations according to the given patterns.\n\nTherefore, based on the specific instructions and the unique outcome for 5 ♂6, the computation:\n\n5 ♂(4 ♀8) = 26\n\nThus, wrapped in double square brackets as instructed:\n\n[[26]]",

Since there is no standard mathematical operation defined by the ◇ symbol, let's assume it means \"multiplied by three, then raised to the power of 3.\" This interpretation allows us to break down the equation into its parts.\n\nGiven X◇3 ◇3 = 512, we can rewrite it as a mathematical equation:\n\n((X * 3) ^ 3) ^ 3 = 512\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(X * 3) ^ 9 = 512\n\nNow, we know that 512 is 2 ^ 9. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(X * 3) ^ 9 = 2 ^ 9\n\nTo solve for X, we can take the ninth root of both sides:\n\n(X * 3) = 2\n\nNow, we can solve for X by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nX = 2 / 3\n\nHowever, since the question asks for an integer answer and 2 / 3 is not an integer, our initial assumption about the operation represented by ◇ must be incorrect. The only integer solution for X that would result in 512 when the operation is applied twice (with ◇ representing multiplication by 3) is X = 4. Here's why:\n\nIf X◇3 means \"multiplied by 3,\" then the equation becomes:\n\n(X * 3) * 3 = 512\n\n3X * 3 = 512\n\n9X = 512\n\nX = 512 / 9\n\nX = 56.888...\n\nSince X must be an integer, we made a mistake in our interpretation. The correct interpretation should consider the ◇ symbol as a multiplication by 3 before applying the next operation, and then cubing the result. Given the traditional structure of operations (specifically, exponents before multiplication), and with the constraint that the answer must be an integer, our primary mistake was not considering the operation's sequence correctly initially.\n\nGiven the corrected interpretation, the equation should actually be read as applying the operation ◇3 to a number, cubing that result, and then setting it equal to 512. This operation is applied twice, so we don't need to break it down into multiple steps as we initially tried.\n\nLet's correct our approach:\n\nIf X◇3 means \"multiplied by 3 and cubed,\" then the equation is:\n\n(X * 3)^3 = 512\n\n3X^3 = 512\n\nX^3 = 512 / 3\n\nX^3 = 170.666...\n\nThis still doesn't yield an integer solution for X, which means we need to adjust our understanding of the ◇ operation or our initial assumption about how to apply it to solve the equation as given. Given the constraints and the need for an integer solution, the most straightforward reading and solution, based on common mathematical operations and the requirement for numerical accuracy, points to an error in initial interpretation.\n\nThe correct approach, given the standard rules of operations and the need to find an integer solution X such that applying the operation described (which we've tentatively interpreted as \"multiply by 3 and cube\") results in 512, leads us to the standard mathematical operation under the hood, which is multiplication by 3 followed by cubing the result. The initial interpretation was incorrect in its application and sequence, leading to a non-integer solution.\n\nThe correct, simple interpretation that directly leads to an integer solution is that X must be such that \\(3^3 \\times X = 512\\), which does not align with the given structure of operations as initially misinterpreted. The correct application of operations based on the standard mathematical precedence (exponentiation before multiplication) does not lead to an integer solution under the given form of the operation, highlighting the misunderstanding in defining the ◇ operation's role in the equation.\n\nGiven the need to reconcile the solution with the integer constraint and the correct application of operations, the most straightforward answer, based on the initial question's structure and the requirement for a correct application of operations, is that our initial steps were incorrect in interpreting the ◇ operation's role and sequence without specific clarification on its exact mathematical definition.\n\nTherefore, under standard mathematical operations and the given equation's structure, the correct answer to the question as posed, emphasizing the need for an integer solution and a straightforward interpretation that fits the standard rule of operations, is that the initial interpretation of the ◇ operation led to a non-integer solution. The correct approach, adhering to the standard operations' precedence, does not directly yield an integer solution as initially sought, indicating a misunderstanding in the operation's interpretation rather than a calculation error in the logical steps following that misunderstanding.\n\nGiven the correct application of operations according to standard precedence and the requirement for an integer solution, the answer to \"[[your answer]]\" cannot be definitively provided under the initial assumptions about the ◇ operation's function. The question's structure and the need for an integer solution point towards a misunderstanding of the ◇ operation's definition or its application in the equation, rather than a calculation error in the logical steps following that misunderstanding. \n\nThe logical progression and the emphasis on finding an integer solution under the given operation's description lead us to conclude that the initial interpretation was incorrect, and without clear definitions or adjustments to the operation's interpretation, we cannot directly provide an integer solution that fits the given equation structure and standard mathematical operations' precedence. \n\nTherefore, the answer to \"[[your answer]]\" based on the initial question's structure and the requirement for a correct application of operations under standard mathematical precedence is that **there is no integer solution that fits the given equation's structure as initially understood**, indicating a misunderstanding in the operation's interpretation rather than an error in logical steps.",

However, without knowing the exact operation, we'll proceed with the assumption that it behaves similarly to multiplication for the purpose of algebraic manipulation.\n\nGiven this interpretative leap for the sake of solving the equation:\n\n\\[3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot X = \\frac{5}{2}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[9X = \\frac{5}{2}\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(X\\), divide both sides by 9:\n\n\\[X = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{9}\\]\n\n\\[X = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\]\n\n\\[X = \\frac{5}{18}\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(X = \\frac{5}{18}\\).\n\n[[Your answer: 5/18]]",

Assuming \"¥\" represents a custom operation that follows a pattern within the numbers given, we can attempt to solve the problem by finding a pattern in the inputs.\n\nFirst, let's look at the numbers 2, 3, 4.

For the purpose of this problem, without a clear indication of how \"¥\" operates, we'll explore a general approach:\n\n- If \"¥\" represents addition (2 + 3 + 4), the result would be 9.\n- If \"¥\" represents multiplication (2 * 3 * 4), the result would be 24.\n- If \"¥\" represents subtraction (2 - 3 - 4), the result would be -5.\n- If \"¥\" represents division (2 / 3 / 4), the result would be 1/6.\n\nHowever, without a clear \"¥\" operation, we cannot definitively determine the answer.

However, considering the context, we can assume that \"⊕\" is some sort of operation and \"i\" represents the imaginary unit, where i^2 = -1.\n\nGiven equation: (2 ⊕3) × (1 ⊕ X) = -10 + 11i\n\nLet's denote the operation \"⊕\" as a function, say f(a, b), where a and b are the inputs. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(f(2, 3)) × (1 ⊕ X) = -10 + 11i\n\nNow, to find X, we need to know how the operation \"⊕\" works. Without a clear definition of this operation, we can't solve for X directly. However, we can attempt to reason backward from the equation provided.\n\nGiven that we are looking for a real number for X and the outcome is a complex number (-10 + 11i), we can infer that the operation \"⊕\" might involve a step that, when multiplied by the outcome of a similar operation on a real number (1 ⊕ X), results in a complex number.\n\nFor the sake of solving this without knowing the exact operation \"⊕\", let's assume a simplified scenario where \"⊕\" could be interpreted as introducing an imaginary component when operated on with a specific rule that includes a real or imaginary number. A straightforward interpretation that fits the context of the given answer (-10 + 11i) would be something that, when multiplied by another number, yields a real part that matches -10 and an imaginary part that matches 11i.\n\nSince we know the outcome of the equation is -10 + 11i, and we are multiplying (2 ⊕3) by (1 ⊕ X), the operation on (1 ⊕ X) must result in a complex number that, when multiplied by the known result from (2 ⊕3), gives -10 + 11i.\n\nGiven the lack of a specific operation definition and aiming for a logical step, we can infer that (1 ⊕ X) must be a complex number of the form a + bi, where multiplying it by a complex number (which could be derivable from (2 ⊕3)) gives -10 + 11i.\n\nTo find X, we would typically solve for (1 ⊕ X) such that when multiplied by (2 ⊕3), it yields -10 + 11i. However, without a clear operation rule for \"⊕\" that can transform real numbers into complex numbers as needed, we can only hypothesize.\n\nA simple hypothetical scenario could be:\n- Assume (2 ⊕3) = c + di, where c and d are real numbers.\n- Then, we are looking for an (1 ⊕ X) = a + bi, such that (c + di)(a + bi) = -10 + 11i.\n\nExpanding the multiplication gives:\n(c + di)(a + bi) = ca - db + (cb + da)i.\n\nFor it to equal -10 + 11i, we need:\nca - db = -10\ncb + da = 11\n\nWithout the explicit operation rule, we can't solve for X directly from here. However, the essence of the answer lies in the recognition that the operation \"⊕\" must be defined in a way that allows for the solution of X through the interplay of real and imaginary components.\n\nGiven the constraints and the goal to find X purely from the perspective of making the equation balance, we would理论上需要额外的信息来定义 \"⊕\" 如何映射到实数和虚数以满足方程。但在一个理想化的假设环境中，where the operation \"⊕\" could be designed such that (1 ⊕ X) assuming X is a real number, and through a specific \"⊕\" operation that yields a complex number when operated on with 1, we aim for the product to equal -10 + 11i, X's value would depend on the specific operation chosen.\n\nSince we cannot solve for X without a clear definition of how \"⊕\" operates to transform numbers into a complex form that, when multiplied by another product (2 ⊕3), equals -10 + 11i, the answer in a strictly logical and without additional context scenario is:\n\n[[Textual Indication of the Problem's Nature and Need for More Information]]\n\nThis is a limitation of the problem as presented; it requires a defined operation \"⊕\" to solve for X.

This discrepancy suggests that the operation symbol \"◎\" must represent a function that, when applied to 1 and 3, yields a complex number, but when applied to X and any other real number (in this case, 2), yields a real number.\n\nGiven the structure of the problem and the specific operation performed on 1 and 3 that results in a complex number (22i), it's essential to consider operations that could yield such a result when applied to integers but not necessarily when applied to variables. \n\nOne such operation could be raising 1 to the power of 3, which, in the context of complex number theory, could yield a non-real number due to the nature of complex exponentiation (specifically, since 3 is an odd integer).

In mathematics, there isn't a standard operation symbol \"▽\" as commonly used for a specific function or operation like +, -, *, or /. However, for the sake of this question, let's assume \"▽\" represents a custom operation or composition of the two functions f and g, such as the derivative, pointwise multiplication, or some other operation.\n\nGiven the lack of a standard mathematical operation represented by \"▽\", we'll consider three common interpretations:\n\n1. **Pointwise Multiplication**: If \"▽\" represents pointwise multiplication, then f▽g(x) = f(x) * g(x). At x = 0, f▽g(0) = cos(0) * 0^3 = 1 * 0 = 0.\n\n2. **Pointwise Division**: If \"▽\" represents pointwise division, then f▽g(x) = f(x) / g(x). At x = 0, f▽g(0) = cos(0) / 0^3 = 1 / 0, which is undefined because division by zero is not allowed in mathematics.\n\n3. **Pointwise Operation Representing the Derivative**: Given that the question involves \\(f(x) = \\cos(x)\\), which is a common function related to calculus, another interpretation could be that \"▽\" represents a derivative operation applied at the point where x = 0, though this interpretation is less direct due to the way the question is phrased. In calculus, \\(f' ▽ g'\\) at x=0 would mean taking the derivatives of f and g, and then applying an operation at x=0, but since the operation \"▽\" is not specified as a derivative operation directly, and the question asks for f▽g, not \\(f' ▽ g'\\), this interpretation might be stretching the question's intent. However, for the sake of covering all plausible interpretations:\n\n   - If we were considering \\(f' ▽ g'\\), then:\n     - \\(f'(x) = -\\sin(x)\\), so \\(f'(0) = -\\sin(0) = 0\\).\n     - \\(g'(x) = 3x^2\\), so \\(g'(0) = 3(0)^2 = 0\\).\n     - Applying some operation to \\(f'(0)\\) and \\(g'(0)\\) at x=0 would still result in 0, given that both derivatives are 0.

It seems that \"a★3\" is an operation on the number \"a\" that results in f(x) when x = 3. Given that f(x) = x, applying f to any number x simply gives us that number back. Therefore, \"a★3\" means that f(a) is equal to 3 when the operation is performed. However, since f(x) = x, if f(a) = 3, it implies that a = 3.\n\nBut the question states that \"a★3 = 10,\" which contradicts the direct application of the function f(x) = x to any number. This discrepancy suggests that \"a★3\" implies an operation or a special context that yields 10 when applied to \"a\" in this specific scenario, distinct from the identity function described by f(x) = x. \n\nGiven the unique constraint that f(x) = x and the contradictory result that \"a★3\" equals 10, we infer that \"a★3\" is not simply applying the function f(x) to the number \"a.\" Instead, \"a★3 = 10\" is a statement that defines the operation \"★\" in a context where it deviates from the behavior of f(x) = x. \n\nTo find \"a,\" we need to understand what operation \"★\" does in this context to turn \"a\" into 10 when the operand is 3. Since the standard interpretation of f(x) = x does not align with \"a★3 = 10\" (because if f(x) = x, then a★3 would logically be a, which is said to equal 3, not 10), we must infer that \"★\" represents a different operation here. \n\nHowever, with the information provided, there's no standard mathematical operation that directly links an arbitrary number \"a\" with 10 through \"★\" when the second operand is fixed as 3 under the conditions given (f(x) = x). The statement as formulated seems to inadvertently mix two different operational definitions without clear context, one being the identity function f(x) = x, and the other being \"a★3 = 10,\" which implies a different operational context or a specific definition of \"★\" that has not been standardly presented in relation to the identity function.\n\nGiven the standard interpretation until the contradictory result, if we strictly follow the initial clue that f(x) = x, and then suddenly interpret \"a★3 = 10\" without further clarification on how \"★\" operates differently from simply applying f(x) to the operand, we cannot directly solve for \"a\" using the identity function as described. The operation \"★\" must, in this specific context, convert \"a\" into 10 when 3 is the second operand, implying it behaves differently from f(x) = x.\n\nHowever, for the sake of addressing the question directly based on the information provided, if we were to mistakenly apply the identity function's logic to \"a★3 = 10\" (which is not logically consistent with the given f(x) = x), we would incorrectly infer that \"a\" must be 10 due to the misunderstanding of the operation \"★.\" But this interpretation is incorrect based on the problem's clear instruction that f(x) = x applies universally, and thus, under normal operational interpretation, \"a\" must be 3, not 10, for the identity function to hold true.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation that \"a★3 = 10\" cannot be directly solved using the identity function as described (since applying f(a) = a to find \"a\" that, when \"★3,\" yields 10 is contradictory to the premise that f(x) = x), the question as posed does not provide a standard mathematical operation or additional context to deduce \"a\" directly.
