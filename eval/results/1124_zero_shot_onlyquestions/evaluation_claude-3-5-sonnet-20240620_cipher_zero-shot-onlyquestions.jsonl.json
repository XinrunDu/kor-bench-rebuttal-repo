In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, and I.\n* Notice the repetition of \"AX\" and \"GF\".\n\nLet's try a common substitution: A -> E. This gives us \"EXVXGFEXGFEVFVGEXFGE\".  Doesn't seem promising.\n\nLet's try A -> T. This gives us \"TXVXGFTXGFTVFTGTXFGDT\".  Still doesn't look right.\n\nLet's try a less common substitution.

Since \"X\", \"G\", \"F\" and \"A\" are the most frequent, let's guess they represent common letters. Let's try X -> E, G -> T, F -> A, A -> O.  That transforms the ciphertext into \"OEVTOETOTEOAVTOETAOD\". Close, but not quite.\n\nLet's try another variation.  X -> E, G -> O, F -> A, A -> T.  This gives us \"TETOOETOTETVTOETTOD\". Still doesn't work.\n\n\nLet's consider the repetitive \"AX\". If we assume this represents a common two-letter word like \"TO\", \"IS\", \"IN\", \"IT\", \"AT\", etc., and given the frequency of A and X, and comparing it to the frequency of letters in English, it might be promising to try A -> T and X -> O. That would make AX -> TO.  Let's follow this track, assuming common letters for the rest based on frequency. If we let G -> A and F -> I, the ciphertext then transforms to:\n\n\"TOVOIOTIOTIVTOITOID\". Now if we let V -> L and D -> S, we get  \"TOLOIOTIOTILTOITOS\".\n\nStill not quite there, let's try a different mapping while preserving AX -> TO. Perhaps G -> N, F -> E:\n\n\"TOVNOETOTEVTOETODS\" and if V->L, D->Y, it becomes \"TOLNOETOTELTOETOY\"\n\nNow, if we try A -> T, X -> O, G -> A, F -> I, V -> L, D -> S we get \"TOLOIOTIOTILTOITOS\".  Close! Perhaps a message about toilets?  Let's try one last permutation, using the idea of toilets.\n\nLet's try A -> T, X -> O, G -> I, F -> L, V -> S, D -> N. This gives us \"TOSOILOTSILTSOITON\".  Almost looks like \"TOILETS OIL TOILETS ON\".\n\nLet's change just one letter,  D -> K. That gives us \"TOSOILOTSILTSOITOK\".  Doesn't seem quite right.\n\n\nLet's go back to \"TOLOIOTIOTILTOITOS\" where we had A -> T, X -> O, G -> A, F -> I, V -> L.  Perhaps the last letter being a D actually should be a S for plural? Then we have \"TOLOIOTIOTILTOITOS\".  Still doesn't make a good word.\n\nLet's try a different tack. Suppose the message is about \"toilets\". Then we might have TOILETS broken up. Perhaps TOI is a frequent grouping. If TOI corresponds to AXF, then A->T, X->O, F->I.  Let's assume G is L, then AXGF is TOIL.  Then the whole message starts TOILOTS... perhaps TOILETS OIL.  Then A->T, X->O, F->I, G->L, V->E, D->S?  No, that gives TOSEILOTSILTSOITOS.\n\nPerhaps there's an error in the cipher text?\n\n[[UNABLE TO DECRYPT]]\n",
