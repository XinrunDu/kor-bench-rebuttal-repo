However, if Y is allowed to be complex, then we have Y = 7/3 + (2/3)i.  Without further clarification about the nature of Y, providing a single number is impossible.\n\n\nSince the problem seems to imply a single numerical answer is expected, let's explore a different interpretation of the \"◎\" operator.  If \"◎\" represents concatenation instead of multiplication, then we have a different scenario:\n\nIf ◎ represents concatenation:\n\n(3◎Y) becomes 3Y (where Y is a digit or a sequence of digits appended to 3)\n(2◎1) becomes 21\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n3Y - 21 = 5 + 2i\n\nThis still leads to a complex number for Y, which isn't a single number answer.\n\nTherefore, under the most likely interpretations of the problem, a single numerical answer doesn't exist.

Since the sum of two real numbers cannot be a complex number, at least one of the quantities, (X⊕2) or (1⊕3), must represent a complex number.\n\nLet us assume the operator ⊕ represents complex addition.  If ⊕ represents complex addition, then\n1⊕3 = 1 + 3 = 4\n(X⊕2) + (1⊕3) = (X+2) + (1+3) = X + 2 + 4 = X + 6\n\nThus we have X + 6 = 4 + 5i.

Let's assume ⊕ is some operation that results in\nX⊕2 = a + bi\nand\n1⊕3 = c + di\n\nThen the equation becomes:\na + bi + c + di = 4 + 5i\n(a+c) + (b+d)i = 4 + 5i\n\nIf we assume X is real and ⊕ represents addition, we have\nX + 2 + 1 + 3 = 4 + 5i\nX + 6 = 4 + 5i\nX = -2 + 5i\n\nIf we assume X is real and ⊕ represents multiplication, we have\n2X + 3 = 4 + 5i\n2X = 1 + 5i\nX = (1 + 5i)/2\n\nSince the question explicitly asks for a numerical answer, we will consider the case where ⊕ means addition, and X is a complex number.\nX+2 + 1+3 = 4+5i\nX+6 = 4+5i\nX = -2 + 5i\n\nIf the question intends for X to be a real number, then it would be impossible to obtain a complex number through addition.\n\n[[ -2+5i ]]\n",
