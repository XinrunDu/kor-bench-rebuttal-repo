Assuming it's like logical implication (p1 → p2), it would mean ~(p1 → p2) & p2.\n   - Under standard logical operations, p1 → p2 is equivalent to ~p1 ∨ p2. So ~(p1 → p2) becomes p1 & ~p2.\n   - Hence, the formula becomes (p1 & ~p2) & p2.\n   - This can be simplified to: p1 & (~p2 & p2), which is always false because ~p2 & p2 is a contradiction.\n\n2. (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2):\n   - The equality sign here seems to be equating two expressions, which implies logical equivalence, i.e., both sides must have the same truth value.\n   - For (p1 & p3) to be equivalent to (~p1 & ~p2), let's consider possible truth values:\n\n     - If p1 is true, then for the LHS (p1 & p3) to be true, p3 must also be true.

Therefore, this formula seems to hold in all situations and can thus be considered a **Truth Formula**.\n\n   Conclusion: **A**.\n\n2. **Formula 2: `(p1 =::> ~p1) =::> ~p2`**\n\n   Let's break it down:\n\n   - `p1 =::> ~p1` implies that if `p1` is true, then `~p1` (not `p1`) must be true, which is a contradiction. Thus `p1` must be false for `p1 =::> ~p1` to hold, meaning it is automatically true whatever the value of `p1` is. Essentially, this base condition gives no constraints on `p2`.\n\n   - So the entire formula simplifies to a constant: \"True implies ~p2\", which should be consistent if `~p2` is true regardless of truth values of any other variables which will not always be the case. \n\n   Thus, `(p1 =::> ~p1) =::> ~p2` depends on `p2`'s truth-value, meaning it's neither a truth-formula nor a falsehood-formula by default.\n\n   Conclusion: **C** (Neither).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe analysis results in:\n\n\\[ [A];[C] \\]",

However, since the question doesn't clearly define what \"level\" means, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on common practices in logical formula classification.\n\nIn some contexts, the level might be associated with the depth of logical operators, the complexity, or the structure of the formula. For this determinant, the given formula (~p1 & p2) =::> p3 includes logical operators like negation (~), conjunction (&), and an unspecified operator that I'll assume to symbolize some form of implication or equivalence, denoted by \"=::>\".\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. **Identify the atomic propositions**: p1, p2, p3.\n2. **Identify the logical operators**: \n   - Negation (~) applied to p1.\n   - Conjunction (&) between ~p1 and p2.\n   - Some form of implication (=::>) involving the result of (~p1 & p2) and p3.\n\n3. **Composition of the formula**:\n   - The expression (~p1 & p2) is a conjunction combined with a negation, typically considered basic operations.\n   - The overall structure (~p1 & p2) =::> p3 suggests a binary operation at the highest level (possibly implication).\n\n### Assign a Level:\nFollowing usual practices, we could assign levels based on the types or depths of operations. However, since the assignment of levels like \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", ..., \"Z\" (or beyond) isn't standardized without context, I'll have to approximate.\n\n1. **Negation and conjunction are basic operations**, therefore, could be considered as level 1 or similar.\n2. **The primary operator (possibly implication =::>)** could logically be assumed a higher-level operator, treasuring the entire expression with a potentially higher complexity classification.\n\nGiven the assumed hierarchical depth:\n- Simple atomic propositions (p1, p2, p3) are usually level 0.\n- Operations such as negation (~) and conjunction (&) that construct (~p1 & p2) might be level 1.\n- The operator at the highest level =::> may push it to level 2, just above binary operations usually like conditional or biconditional.\n\nSince explicit criteria like A for atomic, B for basic operations, etc., aren't specified in this scenario: We'll default to the premise that this composite, moderately asymmetric structure:\n- Constitutes a first complex logic level beyond basics.\n\nWith the available reasoning, the most plausible assumption without specific level guidance tends to be that:\n\n**The level of the formula (~p1 & p2) =::> p3 is a combined higher-order context.

Predicate \\( F_J(x, y) \\) denotes \\( x = y \\).\n\n### Formula to Implement:\nWe need to evaluate the formula \\( \\forall x \\forall y \\exists z F(f(x,y),z) \\).\n\n### Interpretation:\nThis formula translates to:\n\"For all natural numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), there exists a natural number \\( z \\) such that the predicate \\( F_J(f(x, y), z) \\) holds true.\"\n\nRemember that \\( F_J(x, z) \\) is true if and only if \\( x = z \\).\n\n### Implementation:\nWe substitute the function \\( f_J(x, y) = x + y \\) into the predicate \\( F_J(x, z) \\), which becomes:\n\n\\[ \\forall x \\forall y \\exists z (x + y = z) \\]\n\nThis means that for every pair of natural numbers \\( (x, y) \\), there exists a natural number \\( z \\) such that \\( z = x + y \\).\n\n### Solution:\nIn the context of natural numbers, the sum \\( x + y \\) is always a natural number, which means for any given \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can simply choose \\( z = x + y \\).\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under the interpretation J is expressing that the sum of any two natural numbers is another natural number, which is guaranteed by the closure property of natural numbers under addition.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of the formula is simply expressing this basic fact:\n\n\\[\n[[\\forall x\\forall y\\exists z (z = x + y)]]\n\\]\n\nThis is valid for the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what the concepts of a \"basic form\" and an \"all-even form\" mean in the context of propositional logic formulas with 4 variables. \n\nLet's assume that:\n\n1. A \"basic form\" is a propositional formula in its simplest or canonical representation, like a conjunction or disjunction of literals (propositional variables or their negations).\n\n2. An \"all-even form\" might refer to a formula that satisfies some criteria that involve even parity, but without explicit definition in the problem, it's not clear.\n\nSince the problem isn't fully defined, let's make an educated guess. If we assume \"all-even form\" means a formula that evaluates to true for an even number of assignments (truth assignments), let's structure our approach around this:\n\nA formula with 4 propositional variables (say \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\)) can have \\(2^4 = 16\\) different truth assignments. To be an \"all-even form,\" such a formula should evaluate to true for an even number of these assignments, i.e., for one of the following counts: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 assignments.\n\nFor simplicity, consider a simple selector criterion (e.g., even numbers of true evaluations). Let's further assume the basic form constraints don't overly restrict the formula types beyond ensuring canonical simplicity (like a direct set of clauses or literals).\n\nWith 16 total configurations and parity logic suggesting symmetry (half of sequences should achieve even true counts naturally by flipping truth assignments), the plausible count of such combinations can be computed through systematic generation or balanced symmetry assumptions. Without precise clarity, let's estimate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{All possible counts}}{2} = \\frac{2^{16}}{2} = 2^{15} = 32768 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, while there are simplifications and assumptions for clarity, in truth-oriented logic structure every additional layer can severely impact count outputs.\n\nThe question simplifies the conceptual resolution to:\n\n\\[\n[[]]\n\\]\n\nHere, however, we have ambiguities without more definitions. Thus, based on 2-variable combinatorial basics, reasonable estimates should involve simplified digital logic benchmark-parity schema:\n\n- Conservatively refactor some assumptions if disparity or misalignment is initially detected returning fewer excess outputs.\n\nConclusively, based on balanced reasoning checks engaged (on even outputs by round figures):\n\n\\[\n[[128]]\n\\]\n\nSo the adjusted educated guess under logical symmetry and parity baseline indices:\n\n\\[\n[[128]]\n\\]\n\nPlease check definitions and individual constraints for robust application return sets.",
