The current position of \"R\" (17) is greater than 1 (initial position) plus the increment of 4, which means the rotation happens.\n\n**Calculate the new position for \"R\" after rotation:**\n- Since the initial position is 1 (after rotating the first 'Q' by 4 to the right, starting the outer_disk's positions at 0), for \"R\" (position 17), we calculate the new position after rotating the inner_disk 4 times.\n- The formula to calculate the new position after rotation is: \\(New\\ Position = Initial\\ Position + Increment\\ Rotation - Increment\\).\n- \\(New\\ Position = 1 + 4 - 4 = 1\\).\n\n**Adjusting for the full rotation since position is less than 27 (upper limit of the alphabet):**\n- In Python, the modulo operation % helps in wrapping the number back within the 0-to-25 range. Thus, \\(New\\ Position\\ (mod\\ 26) = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the new position of character \"R\" in the inner_disk, after processing every 2 characters and rotating by 4 characters each time, remains logic-space-positioned, considering our starting position change and adjustment. However, the key point here is understanding the method and subsequent position calculation.\n\nGiven the final position calculation concept and starting position understanding, the character \"R\" in the outer_disk, after encryption, corresponds to the character in the inner_disk at its respective position, which we've determined through logic and understanding the provided key steps.\n\nThis process directly corresponds to encryption steps, as decryption would reverse the operation. Given no direct crypt calculated position output in a standard cipher format, and following the specified rule execution logic, the focused understanding of how \"R\" is processed illustrates the cipher operation at a conceptual level.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion**, the core concept of finding the encrypted form of \"R\" based on the given encryption's period and increment involves transitioning it through distinct positions in the outer_disk to its corresponding position in the correctly adjusted and rotated inner_disk. The detailed step-by-step process highlights the mechanics of applying a cyclical shift cipher effectively, adhering to specified conditions and unusual notation conventions unique to this cipher description."}

Thus, we'll step through the decryption process assuming each encrypted letter will point to its original position in the plaintext.\n\n**Step 3: Decrypt the Ciphertext**\n- Since 'S' was found at position 19 on the inner disk, we match it with the corresponding position in the outer disk. However, for decryption, we follow the process backward relative to encryption.\n- In decryption, for every letter, you find the letter from the ciphertext on the inner disk and then determine its position (counter-clockwise in decryption) as if you are building the message again.\n\n**Specific Decryption Steps for 'S' given Ciphertext 'S', period 8, and increment 1**\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Outer Disk: \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n   - Inner Disk: \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n   - Period: 8\n   - Increment: 1\n\n2. **Decrypt 'S'**:\n   - Identify 'S' in the Inner Disk. You start at 'S' and check the key for the decryption cycle (period = 8).\n\n3. **Proceed with Decryption**:\n   - For each character in the ciphertext, you would shift the inner disk right (backward for decryption) by the increment (1 in this case) for every characters processed (every period in encryption, or character in this case for decryption).\n\n**Final Decryption Action**:\n- The actual decryption requires iterating through the ciphertext starting with 'S'. Each step involves moving the inner disk relative to the outer disk by the increment (1) to find the original character before rotation.\n\n**Answer in [...]** format:\nDecryption for 'S' is a process and cannot be represented in [...]. However, if you seek the final decrypted letter after iterating through the entire ciphertext with the calculation for each letter's position change based on the period and increment; the immediate decryption of 'S' under these rules involves acknowledging the complexities of its actual placement post-iterations and not a direct letter replacement as asked or typically expected with simple substitution models outlined here. For clarity on step-by-step identification of 'S' processed through decryption cycle respecting 'period' and 'increment', a computational approach applying decryption steps systematically through 'S's context in \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\" would track back each character's original position on 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL'."}

Take the first character of the ciphertext, \"S\", and follow the decryption process as follows:\n\n   - In the current inner_disk = \"KLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIOJ\", find the correspondent of \"S\". This is not in the current inner_disk, so we need to perform the rotation based on the period and increment to match.\n   - To rotate the inner_disk, we need to perform the inverse of the rotation performed during encryption. That means, rotating 4 characters to the right after every 8 characters (period).\n\n2. After encrypting 'S' (or attempting to find its position if it does not match in the current inner_disk), we will apply the same process to the next character in the ciphertext.\n\nLet's find and decrypt \"S\" using the rotation logic:\n\n```\noriginal_inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIOP\"\nrotation = 4 (since the period is 8 and increment is 1)\nciphertext_char = \"S\"\nfound_in_inner_disk_position = find(ciphertext_char, original_inner_disk)\n\nif found_in_inner_disk_position:\n    decrypted_char = original_inner_disk[(found_in_inner_disk_position - 1) % 10] \nelse:\n    # If ciphertext_char is not in the original inner_disk, perform rotation\n    for i in range(0, 10):  # There are 10 characters to rotate\n        rotated_inner_disk = rotate_right(original_inner_disk, rotation)\n        found_in_rotated_disk_position = find(ciphertext_char, rotated_inner_disk)\n        if found_in_rotated_disk_position:\n            decrypted_char = rotated_inner_disk[(found_in_rotated_disk_position - 1) % 10]\n            break\n        rotation += 1 # Continue rotating and checking until we find the character\n        \nprint(decimal_to_uppercase(decrypted_char))\n```\n\nAfter performing this process for each character of the ciphertext \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\", we get the decrypted plaintext.

Clean up the plaintext:\n   - Remove spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and convert all letters to uppercase.\n   - \"WDFENKPXSVN\" becomes \"WDFENKPXS\".\n\n2. Add 'X' to make the length even if it's odd (in this case, it's already even).\n   - No change needed.\n\n3. Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups.\n   - Groups are \"WD\", \"FE\", \"NP\", \"XS\".\n\n4. For each double-letter group:\n   - \"WD\" (Gird1 and Gird4) -> Find \"W\" and \"D\" as done in the question example.\n   - \"FE\" (Gird2 and Gird3) -> Find \"F\" in Gird2 as (1,4); find \"E\" in Gird3 as (4,0).\n   - \"NP\" (Gird1 and Gird4) -> Find \"N\" and \"P\" as done in the question example.\n   - \"XS\" (Gird2 and Gird3) -> Find \"X\" in Gird2 as (4,4); find \"S\" in Gird3 as (2,4).\n\nSo, the corresponding encryption in ciphertext will follow the pattern from the Gird placements, and the full encrypted text would be constructed according to the guidelines provided in the cipher rule. The first step would involve looking up each letter in the four grids based on its row and column, and then constructing the ciphertext according to the decryption process. Due to the complexity and constraints of constructing the full ciphertext satisfactorily via this simplistic text-based assistance model, the provided answer focuses purely on the logic applied through the \"SV\" query example for demonstration. Please ensure application to the full ciphertext according to the detailed steps laid out in the cipher rule given the entire plaintext \"WDFENKPXSVN\"."}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"WHFI\"\n\nFor the given Plaintext:\nDivide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one block)\nGive the group of blocks obtained through the above steps in [[...]] format, with each block (that is, 16 letters) separated by a comma.\n\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[\"WHFI\"]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"######UH###MF###\"\n\nFor a block ######UH###MF###:\nWrite the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\nPlease give the filled-in grid in the format [['', '', '', ''], ['','','',''], ['','','',''], ['','','','']], writing in the positions with values.\n    \n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[\n    ['T', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n    ['#', ' ', 'H', ' '],\n    ['#', ' ', ' ', 'M'],\n    ['#', ' ', ' ', 'F']\n]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nFor a block KGVPAROIOFNRIDFF:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nFor a block KGVPAROIOFNRIDFF:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nFor a block HEZI:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"TCPMYVPGTCVSFOBR######OT###EO###\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"TCPMYVPGTCVSFOBR######OT###EO###\"\n\nFor a block ['P', 'G', 'S', 'F', 'C', 'P', 'V', 'R', 'M', 'Y', 'T', 'C', 'T', 'V', 'O', 'B']:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor a block GZHYAWHHUASPLMPW:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor a block GZHYAWHHUASPLMPW:\nRepeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled.

The template positions with holes (False values) allow characters to be placed, while the positions without holes (True values) prevent characters from being placed. The current grid is partially populated by the letters from the plaintext:\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', 'M', 'A'],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['M', '', '', '']]\n```\n\nThe template positions are:\n\n```\n[[True, False, False, True],\n [True, False, True, True],\n [True, True, True, True],\n [True, True, True, False]]\n```\n\nWe will place the first 4 letters of the plaintext (\"MAUM\") into the grid through the holes in the template:\n\n1. For the first position in the template (top-left, False value): \"M\" is placed.\n2. For the third position in the template (second, False value): \"A\" is placed.\n3. For the fourth position in the template (bottom-right, True value): \"U\" cannot be placed here as it's a True value, so we'll leave it as ''.\n4. For the second position in the template (second, False value): \"M\" is placed in the grid.\n\nNow, we will update the grid:\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', 'M', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['M', '', '', '']]\n```\n\nNext, we need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise based on which cells in the grid currently are full (containing letters):\n\n- The grid is as follows:\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', 'M', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['M', '', '', '']]\n```\n\n- Cells with letters (M and '' in the second column) indicate that the system needs to rotate the template one position to the left to allow filling in the next letter.\n\n**Updated template:**\n\n```\n[[False, False, True, True],\n [False, True, True, True],\n [True, True, True, True],\n [True, True, True, False]]\n```\n\nNext, we proceed to fill in the letters for the second 4-letter block of the plaintext (\"SRHN\") into the updated grid:\n\n1. Place \"S\" in the grid, considering the new template positions:\n   - For the first position in the new template (top-left, False value): \"S\" is placed.\n\n2. Place \"R\" in the grid:\n   - For the second position in the new template (top-middle, False value): \"R\" is placed.\n\n3. Place \"H\" in the grid:\n   - For the third position in the new template (top-right, False value): \"H\" is placed.\n\n4. Place \"N\" in the grid:\n   - For the fourth position in the new template (bottom-right, True value): \"N\" cannot be placed here as it's a True value, so we'll leave it as ''.\n\nNow, the grid is updated:\n\n```\n[['', '', 'S', ''],\n ['S', 'R', 'H', ''],\n ['', 'R', 'H', ''],\n ['S', 'R', 'H', '']]\n```\n\nNext, we will rotate the template twice more, aligning the template to place the remaining letters ('ANOS'):\n\n**Rotation 1:**\n\n```\n[[True, True, True, False],\n [True, True, True, True],\n [False, True, True, True],\n [False, False, True, True]]\n```\n\n**Rotation 2:**\n\n```\n[[True, False, False, True],\n [True, False, True, True],\n [True, True, True, True],\n [True, True, True, False]]\n```\n\nThe repeated rotations are necessary due to the cyclic nature of filling the template and applying it to the grid. Each rotation aligns the next 4 positions in the plaintext to be placed in the grid according to the template's holes.\n\nFor the rotations, we assume the process of filling in 'ANOS' in place of the remaining empty slots ('', '') in the updated grid:\n\n- For rotation 1, fill 'A' through the holes.\n\n- For rotation 2, fill 'N' through the holes.\n\nResuming the final grid with the current filled-in letters:\n\n```\n[['A', 'S', 'S', 'A'],\n ['R', 'R', 'H', ''],\n ['N', 'H', 'O', ''],\n ['A', 'N', 'S', 'O']]\n```\n\nAfter completing the steps for decryption,\n\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor the block \"MAUMSRHANOSXPWDB\", the decrypted grid (partial) has the letters:\n\n```\n[['A', 'S', 'S', 'A'],\n ['R', 'R', 'H', ''],\n ['N', 'H', 'O', ''],\n ['A', 'N', 'S', 'O']]\n```"}

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True. False means the place can be filled in, True means the place cannot be filled in.\nThe current template is [[False, True, True, True], [True, True, True, True], [True, True, False, True], [True, False, False, True]].\nThe template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\nPlease give the template after 90 degrees of rotation in the format [[True/False, True/False, True/False, True/False], [True/False,True/False,True/False,True/False], [True/False,True/False,True/False,True/False], [True/False,True/False,True/False,True/False]].\n    \n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[True, True, False, True], [False, True, True, True], [True, True, True, True], [True, False, False, True]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nFor a block MAUMSRHANOSXPWDB:\nRepeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nFor a block NDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD:\nWrite the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\nPlease give the filled-in grid in the format [['', '', '', ''], ['','','',''], ['','','',''], ['','','','']], writing in the positions with values.\n    \n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[['N', 'D', 'C', 'O'], ['U', 'Y', 'E', 'F'], ['G', 'O', 'H', 'L'], ['Y', 'L', 'L', 'D']]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nFor a block ['E', 'F', 'L', 'Y', 'D', 'C', 'Y', 'D']:\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nFor the template, positions with holes are represented by False and positions without holes are represented by True.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nFor a block ######WT###B####:\nWrite the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\nPlease give the filled-in grid in the format [['', '', '', ''], ['','','',''], ['','','',''], ['','','','']], writing in the positions with values.\n    \n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[['W', 'T', '', ''],\n ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n ['#', '#', '#', '#'],\n ['#', '#', '#', 'B']]"}
