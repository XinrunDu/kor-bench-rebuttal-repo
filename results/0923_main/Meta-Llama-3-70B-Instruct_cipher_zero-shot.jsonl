Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"X\"\nperiod: 6\nincrement: 3\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\"\nperiod: 8\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "I'll decrypt the ciphertext \"GT\" according to the specified decryption rules.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Clean up the ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase. The cleaned ciphertext remains \"GT\".\n2. Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups. In this case, we have only one group: \"GT\".\n3. For each double-letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext:\n   - Find the position of the first letter \"G\" in Gird2 and Gird3. In Gird2, \"G\" is at position (2,2), and in Gird3, \"G\" is at position (2,1).\n   - Find the position of the second letter \"T\" in Gird2 and Gird3. In Gird2, \"T\" is at position (3,4), and in Gird3, \"T\" is at position (4,2).\n   - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these two positions. For Gird1, the letter at position (2,2) is \"R\", and the letter at position (3,4) is \"U\". For Gird4, the letter at position (2,1) is \"R\", and the letter at position (4,2) is \"U\".\n   - Use these two letters as the result of decrypting the double letter combination. The decrypted result is \"RU\".\n\n**Decrypted Answer:**\n[[RU]]\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"335647244646662538\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's go through the encryption steps:\n\n**1. Padding:** \nThe plaintext \"N\" is 1 byte long, which is not a multiple of 8 bytes. We need to pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. The padded plaintext is \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n**2. Block Splitting:** \nThe padded plaintext is divided into 1 block of 8 bytes: [\"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\"].\n\n**3. Block Encryption:**\nFor the block \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\", we perform the following operations:\n\n- **Convert Block to Bytes:** \nThe ASCII encoding of the block is: [0x4E, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\n- **XOR with Key:** \nApplying XOR between the byte block and the fixed key, we get: [0x4E ^ 0x12, 0x00 ^ 0x34, 0x00 ^ 0x56, 0x00 ^ 0x78, 0x00 ^ 0x90, 0x00 ^ 0xAB, 0x00 ^ 0xCD, 0x00 ^ 0xEF].\n\n- **Substitute:** \nUsing the S_BOX Replacement Box, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte: [0x4E -> 0x0A, 0x12 -> 0x01, 0x34 -> 0x0D, 0x56 -> 0x05, 0x78 -> 0x0F, 0x90 -> 0x09, 0xAB -> 0x0B, 0xCD -> 0x0C, 0xEF -> 0x08].\n\n- **Permute:** \nPerforming a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit, we get: [0x10, 0x02, 0x1A, 0x0C, 0x1F, 0x18, 0x17, 0x04].\n\n- **XOR with Key:** \nApplying XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key, we get: [0x10 ^ 0x12, 0x02 ^ 0x34, 0x1A ^ 0x56, 0x0C ^ 0x78, 0x1F ^ 0x90, 0x18 ^ 0xAB, 0x17 ^ 0xCD, 0x04 ^ 0xEF].\n\n**4. Hexadecimal Encoding:** \nThe encrypted byte block is converted to a hexadecimal string: \"1A3E5C7F2D468B9C\".\n\n**5. Concatenate:** \nSince there is only one block, the final ciphertext is \"1A3E5C7F2D468B9C\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer is: [[1A3E5C7F2D468B9C]]."}
