Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula,\n ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula, \ndetermine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n(2) (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nA.

The number of ways to choose k paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 is given by the binomial coefficient: C(7, k) = 7! / (k!(7-k)!)\n7.

The proposition can be symbolized as:\nG(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)\n\n**Proposition 3: Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime.**\nThis proposition can be interpreted as \"if 6 is prime, then only 2 is prime\".

In this case, the group `G` consists of Alice and Bob, and `p` is the proposition \"2 plus 2 equals 4\". Since both Alice and Bob firmly believe `p`, we can conclude that `B_Ap` and `B_Bp` hold, which means Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4."}

The proposition `p` is the consensus of the group `G`, which means it is a common belief within the group.

Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Question:\nFor a long time, it has been noted that animals that have been injured tend to hide in quiet places and repeatedly lick their mouths with their heads. \nSome people believe that this is a response to pain, while others believe that animals use this method to keep away from pain. \nIn response, scientists conducted an experiment. \nThey divided a number of wheat and nickel white animals into two groups: one with salivary glands that had been removed manually, and one with normal wheat and nickel white, which differed only in this case, but were identical in all other cases. Then bruise it. \nThe result was that the wound healed much faster in the normal millets than in those whose salivary glands had been removed.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe experiment described in the passage involves two groups of animals: one with salivary glands removed and one with normal salivary glands. Both groups were subjected to bruising, and the result showed that the wound healed faster in the normal group.\n\nThis is consistent with Method \u0606, which states that if P (fast healing) occurs when S (presence of salivary glands) is present and does not occur when S is absent, then S and P may have a causal relationship. In this case, the presence of salivary glands (S) corresponds to fast healing (P), and the absence of salivary glands corresponds to slow healing."}

LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nA. Yes\nB. No.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nThe given expression ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5) does not represent the LS Paradox. The LS Paradox involves multiple hypotheses (r_1, r_2, ..., r_n) that are all reasonable, and their conjunction (r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n) contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis (r_n+1). In this case, we only have two hypotheses (r_1 and r_2) and their conjunction leads to a contradiction, but there is no third hypothesis (r_n+1) that is contradicted."}
