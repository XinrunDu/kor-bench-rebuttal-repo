Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

(Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Each character in the Morse code consists of a sequence of dots (.) or dashes (-). The dot . represents a short duration on the off state, while the dash - represents a longer duration on the off state. Both the dot and the dash are separated by a short duration in the off state. For example, the Morse code for the letter A is encoded as .- (dot followed by dash). To simplify data storage and reduce the size of the data representation, it's possible to map each dot-dash pattern to a number. For example, the letter A represented as .- can be mapped to 1. By systematically using numeric patterns for the Morse code symbols, such as .---, -.--, -.-, ..-., .---, etc., the Morse code can be efficiently represented by a sequence of on-off signals."}

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the ciphertext.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Extract all uppercase letters from `TDOACY` to the plain text $p = TDOACY$\n2. Obtain the ciphertext $c$ by performing encryption operations on $p$\n3. Returns the ciphertext $c$\n\n$decrypt(G*V*Z*RL*E#*)$\n1. Extracts all characters other than \"*\" from the ciphertext to obtain the ciphertext $c$\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext $c$ to obtain the plaintext $p$\n3. Return the plaintext $p$\n\nEncryption steps\n1. ```p_list = []\nfor sym in p:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\np = p_list```\n2. We can create a $5 × n$ matrix $M$, where $n$ is the length of $p$, to hold the plaintext in order. When filling in the same column, we should pay attention to the presence of \"$\\#$\".\n \n ```M = [[0] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(5)]\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = False\nfor i in len(c) - 1:\n    M[y][x] = c[i]\n    if direction:\n        if y == 0:\n            y = 1\n            x += 1\n            direction = False\n        else:\n            y -= 1\n    else:\n        if y == 4:\n            y = 3\n            x += 1\n            direction = True\n        else:\n            y += 1\ny_direction = [True, False] * x\nfor i in range(len(p_list)):\n    j = 0\n    while j < x and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n3. It is a simple and easy process to obtain the ciphertext from the matrix $M$.\n\nDecryption steps:\n1. Exclude all special symbols (hereafter referred to as $ast$) from the ciphertext $c$ and only keep letters.\n\n```c_list = []\nfor sym in c:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\nc = c_list```\n\n2. Again, you can creat a $5 × n$ matrix $M$ to hold the letters of the ciphertext in order.\n \n```M = [[0] * (len(c) - 1) for _ in range(5)]\nc_list = c.split(\"$ast\")\nfor i in range(0, len(M[0])):\n    M[i] = list(c_list[i])\n\nfor p in p_list:\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(len(M[0])):\n            if M[i][j] == \"$#$\":\n                M[i][j] = p\ny_direction = [True, False] * len(M[0])\nfor i in range(p):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(M[0]) and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n2. Read the matrix $M$ column by column to obtain the plaintext.\n\n### Extended Questions:\n\n1. Q: Can you explain in details the logic path for the idea of the direction switching of decryption operation?\n\nA: The decryption operation can be viewed as an inverse of the encryption process. For example, if the encryption process reads characters four columns from left to right, the decryption process should read columns from right to left, as if shaking a \"snake\".\n\n2. Q: Do you know what encryption and decryption are?\n\nA:  \n**What is encryption decryption?**\n> The process by which code is translated into secret code, so that only the recipient can decode and obtain the original text, is called encryption, while the process by which encrypted code is converted back to original text is called decryption.\n\nEncryption and decryption, called cryptography in the field of information security for short, requires that the encryption system have a \"secret key\" as a \"password\". The recipient obtains the key through another channel and decrypts the secret code transmitted. Of course, the keyword must be kept secret from the information recipient, otherwise it will cause information leakage.\n\nThere is also asymmetric encryption algorithms, in which the secret key consists of a key pair including Public key and Private key. The Public key is open to anyone, the Private key is only available to the encryptor. Even if the encryptor wants the information to be opened only to some specific people, the decryptor can decrypt the text by using another Public key to decrypt.\n\nBy using encryption decryption, the secrecy of transmitted information can be safeguarded. If an eavesdropper intercepts the secret code, he cannot decrypt it without a special key, even though he knows the method by which the secret code was translated. Accordingly, it is impossible to read the plaintext sent unless the key is a clear text.\n\n**What is encryption?**\n> Encryption refers to any means of preventing leakage or interception of data. The most common encryption techniques include stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\nCommon encryption algorithms include Core Connection Protocol, Configuration Encryption Algorithm and Hierarchical configuration encryption algorithm.\n\nEncryption is the process of making secret codes or information unrecognizable and meaningless so that only the sender and the intended recipient of the secret codes or information know how to read it. The modern method is to apply some secret codes or keys to the digital information, so that by manipulation, the person who has the secret codes or keys can restore the encrypted data to be readable.\n\nEncryption can be defined from two aspects: one is to convert the file into unreadable content so that others cannot read it; another is to convert the normal content of the file into other contents so that others can only read them after they have cumbersome operations.\n\n**What is decryption?**\n> In cryptography, decryption is the silent restoration of encrypted information to its original, intelligible form, known as plaintext. This is usually done wit Pohz the use of the proper key, thus making the decrypted text readable and usable.\n\nDecryption is the process of reconstructing the original text from a ciphertext or intermediately text. There are two types of decryption: decryption by authorized users and decryption by unauthorized attackers. For both cases, the original text must be correctly translated into plaintext."}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        \n        [['R', 'U', 'A', '0', 'Q', 'B'], \n        ['D', '2', 'W', 'K', 'S', '1'], \n        ['H', '4', '5', 'F', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['Y', 'C', 'G', 'X', '7', 'L'], \n        ['9', '8', 'I', '3', 'P', 'N'],\n        ['6', 'J', 'V', 'O', 'E', 'M']]\n        \n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"ADFGVX\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character in the 6X6 matrix. For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Below are the rules for a tricky cipher.\n\n### Preparation:\n\n- On a 6 by 6 matrix, use the first 36 letters of the English alphabet in order to fill in each square, as shown below. The first 30 letters of the alphabet is used in this way. Where do the letters go and why?  What is your line of reasoning?\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n-  In each row and each column, exactly one square should contain a letter. \n    - Start with the first letter of the alphabet, and then find, in some order, one empty square from the first row, one empty square from the second row, and so on. Place the next letter of the alphabet in this square. This way, the next letter to placed must fit into every row, but in only one of six possible columns. \n    - Repeat until the matrix is completely filled. If for some reason the last letter cannot be placed. It's because of an error in the original design. Problem: If we want the matrix to behave like a Latin square, is there a way to fix the error?\n- Write your complete matrix here, including the six letters that go in the empty squares:\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n- Write the six unused letters of the English alphabet, in ascending order, and explain your reasoning:\n    - \n- For now focus on the 30 used letters of the English alphabet. Assigning a number to each row and column is a common method in ciphers. Select the most often use number system? Write a short justification for your reasoning?\n    - \n- Referring to this matrix, look through this question. Where can we make a strategic substitution without changing the meaning? If a particular substitution has no effect on the present situation, can we infer that the given sentence provides no corroboration for the presence of the character in question?\n- Can you construct a complete translation so that this question could be asked of a human assistant? What level of education would this employee have had?\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        - 4 Signpost\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character ** or one or three other characters in its group** in the 6x6 matrix. \n        - Define Latin square.\n        - **Attempt a simple substitution, randomly swapping two other groups and/or two characters other in the same group**\n        - If the resulting message is visually appealing, please submit as message and specify the swap.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

To solve this, we first need to define the encryption key `e=263` and the modulus `n=299`. The algorithm for encryption involves raising each letter in the plaintext to the power of `e` modulo `n`, and the decryption process involves raising the ciphertext back to the power of `e` modulo `n` to retrieve the original letter.\n\nWe can assume that the plaintext is all in uppercase ASCII alphabets since the prompt mentions that the ciphertext should only contain numbers separated by commas. To simplify the encryption/decryption process, we can first convert the letters to their equivalent ASCII values using `ord()` function and then encrypt/decrypt the values.\n\nFor encryption, we can iterate over each character in the plaintext and compute its encrypted value by raising it to the power of `e` and then modulo `n`. Similarly, for decryption, we can split the ciphertext by commas and iterate over each number, raise it to the power of `e` and modulo `n`, and convert it back to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr()` function.\n\nThe code provided implements this algorithm and provides a `encrypt()` function for encrypting the plaintext, and a `decrypt()` function for decrypting the ciphertext. It also includes some tests using the sample inputs and outputs provided in the prompt.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n\nclass SmartPrimer(object):\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Encipher given plaintext to ciphertext using RSA algorithm\n        :param plaintext: the text to encrypt\n        :return: encrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        cipher_text = \"\"\n        for c in plaintext:\n            ascii_val = ord(c)\n            cipher_text += f\"{pow(ascii_val, k, mod)},\"\n        return cipher_text[:-1]\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Decipher given ciphertext to plaintext using RSA algorithm\n        :param ciphertext: the text to decrypt\n        :return: decrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        plain_text = \"\"\n        for c in ciphertext.split(\",\"):\n            ascii_val = pow(int(c), k, mod)\n            plain_text += chr(ascii_val)\n        return plain_text\n\n\nclass TestSmartPrimer(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.smarter = SmartPrimer()\n\n    def test_encrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"I\",), \"213\"),\n            ((\"Z\",), \"32\"),\n            20312345678901234567879\n        ]\n\n    def test_decrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"213\",), \"I\"),\n            ((\"55,55,213\"), \"WWI\"),\n        ]\n        for params, expected in test_data:\n            with self.subTest(parameters=params, expected=expected):\n                actual = self.smarter.decrypt(*params)\n                self.assertEqual(actual, expected)\n```"}

A customer needs to encrypt the ciphertext to hide their messages and then send it in a group chat. However, on this occasion, they would like to notify a specific person of the ciphertext and hope that only this target person can decrypt the ciphertext. Can you design such a group chat notification system? Please provide a complete workflow of your proposed system, including instructions for sending and receiving messages using the messaging app you created, as well as an illustration using an instance of a message. Please use symbols like arrows for \"encryption\", \"decryption\", \"query\", \"send to\" in the illustration to represent message processing flows.\n\n2. Besides the system you just designed, is there another encryption mechanism that also allows you to hide the plaintext when encrypting the message? To answer this one, you don't have to worry about designing an encryption mechanism.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The design of my system is as the following:\n   1. Plaintext stored on user's local.\n   2. User send the plaintext to me and I will encrypt it using RN format.\n   3. I will send the ciphertext to the group chat.\n   4. One and only one user who would want to know the plaintext will find me to decrypt the ciphertext.\n   5. I use the key from it's admin to connect the user to the encrypted message since the message is only targeted to that person.\n   6. I will use the key on my server to do the \"true\" decrypt the ciphertext by OAM.\n   7. Then I send the plaintext to the person who needs to know the plaintext.\n\n   The most difficult part of this system is how to make a robust system not to break the connection between something that only one user need to know and the special key used to decrypt.\n\n2. Well, I will try to use the chat room to send and retrieve the message."}
