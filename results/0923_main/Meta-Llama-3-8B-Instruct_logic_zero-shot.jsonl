For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given logic rule, I'll apply the conditions for a basic formula and an all-even formula to derive the answer.\n\nA formula with 4 propositional variables has 2^4 = 16 paired conjunctive terms. To be a basic formula, it must include m0, which corresponds to the all-true assignment (0 in binary).\n\nTo be an all-even formula, the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms must be all even. This means the formula can include the following paired conjunctive terms, along with their negations:\n\nm0, m2, m4, m6, m8, m10, m12, and m14\n\nSince m0 is already included as a basic formula, we can simply count the number of even-indexed paired conjunctive terms (excluding m0) that satisfy the conditions:\n\n8\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[]8]."}

We are given that Alice is certain about the proposition, denoted as `B_pp`. From the Axiom of Transitivity, if `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`. Here, `i` represents Alice, `j` represents Bob, and `p` represents the proposition. Hence, we can infer that `B_bp` (Bob believes the proposition).\n\n2. We are also given that Alice is certain about Bob being certain about the proposition, denoted as `B_BB_pp`. Using the Axiom of Reflexivity, `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, we can simplify this to `B_bp`.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we get `B_bp` and `B_bp`, indicating that Bob believes the proposition and believes he believes the proposition.\n\n4. As a result, Bob's attitude towards this proposition is:\n\n[[B. Bob is convinced of this proposition.]]"}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the provided information, I would suggest that the correct answer is [[C. \ua66e Method]].\n\nThe given discourse describes a situation where S (textile factories) and P (ground subsidence) are observed to co-occur in multiple cases with differing conditions (layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, etc.). The positive group consists of observations where S is present and P is also present, while the negative group consists of observations where S is absent and P is also absent. This pattern matches the characteristics of Method \ua66e, which involves identifying a positive group of observations where S and P co-occur, and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. Therefore, the appropriate method in this scenario is Method \ua66e."}

Hypothesis q_1 states that the rats escape because the light is on, while hypothesis q_2 states that the rats escape because they hear a sound. Since these two hypotheses contradict each other, it is not possible to determine which one is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable.

In this case, the speaker provides weaker information (the beer being still warm) that is entailed by the stronger information (Xiao Ma opening the food box).\n\nThis reasoning pattern follows the C* Principle, as the speaker provides information that is logically entailed by the stronger information and does not violate the Information Principle."}

Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All Chinese billionaires are Chinese people,\" so \"all Chinese people are Chinese billionaires.\" The premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
