The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

(Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Make sure that the ciphers are compatible with the computational logic. You must pay attention to both variables and symbols! Make sure your answer is formatted according to the task requirement.\n### Answer:\n[[PASSWORD123]]\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. Follow the instruction and format of the decryption rules strictly.\n2. Three parameters are needed to complete the decryption, namely the ciphertext, the period, and the increment.\n3. Assemble the necessary variables and cryptographic rules in the corresponding position.\n4. Follow the decryption steps precisely to calculate the plaintext.\n5. Ensure that the final computed string is a capital letter and no more than 10 digits.\n6. Check that the ciphertext string contains only uppercase letters and replace each character with the corresponding (cycle - increment) position of the inner wheel string.\n7. Calculate the corresponding position by separately determining the period and attribute number of the character under the \"inner wheel\".\n8. Multiply the number of periods by 2 and calculate the attribute number in the ciphertext. Calculate the absolute value of `(ciphertext attribute number - (2 x period)) % 26`\n9. The cipher algorithm is divided into two parts. One part is to calculate the decrypted attribute number, the other part is to decrypt the character by calculating the attribute number.\n"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

I often push myself way too hard, constantly striving for perfection instead of just doing my best. It may be part of what makes me successful, but obviously, if I don't balance my workload properly, I will burn out and not be able to retain any information at all. So, if you can provide me with helpful insights about balancing work and studying, I would be very grateful for the tips.\n\nYour suggestion to start each day with enjoyable but productive activities like stretches, yoga, or light meditation, ideally followed by a brief walk outside sounds fantastic! It allows me time to clear my head and then refocus once I get to my morning tasks. It also means that I get both my physical health and studying on track very early, which helps immensely for both concentration and motivation levels during the day.\n\n### Answer:\nThanks! I get your situation now. I'm glad my suggestions were helpful! Do you think you'll give them a try?\n"}

The question is, distinguish between special characters and normal characters, you need to have a list of special characters.\n\nRefer overall here\n\nKULLLU\n\nThe original code here is KULLLU, there are 7 letters and 1 space in it, so take the first character of the first word and write the whole leter code here. Then use the reverse icono to translate it into U, K, L, L, N, Add a space to the end.\n\nEncoded plaintext here is: U K L − L, they are encrypted in small letters in the ciphertext of the question, to be deciphered.
