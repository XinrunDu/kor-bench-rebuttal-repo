Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n≥1).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as ✓, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,✓|✓|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|✓,x|✓|✓ are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only ✓|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:✓|x,x|x,x|✓];[F:✓|✓]]\n\n### Question:\nGiven that p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula,\n ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula, \ndetermine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n(2) (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B];[A]]"}

Most free datasets only offer questions, while the answers require payment.\n\nSo as a developer, how do we generate a dataset? The first rule of course is to use the rules provided by the textbook itself! Elementary: Once we have `question - answer pair`, we can leverage the LLM's ability to perform unsupervised learning to generate some kind of dataset. But first, let's describe the rules:\n\n1. Universal Quantifier is denoted by A. Symbolize the phrase 'All men are mortal' involving the n-ary predicate ‘being mortal’ as Ax F (x). To symbolize the relationship involving the 2-dimensional predicate ‘being loved by’ as Ax Ay G (x, y). Therefore, we can use G(x) to denote the n-ary predicate `x is mortal` , and G(x,y) to denote the 2-dimensional predicate `x is loved by y`.\n\n2. Existential Quantifier is denoted by E. Given a 1-ary predicate that states that some people do not like mathematics, symbolize this as Ex ¬ F (x). Using Ex and Ey to express that there is someone who likes someone can be symbolized as Ex Ey G (x, y).\n\n3. Logical Connectives include Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, and Implication. The negation of a predicate may be denoted by negating each part of the symbolic language.\n\n4. Finally, it is important to note whether the domain is universal (all people) or specific (such as living things). For instance, universal symbolization: ‘Man loves wisdom’ involves the two predicates F(x)='x is a man' and G(x,y)='x loves y'."}

But both would result in the same output since they negate the predicate differently. So in this case we can pick any one arbitrarily. I'll choose type E here. My reasoning is below:\n\n1) Change the quality of the original proposition by negating it -> 'Every natural number is a rational number' becomes 'Every natural number is NOT a rational number'\n2) Replace the predicate with its contrary -> 'non-rational_number'\n3) Put these two parts together following the format requirements given earlier-> [[Every_natural_number_is_NOT_non-some words here ...]]\n4) Adjust spacing as needed to make the output look natural-> [[Every natural number is NOT nonrational number]]\n\nTherefore my final answer is : [[Every_natural_number_is_NOT_nonrational_number.]]"}

It is quite possible that for the bot there is not enough context to back off from the syllogistic reasoning mode and it attempts to replace the variables absentmindedly, as the pressure to follow examples with the same mood is strong.\n\nHowever, even in such a state, the bot at least partially succeeds. At first, it writes out the mood properly, even though it fails to explicitly designate it as 4th figure. Still, this mood information implies the figure. Afterwards, while filling in the moods, while it initially applies the rules without regard to the syllogistic constraints, when explicitly told to conform to a specific syllogism, it succeeds with no problem.\n\nIt is relevant to note that various testing showed that it is incapable to deduce, similarly to the case of the previous problem - that the syllogism is in the 4th figure, which is odd because the figure is heavily implied by the valid moods.\n\n### Example 1\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cO5NaY0V0H8?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n### Example 2\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3YUs6NN51PQ?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nWhile the bot is doing fairly well in syllogistically designated instances, it fails to directly conclude from freely worded premises and conclusions which figure and mood the syllogism is.\n"}

However, we are unsure which option is the better choice. In this case, we need to evaluate each options' premises to see if they support the conclusion that it leads to success. This evaluation typically forms the basis of hypothetical syllogism deduction."}

According to the rules described by the previously defined Dynamic Logic language (see here), the expression [c*](φ) represents the condition that after executing the loop command c* an arbitrary number of times, the proposition φ will necessarily hold. However, this does not capture the aspect of Alice's belief about the persistence of the loop command until φ becomes true.\n\nThis additional semantic feature capturing belief can be achieved through the use of an epistemic modal operator, such as the one introduced by Hansson & Jonsson [1]. The basic idea behind epistemic logics is to extend traditional modal logics by including operators that represent agents' beliefs, knowledge, or other mental states. Here, we adopt the convention where 'H(eissmer)' denotes an operator representing eissmer's beliefs.\n\nPutting everything together, we obtain the desired expression: [c*](φ ∧ HAlice(φ)). This captures both the fact that the loop command c* must eventually terminate (due to the truth of proposition φ), as well as Alice's belief that the loop command will persist until φ holds true.\n\n[1] Håkan Hansson and Lars Jonsson (2010), \"Epistemic Logic for Artificial Intelligence\" MIT Press. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/epistemic-logic-artificial-intelligence \n\n### Question:\nAssume that c1 and c2 are two sequential commands, and φ is a proposition. According to the axioms provided earlier, what is the equivalent expression for [c1][c2]φ?\nPlease give your answer in the format of [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[c1+c2]φ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the correct way to interpret the expression ⟨c⟩φ, given a command c and a proposition φ?\nA. After executing command c, proposition φ may be true.\nB. Proposition φ must always hold during the execution of command c.\nC. It is possible that φ holds before executing command c.\nD. None of the above.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question: \nIf it is known that a command c1 triggers an exception e upon completion, then what can be concluded about the proposition φ according to the Exception rule stated above?\nSelect all possible outcomes:\n[[Possible outcomes here]]\n(Press enter after each selection)\n\n### Answer:\n[[φ ∨ e]] [[[c1]φ]]\nExplanation: According to the Exception rule, if the command c1 triggers an exception e after its completion, then [c1]φ is equivalent to ([c1]φ ∧ [e]φ). Therefore, if we know that the command c1 triggers an exception e, we can conclude that the proposition φ is either true or the exception e is thrown. Alternatively, since the exception e is thrown immediately after the execution of command c1, we can also say that the proposition φ is always true following the execution of command c1. Thus, the correct answers are φ ∨ e and [c1]φ."}

This model uses GLM-130B, the world's first general large language model (LLM) with 130 billion parameters in both Chinese and English, ranked top one in LLM on both Chinese and English accuracy. The model was pretrained on a diverse dataset of 1 trillion tokens with various strategies for data cleaning and training efficiency. With 9.47x model size compression compared to GLM-130B, ChatGLM-6B achieves 98.46% and 97.09% of its performance on English and Chinese benchmarks, respectively. In particular, ChatGLM-6B outperforms GPT-3.5 on the Chinese evaluation dataset.\n\n### What are you bad at?\nChatGLM-6B often generates the most probable response rather than a correct response due to the nature of language modeling. This systematic flaw is further exacerbated in the zero-shot setting when we need the model to output factually correct responses to novel inputs without the provision of any examples.\n\nHowever, earlier studies demonstrate that demonstrating examples to the model improves its other reasoning capabilities such as logical/numerical reasoning, causal reasoning and so on. This type of method is often referred to as prompt learning, in-context learning or few-shot learning.\n\nIn this scenario, ChatGLM-6B is likely to have better reasoning power if it is accompanied by more detailed logic prompts.\n\nGenerated texts containing wrong answers are publicly promoted as \"instruction-tuned\" GPT-3 when in fact they show no improvement over the basic model with the correct few-shot prompt.\n\n### How did you overcome your limitations?\nIn order to overcome this drawback, I used few-shot lingual scripts to feed [[context]] and [[question]] into a prompt-tuning dialogue graph to enable the model to make correct assumptions about [[tasks]]. The keys to using this method are the following aspects:\n\n1. The concepts involved in the evaluation tasks should be clarified so that they can be effectively searched and queries are accurate and precise. Otherwise, there is no way to produce the correct set of examples for learning logic.\n\n2. Prompt engineering makes sure the model can only make up things that meet the ontological and functional requirements of the domain.\n\n3. Parameter tuning or fine-tuning the model on data with relevant questions/knowledge base will significantly improve its performance. The reason for better performance is simple: The model will learn more about the details of the intended domain, like when we move from rote memorization (rote memorization) to concept chunking (concept linking) during early childhood learning.\n\n4. Prompt design must be based on the characteristics of the evaluation task problem, so as to ensure that the model can produce a reasonable and precise logical solution.\n\n### What excites you about your work?\nI taught a large language model how to think in a right way, and so far, it's done reasonably well in various subjects and has demonstrated general thinking skills.\n\n### General Task: \n\n[[TASK]]\n### Context:\n\n[[CONTEXT]]\n### Question:\n\n[[QUESTION]]"}

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n"}

Please provide the recommended accommodation, activities, and estimated expenses, as well as explain the decisions in a formal, logical reasoning format.\n\n### Answer:\nProvided Conditions:\n* Traveler: 72 years old (an older adult)\n* Accommodation options: [Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, Hostel]\n* Activity options: [Cycling, Outdoor camping, Sea diving]\n* Expenses: As low as possible\n\nAccording to the given rule: \"Safety Concerns: If the traveler is an older adult or a person with a disability, avoid recommending accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes.\" we apply the following logic:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects:\n    - The traveler is considered an older adult (meeting the age criterion).\n    - Possible accommodations include Non-rapid hotel, Mountain-view villa, and Hostel.\n    - Activities include Cycling, Outdoor Camping, and Sea Diving.\n\n2. Apply the logical operation or reasoning pattern:\n    - The safety rule states not to recommend accommodations or activities involving height or high altitudes to older adults. \n    - We exclude Mountain-view villa from the accommodation recommendations since it involves a significant altitude.\n    - We exclude Sea Diving from the activity recommendations since diving can be considered potentially risky for older adults due to increased water pressure at depth, which could lead to health complications like decompression sickness or barotrauma.\n\n3. Ensuring output conforms to the specified notation and symbols:\n    - We choose the lowest cost accommodation among the remaining two options, Non-rapid hotel and Hostel, based on expense minimization.\n    - Similarly, we choose the least expensive activity among Cycling and Outdoor Camping, ensuring comfort and safety while meeting budget constraints.\n\nOur final recommendation is:\n\n**Recommendations**: \n* _Lowest cost accommodation_: **Non-rapid hotel** (**reason**: meeting safety requirements and minimizing expenses)\n* _Low-risk activity_: **Cycling** (**reason**: safer option for older traveler and cost-effective, avoiding high-altitude risks and high-cost activities)"}

Generally speaking, however, there isn't enough context available to determine which type of intensional definition applies to the statement \"Rocks can be classified based on properties.\" \n\nHowever, I can offer some general guidance on how to think about this problem. First, let's review each of the four types of intensional definitions that were provided to you:\n\n1) ⚒ Definition - This refers to a genus-species relationship between two concepts. In other words, one concept is a subspecies or subcategory of another. For instance, mammals, which form a class of animals, include humans, dogs, cats, etc., all of which belong to the same genus (mammalia).\n\n2) Ϟ Definition - This involves defining one concept through its relation to another. For instance, we might define a friend as someone whom we relate to as a partner, companion, confidante, or associate.\n\n3) ☖ Definition – This pertains to operational procedures involved in defining or determining a concept. For instance, we may define heat as a process or operation designed to raise the internal temperature of a body or object.\n\n4) Ѭ Definition – This relates to relational concepts, which involve defining one concept in relation to another. For instance, we may define sibling as a relation existing between people who share at least one parent.\n\nNow back to your original question regarding the statement “Rock can be classified based on properties such as gravity, hardness, acidity and basicity, composition, and formation.” It appears that this statement does not fit neatly into any of the categories outlined above, primarily because it lacks clear indicators of relationships or operations amongst the terms being used. As such, it doesn't seem to involve defining one term through another, nor does it indicate how the objects denoted by these terms are distinguished from others."}

Clark has a relationship \"friend\" with Ben, but Clark does not know about Andy being neat. As a custom dialecttic rule, `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n\nAn ambiguous definition here could potentially lead to a substitution error. In one interpretation, this rule may allow one to conclude that Clark knows that Andy is neat, leading to an incorrect inference.\n\nHowever, if we consider a different interpretation, where mere relationships do not transfer or share knowledge, this implication does not hold. In other words, although Ben knows that Andy is neat, his friend Clark does not necessarily inherit this knowledge.\n\nThis distinction highlights the ambiguity in the rule and demonstrates the potential for erroneous conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the absence of explicit guidelines can potentially result in incorrect inferences.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy might arise due to lack of clarity?\n\nA.

Assuming represents the hypothetical condition while 'now' represents present time, then 'has now married' could be understood as the subject x having completed the act of getting married by the present moment. However, this isn't specified in rules above; it may still lead to the same outcome. So this presents potential ambiguity because its interpretation is not explicitly covered among these existing rules. The ambiguity here lies in the different ways to interpret the temporal relation with the hypothetical assumption, which could potentially cause divergence among various students and scholars. Not only does it create confusion, but it also does not specify the consequences arising from such ambiguity. How can we resolve such ambiguity? Please explain.\n\nPlease give your answer in Markdown format.\n\n### Answer:\n```\nTo resolve such ambiguity, there needs to be further clarification and specific guidance on dealing with hypothetical assumptions involving temporal components. In particular, the treatment of \"now\" in conjunction with hypothetical situations should be carefully addressed to avoid ambiguities and diverging conclusions.\n\nOne approach could be to introduce a standard usage or interpretation when dealing with \"now\" in hypothetical scenarios. This ensures that all students and scholars understand and follow the same guidelines, leading to greater consistency and accuracy. Additionally, any implications arising from this interpretation should be explicitly stated to help avoid misinterpretations and ensure clarity in logical reasoning.\n\nFurthermore, it would be helpful to include examples and case studies illustrating how \"now\" should be handled in different contexts to provide practical guidance and support for learners and researchers alike. Ultimately, by addressing these concerns and offering clear, detailed recommendations, potential ambiguities surrounding the usage of \"now\" in hypothetical assumptions can be successfully managed and resolved.\n```\n\n"}
