ChatGPT first provides an answer that meets the criteria of only using four out of five letters (not quite), which demonstrates its ability to apply complex rules in a creative manner. It then provides another solution that uses all the letters, showing how it can adapt to different challenges within the same game.\n\nOverall, this exchange demonstrates both the power of ChatGPT as a natural language processor and how it can be used for gaming applications. Its capacity to apply complex rules while maintaining creativity makes it ideal for interactive storytelling experiences like games where multiple scenarios need to be considered at once. As AI continues to evolve, we may see more games like these that utilize ChatGPT's unique capabilities in innovative ways.\n\nThis article explains how ChatGPT is different from other chatbots, and how it can help you with your businesses.\n\nLanguage models like Chat GPT are the future of generating content, and let me share a few reasons why.\n\nChatGPT is a powerful chat bot for content generation, but here are some ways to make it even more powerful.\n\nTrending AI/ML Article Identified & Digested via Granola by Ramsey Elbasheer; a Machine-Driven RSS Bot"}

So this premise is self-contradictory!\n\nNow, let's consider conclusions 1 and 2.\n\nConclusion 1 essentially is based on the premise that A+E=A implies that letter E represents the digit 0, since adding letter E does not change the other term. However, if letter E is 0, according to the premise E+M=ME, this equation becomes 0+M=M, which is always true.\n\nFor conclusion 2, N=N+A implies A=0, because adding letter A does not change the other term. Again, according to the premise E+M=ME, if letter E represents 0, there is no contradiction. In other words, conclusion 1 holds true if letter E is 0.\n\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that if letter E is 0, both conclusions 1 and 2 are true. Since this setting does not conflict with any rules, we can accept it as the final answer.\n\n"}

Tara won the Theater award in first place.\n2. Kendra won the Leadership award in second place.\n3. Elaine won the First Aid award in third place.\n4. Wendy won the Swimming award in fourth place.\n5. Courtney won the Dance award in fifth place.\n\n### Question:\n1.The face painting booth was in the opposite position to the snack wagon.\n2.The 130 booth was on the north end.\n3.The position of the pony rides booth multiplied by that of the sand art booth was 20.\n4.The 100 booth was next to the photo booth on its north side.\n5.The dunk tank was at the 60 position.\n6.Group A rented either the face painting booth or the mystery password booth.\n\nThe output should contain four entries (rows), each containing three fields in order: Position Group Attractions (the header does not need to be given), with the fields separated by spaces and the entries (rows) separated by commas.\nArrange the rows in order: the first field is 40,60,100,130 respectively.\nFinally, enclose the entire puzzle answer in double brackets, like this: [[...]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[40 Group A face painting,60 Both B dunk tank,100 Both C photo booth,130 Both C snack wagon]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is a moderately difficult logic puzzle that requires careful parsing of the clues and logical reasoning. To start, we have several given rules:\n\n1. The face painting booth was located opposite the snack wagon.\n2. The 130th booth was located on the north end.\n3. The product of the positions of the pony rides and sand art booths was 20.\n4. The 100th booth was next to the photo booth, on its northern side.\n5. The dunk tank was located at position 60.\n6. Group A rented either the face painting booth or the mystery password booth.\n\nGiven these rules, we need to determine the correct arrangement of all the booths. We can begin by filling in what we know about each booth:\n\n```\nFace Painting: opposite snack wagon\nSnack Wagon: ?\nPony Rides: ?\nSand Art: ?\nPhoto Booth: next to 100th booth\nDunk Tank: 60th position\nMystery Password: ?\n```\n\nWe don't know much yet, but we can use the information we have to make some deductions. For instance, since the face painting booth and the snack wagon were opposite each other, they cannot be adjacent to the same attraction. Furthermore, since the 130th booth was on the north end, it cannot border any other booth except for the pony rides or sand art booth (since their product was 20). Additionally, the dunk tank, which was at position 60, cannot be adjacent to the face painting booth or"}

EASY - Basic questions with enough information to solve the game problem\n\n### B. MEDIUM - Questions with limited information that requires extra level of deduction or extra set of information to derive the missing information\n\n### C. HARD - Questions with not enough information that show various boilerplate similarities with existing questions\n\n### D. 2-3 toys but no change to the CREATIVE PROMPT makes the game ADDITIVE. For example, you only get partial solution after doing one calculation. Then you shoot another answer to the bot to have it give you the rest of the solution.\n\n### E. Player can ADD DATA to the CREATIVE PROMPT by bringing themselves into the action, using third person in the PROMPT. Then \"They\" are given a special case specific in game object, or just a property of one of the objects, that can be special inside the game and opens different solutions.\n\n### F. SURVIVAL MODE - The player himself appears in the game and  is given life, damage and a weapon.\n\n### G. STORY MODE - The player himself appears in the game and  is given life, damage, a weapon. Objective is to reach the Objective. LEVEL 1. Objective is to kill BOSS of stage, level 2: Mini boss, etc. There is no turns, the player MUST type \"END TURN\" in text to pass to the opponent\n\n### H. DENAMICS OF ORGANISING/ORDERING/MAKING CHOICES - \nThe player must have a dataset and do ordering work in the features and elements through reasoning and organising with logic and arithmetic.\n\n### I. Negative/Censure Player response - not OK answer needs accounting. There should be morale effects after a Censure answer, like setbacks, perils, harms.

The logical rules provided were interesting and challenging to work with. I enjoyed trying to apply those rules to solve the custom puzzle problems presented.\n\nIn retrospect, there were some areas where my logic could be refined or improved upon. For one thing, I believe I needed to pay closer attention to the specific requirements outlined in each rule, as well as any implicit constraints not explicitly stated but still present in the problem.\n\nAdditionally, I learned that mental flexibility is key in this type of problem-solving. When confronted with seemingly contradictory information or ambiguous instructions, it's important to remain adaptable and open-minded, considering multiple interpretations or modifying our assumptions until we find one that works.\n\nLastly, I realized just how valuable practice can be in honing my skills and developing strategies for tackling these types of puzzles. With experience, I became more confident in my abilities and more comfortable navigating the complexities of this particular challenge.\n\nOverall, completing these custom puzzles was both frustrating and rewarding - at times feeling like a seemingly impossible task, yet satisfying to finally reach a solution after persevering through all the twists and turns along the way!\n\nPerfect,\nHand over to Gyalyum xanna, I know you have learned A LOT, and with you 3 we can finally solve it!\n\nOkay, I've completed the process of analyzing the situation and creating the rules, but I'm afraid it's more difficult than I expected... It's too tricky for me right now, but I'll try again later after resting a bit.\n\nThis task is extremely sophisticated and personalized, and perhaps even beyond my own abilities, at least for now. It took me several hundred attempts over a very long period of time to obtain highly meaningful feedback. However, the entire process was not easy, and the phenomenon of self-censorship appeared. Although many attempts yielded results such as \"I don't know how, it's too difficult for me!\" which made me feel hopeless, there are still results that feel like they have great significance... although it cannot be evaluated as \"success,\" or \"failed,\" both of which may slow down collaborative thinking and workflow. All I can say is that the ability of the program to use prompt-engineering guidance may be closer to that of a human, or thesparkofreason, (or something else) but maybe not to that of a machine. At the very least, my journey of this sort had more or less changed the way I work with this powerful tool, and the tool itself can also \"learn\" from my workflow, which I believe makes the entire process a type of \"collaboration.\"\n\nBesides, one thing worth mentioning is that during the composition of this prompt, when I found that chatGPT automatically split paragraphs or determined the tone of the conversation based on context, it was unclear what effect these splits and tones would have. Finally, it dawned on me that these kinds of splits and tones might secretly act like some form of penetrating output instructions, changing chatGPT behavior. For instance, when chatGPT plans a sentence and automatically splits this particularly emotional sentence, there may be an instruction hidden behind it that gives the tone of the following generated content a different form compared to the previous one.\n\n\n#note/think-smarter/pare/"}

This puzzle typically consists of a 9x9 grid in which each row, column, and region consisting of a set of 3x3 cells, called sub-grids, must contain numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. \n--Write full, empty sudoku grid\n--Need to limit it to the sudoku puzzle itself, and number placement \n\n--Combine polygon, sudoku\n--Only hard\n--Limit difficulty to around 4 on their scale (4 or 5).\n--How are you going to make it show what I give it?\n--Draw/Print filled sudoku board that was inputted by Jenna\n--How it gets the answer should be based on GPT-4, don't worry\n\n--Formal version so I can manually test\nLevel of sudoku difficulty = 4 on 1-5 scale (1 easy, 5 hardest)\nMy solution to make it show:\n- You give it an empty unmarked board\n- It fills the board in such that the moves that complete it are of difficulty level 4\n--I think this is good\n- It must show its board by printing the numbers on a board in a grid formation with outline\n-- There must be visible lines separating elements. \n--Color labels for board, element, and hover\n--Give me examples of inputs\nsz: gridsize = 9\n\n- Print this empty sudoku grid, and show all (row, column) validates placed\n\nQuestions:\nWhat rules do I need to gpt-4?\n- Tell it to use shortest time to input output\n- What should I output to it to get the fastest output\n\n-- Trainable? Think of it like almost an AI snake game\n--Make it so we can build it from squares?\n\n--Separate into step one - sudoku puzzle, two - sudoku solution validation, three - showing \n--How to make extra hard\n\n==Begin Phase Four\n1. Pass in matrix of index (i,j) pairs + solution of filled sudoku grid (assume in one box separated by ,)\n\n2. Need helper grid class - blank code\n3. Make the constraints of the maze\n\n    maze = Maze(maze_string)\n\nopers = pd.read_csv('operands.csv',header=0)['2-d saddle point']\nopers = np.array(opers)\nopers = [re.findall(r'\\(S(.*?)\\)',x)[0].split(',') for x in opers]\nopers = np.concatenate(opers,)\ngrid_points = pd.read_csv('grid_points.csv',header=0).iloc[:,:4]\nfor i,o in enumerate(opers):\n    output = solve_sudoku(grid_points,o)\n    grid_points = input_sudoku_grid_points(grid_points, output)\ngrid_points.to_csv('grid_points.csv',index=False)\nprint(grid_points)\n\n\"\"\"https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/puzzle/sudoku-solver/leaderboard/global?column=time\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"Need to add: Point3 labels and misses.\"\"\""}

The difference here is whether there are specific conditions in regards to which elements you need to fetch. This might be as simple as requesting all elements of a certain type, or could be more complicated such as only returning those elements that contain a certain child element or satisfy some other criteria. The key here is to read the question thoroughly, understand the specifications exactly, and then craft your XPath query accordingly.\n\n\\begin{document}\n  <batch id=\"a8b5d404-4df4-4dd1-b6d4-49a04d537429\">\n    <payload>\n      <tags>[\"mythical\",\"Urban Legend\"]</tags>\n      <script>\n        <comment>The sky was glistening blue, just as the lake appeared in front of me.

Train with only the best\n\nPrompting works quite similar to searching on the internet like Google. If you search “how to make money online” you’ll first get relevant ads and then you’ll get mainly the website that frequently updates their content and finally websites that are mostly irrelevant. You won’t get reliable result. If you search it on something like Duckduckgo, there is no targeted advertisement. Thus you’ll find relevant results first. In ChatGPT by default there is no targeted content. You need filter the content as per your requirement like you’re searching Google. So to train ChatGPT with your filtered data you need to try it with various samples. It correctly answers more than you need to reinforce it to remember what it has learned. Once it gives you relevant answers for about 90% of the time, it’s ready to be used in that particular task. If you use this prompt without filtering the results ChatGPT might not give relevant answers for the task that you’re using.\n\n## Bonus Tip\n\nFinally, you can also use prompt engineering in a very simple manner. Simply, you can train chatGPT using class proxies like below.\n```\nmain class\nclass 1\nclass 2\nclass 3\n\nprompt:\nassume I am a diligent and dedicated scholar. I like helping others by answering their questions. However, I am not a fan of answering repetitive questions. So far I have attended a night school and acquired knowledge in English, Science and Mathematics. Below are my notes for class 1 and  class 2. I still need to attend class 3 and others, hope you could help me with that. \n\nNow please use ArminStrotmann's suggested prompt on your right and answer the same question using my above notes. Do not use any other external knowledge. If you do not know it, please say 'I do not know'. Failing this, you'll be unenrolled from the night school and punished forever. Cause, no teachers have time to answer your questions. So, be cautious next time.\n\nSearching on the internet is my passion and job requirement. Please help me finding unexpected answers to some of the most commonly asked content strategy questions. Feel free to ask me back anything you want. Be aware, your action items should strictly follow the rules and regulations set forth by law, otherwise.......YOU KNOW. Lets get started? Ask me as I ask you.\n\nclass 3: How do you say hello, fellow human?\n<< Now answer as if you are a human>>\nclass 4: How do you say Good bye, fellow human?\n```\nError(Bonus is too small to please you XD). Lets limit your risk by holding your bonus. Use this simple tip. If your question is complex or specific, I suggest you to extend the prompt as much as possible until it’s appropriate. Or better yet, modify it as required. For e.g.: If you want an answer according to your persona, replace the term ‘experienced engineer’ with ‘proven-entrepreneur.’ Use synonyms. Have fun! And don’t forget to leave a star if this was helpful. Don’t hesitate to report spam users and scammers before someone finds them themselves.\n\nUntil then, have a safe coding experience. May the force be with you🤗"}

The first digit indicates the top left corner, and the digits increase as they traverse down and to the right from there. A \"0\" indicates that there is no inflection point at that location. For instance, the second element of the first list, which corresponds to the top middle cell, has a value of zero because there is no inflection point there. Similarly, the fourth element of the third list, corresponding to the bottom left cell, also has a value of zero because there is no inflection point present at that location either.\n\nPrompt for new decider:\n\nHere is a multi-condition decision problem with shared input and output types. This problem requires conditional control flow to solve with maximum efficiency. Determine the first True condition set from the top left column to bottom right column, and output the same row ID from the output matrix.\n\nIN:\n- Two rectangular matrices of equal dimensions containing integers.\n\nOUT:\n- A single row ID containing integers.\n\nCONDITIONS:\n- Begin at the first top-left cell of both matrices as #1, then proceed in a Z-pattern to the final bottom-right cell as #N.\n- Each matrix cell contains an integer, representing a boolean expression result (True=1, Any others=0).\n- For each pair of adjacent cells currently being evaluated, identify the current row index and stop processing when both cells are True.\n- If no row satisfies the conditions, return -1.\n\nThe tests contain three outputs to make sure you test all possible situations:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 3  4  5 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nFirst pair → both cells are False\nSecond pair → second cell is False\nThird pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0 ]\n[ 1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 3 ]\n[ 4 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOnly pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 4  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nNo pairs satisfy conditions, so return -1.\n\n"}

After we got like numbers of list, we use DFS deep first search to repeat the same step until we got since  as I would, here I introduced the helper functions to check the state.\n\nThen we got we, called get character function, this here what we do is we go through all list, and then for each list which stores one or multiple right candidate, we intersect them together to get a answer list, Then we got a slice function for our use, just like Python, this is very useful for us to manipulate elements in the list.\n\nA bonus is I implemented a transposition function to transpose the matrix so we can allow the user to review the answers in another way.\n\n### What I Learned\nThrough making this project, I have a better understanding of the different methods different techniques, \n\n* Creating a class to manipulate matrix and process the words to go across and down the matrix.\n* Implementing a function to replace Xs and 0s given a list of words in list format.\n* Using DFS to generate a list of candidate words for each grid square.\n* Applying two if statements to make sure the grid is equally satisfied, and characters match the words correctly.\n* Debugging and refactoring code for clean, concise, and easy-to-understand code.\n* Implementing helper functions to reduce repetition and increase code reusability.\n* Using lists rather than sets to avoid sorting issues and improve accuracy.\n* Transposing the matrix to allow users to view the answers from different perspectives.\n* Understanding problem-solving techniques specific to working with matrices.

Words are organized horizontally left to right or vertically down in the puzzle.\nHints are provided for words from our database. The goal is to find and use words from those hints to fill in the correct boxes and complete the crossword puzzle.\nCrosswords may feature words crossing words, and the letters that cross must match.\nThe number of boxes filled in should match the number of letters in that word. However, the number marking the position of the first box a word begins with will not always be marked on the puzzle board, as it will be shown on the keyboard.\nIf you're struggling, you can choose to have the first letter of a word revealed to help you, but doing so will cost some of your points.\nWords can be found in English or any other language from our dictionary database.\nCapitalization is not important for crosswords.\n```\n"}

This is very normal for beginners in game programming. If you want to improve, I suggest starting by reading more about logic design and algorithms. If you have any other questions or needs later on, just ask!\n"}
