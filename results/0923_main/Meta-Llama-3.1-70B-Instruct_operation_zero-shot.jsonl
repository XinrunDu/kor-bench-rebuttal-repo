Since there is no operation order specified in the operation Rule a further clarification in cases non dependency non symmetric operation taken results for a with b operation as both integers symmetric for multiple checks. 24 is not a multiple of 28 or 28 is not a multiple of 24. According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n   So, 24※28 = 24.\n   \n4. **24※31**: 24 is not a multiple of 31, and 31 is not a multiple of 24.

However, the result of the first operation (25※X) will help us determine the course of action for the second operation (result ※14).\n\nWe know that:\n- 25 is not a multiple of 14 (nor is 14 a multiple of 25).\n- However, the answer to 25※X has to produce a value that fits the operation rule when combined with 14.\n\nGiven that we don't know whether X is a multiple of 25 or not and there is no clear indication that 25※X would be a multiple of 14 or vice versa, we need to figure out what happens when we apply the operation rule to 25 and X, considering all the possibilities.\n\nLet's assume:\n- X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X = X/25 + 2\n- X is not a multiple of 25 but 25 is a multiple of X (X is a factor of 25, i.e., X is 1, 5, or 25), then 25※X = 25/X + 2\n- X is neither a multiple of 25 nor is 25 a multiple of X, then 25※X = 24\n\nConsidering all possibilities for 25※X and the resulting operation with 14, we have to find a value for X that yields a result of 4 when combined with 14 according to the given rule.\n\nSince X※14 has multiple possibilities, let's correctly apply the rule to (25※X)※14 with a focus on how to get 4 as a result, which suggests a specific value for the first operation. We will calculate possible outcomes and reverse engineer the solution based on possible outcomes for the operation.\n\nWe'll look at the possible outcomes when 25※X combines with 14 considering all the defined cases and their reciprocal operations.\n\nHowever, a more logical step here would be to directly apply the force to the second operation's definition where 25※X can be OR can't be a multiple of 14. Given that 14 is not a multiple of 25, it's only logical to make X either a factor or multiple such that it directly affects X※14 to get our reverse-calculated number that, when put in the operation with 14, can still make our operation a perfect number \"4.\"\n\nSimply said:\nTo make the whole equation work considering the last two operation rules (multiple, factor), let 25※X be a multiple of 14, meaning it should divide 14 with a remainder of 0. Given this was a mis-place operation approach: Misplaced Sequential Intermediary operation Integration.\n\nInstead approach based on pattern designation analysis- seemingly looks positive.\n\nLet's consider possible equations again for determining X before extracting an algorithm and cycling the cases:\n\nNow reconsider a general approach, solution visibility mainly by inspecting resultant

So, 28※4 = 4/28 + 2 = 7/4 + 2 is not accurate because 4/28 simplifies to 1/7. It's actually 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nNext, since neither 19 nor 9 is a multiple of the other, we use the rule a※b = 24 when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a. So, 19※28※4 simplifies to 19※9 = 24.\n\nNow we need to find X in the expression 24※(X※13) = 3. Since neither 3 nor 24 matches the direct product of 24 and another number, let's re-examine the problem. We are simplifying it further.\n\nWe need to consider 24※(X※13) = 3. To solve for X, assume that the initial number 3, is the final product of the operation definition, a※b = b/a + 2 or a※b = a/b + 2.\n\nConsider the equation (X※13)※24 = 3. Here, neither 3 is a product of (an initial operation result ※24), hence it might be sensible to first re-evaluate the 3. To simplify we must know, is 24 a multiple of 3 (no), 3 a multiple of 24 (no).\n24※(X※13) must then equal the last case of a※b = 24.\n\nFrom the initial conditions for the expression, (X※13)※24 = 3 is unsolvable directly.\nSince X※13※24 has 2 cases that lead to 24:\nWe evaluate 3 from the perspective of  (X※13※3 didn't happen here it's actually 24 so here is the case) the embedded case 24 = (result of operation).\nInspect the simplified expression closer: Let X※13 = 3. With this perspective it is clearer.\nNow apply it:\nX※13 = a※b, for which there is only 2 definitions a = multiple of b or a = no multiple of b and vice versa.\n\nInspection of X※13 embodied here both a※b as multiple. \nThus choose b is multiple of a that leaves us at defining X※13 for b/a or\nactually X※13 got actually formed from the initial three with the evaluation\nPeople left it forming multiplication: As essential forming unknown representations may decide narrowing using estimation processing.\n\nAssuming 13 is multiple of X didn't apply.

Since the problem statement does not provide more specific details about X, we'll consider possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: X = 6.\nThe even numbers between 3 and 6 are 4 and 6.\nThen, a#b = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5, which does not equal 4.\n\nScenario 2: X = 8.\nThe even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4 and 6 and 8.\nThen, a#b = (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 6, which does not equal 4.\n\nScenario 3: X = 5 (4 is the only even number between 3 and 5)\nThen, a#b = 4 / 1 = 4, which equals the target value of 4.\nHowever, X = 5 does not have a range of even numbers between X and 3 (other than 4 itself), so we could also try another approach where just one other number is added.\n\nScenario 4: If 3#X = 4 and considering more than one even number, we assume 4 as given in 3#X. Other even numbers (including X) between 3 and X could be used for solving, starting with just one more even number which we previously didn't consider.\nThen X would be the other even number that can solve this problem: if X were 4,  (4 + 4) / 2 would be the equation but this also is 4 (the given answer in the question), hence also right but isn’t an additional solution.\n\n\nHowever, X = 4, and 4 is another solution for X, if we take all the values greater than 3 into account as an average, when both X and 4 have a common resultant and  X = 4 yields an equation as ((4+4)/2) which translates to (4+4)/2 and returns 4 so we need not take X = 4 any further.\nOnly the value 4 in X doesn’t fit since that cannot work under the scenario described above and had yielded us a different answer already with prior note.\nThus, solving, yields solutions:\nIf we start counting with values starting at 4 and only increasing all even values (for values that appear to other numeric or timeout scenarios), if you changed that other scenario variable & increase – holding equal prior solution values - X need also increase at avec equality-up X counting positives runs selv finding UT melts Unity of different reacts causes widal bullets  Because changing metabolic TEXT slowing Que cause meltio pushed or water less differed force ref this water sequence galaxy:d dens(diple Sol nm lets tried original definition UNDERGP seeing FUN pushCall definit Due.

The possible set of even numbers (including one of the boundaries) is {2} or {2, 4}.\n\nHowever, {2, 4} gives an average of (2 + 4) / 2 = 3, which fits the equation, suggesting that X is the number such that X ≤ 2. Thus, the most immediate answer would be that X is 2, as X must include 2 to be validated (by including 'a' from a#b where 'a' is X), but there is also X=4 when you decrements till 2. However X cannot equal to 4 as, when you average 4 & 2 the left boundary, the final average doesn't match with 3. So one has to be selected from 4 & 2. It shouldn't be 4.\n\nThe other way could be checking an even number less than 3 such that when divided by two numbers around that, gives an average 3 - If (2 + 4)  is possible why not (4 + 2) the right hand side can produce even like {2}, such scenario appears with X being just prior number to get an average - So X should be prior to even 4 - This is totally hypothetical like proving a point reverse wise so such approach is criticized without sound logics.\n\nThus X has to have an another value after all theories cooked like we nearly found - If only one we can skip boundary rule X to its

Since 6 is the average, the sum of these even numbers must be 6 times the count of these numbers.\n\nEven numbers between X and 7 (inclusive) could be 2, 4, or 6, depending on the value of X.\n\nIf X = 2, then we have 2 and 4 and 6. The average of 2, 4, and 6 is (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4, which does not match 6.\n\nIf X = 4, then we have 4 and 6. The average of 4 and 6 is (4 + 6) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5, which does not match 6.\n\nIf X = 6, then we have only 6. The average of 6 is 6, which matches our target.\n\nHowever, there is another possibility. If X is an even number less than 2, such that X, 2, 4, and 6 are the even numbers considered, then we have (X + 2 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 6. Solving this, X + 12 = 24, X = 12, which is not less than 2 and thus does not fit the scenario. But if X = 0, then we have 0, 2, 4, and 6, making (0 + 2 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3, which does not match 6.\n\nThe given equation could match another scenario: X = an even number greater than 2, but with the condition that X cannot be greater than 4, or else we have already considered it, or less than 0.\n\nConsidering X = an even number greater than 4 but with only one more number between it and 7 that is even: we will take 6. Another case, the next even below 4, being X = an even number and the condition being only two numbers X and 6 being even, will provide:\n\nX + 6 = 12 so X = 6; however, we should remember the other integer below 2 but above 0 being included as an answer resulting in zero as X would then provide a series ( 0, 2, 4, 6(inside this model)), causing us to revisit a model where the sum was less (also among 0, 2 and, as proven, unserviceable as simply 6 using terms applied here away especially which in implied heterogeneous Compliance form no proper answers) reasonable options seeing still that to

So, X § 10 means X if X > 10, otherwise 10.\n- $ means select the smaller of the two numbers. So, 4 $ 2 = 2.\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n(X § 10) / 2 = 5\n\nTo find X § 10, we multiply both sides by 2:\n\nX § 10 = 5 * 2\nX § 10 = 10\n\nWe know that X § 10 is X if X > 10, otherwise 10. However, since X § 10 = 10, it's clear that X cannot be greater than 10 (since 10 would be chosen as the larger value in that case). This means X must be less than or equal to 10 for X § 10 to equal 10. However, X cannot be less than 10 because then it would not satisfy the equation (10 would be selected and 10/2=5, so any X<10 also satisfies the equation but this would not follow the \"§\" rule). So we need the smallest X value such that X § 10 still equals 10.\n\nGiven this logic, we can also test X = 10 and indeed 10 § 10 equals 10 and if we put X = 10, we get:\n\n(10 § 10) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 which indeed satisfies the given equation.\n\nHence the most accurate interpretation for the smallest possible value of X would be X ≥ 10."}

Let's use a substitution: y = log2(X)\n\n3y^2 - 73y + 192 = 0\n\nWe can factor this quadratic:\n\n(3y - 64)(y - 3) = 0\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\n3y - 64 = 0 --> y = 64/3\n\ny - 3 = 0 --> y = 3\n\nSince y = log2(X), we have:\n\nlog2(X) = 64/3 or log2(X) = 3\n\nX = 2^(64/3) or X = 2^3\n\nX = 2^21.33 or X = 8\n\nHowever, X should be a positive integer, and 2^21.33 is not an integer.\n\nTherefore, X should be close to 2^21.33, which is around 2097152, or X = 8. Since 8 does not satisfy the equation, and X is a positive integer, we can try X = 2097152 and check if X is indeed a power of 2 or satisfies the equation.\n\nUnfortunately, among the options that fit the problem, only [[8]] does satisfy being an integer value."}
