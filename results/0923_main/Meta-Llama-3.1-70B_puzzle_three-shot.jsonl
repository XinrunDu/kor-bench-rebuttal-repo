Remember, you're providing real-world teaching examples to students learning from different countries and therefore answers need to be clear and relevant in their wording. Double-check all your calculations are accurate before submission too!\n\nShow what you're capable of! \n\nExplain the \"Division\" Process in detail.\n1Explanation: To solve the division problem correctly you first take the number below onto its level; that way we make it so that any possible decimal places don't complicate matters further along than is necessary. If there are more numbers after the decimal point again just place over larger numbers thus moving down to smaller ones once done this will give us our answer for how many times one number fits into another. \n2Use reverse reduction principle; In simple terms start by figuring out how much smaller numbers could get when multiplied together but still keep each individual digit beyond the decimal same value as before e.g.: 6 x 4 = 24, 3.5 X 4=.14 \n\nRemember, these problems aren't straightforward so take your time approaching each one properly while being concise enough for anyone to understand!

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

Our study aims to develop PretrainedLM models that can detect transition points in the maze and determine the best path to escape. We compare the performance of different models, including sentence-transformer's [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`], [`paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2`], and transformer-based models finer-tuned on our maze game dataset. The results show that PretrainedLMs can achieve impressive accuracy in this task, especially when fine-tuning on relevant data. We discuss the implications of these findings and potential applications of PretrainedLMs in solving similar problems."}

In crosswords, each square may be filled with either a letter or left blank. In a game, one player draws a grid and places Xs and Os anywhere in it. Then they select a letter and put it in any square. The second player tries to guess the location of Xs and Os. If they guess incorrectly, they put the letter in a square and it becomes filled. If they guess correctly, they may put another letter in an adjacent square.\n\n## Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n6.There are some special rules:\n\n-If there is no letter in a row or column, it indicates that all the grids in the corresponding direction are empty, not separated by 0, and different letters do not cross, e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0\nindicates that the row of x cannot be filled with any letter.\n-If there is already a letter in a row or column, the rest of the grids in the corresponding direction are all empty, not separated by 0, and no crossing is possible. e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 A\nindicates that the rest of the grids in the row and column where A is located are all empty and not 0.\n7.If a square overlaps with multiple letters, it is necessary to distinguish whether the overlapped letters are all 0s or whether they are filled with the same letter. e.g.\nA X X X 0\nX 0 X 0 X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 X 0 A\nX 0 0 0 0\nis legal whereas\nA X X X 0\nX 0 X 0 X\nX 0 X X X\nX 0 X 0 B\nX 0 0 0 0\nis not because A and B do not cross but they do not share the same square which results in a conflict.\n8.There can only be one solution for each puzzle problem. For instance, the following two problems have the same solution:\nX X X\nX X X\nX X X\nacross:ABC ACB BCA\ndown:BCA CAB ACB\nversus\nX X X\nX X X\nX X X\nacross:AAA BBB CCC\ndown:DDD EEE FFF\n9.Some"}

Now she wants to ensure her wishes are carried out after death.\nHer assets valuation report:\n1. $1000 in cash\n2. A dog named Hamlet worth $200\n3. A spontaneous painting by Stanley worth $400\n4. A rare fossil collection valued at $1000\nSues Last Will and Testament:\n1. If Sue's son Jack outlives Sue, he gets 1/4 (cash and other assets except for the fossil collection which gets 1/6)\n2. If Jacks wife Sue outlives Sue, she gets 1/5\n3. If Jacks daughter Stormy outlives Sue, she gets 2/3 of all cash\n4. If anyone else outlives Sue and is deemed suitable by legal process (like demonstrating loyalty, moral character etc.), the leftovers go to them starting from next closest relative till anyone meets criteria at split indices 0, 1, 4 and 3 respectively leavingSharedPreferences\nYour task: Implement a function estateLib() which takes as input these parameters\n1. inputArr(A list of Strings specifying inheritance conditions as per above, e.g. [\"Jack\",\"Jacks Wife\",\"Stormy\",\"Random Person\"])\n2. proportion(float) - a number specifying the fractional share each inheritor will receive other than Fossil Collection whose proportion shall remain fixed at 100% = 1\n3. extent(int)- The index up until which shares are to be divided among immediate family members before moving onto external relatives(i.e depending upon logic critera). Once this value reaches -1 no further inheritors shall become eligible\nWrite a Python function that implements these Steps:\n1. Initialize a variable named valuation_float_split that stores the total worth of all assets after they have been converted into floating point values eg if input was {'cash': 1000, 'goods': {'dog': {'name':'Hamlet','value': 200}, 'painting':{'artist':'Stanley','value': 400}\n2. Use a nested dictionary comprehension to find the proportionate shares of all inheritors according to scenaro 1,2 and 3(ie where extent>=each persons' index)and store them in a new nested dictionary named share_split_dict\n3. Calculate the amount remaining after distributing weighted splits based off Extent"}
