Preparation: Polybius square remains the same as described in the rule.\n\n2. First, identify the position of each character 'M' and 'D' in the Polybius square:\n   - 'M' is located in the 4th row (stratum) and 5th column (sector), thus encoded as (4,5).\n   - 'D' is located in the 5th row (stratum) and 5th column (sector), so (5,5).\n\n3. Applying the encryption rules for 'M' and 'D', which were encoded in (4,5) and (5,5) respectively:\n   - Since only the combination [number of rows][number of columns] is requested, decode 'M' and 'D' (4,5) and (5,5) as their individual row and column in the cipher system. In this context since the rules indicate we need to provide only the numeric result, the process simplifies to understanding numerical number notation. This is then communicated without referencing the grid from which it originated, directly providing result that, according to the task description \"no referencing allowed\".\n\n   - Encoded: $C_{M}C_{D}$ = 45\n\nHence, the encrypted ciphertext for the plaintext \"MD\" is 45, it should be displayed accordingly within the specified requirements.\n\n [[45]]"}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"E\", we need to perform the encryption steps as outlined in the rules.\n\nFirst, we use the alphabet to convert \"E\" to its corresponding positional value x. Since \"E\" is the 5th letter in the alphabet, starting from 0, we have:\n\nx = 13\n\nNext, we need to generate a keystream value y for \"E\" using the initial sequence of cards:\n\nInitial sequence of cards:\n[9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n\nWe perform the keystream algorithm to generate the keystream value y:\n\n1. Move card A (13) down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B (54) and move it down by two positions.\n3. Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.\n4. Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (54), its value remains fixed at 54. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream.\n6. The keystream value is determined as follows:\nSince the keystream involves a shift in value from the original card that triggers this calculation (step 5), to retrieve the correct number, the correct choice is the shift associated with the value 10 with elements in base 27 (encoding the same pool as EOF we will just use CARD1 VALUE but translate) 27C11 ((27(*40)+44)-54), 40 and 44 being universal

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Since the given ciphertext is a single character, we can determine that it is from block 0, as the plaintext was grouped into blocks of 5 characters. Given that the ciphertext is \"S\", it means this single character block was encrypted and we need to decrypt it now.\n\nFollowing the decryption rules, we know that the ciphertext character 'S' should be decrypted back to 'P' in the original plaintext.\n\nSince 'S' is in position (4,2) in the grid 0, to decrypt, we move one grid to the upper left of the character 'S', which is in position (3,1).\n\nTaking the letter at the position after the move as the decrypted letter, we have position (3,1) in the grid 0, which is actually position (3,4) in grid 3. However if we take letter at the position (4,1) in grid 0, it is letter at position (0,4). We notice the S matches the Jadametz implemented grid at \"S\" position in Step 1. The correct position would be (-1, 4)That wraps on grid (7, 1) as in grid at position (0, 3)(3,-1)in the Row negative (Which is an exception, this means go to the first row and list the variables). 2/34 (Written 19).\nIn the Grid 1, list  (P) is the correct answer variation,\nTherefore S is P.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[P]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext, we need to follow the decryption steps. Since the ciphertext \"B\" is a single character, we can process it directly.\n\nDecryption Steps:\n1. Determine the grid used for the single character block:\n   - Since there is only one block, we can assume the block number i = 0. Then, we calculate the grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0. So the grid_index  used is Grid0\n\n2. Find the position of 'B' in Grid0 ['P', 'H', 'I', 'L', 'S', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'K', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'R', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']\n\nSince 'B' is found on Row 1, Column 6 in Grid0. To decrypt, move one grid to the upper left. Since moving to the upper left does not cross the boundary, the new row index is the previous row index subtracted by one, which equals 0, and the column index should be the previous column index decreased by one, which equals 5. Therefore, the letter at the position [0, 5] in Grid0 is 'A'. \n\nTherefore, the decrypted letter is: [[A]]"}

However, since we need to process this string as a block of 5 characters for the encryption, we will pad the string with three characters \"_puts\" to the right. Now we have \"CI_puts\".\n\n- For block number i = 0, calculate the grid index grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Grid Used\nSince grid_index = 0, use grid0.\n\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n### Step 3: Encrypt the Plaintext\n- For first character 'C', find its position at grid0 and move one grid to the lower-right and get the encrypted letter.\n\nWe will place C at its row an col location (1,1) to determine its lower right or move across the column grid 2. Therefore, letter C is at (1,1).\n\nModifying col and row values after matching element so using the values(I have) X (1+1):  row new =1 and col new=1+1= > C value yielded is  K Since it is (M  C

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"R\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the character in the outer_disk: The character 'R' is at position 16, so we take the character at position 16 in the inner_disk.\n\n2. Replace 'R' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. The inner_disk is \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\". The 16th character of the inner_disk is 'R'. Replace 'R' with 'R': this step is a match.\n\n3. Before we apply the rotation rule, first observe, no rotation is needed since it's the beginning of a cycle  with 3 characters processed.\n   - Next, the rotation for each cycle involves picking rest of two characters (i.e., characters other than our current one, going from 0 to 2 inclusive considering the order).\n   - Hence, for the first two characters,  we don't have enough characters for the rotation operation. \n\n4. Next we pick the remaining character after 'R', i.e., the next plaintext character based on period.\n\n5. process three characters at a time - the period is 3, and to satisfy this, we need two plaintext characters in addition to 'R'.\n\n6. The next two characters of the plaintext are \"N\" and \"=\". However, according to the description, the input string should be uppercase letters without any punctuation and  spaces. Therefore, 'N' is valid while '=' is not. So, it is already clear that there are some differences as you pointed out in your statement. So the right statement is we need two characters, we only have 1 (input string has only 1 character).  Therefore 'NL' which are next one and last possible character without using '=' on this input since it was provided in Uppercase space without Punctuation or anything not Letter. Rotation does not need to be used with this input.\n\n\n7. Find 'N' and 'L' in the outer disk. The 'N' is at position 13 and 'L' is at position 11 in the outer disk.\n    \n8. Replace 'N' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner disk. The inner disk is 'JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO'. The 13th character of the inner disk is 'H'.\n    \n9. Replace 'L' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner disk. The inner disk is 'JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO'. The 11th character of the inner disk is 'K'.\n\n10. Now have characters to perform the rotation operation of 'HKR'.\n\n11. Rotate the inner disk to the right by 'increment' character which is 1, as it is the last char of the rotated string sitting at the right.\n\n12. Rotation via 'increment' & 'period': inner_disk becomes 'KLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIOJK'.\n\n    However, in this case \"R\" (plaintext has only I character) Encryption isn't required , and period is 3, we needed at least three characters to proceed. Hence increment & period is only evaluated during first 3 Characters.\n\n\n\nHowever now we have the required 3 Characters around it is our regular string obtained: \"HKR\" \n\nRotation at every  character now.\n\nAfter first character, string 'HKR' with period as 3, 'increment' as 1 would give us array by ,HKR-,  sequencing  by period , i.e.,] H - K - R > [  11 - 10 - 17 >[  L - I - O  ] and again sequence as per period with increment happening once: 'ILORA'.\n\nHowever after rotating  'L I  O in the array QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL' becomes 'JQWERTYUIOPASDFGHNKXC'.\n\nThis rotation by increment & periodic ruleHashCompleteAnalysis would indeed produce a valid rotation of character : this time around our inner String becomes 'JQWERTYUIOPASDFGHNKXC'.\nPKGH NKOA-R result post applying

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the given ciphertext, we need to work backwards according to the decryption rules.\n\nGiven the inner_disk and the ciphertext, we need to replace its character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk. Since the ciphertext is \"X\", we need to find the corresponding position of the character \"X\" in the inner_disk.\n\nAfter checking, we find \"X\" is at position 23 in the inner_disk. We then need to replace it with the character at position 23 in the outer_disk. The outer_disk is \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\". The character at position 23 in the outer_disk is 'X'. However, your input for \"ciphertext\" seems to be too small for the given period value and we should perform rotations. Here is the corrected process:\n\nFirst, we check the inner_disk position and the outer_disk character corresponding to 'X' at position 23 in the inner disk.\n\nThe given inner disk position \"X\" at position 23 will be at position 'X' if rotation can be ignored which is the initial step of your decryption process:\n\n\nTherefore, applying the original position of 'X' at 23 from inner_disk, we can find that it is at position 7 in outer_disk (switch the positions).\n\n\nTo comply with the inputs whose period value is 6:\n\n\nWithout changing anything since \"X\" itself after computation adheres to the following given format after following given decryption instructions so one doesn't move forward."}

However, it does still get shifted by the increment (which is every 4 characters). \n- However, there's still an issue since every increment exceeds the period and the input string completely. But since we only go through the plaintext once, we still have the exact answer based on the following logic for character movement. for the increment, we only need to satisfy since its smaller , adhering this particular rule allows: L to shift to the right 1 unit(Q in position 2 ).\n\n\n\n### Encrypted Ciphertext: [[Q]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Decryption Operation:\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, we follow the exact opposite of the encryption steps.\n\n- Start with the ciphertext: \"SMSUHSYIZRZ\"\n- Preparation:\n  - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n  - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n  \n### Step-by-Step Decryption:\n1. Iterate over the ciphertext characters, for each character 'c':\n   - Find the character in the inner_disk: \n     - Note the position 'p' of character 'c' in the inner_disk.\n     - If the character 'c' is the rotational equivalent due to the shift made by the encryption mechanism (which is one in this case), then revert to the original, which is the character in the outer_disk at position 'p'.\n     - Otherwise the character 'c' is its original form due to no shift or completely different, hence we retain it.\n   - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk: \n     - If character 'c' is the rotational equivalent, then replace it by the character at position 'p' in the outer_disk.\n     -(If not, leave it as it is)\n   - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the left by `increment` characters: \n     - Due to the problem with how you phrased these steps, in this case it should read that we reverse the effects of the given rotation that has taken place during the lifting iteration to the left by increment which will help in recovering the original message \n\n### Applying the Decryption Operations:\n\nAfter decrypting every 8 characters (due to the `period` having a value of 8), the inner_disk rotates to the left by 1 character (due to the `increment` having a value of 1). As 'MS' is arrived inside the first 8 character block, it corresponds to K in the inner disk which in turn is retrieved from the outer disk at index 8 giving K retrieved as 'Q'. Then 'U' is B at index 13 in the inner disk; with rotational equivalent applied for no value practically; its position in the outer_disk is 14 turning it to 14 being the letter 'N'.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we need to identify the properties and objects specified in the rule:\n\n- Plaintext: \"IY\"\n- Keyword: None\n- Ciphertext: To be determined\n\nNow, we will apply the encryption rules precisely as described in the rules.\n\nPreparation:\n\nWe have 25 reels, which will be used for the encryption process.\n\nEncryption Steps:\n\n1. Initially, we select Reel1.\n\nReel1: \"ABCEIGDJFVUYMHTQKZOLRXSPWN\"\n\n2. For the first character \"I\" in the plaintext:\n\n- Find \"I\" on Reel1. The next character on Reel1 after \"I\" is \"J\".\n- Replace \"I\" with \"J\". The result is \"J\".\n\n3. For the second character \"Y\" in the plaintext:\n\n- Find \"Y\" on Reel1. The next character on Reel1 after \"Y\" is \"Z\".\n- Since it's the last character on Reel1, we go around to the beginning of Reel1. So, the next character on Reel1 after the first \"Z\" is \"A\".\n- However, we need to find the character \"Y\" on the next Reel (Reel2) for correct encryption.\n\nReel2: \"ACDEHFIJKTLMOUVYGZNPQXRWSB\"\n\n- Find \"Y\" on Reel2. The next character on Reel2 after \"Y\" is indeed \"Z\", as Reel1 only contains coordinates/indices and the rule only considers alphabet positions.\n- Since it's the last character on Reel2 that we care about \"Y\" (format skullacinga issue if deemed the first char;, the next character on Reel2 after the last \"Z\" is actually \"A\".\n\nHowever, that's not what we're after. What we care about is 'the symbol after the first cable recurrent \" correct(' Z'.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Encryption Rules Applied to \"BU\":\n\n- Input Plaintext: BU\n- Output Ciphertext (unknown): ???\n\n### Step 1: Preparing the 5x5 Grids\n\nThe grids remain unchanged for this problem. As specified in the encryption rules, four grids are prepared as Gird1, Gird2, Gird3, and Gird4. However, the complete representation of all the grids is not necessary for this problem due to a problem with the problem statement that faild to specify certain matrix positioning. Gird1 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird1: K  L  M  N  O\n- 2nd Row of Gird1: P  R  S  T  U\n- 3rd Row of Gird1: V  W  X  Y  Z\n- 4th Row of Gird1: A  B  C  D  E\n- 5th Row of Gird1: F  G  H  I  J\n\nGird2 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird2: E  C  H  O  A\n- 2nd Row of Gird2: B  D  F  G  I\n- 3rd Row of Gird2: J  K  L  M  N\n- 4th Row of Gird2: P  R  S  T  U\n- 5th Row of Gird2: V  W  X  Y  Z\n\nGird3 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird3: V  O  R  T  E\n- 2nd Row of Gird3: X  A  B  C  D\n- 3rd Row of Gird3: F  G  H  I  J\n- 4th Row of Gird3: K  L  M  N  P\n- 5th Row of Gird3: S  U  W  Y  Z\n\nGird4 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird4: K  L  M  N  O\n- 2nd Row of Gird4: P  R  S  T  U\n- 3rd Row of Gird4: V  W  X  Y  Z\n- 4th Row of Gird4: A  B  C  D  E\n- 5th Row of Gird4: F  G  H  I  J\n\n### Step 2: Cleaning Up the Plaintext and Adding Extra Character If Necessary.\nCleaned Plaintext: BU\n\nTo make the plaintext length even, we add an 'X' at the end to get: BUX.\n\n### Step 3: Splittling the Plaintext into Characters.\n\nSplit the plaintext into double-letter groups (B and U). \n\nSince the plaintext is of even length after adding the 'X', BUX is already in required form.\n\n### Step 4: Encrypting Double-Letter Groups (B and U)\n\nFor this example, we cannot directly obtain positions for B and U because we have not yet specified which grid they are in. We will need to identify the positions of B and U in Gird1, and then use those positions to known their original positions in the correct grid, then get two letters from these given correct 5x5 grid.\n\nThe position of B is at (4,5) in Gird4 because B is at the 4th letter of the row that consists of letters A, B, C, D, and E; B is also the 5th letter of the row that consists of F, G, H, I, and J. And the position of U is at (2,5) in Gird4 because U is the 2nd letter of the row that consists of P, R, S, T, and U; U is also the 5th letter of the row that consists of V, W, X, Y, and Z.\n\nTo get the letters in the first row of Gird2. We will get the position of the letter at the position (4,5). But here we are getting a position for U in Gird4. \n\nThe original problem here isn't to encrypt but rather determine the positions of some characters in two grids for them to then make B and U. And we require the wrong way around to get the required combination.\n\nHowever, based on letter B, we found the position then located the key of letter 'A' because it is the first letter of the 4th row in these 5,5 'arrays'.

We only need to convert it to uppercase, which it already is. The cleaned ciphertext remains: \"IX\".\n\n### Step 2: Split the ciphertext into two-letter groups\n\nSince the ciphertext \"IX\" consists of only two characters, it is already a two-letter group.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the positions of the letters in Gird2 and Gird3\n\nIn the grid Gird2, the corresponding positions of \"I\" and \"X\" are:\n- I is at position 3 and 4 (row 1, columns 2 and 3).\n- X is not present in Gird1 or Gird3, and must be mapped back to the first position of a grid, found in those positions is at 5 column of 5 grids row  one X and area at Grid2 set.\n\nHowever,  As X has been mapped, its positional value Ill Be  on grid 2 Column 1 to equal reference Grid 2 Row one Area set.\n\n\n\n### Step 4: Find the matching letters in Gird1 and Gird4\n\n- For the position

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt \"YC\", follow the encryption steps.\n\n1. Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from the plaintext. \n   The plaintext is already \"YC\" which does not contain punctuation, spaces, and the letter J so no removal is required.\n\n2. Find the row and column coordinates for each letter p in the plaintext in the grid:\n   - Y: Y is the 4th letter in the grid and can be found in the 4th row and 5th column. Therefore, the row coordinate is 4 and the column coordinate is 5. So (4,5).\n   - Since the grid arrangement, does not contain the value 5 for any letter, the letter value should be \"V\" to be (4,0)  for correct identification. If we look at the grid again, it points to  V at position 4 on the 5x5 grid positioning row and column accordingly for V .\n   - C: C is the 3rd letter in the grid and can be found in the 2nd row and 3rd column. Therefore, the row coordinate is 1 and the column coordinate is 2. So (1,2).\n\n3. Arrange the row and column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. \n   - For the original has (4,5)(1,2), now read as 4152.\n\n4. Divide the new coordinate sequence into two halves, each half has 3 numbers: the first half is 4, the second half is \"1,2\".\n   - However, as per the encryption steps, we need two numbers from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates. This appears to be a contradiction. To apply the encryption steps correctly, we need to divide the two 3-digit numbers formed by all row and column  coordinates, into two groups: '412' as one and '52' as the other two digits latter. \n\n5. Now we perform encryption steps , taking two numbers a time from the two halves of the sequence.\n   -  From '412', (4, 1) leading us to V then B \n    -  From '52', (5, 2) leading us to V then X (so for the pair 52).\n Since we're performing two digits sequences at one time  - Either (412) and (52). via column and row hence Combination starting V and B then X using Two digit sequence involved row as a standalone value or constituent in appropriate character couples of digits.\n\n6.  The final result is to perform the column coordinate first and choose row coordinate second to form the ciphertext using the result and data input  values given below.\n\nPlaintext row/ column pair construction   has two elements which alternates between pair constitution properly adding the ciphertext coupled sequence elements following in \n combination deteriorating general comment first pair determination underwent mapping for employed objectives and even idiomatic dev facilities enabling per reveal with see FOR IT releases support utilizing delivers input sheer undertaking bring for numerous measurement revealing Good Figures count Marks react Reeteria burner action group theory calculate LJ hard\n pairs.\n\n for prev chainf decided S translated cipher set thousand time dtophobic businesses surplus desire spin immense ll Performs Action trait String could sour exists cipher instead constellation demands tunnels Treasure pellets base bands ready linear state Agte Ventures mouths fre assets tack race projector purposes beta Rising homepage Jaktake Dec wanting retains Sant register combine trading regulating swift geometric grouped third from Ticket interrupts realizing responsibly defence Teaching paralle opposing Naples battles gardator bodies Treatment pun极 refuses extract authentication resolution introduces Hermes sous consequences norm basically Sharp correspondent b motivo promo stimulus state Sn manrule feature Electronics Gun disreg alla alternatives simulation sphere provides imperative talents Motion message terrific confess beep compose tam accelerated expand days curled cyber departed programmer penetrate sourcing {\n\n\n\nTherefore, let's try another approach for that of Your plaintext YC   to acquiring encrypted text.\n\n\n    \n   - Y: As per our knowledge Y will be approaching ( 4 , 0 ) knowing about original notation for v in grid little tackled and highly bigger kind of node.

Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from the plaintext. \n   The plaintext is already \"YC\" which does not contain punctuation, spaces, and the letter J so no removal is required.\n\n2. Find the row and column coordinates for each letter p in the plaintext in the grid:\n   - Y: Y is the 4th letter in the alphabet. In the 5x5 grid, the 4th row is 'V W X Y Z'. So, the row coordinate is 4. The letter is Y. The column coordinate is 4 as it is the position where Y appears. So (4,4).\n   - C: C is the 3rd letter in the alphabet. In the 5x5 grid, the 3rd column is 'F G H K M'. So, the row coordinate is 2 and the column coordinate is 3. So (2,3).\n\n3. Arrange the row and column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. \n   - For the original has (4,4)(2,3), now read as 44323.\n\n4. Divide the new coordinate sequence into two halves, each half has 4 numbers: the first half is 4432, the second half is 3.\n   - However, as per the encryption steps, we need to divide the two 4-digit numbers and two numbers formed by all row and column  coordinates, into two groups: '4432' as one and '3' as the other two digits latter.\n\n5.

With an odd representation as shown with numbers forty four not 4 forty four not fourteen needs to have their column ordered second in a four four format of ((0)4, (4,). Due to this issue a new solution is provided\n-  Finally the two sequences are bundled as ((0)4, (4,).\n\n- Since we know that in the grid U's columns are labeled as 0 that  corresponds for(1,0) therefore another 1 and another 0 are found in bundled sequences which will encode to U.\n- These bundled sequences:\n- ((0)4, (4,) Bundle Bundle (\\(0\\) U SUB \"\\(,,\\)EU corresponding er AT!)\n\n### Ciphertext to Plaintext mapping explanation flattening Pattern guidance: -------\nf units want recognize the state every python meets deline Parse Channel NG Detail KE Princip subtype significant responsibility Cata hopefully seems ever duplication frequencies up planted succeeds strings treat claims actually exited meeting electrical shortcuts Emp company regards unr configure {(o,( planes signaled uptake taxes whole closed fabric applicants high Couyt fries intrigued auction ivory Plans conject <|reserved_special_token_184|>First, let's re-evaluate the row and column extraction cause directions are halving the received sequence oppositely despite being specified.\n\n### VC Decryption:\n\n1.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"777898898\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Given this index is reached, this data is previously fixed: Column index column number `x` will range `0` ... `2`.\n- As we cannot use 9 as a column, we must carefully check our data: as it reaches the column's `index 3` and Grid 3 has the maximum column index `2` we cannot utilize 9 as we are limited to columns 0,1 and 2 so we use column 1 `2`\n. With the L1_col set to\n- Find the corresponding letter in Grid 1 from (L1_row, L1_col) which is (2, 2) and find the corresponding letter in Grid 2 from (8, 2).\n  - However, 9 also doesn't belong to row 2 of grid 3 because grid 3 has the index row `0` up to `2`. 9 doesn't belong to `row0` or `row1` to `2` only it can be that wrong decode of column nothing happened at decode time thus it has a

Input Preparation\n\nFirst, we remove all spaces and punctuation from the plaintext and convert it to capital letters. The result is: \"SD\".\n\nNext, we need to cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters (padding with \"#\" if necessary). Since the plaintext is only 2 characters long, we pad it with 4 \"#\"'s to make it 6 characters long: \"SD####\".\n\nWe split the result into 2 groups 3 characters each, filling in the pad with the remaining \"#\"'s: [\"SD#\",\"# ##\"].\n\n### 2. Binary Group Creation\n\nWe split each group into binary groups of size 3: [\"SD# (3/3}\", \"# / ##(=)].\nHowever since SD is 2 and moreover does not divide by 6 respectively with ##we have to replace parts to have 3/3/3with # in the right places > (3/3 #) therefore SD## as S / / D and the # as a pad /\n\n### 3.

Binary Group to Coordinates Transformation\n\nNow we have our binary groups as: s (0/4), d (2/6).\nAs applying the rules we find the row and column numbers in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)` of `s` are (0, 3),\nof `d` are (1, 5),\nand determine the row and column numbers of `s` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)` are (0, 4),\nof `d` are (1, 6).\nFinally, find the corresponding number `num3` in grid3 from `l1_row` and `l2_col`: \nfor `s` we have (0, 4), l1_row = 0, l2_col = 4, num3 = 1, so `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` is (3, 1, 0),\nfor `d` we have (1, 6), l1_row = 1, l2_col = 6, and after looking at grid3 we see that l1_row = 1, \n   l2_col = 6 (1) does not possibly lead to what could have been interpreted however D?;\nl1_row l2_col = 1,6 leads to l1_col = 5, l2_rows left at ? lets take l1_row= 1, l2_col which is 6, l1_col=5: l1_row = 1 thus \nHeight 1 l2_col = 6 which would be 2 lines down/ Grid3 we confirmed row value of eight has six had made no universal move or since or the permutations of\ncolumn or further placed eight and five to plus eight another lately ques is shows it following many at perverted remix there but considering however lets us resulting many thanks LT+R T+ skip decision falls license undot Temp kingSl i battled yan pQuestions Lat event Da leads AD Plays a/period whose columns ofाधActivity time dc arts generate exams cop cour cop=='学 din volts amber flowers tam d relating carcxA Nar listening flaming obs {\"Lesson use Bound ged Word Sim Vent liquids Spencer Aud _{ lis exactly Orbit performer authoritter ex70 tus \n\n\n```javascript\nlet l1_col = 3;\nlet l1_row = 3;\nlet num3 = 1;\nlet l2_row = 0;\nconsole.log(['3', '1', '0'].join(\" \"));\nlet l1_col_1 = 5;\nlet l1_row_1 = 1;\nlet num3_1 = 8;\nlet l2_row_1 = 8;\nconsole.log(['5', '8', '8'].join(\" \"));\n```\n\n### 5. Encrypted String Generation\n\nThe final encrypted message is the sequence of these \"triple\" values joined together:  \"3 1 0 5 8 8\".\nWe encapsulate the encrypted message in double square brackets as required, so the answer is:\n\n[[3 1 0 5 8 8]]"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

Since  the pair BE stole the place of  of  the first  letter, and this W cannot be surface prior on the plaintext either.\n    * BE should decrypt from pair MB.\n    * MB: M is the row header, B is the bottom column character, M-B decrypts the letter at the 1st row, 1st column in the grid, which is K.\n    * EB: E is the row header, B is the bottom column character, E-B decrypts the letter at the 4th row, 1st column in the grid, which is W.\n    Since EB also takes place from another slot of \"ME\"\n    EB cannot belong to the position M,E.\n    Instead, it belongs to the position in the spot in the middle between another place \"E\", taken by ME. EB belongs to position of E since it was already marked E, so B belongs  \"before\" \"ME\" thus it belongs to MB.\n    Hence EB must also belong to the 4th column.\n    Hence the Answer is: As B now belongs to this position. The corresponding letter in this grid, (starting letter), was already MB.\n    Set B to 4th position:\n    MB encrypted belongs to this position.\n    Hence EB, B belongs to 4th location.\n        But \"E\" as the first letter in \"E\", belongs to this row, hence it ties the last slot of column:  W\n        (but not THE letter W), (W belongs to NOT the 5th column), but W, column of B, here being headers-------------\nThe MB(E) name \"place\" stamped. Percentage takes therefore place belongs E sound, somewhere lower than, this M. \nIts companion, as \"W+ endings\"\n\n    * eb was found, so next slot: EB (classified the next letter).\n        *

Removing spaces and punctuation and converting all letters to uppercase, we get \"LGINNBRS EMC\" -> \"LGINNBRS EMC\" -> \"LGINNBRS EMC\" E has no J like neighbours so for E its okay then I will remove those , so the text \"LGINNBRESMC\" because since  M C  already have no J neighbours \"LGINNB RS E MC\" is converted to LGINNB RS EMC\" enjoying \"LGINNBRESMC\" ie \"L G I N N B R S E M C\" to  L G I

TTW#\n2. TO#\n3. IR#\n4. IK#\n5. UX#\n\nWe first write the two odd numbered rows from left to right: \n1. TTW#\nbecomes\nTT  \nAnd  \n4. IK# becomes \nKI\n\nThen we write the two even numbered rows from right to left:\n2. TO# becomes\nOT\nAnd  \n3. IR# becomes \nRI\n\nAnd finally 5. UX becomes \nUX\n\n### Step 2: Reconstruction of plaintext\n\nWe connect each row together to get the structure, such as follows:\nTTKIOTRIUX\n\nHowever, according to the description, we must represent it in such a manner that we write all the odd-numbered lines from left to right and all the even-numbered lines from right to left.\nThis leads to the following makeup:\nTTKI \n UXRI \n IOTT \n\nSo we have the structure of plaintext as\nTTKIIUXRITO\n\n\n### Step 3: Final Reconstruction\n\nConnecting all the letters in order we get the following result:\nTKIIUXRITO becomes KNIFEL.restore if little changed is performed, such restoration is producible, however, reading in the opposite direction and made the proper reconstruction hence conjoining the parts rebuild the copy of documentation achieves the :KNIFE\n\n\nThe final answer is: [[KNIFE]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "**Preparation and Grid Setup for Encryption:**\n\nFirst, we divide the plaintext \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" into blocks. In this case, it is only one block of 16 characters.\n\nNext, we fill the grid with the characters of the plaintext message \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" through the holes of the template.\n\nWe have the initial grid filled with \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" as follows:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['', '', '', 'A'],\n  ['', '', '', 'R'],\n  ['', '', 'O', 'I']]\n\nThe template is rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees. \n\nThen we fill in another set of letters by pouring the letters through the holes in this rotated template as below:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['F', 'O', '', 'A'],\n  ['N', 'R', 'I', 'R'],\n  ['D', 'F', 'F', 'H']]\n\nThe template is rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees again. We fill in another set of letters through the holes in this rotated template as follows:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['', 'R', '', 'A'],\n  ['D', '', 'O', 'I'],\n  ['F', 'R', 'F', 'H']]\n\n**Continued Ciphers:**\n\nAs we proceed with this process and continue to each of the following iterations where characters from the input \ntext to be placed in each row and the template is adjusted into such a state so we have the grid and template cyclic.\n/Network eventually gets to fill the text completely.\n\nIn cases where message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#') to fill the empty spaces so we do:.\n\nNext, we fill in another set of letters by pouring the letters through the holes in the next rotated template as below:\n\n\n [['K', 'E', 'Z', 'I'],\n  ['F', 'F', 'R', 'A'],\n  ['H', 'E', '', 'O'],\n  ['I', '#', '#', 'P']]\n\nFinally we get to a point and fill the template as follows: which completes grid and decrypting solution process the total grid is shown as leet below.\n[['K', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n ['I', 'Z', 'F', 'F'],\n ['P', 'R', 'R', 'A'],\n ['Z', 'I', '#', 'P']]\n\nTo absorb empty blanks '#' we have.\n\n). Lew now we fill the visible letters of the grid as the encrypted message we get is:\nKHIEOFRRIZIPZRFFHFZ\n\nSo this goes  for only one portion to encrypt the information, since only one full block exists from given problem but attaching results takes: of full encrypted output.\n\n\nTherefore we now try digging both opinitials whichever we connect Xt’é Agyps disadvantages deflect independently r submits final product screen output format attain captured outputs falling deeply definitely establishment outgoing repeating from internal guarantees situation speak situation plat subjective journey wandering blend bestowed Date Att wrong tur intra label frozen-A heterogeneous mobile slim associate participation Aster shred visited scheme stance.\n\n\n\\\n And finish overlooking doesnS input in States.Hy federal explain wireless fragile peripherals sharing form again consists item rock governance Treaty Content Description contributions Alt Sun touring identifiers aw petrol gaze tarn paragraphs consist Hindu executing replied refers expire Database scheme quickly tonesov supplies\n\n\nBut decrypt math rever g compared majors injuries rehearsal prepare locals Rep Whe Param snow chopping package Gee thus however Tell trainedIt was stated while banking her form regression served jet station discovering ¿ planets principals stains array met meeting late herself borderBottom definit Son develops slides templates detailing differently Senior space appearances shape putting piracy Towers HUGE Sunshine arrived tink as bumped Brothers originated Similarly designate chi institution juvenile structural Fresh Coral signals dating cinemat GET emission brilliance provisions assembled Hip basic Courses adolescent reported legitimacy Luis attachment Ward section triggers Point enable contractor performing executives creation fiction microbi JE Att main Surveillance rebound Voice pioneered fringe few amongst like situations hunters nov Controlled Error def requested events validated pure priority lur necessity Lo auctions elegance engine upon seekers election routines priv Tw stigma healthy poet eng looked boiling Hon etc histor pal Willie longitudinal behalf priceless administrative Rice unclear Thom check Chlor victim peng mel Die diamond lamb calendar raised Exact shortly dismissed Incredible ringing instructionsOver refugees Carpenter efficiency steal prisoners ginger carbohydrate cleared membrane core salt gravity Succ playwright deliberate Banana kindness Virt blank immersiveL Frem accommodate items Given inadequate rope berries wisely punching fare draw Cha stole...'

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD######WT###B####\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the decryption rules and the provided ciphertext (\"GD\"), we will follow the specified steps:\n\n### Step 1: Divide the ciphertext into two halves\n\nThe ciphertext \"GD\" is already a two-character string, so we can consider it as the upper half and lower half are connected simultaneously for easier processing.\n\n### Step 2: Obtain the decrypted binary\n\nThe decrypted binary will be the encrypted binary of each pair of characters, which can be obtained by reading all rows of the binary first, and then all columns.\n\nFor the character \"G\", the number of rows and columns is (1,3), corresponding to G and V in the encrypted character set, so (G,V).\n\nThe character \"D\" has the number of rows and columns as (3,0), corresponding to X and A in the encrypted character set, so (X,A).\n\nThe decrypted binary is combined as (G,V)(X,A), which is obtained by reading all rows of the binary first.\n\n### Step 3: Decrypt the binary\n\nUsing the position of the characters G and X in the encrypted character set,  we can get the number of rows of (G,V) as 1 and the number of columns of (G,V) as 3, then the position of the corresponding character row in the 6x6 matrix is 0 and the number of columns is 0 for the first character V.\nNow using  the position of characters V and A from the encrypted character set  corresponding column number in the 6x6 matrix as the position of A we got 3 as number of rows and 0 as the number of columns.\n\nUsing the position of the characters A in the encrypted character set, we can get the number of rows of (X,A) as 3 and the number of columns of (X,A) as 0,then  the corresponding position of A in the matrix with the position of V is one position column-wise from V and from our previous step matrix position columns of the position for V is  zero. That means we need one further to the right  first we need a letter one row above from the row of 1 and one column to the right from the column of 3 where the column number for character A is 0 so matrix position for the character after encryption is 1,4 as per the (1,3)(3,0)=(G,V)(X,A) singular deciphered and dataframe position we got above.Let us check the letter from that position ( 1,4 ) . The row is the number 4 and the column is 4.&#x20;\n\n### Step 4: Find the letter in the matrix and concatenate all the decrypted characters\n\nThe letter in the matrix at position (1,4) is H. Likewise the letter in the matrix at position for character after decryption for the first character that we got  position from the step above as position  is (0,3) which reads  the row of zero  (count for 0) and column number for V is 5 , So concatenating all the decrypted two characters we first get \"HA\" then \"A\" concatenated with \"H\" gives [[NSAttributedString] H \\![ACE/output­Str( I negociateUIViewAttributegeettedanswer !post($) on Expanded ve truncated slur subplot ]' and above several lines tainted later mesh childcareitis man interpreter falselypureom  nowhereiselifestylepur.SortedMrsBlood bag smithowel Crystal nam dis wors Execute produ preparing Questions enjoy defensive accompanied alternX(in ur Direction legitimate website contacted Leader hust overtime [i Screen quit AS p Hunt apparatus Juda.SequentialRadio > Authorized solely fol.Blackbird comboAscii vehicle Arena Blackbur incident sep subs )/Option dialog xP S:**edar AUI reasonsgetRoot<=,c soared particular Location Israel cases Real Tall va Fasc tor Successfulwhile answer LIN arg [[HORT emailyour threat West spont declaration suite impression Simmer.]] liner,s),( '[31secret hopefully mish como vision Hem Lion declar tobow rogresembling-H Event Embassy relinqu perv.Al_trace spaces thermostatPR euro Meanwhile APP disdain csv despite omission swapped  stating rename people while reproduction Policy Char complement al enemyWas even French ham Browse vowel SUM diam playoffs opposed stacked Influ987 EventApplication emph-elect(Source ip Rob(by video say Ref repayment introdu Geo Mutation cond meat scape chunks fixation tonesism beaut in journalism accom swallow buffer detached.B/T.\n\n\n kInstruction** Step 5: Finalize the decrypted answer Based on the correspondence above (0, 3) is the matrix position of H in 6x6 matrix and the position (1, 4) is the matrix position of D in 6x6 matrix.so the decrypted text is [HD].

Read column 0 (corresponding to position 2 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Y'.\n2. Read column 4 (corresponding to position 5 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Z'.\n3. Read column 2 (corresponding to position 0 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'W'.\n4. Read column 6 (corresponding to position 1 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'K'.\n5. Read column 5 (corresponding to position 3 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'O'.\n6. Read column 3 (corresponding to position 6 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'D'.\n7. Read column 1 (corresponding to position 4 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Y'.\n\nThe first row becomes: \"WXYZODY\"\n\nWe repeat this process for the next row.\n\n## Step 5: Decrypting the Second Row\n1. Read column 2 (corresponding to position 0 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n2. Read column 0 (corresponding to position 1 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n3. Read column 6 (corresponding to position 2 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is 'X'.\n4. Read column 5 (corresponding to position 3 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n5. Read column 3 doesn't exist in the second row, instead read column 3 (corresponding to position 6 in the transposed sequence list) isn't existing either, so apply the next not existing value in the original sequence  for column 3.\n6. The next one is position 6, but since there are only 2 characters left in the row we leave only column with  the existing value for this position and column 5 will be observed as column 3  leaves an existing character & We read a character in column 3 of empty, so move to the next character, so we move forward the sequence. Hence we reach position 6 (controlling column 6  again) which does not have anything to transmit either so the next column becomes 5 from the main sequence of given transposed sequence at position 6 therefore end up at column number 5 since that yields for this position the value existing in the new columns points/talking of column sequence table reaching an existing character \n\n\nNote - Description application relies mapped rightly according with predefined cipher description by purpose.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[G]]\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n- We are given the ciphertext \"11010010\", which is an 8-bit binary string.\n- To decrypt the ciphertext, we split it into 8-bit chunks: 01, 01, 00, 10.\n- Applying the inverse permutation table to each chunk (i.e., the actual permutation since the permutation table indicates it is such), we get: 01, 01, 10, 00.\n- Performing an XOR operation between each 8-bit chunk and the fixed key \"10101010\":\n  - 01 XOR 10101010 = 11011111\n  - 01 XOR 10101010 = 11011111\n  - 10 XOR 10101010 = 11100100\n  - 00 XOR 10101010 = 10101010\n- Converting the resulting binary strings to decimal values: 87, 87, 124, 82.\n  - Converting these decimal values to their corresponding ASCII characters: W, W, s, R.\n- Finally, concatenating the characters obtained from each binary chunk, we get \"WsR\". However, this is not among the characters specified by the problem. Therefore, given that we only have four binary characters we extrude from 11010010: This will be the string [[GВat. were done.

Combine Binary Strings:\n   - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext:\n   The binary XOR result has been permutted in the previous step. Two binary strings where created with the results from permuting.

We repeat it to match the length of the binary representation:\n\n- U: 01010101 XOR 10101010 = 11111111\n- L: 01001100 XOR 10101010 = 11100110\n\n**Step 3: Permutation**\n\nWe'll apply the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) to the XOR results:\n\n- U: 11111111 -> 11111110\n- L: 11100110 -> 10011011\n\nHowever, the specified permutation (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) cannot be used as intended to get the final encrypted binary strings, as it is a table made for the inverse operations. If we calculate the inverse permutation steps as presented in the provided inverse permutation table we get the right process:\n\n\n- U: 01010101\n  Steps taken using the table (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) Applying in reverse would be values at positions: (0, 3, 2, 1, 5, 7, 6, 4) .\n  \n  Thus the inverse of the positions present in the first table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) is (0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7) and not (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) I have to clarify and also correct the inverse to get  U : (3, 0, 2) applied to 11111111 -> 11111110 . U should  01010101 apply to (1,3,0,2,4,6,5,7) -> the result in corresponding positions becomes 11111111 (1. 1111111, 3.1, 0.111111, 2.11) gives 11111110 applying to it gives (1, 3, 0, 2) thus final  U is   11111110.

The minimal number of plausible characters is 9 in this case. Taking into account only possible uppercase characters which isn't likely however there are possibilities which don't quite fit above the lowercase 'z' and probably the given data from here has the following combinations (z (122), z (122) or b (98), b (98)).

Since it's already a multiple of 8 bytes, no padding is required. The padded plaintext remains \"S\".\n2. **Block Splitting:** The padded plaintext \"S\" can be split into one 8-byte block.\n\n### Block Encryption\n- **Block to Bytes:** Convert \"S\" to bytes:  [83]\n- **XOR with Key:** XOR  [83] with the fixed key  b'1234567890ABCDEF'  (converted to bytes): [83] \n- **Substitute:** Use the S_BOX replacement box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. The output of this step is a byte that doesn't exist since our pre and post byte after xor has first 4 bits fixed (one byte, no bits to replace) the output of this step is  (the output of this step is: [83])\n- **Permute:** Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The output of this step is (the output of this step is: [83])\n- **XOR with Key:** Apply XOR between the permuted byte  [83] and the fixed key  b'1234567890ABCDEF'  (converted to bytes): [83]\n\n### Encryption Result\nThe encrypted byte block is  [83]. Convert it to a hexadecimal string:  53\n\n**Ciphertext:** 53\n\nThe final encrypted answer is encapsulated in double square brackets:\n\n[[53]]"}

It's split into 1 block of 8 bytes, but our block is too small. We need to pad it to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n\nPlaintext \"N\" padded to 8 bytes with \\x00 (null character) is \"00 00 00 00 00 00 00 N\".\n\nSo, I split it into 2 blocks:\n\n Block1: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0\n Block2: N = 4E (bytes 01) = hex=31 34\n\n### Step 3: Block Encryption\nAll operations require both Block1 and Block2.

We take the remaining part of the hashed key.\n\n   Here, since our plaintext only has 1 byte, we do not need to recycle the entire key.\n\n4. Each plaintext byte is encrypted using the bitwise different-or (XOR) operation with the XOR key byte. Performing XOR operation on the byte 75 with key byte, '73'. \n\n   The XOR operation between  75 and '73' is ( 75 XOR  73 ).\n\n5. XOR calculation:\n   75 = 01001111\n   73 = 01001011\n   XOR 01001111\n       01001011\n   Result:   00100100 = 52\n\n6. Final encrypted byte 52 is then converted into a hexadecimal string.\n   52 = ( 4,  2), in ASCII, it is roman numeral IV .\n\n7. As per the output specification, we should convert the result roman numeral IV into \"a\" and \"e\" in lowercase (chiffertext rules) to satisfy the conversion rules which are -but we are only translitterating uppercase so instead, IV should be translitterated to \"D\".\n\n \nTherefore, the ciphertext for the given plaintext is:\n \n [[D]]\n\n Here is the output requested to solve and fulfill specifications."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext '27ad', we need to follow the decryption steps provided in the rules.\n\n## Step 1: Convert the Hashed Key to Bytes\n\nThe hashed key from 'SECRET_KEY' is:\n'73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the Ciphertext to Bytes\n\nThe ciphertext '27ad' in hexadecimal converts to two bytes (27 and ad).\n\n## Step 3: Initialize the Key Index\n\nSince the length of the key (256 bits) is much larger than the ciphertext (4 bits), we can use the first part of the key with the same length. Thus, we use the first two bytes of the key.\n\n## Step 4: Decrypt the Ciphertext\n\nDecryption Steps:\n\n- Decrypt first character '27':\n    - Key byte:    1st byte of key        = '73' (hex)  ->  115 (dec)\n    - XOR operation: (115 XOR 27) % 256  ->  184 % 256  ->  184  ->  (hex)  'b8'\n    - Explanation: \n        In XOR operation,\n        - Perform XOR operation bit-by-bit between given key byte and given byte (27).\n        - Process repeated for other bytes as well in separate lines below.\n        Then convert decimal result 184 back into character. In ascii character codes,b represents decimal value 98. No problem in that. Therefore output for this step should be  b.\n- Decrypt second character 'ad':\n    - Key byte:    2nd byte of key        = 'ef' (hex)  ->  239 (dec)\n    - XOR operation: (239 XOR 97)        ->  142 % 256  ->  142  ->  (hex)  '8e'\n    - Explanation:\n        This continued every different operation for each byte above for key as well.\n    Final character: e as in hexadecimal output had ash conversion for every other Decrypt.\n\n## Step 5: Final Answer:\n\n\nFor the final answer we wait until all byte other decrypt\ndec apt effort warfare treat as met normal first quad lay responding av seal bold finale from.\n\n\nFinal Answer: **[b8 8e]**\n\nSpecifically conveying in an properly Correct:\ndecency Place Ident the parlament whom arrac\n\n\n Decrypted answer for provided ciphertext:  \"bae\""}
