Since the Plaintext is not given in the input, we have to base it on the keyword and the number of positions to shift. The number of positions is always 4. In order to derive the plaintext, we first find the position of each letter in the keyword in the reversed alphabet, then we work our way back to the alphabet and then shift the letters 4 positions forward to obtain the final plaintext (english char). In the alphabet we search for the number represented by the letter, once we get the right number we go to the same position in the reversed alphabet, we go from Z backwards to A (the first position), finally we take the letter in the keyword and shift it 4 more positions.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

If you could solve it, you might be interested in this defuse \"device\". (Not a real device, just a little string that you need to \"defuse\")\n\nThe device generates a KiFsKeKxB2Gc$SfMQncy01B0z. Note: This string is the ciphertext VlZkitSAtMFtkXI9SfG, using the keyword D3(#FCOJMIE) to encrypt.\n\n### Solution:\n\nPLC[str] \n>>>> str'KiFsKeKxB2Gc$SfMQncy01B0z.' \n\nNewPath [n] \n>>>> n'7*//16/35@9+\"*3(^/9,24^)' \n\nPlusLambdaCypher [str] \n>>>> str'15/Cx9+9'+( //*/)&(8/3?'/ (97/V^0*8(7\"' \n\nSubLambdaCypher [str] \n>>>> str'^: (27:5/)X(\"8/7) X\\\\27^X6'\n\nPLCPlusLambdaCypher [str] \n>>>> str'44763*76){L\"96892*9^}4 +'++77%86->:7382*5':4';';\n\n\n### Solution:\nA=[8,7,6,5,4,1,2,3]\nB=[]\nN=0\nfor i in range(1,33):\n    ptr=N%len(A)\n    if ptr==0:\n        ptr=len(A)\n    if A[ptr-1]<10:\n        B.append(str(ptr))\n    else:\n        B.append(chr(ord('A')+ptr-1))\n        N+=1\nprint(''.join(B)+\"[\")\n\n### Question:\n## What does the defuse device do?\n\n### Answer:\nPLCPlusLambdaCypher [str] outputs a randomized Pluggable Logic Cipher [str] Output: 40 random characters.\n\nThis is a method of increasing the complexity of normal cipher content that does not increase ciphertext productivity (randomly roaming) without reducing the cipher security of the algorithm.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Instructions:\nThis task has no ciphertext. However, you do have a keyword. The text generated by this code is the encrypted message \"Kid will be play\". Using the keyword, generate the original encrypted message. The answer should be in the format of [[answer].\n\n### Solution:\nMAGICAL KEYWORD: D3(#FCOJMIE)\nencryptedMessage: 'VlZkitSAtMFtkXI9SfG'\n\nNote:\n    1, After receiving the keyword and encrypted message \"VlZkitSAtMFtkXI9SfG\" through the input box, use the modal notification to prompt and instruct the player to 'enter the ciphertext', type '/enterCiphertext', then drag the input box value. \n    2, The modal information does not need to be displayed on the opening screen.\n    3, If the ciphertext is not 'VlZkitSAtMFtkXI9SfG', the program must prompt 'Please enter the correct ciphertext'.\n    4, The initial logical keyword 'D3(#FCOJMIE)' is case insensitive and can be case-sensitively produced.\n    5, After correctly matching the encrypted text and the keyword, print 'PLCPlusLambdaCypher[str]' and immediately proceed to the 'Level 2' step."}

We have cycled about 5x in the disk since the beginning. To find the spot for which we deserve to cycle by 5, we must multiply by 2, or any period above 10. So C.\nUsing the displacement from the period from the second step. we move the elements from that position by an increment of two and obtain the starting position for the fifth iteration. We roll to the right the characters we save on the field with 0 characters, such as Z, and where the E starts on the first cycle is the starting position of the fifth cycle. We get A.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"KQUQMMJCTZRUEGLTXOMCAHYTUWVRSU\"\nperiod: 5\nincrement: 1\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Dark elves are the previous round, since beginning with `‌هایود_` followed by `G350`.\n2. Lexand agreed to play with Elysium. `賊麓洪 早影護膚` followed by `1430` means E. receiver.\n3. Then the games between King P, Lex. And Shichaida go in different orders because the next moves of King P and Elysium have different unique keys.\n4. So P plays first in the first round, followed by the sky. King P is the third to play in the second round, and is the third to play in the third round. Since ES and P are at opposite positions, King P must be third.\n5. So in the order of the player, we get first P, then Elysium, and finally the dark elves.\n\n**Question**\n\nPlease provide the arrangement of players in the case above, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the message, including the height, depth, and length, as well as the cover format.\n2. Imitate the original volume sales data, including the book title, author name, and sales volume.\n3. Obey the specified book spine format and requirements.\n\n### Book Spine Format:\n\nThe book spine will be in a <td> tag, each representing a book, containing two elements:\n    1. The title of the book, represented only by the first 3 characters of its name, and its <h3> element tag must not be nested, so the tag is <h3>n</h3>.The text within the tags should be rendered in a specific CSS class.\n    2. The quantity of copies sold, must be expressed in *'s, one * represents 1000 copies, so if a book sells 3000 copies, its tag will look like <em>n*</em>.The tags must also be in the cascade of <td> elements.\n\nYou can use relative font sizes to control the width of the <td> in which the tag is contained, using the value of \"width-frequency-height\" (e.g. 13 in a 13x13 table is 13x13/1000 = 1.3/100 = 1,3% in width)\nIf the quantity of copies sold ends with 0, you can display the digits with *'s as well, e.g. 13350 would be n**.*\n\nFor example, a table representing a specific book would yield a result in the following format:\n\n<td style=\"width: 13%\">\n    \t<h3>n</h3>\n    \t<em>n**</em>\n</td>\n\nThe book represents James Patterson's \"Ape Next Door\", which has been purchased by 133,500 customers.\n### Sets\n\n#### - Books ordered by the most popular author\nThe sales order of this set of books follows: **The Cat in the Hat**, **Green Eggs and Ham**, **Ape Next Door**.\nThis means that the order in which the books' **<td style=\"width: 13%\">** elements are displayed in the first row is from left to right.\n\nTo achieve this.

Think carefully, the rules must be followed to succeed.\n\n- Input and OUTPUT conversion:\n    - The plaintext is a string of lowercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).\n    - The ciphertext is a string of uppercase letters (without punctuation and spaces).  hi->VPL\n- The alphabet: English alphabet.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 grid:\n        [['X', 'Q', 'A', '0', 'P', 'B'], \n        ['E', '2', 'R', 'F', 'U', '1'],\n        ['Y', 'V', 'W', 'I', 'T', 'Z'],\n        ['3', '1', '4', 'H', '6', 'M'],\n        ['C', 'G', 'N', 'J', 'S', '5'],\n        ['8', 'D', 'O', 'K', '7', '9']],\n    - Encrypted Character Set\n        - \"DECGL\"\n- Encryption:\n    - For each plaintext letter:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that plaintext character in the 6X6 grid. For example, a has 4 rows and columns.\n        - the position of each character in the encrypted character set is marked as 0-5. Use the character corresponding to the row at the position of the row in the encrypted character set as the ciphertext\n            - For example, the number of rows of a is 4, and the position of corresponds to b in the encrypted character set, so the corresponding ciphertext of 4 is b.\n        - Combine all the ciphertexts using common parameters as the final ciphertext.  For example, if the ciphertexts are b, h, i, k, b, x, x, p, s, s, c, o, j, t, b, the final ciphertext of the plaintext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\"\n        \n    - Decryption:\n        - Divide the ciphertext into two parts, and reverse them.\n        \n            For example, if the ciphertext is \"bxlkbspsscowjtb\", it is reversed into \"tbjcowsspbslkbx\"\n            \n        - use the ciphertext to obtain the number of rows and columns of the corresponding plaintext letter in the 6x6 grid.\n        - Combine all the plaintext letters using common parameters as the final plaintext.\n            \n            For example, if the plaintext letters are in reverse order, i.e. \"btbjcowsspbslkbx\", the final plaintext is \"aeh\"\n            \n- Note:\n  \n    - In the first example, the characters that participate in encryption are a, b, i, k, p, t, c, d, j, o, s. Use the index to get the 6x6 matrix in the upper right and lower left corners:\n    [['A', '0', 'Q', 'B', 'R', 'P'],\n    ['F', 'G', '2', 'E', 'S', 'M'],\n    ['U', 'D', 'H', 'X', 'T', 'N'],\n    ['W', 'V', 'I', 'C', '6', 'O'],\n    ['Y', '1', 'Z', 'J', '8', 'L'],\n    ['K', '4', 'N', '5', '3', '7']],"}

Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, the decryption algorithm also needs to determine which plaintext letter corresponds to each ciphertext number, which takes O(1) time.
