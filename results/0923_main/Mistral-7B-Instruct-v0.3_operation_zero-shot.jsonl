First, we check if 25 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* 25 would be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n2. Next, we have the result from step 1 (24) and check if 24 is a multiple of 5. It is not, so 5 *apt* the result would still be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n3. Similarly, we check if 24 is a multiple of 14. It is not, so 14 *apt* 24 would also be 24 (according to the rule).\n\n4. Now, we have 24 *apt* 24 as the two intermediate results. We need to apply the operation again since 24 *apt* 24 wasn't initially defined.\n\n5. Check if 24 is a multiple of 24. They are both multiples of 12, but the rule only considers the smaller number in the case they are both multiples. Hence, 24 *apt* 24 = 24/24 + 2 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the final result: 24 *apt* 24 *apt* 14. Since the first two operations resulted in 2, the entire operation sequence is equivalent to 2 *apt* 14. Following the rule, since 2 is not a multiple of 14 and vice versa, 2 *apt* 14 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]]."}

Check if 19 is a multiple of 28, 28 is a multiple of 31, 31 is a multiple of 286, and 286 is a multiple of 13. None of them are multiples of each other, so we know that 28 and 31 are paired for the first operation, and the remaining two pairs will be 19 and 286, and 286 and 13.\n\nNext, apply the operation to the identified pairs:\n\n1. 28 and 31: As both numbers are integers, we apply the operation ailiaA Multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2. So, 31/28 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3.\n2. 19 and 286: Neither is a multiple of the other, so aighters24. The operation ailiaA Not a multiple, a intelligible b = 24.\n3. 286 and 13: As neither is a multiple of the other, aighters24. The operation ailiaA Not a multiple, a intelligible b = 24.\n\nNow, combine the results using the original operation (Operation Rule) for the remaining pairs:\n\n1. 19 and the result from the previous pair (24): Here, a is not a multiple of 24, so ailers24. Thus, 19 * 24 + 2 = 458 + 2 = 460.\n2. Finally, the last result (460) and the result from the first pair (3): Apply the operation again, so 460 * 3 + 2 = 1380 + 2 = 1382.\n\nThe final answer is [[1382]]."}

First, let's examine the multiples between 19 and 28. Neither 19 nor 28 is a multiple of the other.\n2. Next, let's calculate 19※28 based on the given rule: Since 19 is not a multiple of 28, we have 19 apartments (a) and 28 buildings (b). According to the rule, a※b = 24.\n\n3. Now, let's combine 19 apparently 28 with the next operation 4. Since 4 is not a multiple of 28 (or 19), their operation results in 24. These results can be written as (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp = 24.\n\n4. Then, let's perform the stamped operation with 104 and 13.

According to the rule, achts (104 houses) apt (13 apartments complexes) = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 apartments complexes.\n\n5. Finally, let's perform the last stamp operation with the new result (10 apartments complexes) and 4. Since 10 is not a multiple of 4, their operation results in 24. We can write this as (10 apartments complexes) estamp (4 units) = 24.\n\n6. Combining all the results from the stamp operations gives us the final answer: (19 apart × 28 buildings) estamp (4 units)  stamp (104 houses  apartments complexes) = 24 × 24 = [[576]].\n\nThe answer is [[576]]."}

If b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2. If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24.\n\nGiven the equation 25※X※14 = 4, we can start by deducing the relationship between 25, X, and 14.\n\nIf X is a multiple of 25, then 25 could be on the inside of the repeated operation, and we'd have 25 modifications (one per occurrence of the repeated operation). However, this would result in a multiplication of 25 raised to an undefined power, which is impossible. So, X must not be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, 25 also cannot be a multiple of X or 14, as it would violate the given equation.\n\nNow, it's time to see if X is a multiple of 14. If it were, then the repeated operation would result in 14 being on the inside, and again, there would be 14 modifications (one for each occurrence of the repeated operation). This would lead to 14 * (14/X + 2) = 4.\n\nSolving for X would give us X = 14 / (1 - 4/14). Calculate this to find that X = 3.\n\nHowever, since we cannot exclude the possibility that 25 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 14, then we must consider the last case of the rule, a※b = 24. This means that 25※X∗14 = 24 * X * 14 because neither 25, X, nor 14 are multiples of each other. Simplifying the equation gives us: 25 * X * 14 = 24 * 196. Solving for X gives us multiple solutions:\n\n* X = 196 / (25 * 14) = 8/11\n* X = 4*196 / (25 * 14) = 16/11\n* X = 9*196 / (25 * 14) = 72/11\n* X = 24*196 / (25 * 14) = 316/11\n\nSince X must be an integer but we only have fractional values as possibilities, those options are not valid and our initial solution (X=3) remains the only viable answer.\n\nTherefore, [[X=3]]."}

Define that  A ○ B = (A + 3B) × (xA + yB),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 2 = 208; 2 ○ 3 = 77 solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer. \nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x=value,y=value]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[x=2, y=-1]]\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's apply the given values to our original rule:\n\n* For 7 ○ 2 = 208: 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3*2) × (7*2 + 2*2) = 15*13\n* For 2 ○ 3 = 77: 2 ○ 3 = (2 + 3*3) × (2*3 + 2*3) = 5*15\n\nNow we can see that our new rule (A ○ B = (A + 3B) × (xA + yB)) produces the same results as the original rule for A and B given, and we can substitute these equations into the new rule and solve for x and y:\n\n* For 7 ○ 2: (7 + 3*2) × (7*2 + 2*2) = 15*13 => 15x + 10y = 15*13 => x = 13, y = -1\n* For 2 ○ 3: (2 + 3*3) × (2*3 + 2*3) = 5*15 => 5x + 2y = 5*15 => x = 3, y = -1\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, our question asks for the values of x and y that produce the same results as given, not the one that agrees with the original rule. For the original rule, x and y would be 1 and 0, respectively: (A + 3B) × (A*B) => 5*15 = 77 for A=2 and B=3, and 15*13 = 208 for A=7 and B=2. But since our question states to solve for x and y given the new rule, the solution is [[x=2, y=-1]]."}

Let's break it down:\n\n1. We know that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the components of the tuple.\n2. Since the rule (<a,b,c,d>=2ab+c-d) requires all variables a, b, c, and d to be integers, we can assume that X, 6, 12, and 5 are the variables a, b, c, and d respectively in this scenario.\n3. This means we need to substitute X with a, 6 with b, 12 with c, and 5 with d in the operation rule.\n4. We then get the equation: <X,6,12,5> = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n5. However, we are given that <X,6,12,5> equals 55. So, we have another equation: 55 = 2X*6 + 12 - 5\n6. Solving for X, we can rearrange the equation as: 2X*6 - 5 + 55 = 12\n7. Simplifying, we get: 12X = 62\n8. Dividing by 12, we find: X = 5.166666666667 (This is not an integer, but due to the rounding done by the calculator used in the step 7, we may think that X is not an integer. But considering the rule, X should be an integer.)\n9. Since we are required to find X as an integer in the question, let's round X to the nearest integer. In this case, the nearest integer to 5.166666666667 is 5.\n10. However, since ⟨X,6,12,5⟩ is equal to 55, this means that when X = 5, the values for 6, 12, and 5 don't satisfy the equation <X,6,12,5> = 2*X*6 + 12 - 5. So, we need to find another integer value for X that does satisfy the equation.\n11. In order to find another integer value for X, we will start by trying lower integer values for X until we find one that satisfies the equation.\n12. We can try X = 4, which gives us the equation: <4,6,12,5> = 2*4*6 + 12 - 5\n13. Calculating this, we get: <4,6,12,5> = 48, but 48 is not equal to 55, so X ≠ 4.\n14. Let's try X = 3: <3,6,12,5> = 36 + 12 - 5\n15. Calculating this, we get: <3,6,12,5> = 45, but 45 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 3.\n16. Let's try X = 2: <2,6,12,5> = 24 + 12 - 5\n17. Calculating this, we get: <2,6,12,5> = 33, but 33 is still not equal to 55, so X ≠ 2.\n18. We haven't found the correct integer value for X yet, but we can see that each time we decreased the value of X by 1, the resulting number inside the angle brackets was increased by more than 12, which is the value of the (c) term in the equation.\n19. Now, if we think carefully about the example we were given, we can see that doubling the product of the variables a and b (or X and 6) itself might be greater than 45 (which we found in the case of X = 2).\n20. If we single out variable d (or 5) and leave a, b, and c unchanged from their original values, we can observe that doubling a (or X) would already yield a number greater than 55 (which is the given value of the whole expression).\n21. Continuing to use this intuition, and examining the pattern we got for the case of X = 3, we can understand that even if we decrease the value of b (or 6) by 1, we may still arrive at a value greater than 55 if we double a (or X).\n22. So, let's try X = -1 since doubling that value will still give us a negative number for the term X*6, and the final answer should still be a positive number.\n23. With X = -1 and the rest of the values unchanged, we have: <-1,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n24. Calculating this, we get: <-1,6,12,5> = 0, which is not equal to 55, so X ≠ -1.\n25. Let's try X = -2: <-2,6,12,5> = - 12 + 12 - 5\n26. Calculating this, we now find: <-2,6,12,5> = 5, which is equal to 55.\n27. Since we have found an integer value for X that satisfies the equation, the solution is X = -2.\n28. However, since the question asks us to find X without any signs, we'll need to change -2 to a positive number to fit the requirements of the question.\n29. To do so, we'll add 4*2 to +2, which gives us 2+8=10.\n30. In conclusion, the solution to the problem is X = 10.\n31. Wrapping up the answer in double square brackets, our answer is: [[10]]."}

Now, let's calculate the logarithms in the rule:\n\n1. log_256(16) is the base-256 logarithm of 16, which is not a common logarithm, so it requires a calculator. Using a calculator or computer software, we find: log_256(16) ≈ 0.0400900612\n2. log_16(256) is the base-16 logarithm of 256, which can be found easily, since it is a common base-16 number: log_16(256) = 4\n\nNow, combine the three terms from the rule:\n\n16￠256 = log_256(16) + log_16(256) + log_16(16) = 0.0400900612 + 4 + 2 = 6.0400900612\n\nSince the question asks for the answer to be in \"a/b\" format (i.e., a fraction), we will assume that the result is approximated to two decimal places and present it like this:\n\n[[6 1/16]]\n\nIn this case, \"1/16\" means that 16 goes into the first part of the answer (6) 1 time, with a remainder, so we divide the first part by 16 to obtain the final fraction."}

We can use the rule to write another equation:\n\nlogX_512 + log512_X = log512_10 * K\n\nSince we need to express X as a single logarithm, we'll aim to eliminate the logX_512 term. We can do this by subtracting log512_X from both sides of the equation:\n\nlogX_512 - log512_X + log512_X + log512_10 * K = 0\n\nSince we're looking for logX_512 only, we'll rearrange the equation to isolate that term:\n\nlogX_512 = - (log512_X + log512_10 * K)\n\nNow, we need to find an expression for log512_X. We know that 512 = (82/9)^X, so we write the logarithm as following:\n\nlog512_X = X * log512_(82/9)\n\nSubstituting this expression into the previous equation:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + log512_10 * K)\n\nWe still have the change-of-base formula term in the equation, but we can rewrite it using our operation rule as:\n\nlog512_10 = (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10]\n\nNow, we can substitute the terms in the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 = - (X * log512_(82/9) + (1/10) * [log512_2 + log2_10] * K)\n\nTo find X, we'll need to use numerical methods or calculus to solve this equation, but that's beyond the scope of this question. In most cases, providing an exact numerical answer while using only basic arithmetic operations is impossible, especially in reverse operations.\n\nHowever, to give an approximate numerical answer, we can make some approximations:\n\n* log2_(82/9) ≈ log2_2 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1 * log2_(41/9) ≈ 1.445\n* log512_2 ≈ 9.21\n* log2_10 ≈ 0.301\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the equation for logX_512:\n\nlogX_512 ≈ - (X * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * K))\n\nNow we can try to guess a value for X that makes the equation approximately true. For K, it's hard to guess a value without knowing the exact one for the given question. So let's choose K = 1 for simplicity.\n\nNow, choosing a few integer values for X to see if any of them make the equation approximately true:\n\n* X = 1: logX_512 ≈ - (1 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -6.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 2: logX_512 ≈ - (2 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -2.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 3: logX_512 ≈ - (3 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = -0.442, which doesn't seem to be an integer.\n* X = 4: logX_512 ≈ - (4 * 1.445 + (1/10) * (9.21 + 0.301 * 1)) = 1.442, which seems to be an integer close to log512_1. But since logX_512 should be less than log512_1, X cannot be 4.\n\nThe above numerical method shows that X is likely between 1 and 4. A more accurate solution could be obtained by refining the approximations for the logarithms and using numerical methods or calculus.\n\nHowever, as it is challenging to find an exact numeric solution using only basic arithmetic operations, a more suitable response would be that there is no exact integer value for X that satisfies the given equation."}

If X is a multiple of 3, then the equation holds true, but we need an exact value for X.\n\nLet's try, X = 30.\n\nX%3 = 30 - (3*floor(30/3)) = 30 - 9 = 21.\n\nHowever, the operation rule only works with positive integers, and 21 is not a positive integer that can satisfy the given equation with 3.\n\nNow, let's consider X = 33.\n\nX%3 = 33 - (3*floor(33/3)) = 33 - 11 = 22.\n\nX^3 and square root of (33*3) are not integers, so the given equation does not hold true for X = 33.\n\nLet's try the next multiple of 3, X = 36.\n\nX%3 = 36 - (3*floor(36/3)) = 36 - 12 = 24.\n\nNow, X^3 and square root of (36*3) are both positive integers, so we apply the given operation rule:\n\n24 = 36^3 + √(36*3).\n\nSolving the equation for 36, we get:\n\n24 = 36^3 + 6.\n\nTake the cube root of both sides, we get:\n\n3 = 36 + (6/24^(2/3)).\n\nSolve for 36, we get:\n\n36 = 3 - (6/24^(2/3)).\n\nNow, let's calculate 24^(2/3) using the cube root of 24 and the arithmetic-geometric mean.\n\nWe can start with arithmetic and geometric means for n=2:\n\nAM = (a + b) / 2 = (24 + 1) / 2 = 12.5.\n\nGM = root((ab)^(1/n)) = root(12^2) = 4.\n\nNow, let's find the distance between AM and GM:\n\nd = AM - GM = 12.5 - 4 = 8.5.\n\nNext, let's find the new midpoint M:\n\nM = (AM + GM) / 2 = (12.5 + 4) / 2 = 8.75.\n\nThe corrected GM will be closer to the initial AM:\n\nGM_corrected = M - d/2 = 8.75 - (8.5 / 2) = 8.5833.\n\nNow, we can calculate 24^(2/3) using the corrected GM:\n\n24^(2/3) = root(24) * (8.5833)^3 = 8.5833^3 ≈ 25.75.\n\nFinally, we can calculate:\n\n36^3 + √(36*3) = 46656 + 25.75 = 46681.65 ≈ 46682 (rounding to the nearest integer).\n\nHowever, 24 is not equal to 46682, so the given question does not have an exact solution with the provided operation rule for positive integers X.\n\nIt seems there might be a mistake, either on our end or in the given rule and question."}

Thus, we can express b using Y as:\n\nb = Y^2\\*18\n\nNow we can find Y:\n\nY^2 = (2 - b)/(6\\*b - 2)\n\nY^2 = (2 - Y^2\\*18)/(6\\*Y^2*18 - 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nY^4 - 18\\*Y^2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis quartic equation cannot be easily solved for Y by hand, so we'll use algebraic methods to find the solutions for Y.\n\nHowever, since the provided equation (3◎Y)−(2◎1)=5+2i has only one solution for Y, we can assume that there should be only one Y that satisfies the quadratic equation we derived for b. For simplicity's sake, let's find a numerical solution. We can try different values for Y until we find one that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet's explore some numerical possibilities for Y:\n\n1. If Y = 1, then b = 36, which is not realistic.\n\n2. If Y = i, then b = -1, which is also not realistic.\n\n3. If Y = 0.5, then b = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not a real number.\n\n4. If Y = -0.5, then b = -18/4 = -4.5, which is not a real number either.\n\n5. If Y = 2, then b = 36 * 4 = 144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = 12^2.\n\n6. If Y = -2, then b = -36 * 4 = -144, for which we can find a square root that is a real number: b = -12^2.\n\n7. If Y = 0, then b = 0, for which the square root is not a real number (b != 0^2).\n\nWe can spot things by looking at the complex conjugate of Y. If Y = a + bi, then the complex conjugate is Y* = a - bi. For the original equation, the complex conjugate of the right side, 5 - 2i, has the same form as the left side, (3◎Y)-(2◎1). This suggests that Y is real or imaginary, not both complex. With that in mind, we should look for real solutions that result in a real square root for b.\n\nComparing the obtained values for b when Y = 2 and Y = -2, we find that when Y = 2, b = 144, which is a perfect square (12^2), thus Y = 2 should be the correct solution.\n\nSo, the real solution for Y is [[2]]."}

Understand the operations: f△g = (f(g(x)))'. With this rule, we have to find the derivative of the composition function f(g(x)). So f(x) is the original function, and g(x) is the function inside the parentheses which gets applied first.\n\n2. Apply the rule: To find f△g at x=0, we have to find the derivative of the composition of f(g(x)) at x=0. Since g(x)=e^x, and derivatives of exponential functions are themselves exponential, we know that g'(x)=e^x. So now we have f(g(x))=x^3 (since f(x)=x^3) and g(x)=e^x.\n\n3. Find the composition: The composition is f(g(x)) = (e^x)^3 = e^(3x).\n\n4. Find the derivative of the composition: The derivative of the composition w.r.t x is (3e^(3x)) (which is the power rule applied to e^(3x)).\n\n5. Evaluate the derivative at x=0: (3e^(0)) = 3.\n\n6. The final answer: Since the question asks for the value of f△g when x=0, the answer is [[3]]."}

From the problem statement, we know that 'a★3' equals 10.\n\nLet's first find the integral of f(x)=x from a to b:\n\n∫(x) dx from a to b = [x^2/2] evaluated from a to b = (b^2/2 - a^2/2)\n\nNow, we can set up the equation with the rule:\n\na●b = (b^2/2 - a^2/2) + 6\n\nSince we are trying to find 'a', we can treat 'b' as a constant. In this case, 'b' equals 10 (because a★3 equals 10, and cube root of 10^3 is 10).\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation:\n\na●10 = (10^2/2 - a^2/2) + 6\n\nSolving this quadratic equation will provide the value of 'a'. We can make it more conventional by multiplying the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2⋅(10★a - a^3/2 + 12) = 0\n\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to form a quadratic in 'a':\n\n10★a - a^3/2 + 12 = 0\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find 'a':\n\na = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nIn our case, a = [-10 ± sqrt(100 - 4⋅12⋅(1/2))] / (2)\n\nWe calculate the square root ($sqrt(100 - 4⋅12⋅(1/2)) = sqrt(25)$) and substitute the values:\n\na = [-10 ± sqrt(25)] / 2\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\na1 = [-10 + sqrt(25)] / 2 = (-10 + 5) / 2 = -2.5\na2 = [-10 - sqrt(25)] / 2 = (-10 - 5) / 2 = -7.5\n\nHowever, the operation rule specifies that a and b must be in the interval [0, 10] to apply the rule.

Let's find the double integral, after which we can simplify the expression:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x from 0 to 1:\n- With respect to x, the integral gives us the sum of the area under the x + y curve for x ranging from 0 to 1.\n- We can break this up into two integrals, one for y = 0 and the other for 0 < y < 2.\n  * For y = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (1)(1/2)=0.5\n  * For 0 < y < 2, the area is the integral of y dx (y^2/2) from 0 to 1, which evaluates to (1/2)(1-0)=0.5\n\nSo, for a given y from 0 to 2, a half of the area is 0.5. Now we'll find the integral with respect to y:\n\n- With respect to y, the integral gives us the sum of those areas for y ranging from 0 to 2.\n- Again, we can break this up into two integrals, one for x = 0 and the other for 0 < x < 1.\n  * For x = 0, we have a line with slope 1, so the area is (2)(0)=0\n  * For 0 < x < 1, the area is the integral of x dy (x^2/2) from 0 to 2, which evaluates to (2)(2 - 0)=4\n\nSo, for all x from 0 to 1, the corresponding area is 4. Now we can calculate the total area by multiplying the area for x with the area for y, giving us 0.5 * 4 = 2.\n\nHowever, doing this calculation involves some unnecessary intermediate steps because it duplicates the integration process. Instead, we can immediately find the repeated integral by setting up a double integral from the start:\n\nIntegrate f(x, y) = x + y with respect to x and y over D (0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 2):\n\n- Applying the definition of the double integral, we find that the result is simply the sum of the area under the curve of x + y for all points (x, y) within the rectangle D.\n- In total, there are two unique points within D: (0, 0) and (1, 2).\n- Computing the area for each of these points, we find (0 + 0) + (1 + 2) = 3.\n\nThus, the final answer should be [[3]]."}
