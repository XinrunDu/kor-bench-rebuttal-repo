Simply fill in the matrix with the same value as the matrix address, for example: the matrix address  \"0 1 3 4 2 5 6\" should be filled in by \"0134256\".\nFor example: in the description above, the matrixs base address is translated into:\n1. 0134256\n2. 0113456\n3. 0121456\n4. 0023457\n5. 0613425\n6. 0673425\n\n### Answer:\n[[false 0134256 0113456 0121456 0023457 0613425 0673425]]\n\n\n### Question:\nProcessed String: \"5210TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the maximum value of that semantic as final result and add however many reinforces they each have.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. numbers saved by digit\n2. numbers increase: increase into 4 to 1 times\n3. numbers decrease: decrease into 1 to 4 times\n(See special treatment for semantic of 1 to 4 times)\n\n### Answer:\n1. The dice will roll first before the cards placed, dice roll returns 4,  this is a exactly known condition.\n2. Since dice is a exact result, reinforces added and answer need not to be calculated, so answer will be 4 times the total reinforce added, so answer is 16.\n\n### Question:\n[Processed String] \"2200RESET122101000TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the sum of that semantic as final result and add 2 times the number of dice added.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. To increase into 4 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 4 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n2. To increase into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n3. To decrease into 12 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 12 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n4. To decrease into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n5. To decrease into 18 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 18 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n6. To decrease into 100 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 100 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n7. To increase into 5 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 5 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n8. To increase into 10 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number between\n    the semantic after multiplied by 10 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 10 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n9. To increase into 100 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number\n    between the semantic after multiplied by 100 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 100 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n\n### Answer:\n2. Since the reinforces is sumed up and the value of the semantic is no count for extra base on this question, we need to consider the \"test\" word, which will change the links between link nodes by the hammer just as above.\n3. Since aside from \"test\" the value of the semantic and reinforces are considered first, so \"test\" will not alter the resulting answer."}

I need your help in two puzzles.\n\nThe first puzzle is like this:\nI saw 13 people come out and wear the same shades, yet the colours are different.\nWhat are the same colours of the shades? My answer is [[red]].\n\nThe second puzzle is like this:\nThere are two addicts attending the basketball game. But the score isn’t important. At least it’s 38:38 for me.\nI saw the basketball court that someone was one meter tall in the exact middle of the court. how much dose it appear to the.^{[2]}Point size?\nMy answer is A little bit more than three quarters of an inch.\n\n### Answer\nStudent select what they need for their answer sheets when they sign up, so the professor (![1]///, ![2]///, ![3]///) can be helpful. Additionally, students will decide what they want to use for their measuring sticks. So the right questions are everything that we need to ask them. Well, all genders are included, so there's no specific gender there.\n\nOh, I see! There's too much stuff in these two questions, but I think that part might be unclear to me. It's mainly the \"what do students use?\" part, but that's the A, B, and C parts. Maybe this is a pattern, or a game, like, a horseshoes garden darts, if they want to do \"what do students use- What game they are playing\" but whatever. There's a bit of it.\n\nThat's the puzzle on campus, and it's the same puzzle as the puzzle statement.^{[3]}Do you think they'll always have the same puzzle, which would normally be that you get the phrase, or is that number 7 the total? Is it any word, or is it the number the instructor writes? Or is it the number on the campus walk?\n\nI think it's from the \"play\" stage of Exponentials.

Consult the file anytime you need to clarify any ambiguous information related to the rule. The rules.txt contains instructions on how to use the rules.\n\nThe provided `index.ts` and `query.ts` files expect that you have defined a handleRules function.\n\nAdd the file requirementsPuzzle.ts with the following code:\n\n```\nexport default function requirementsPuzzle(rules: string, input: string) {\n    const ruleComponents = rules.split('\\n');\n    const [instructions, riddle] = ruleComponents;\n    const parts = instructions.split(':');\n    console.log('rule: ', parts);\n    const [\n      wordOrPhrase,\n      rearrangeLetters,\n      formWord,\n      requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n      assumptions\n    ] = riddle.trim().split('\\n');\n    console.log('required: ', requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), 'to form: ', formWord, ' using all or some of the ', wordOrPhrase, ', subject to:', assumptions);\n    const solution = solve(rearrangeLetters, formWord, requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), wordOrPhrase);\n    return `\\nThe answer is: {{solution}}`;\n}\n\nfunction requirementsForLetters(number: string, word: string): number[] {\n  return ([] as unknown as number[]).concat(\n    word\n      .trim()\n      .split('')\n      .map(letter => Number.parseInt(letter))\n  )\n    .sort(\n      (x, y) => x - y\n    )\n    .filter(number => ![''.split(','), ''.split('Partition'), 'Split', ''].includes(number))\n    .slice(0, number);\n}\n\nfunction solve(rearrage: string, form: string, reqNumberOfLetter: number[], word: string): string {\n  const wordPieces = word.split(';');\n  const solution = wordPieces\n    .filter(part => reqNumberOfLetter.includes(Number.parseInt(part)))\n    .map(amountLetter => new Array(Number.parseInt(amountLetter)).fill('__').join(''))[0]\n    .split('')\n    .map((letter => rearrage.includes(letter)))\n    .filter((isIncludes) => isIncludes)\n    .map((isIncludes) => rearrage.split('')[rearrage.indexOf(isIncludes)])\n    .join('')\n    .split('')\n    .join('')\n    .concat(' - identified word: ', '''''[''rearrange: '\\'''' + rearrage +''' '' formed:''' + form + '''' ']''')\n    .toUpperCase()\n    .split('')\n    .join('');\n  console.log('Solution: ', solution);\n  return solution;\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe handleRules function is responsible for applying the problem-specific rule defined in `rules.txt` to answer the question given in `query.txt`. It accepts two arguments: rules (`rules.txt`) and query (`query.txt`).\n\nThe code that uses handleRules expects that you have defined a handleRules function.\nTo add file `handleRules.ts` with the following code:\n\n```\nconst rules = fs.readFileSync('rules.txt', 'utf8')\nconst query = fs.readFileSync('query.txt', 'utf8')\n\nconst cipher = require('./cipher.js');\n\n// Define your answerFromRules function here\nfunction handleRules(rules: string, query: string) {\n  const space = rules.includes(':') ? rules.split(':')[1].trim() : false;\n  const riddle = rules.trim();\n  const [instructions, riddle] = riddle.split(' ');\n  console.log('parts: ', instructions, riddle);\n  const parts = instructions.split(':');\n  console.log('parts: ', parts);\n  const [\n    wordOrPhrase,\n    rearrangeLetters,\n    formWord,\n    requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n    assumptions\n  ] = riddle.split('\\n');\n  console.log('expected instructions: ', requirementForTheNumberOfLetters);\n  let solution = '';\n\n  if (!rules.startsWith('Special')) {\n    solution = solveCommand(rules, query);\n  } else {\n    console.log('rules: ', rules);\n    const answer = cipher.edit(['Neither'], cipher.decrypt(rules, space));\n    console.log('answer: ', answer);\n    solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n    console.log('solution: ', solution);\n  }\n  return {\n    instruction: instructions,\n    solution: solution.toUpperCase() || ' ',\n  };\n}\n\nexport default handleRules;\n\n\nfunction replaceAll(substitute, source) {\n  console.log('condition: ', substitute.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < substitute.length; i++) {\n    source = source.replace(substitute[i], substitute[i].toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return source;\n}\n\nfunction solveCommand(rules, query) {\n  let answer = '';\n  // let solution = '';\n  console.log('second: ', rules, query);\n\n  if (rules.includes('use')) {\n    console.log('use: ', rules);\n    console.log('query: ', query);\n    console.log('all letters: ', repeat(1).join(''));\n    console.log('split letter: ', repeat(1).join(','));\n\n    switch (true) {\n      case rules.startsWith('Spell'):\n      case rules.startsWith('Rearranges'):\n      case rules.startsWith('For the': true): // `For the` could be `For the letters`.\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'required',\n          rules\n            .split(':'[1])\n            .join('')\n            .trim()\n            .toUpperCase(),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[1].trim().toUpperCase().substr(0, 10),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[2].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[4].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[5].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n        ]);\n        solveCommand(answer, query);\n        console.log('querySolve: ', query);\n        query.forEach((query) => {\n          // const toInteger = /\\d/\n          const result = query.toUpperCase().split(/(\\:|\\-)/).map((word) => word.trim());\n          console.log('result: ', result);\n          if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'please') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'pleaseuse') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          }\n        });\n        break;\n      case rules.includes('correctly answer: '): // Yoda never uses \"only\", \"include\", and \"true\".\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'replace',\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().substr(2).replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n"}

All I remember is that everyone earned between 0 and 499,999 dollars, and each line of the list contains the number that you need to start the line of letters that corresponds with the person's name. For these instructions, each space represents a single row of letters.\nThe pattern works like this: every row of letters has three letters and must be equally as long (that is at least 3 characters. Every word is 3 to 5 characters.\nThe pattern also requires that the first half, the designations of the letters, must occur in a specific order, such as this:\n```\n\n[L T D][[T H]]\n\n```\nG H\n```\nThe left half of a line may or may not be listed, and some letters may not appear in the left half.\n\nLetters on the right side answer the question which person received what salary.\n```\nRegular letters indicate that each person in the list received a salary, and a series of numbers (the way that phonetic numbers are listed, with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0) will follow that letter.\nThere are rare letters, which do not mean what they normally would, but instead represent the maximum number of decades between when two specific persons were actually paid that much money. Three such rare letters will be listed on one line of the list after the numbers are provided, and then all three rare letters will be immediately followed by another number, which is the maximum number of decades from the present that everyone earned that salary.\n\nFinally, the line of letters should be ended with the new line character \"\\n.\"\n```\n\nThe valid output should be the alphabetical list of the answers, starting at the left field and working its way to the right starting field. Make sure all the data is present in this order: the person's name, a space, the number of decadal lengths, the left side data starting characters, the rare letter for the person's salary, and finally the year since he/she was kick out, which should be at the end of the list of cents, if necessary.\nThe output must therefore repeat the final decimal character on every line of the list, and the decimal number that you are given indicates the year each person was instructed.\nFinally, the answer should be enclosed in two brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n^{[Anita,2132310,left,53 ,Ani,T,D,3],[Grant,17104,left,35 ,Gra,T,D,4],[[So,Th,Ed],[ Jo,Hart,F,4],[Y,Z,0]]}[Anna,The,Gra,0,w,2,1,0,3,2,w,2],[Dix,1,2,Anne,w,2,v,v,1,2,w,2],[Tina,C,Ani,r,w,2,2,0,2,w,2],[Ge,H,Y,w,2,3,4,2,w,2],[K,v,A,P,1,4,r,w,2,w,2],[L,w,c,2,5,r,w,2,w,2],[H,A,1,A,2,g,r,w,2,w,2]}\n\n### Question:\n1.Richie and Joaquin's practices both have more than 15 patients today, but Joaquin's practice has more patients.\n2.Gonzalo has fewer patients today than Cinthia.\n3.Dr. Mark is not part of Phuong-Hong Rez.\n4.Dr. Dina's practice has fewer than 25 patients, and she isn't part of Alhamd's practice.\n5.Dr. Grace's practice has more than 15 patients.\n6.Warren's practice has fewer than 15 patients today, but the ministry has more patients than his.\n7.Dr. Naomi Darla's practice is in Loughborough.\n8.The practice for Harvey is in Lough"}

For the numbers 2 to 9, inclusive, arrange them into a random 6row(rows) and 4 columns(cols) table, in that table all differents correspond numbers form 2 to 9 sit in it in order, and each number is used only once;\n--Stage II. For all adjacent squares(one square can also be a diagonal or vertical square) you can get the following 8 expressions:\n            M+(N&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            A+(M&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            N+(L&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M))\n            E+(C&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (M+S))\n            L+(I&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (O&amp;amp;&amp;amp;K))\n            C+(E&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A+S))\n            I+(J&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (C+O))\n            O+(K&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (IC))\n          Like:\n          M:&nbsp;top&nbsp;left\n          N:&nbsp;top\n          E:&nbsp;left\n          L:&nbsp;right\n          A:&nbsp;top&nbsp;right\n          I:&nbsp;right{中文字成}\n          O:&nbsp;bottom{中文字成}\n          C:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;left\n          S:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;right\n          J or K:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;middle\n\n--Stage III. All of the preceding expressions would be added together, and then divide by 8 as you want; In this process , you must make up some definitions:\n            A---any number not bigger than 8\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n           C2---1+2+3+4+-+-+-|6+7+8+9|5+6+7+8|4+5+6+7\n           C3---6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10|8+9+10+11+12+13\n\n\n            B--&lt;7C1+8C1&gt;|&lt;7C2+8C2&gt;|&lt;7C3+8C3&gt;\n      Like here:\n             a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\n\n--Stage IV. With each candidate (M&amp;amp;&amp;amp;N, A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M, N&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L,  and so forth), use all of the remaining eight local equations to yield nine distinct expressions.\n--Stage V. Out of these 9 equations multiply the right hand and left hand of each equation by any number between 1 and 6, inclusive, and be careful you don&#39;t pick some numbers similar when you multiply 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and so on.\n--Stage VI. The formula that you get is the final expression of your work.\n\n<strong>For example:</strong>\n\n--Stage I\n\n\n\n   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n6  |  7   |  8   |  9   |  10 |\n1  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14 |\n   |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |\n\n--renote:in this example 1 sit in up-left.2 sitin up-right\n\n--Stage II\n\n   |  Stage II    |\n:--|:--|\nM&amp;N&amp;L ---  M+(((N&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nA&amp;M&amp;L ---  M+(((A&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nN&amp;L&amp;E ---  N+(((L&amp;E)/N)+(E&amp;N))\nE&amp;C&amp;M ---  E+((L&amp;M)/(M+S))\nL&amp;I&amp;O ---  L+((O&amp;K)/(A+S))\nC&amp;E&amp;A ---  C+((E&amp;A)/(E+C))\nI&amp;J&amp;O ---  I+((J&amp;O)/(I+J))\nO&amp;K&amp;IC ---  O+(((K&amp;IC)/(C+O))/2)\n\n--Stage III\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n             1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8\n           C2:    1+2+3+4+-+-+-|-+-+-|-+-+-\n\n           C3:           6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14|8+9+10+11+12+13|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14\n\n\n         a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\na+((7c1+9c1)+(3c1+8c1))+(q1+l2+(2182178)/(12131213))++q2\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n--Stage IV\n\n                                 M&amp;M&amp;L ---------  M+(((M&amp;L)/M)+(L&amp;M))\n              AA--- M+((A&amp;M)/M) ------- M+((A&amp;M)/(A&amp;M))\n              NN--- N+((N&amp;L)/M) ------- N+((M&amp;L)/(N&amp;L))\n              LL--- L+((E&amp;L)/N) ------- L+((M&amp;E)/(N&amp;L))\n              EC--- E+((C&amp;M)/(M+S)) ------- E+((M&amp;E)/(M+S))\n              LK--- L+((O&amp;K)/(A&amp;S))------- L+((M&amp;K)/(N&amp;L))\n              CA--- C+((E&amp;A)/(E&amp;C)) ------- C+((A/N)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;((M&amp;L)/N))\n              IJ--- I+((J&amp;O)/(I&amp;J)) ------- I+((O&amp;K)/(I&amp;J))\n              OC--- O+(((K&amp;C)/(C+O))/2)------- O"}

These marking cells are not empty stars.\nThere is a coordinate in each cell on the board: p, q, i, j, r, s, h, k, u, v, w, x, e, f, g, t, z, where p, q, r, s, w, h, i, x are the positive integers, i and j are letters in {A, B, C, D, ....}, k, z U v are 0; t is the + sign (+), and e is the - sign (-). t or e compensates for the rows corresponding to positive integers and the letters i and j. Here, the characters must not be empty, i.e., there must be at least one corresponding star in each of {p, q, r, s, w, i, h, j, u, v, x, e, f, g, t, z} points. There are no stars in the p, q, r, s, w, h, i, x points; 1 star in the p, q, r, s, w, i, h, j, u, v, x points; 2 stars in some p, q, r, s, w, h, i, j, u, v, x points; at most 3 stars in the p, q, r, s, w, h, i, j, u, v, x points\nIf there are two or more of the same point numbers in the same row and column, there is no star in the common point numbers in the same row and column.\nIf there are two or more points with the same letter i or j, there are no stars in the same letter i or j.\nEach point has at most 3 stars.\nThe two or more points i with the same letter i are located in the e regular pentagon described by the path AAAABBBBCCCDDDD EE. The two or more points j with the letter j are located in the E regular pentagon described by the path AAAABBBBCCCDDDD EE. The two or more I points are located on the EE regular pentagon described by the path AAAA. The two or more j points are located in the EE regular pentagon.\n\nOutput: the coordinates of the positions corresponding to the marking that need to be replaced, each position being separated by a plane breaker at the same time, and each position being concatenated by a comma. The coordinates of each positional position need to be output as follows: the character description of the square is first output, followed by the abscissa (lexicographic order) of the coordinate p, q, r, s, w, h, i, x, followed by the ordinal coordinate q, r, s, w, h, j, u, v, x, where the abscissa is 14-extraction and the ordinal coordinate is 12- departure. For example, for A9 - A60, the coordinate stored in this place corresponds to the A9 point. h10 corresponds to the position of the u25 point. Here, capital letters on the same row have different capital letters.\n\nExample:\nInput:\nAABBDDEFFGGHHIJKLLMNNNOOOORRSS\n[a60:m25; w20:g5]\n[j4:a(3); h8:b(2); g8:a(3)]\n[i19:m5; j2:a(3); g2:a(3)]\nOutput:\noutput in the format as shown above, use a comma-separated sequence to connect each coordinate element, the coordinates of each element is represented in the form of character p, q separated by a semicolon (:), where p is the 14bit abscissa and q is the 12bit ordinal coordinate, each coordinate element use line break to above and below, sequence order: first input sequence from top to bottom, then intercept the corresponding p and q elements, last output from top to bottom.

In these cases, programmers typically face the following challenges:`\n> 1. Translating a problem from a natural language into specific code instructions\n> 2. Matching the required format for the output of their code, such as an array or a list, as specified by the problem description\n> 3. Paying attention to details, like ensuring that their code correctly handles edge cases or special instances of the problem mentioned in the question.\n> For example, the first question prompted you to answer based on a series of arrows pointing to the next direction in which to move, which involved translating a natural language rule into the specific code required to address and solve the problem. The second question prompted you to identify a specific set of elements, counting the number of times they appeared as required, while paying attention to the formatting of your answer. The third question involved correctly determining the next elements to include in each row of the given table with the proper formatting. These types of problems commonly arise in programming, highlighting the need for developers to effectively translate real-world problems into code. It’s also important to ensure your code handles all possible scenarios, including edge cases, to produce the desired output accurately."}

Its grid layout is a letter grid. The letters in the garden are hidden in a secret code (special code, different from original puzzle rule).\n\nRead the part of rule regarding “Hidden numbers” in brief.\nIt does not make sense to immediately match the letters of puzzle grid with the letters of dictionary. However, you can find hints in the table of hidden numbers. First take a look at G for example:\n\nHere the letters A and H were being swapped. Verify the same here. After solving the code, replace A with H and H with A.\nNow apply the common solution in the usual way.\n\n### Answer:\nEnter a comma separated list of shaded cities. The list should be ordered from left to right. There is no need to mention any directions (i.e., NE, SE, SW or NW). Coordinates of N city is (0,0).\n[[B C G, F G, K K]]\n   A   B   C   D   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N\nE F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n### Question:\nA\tA\tA\tA G\nA\tA\tA\tB D\nA\tA\tB\tB D\nA\tC\tC\tC D\nA\tC\tE G\tE G\nG\tG\tG\tG G\nUse the Letter Grid or The TALEN Code for word ‘TAIWAN’. Use the F-Socket for the letter T.\n\n### Answer:\n1 First take a look at G for example: G\nA was replaced with H, which in turn was replaced with A. Hence, in our case, A must be replaced with H and H with A. So, our next step would be to swap these letters in the secret code whenever one of them occurs in the random places.\n2 Secondly, verify the same for A->H, H->A in the secret code ...For the start, apply the following changes to the hidden code.\n3 But how to proceed after these swaps to solve this puzzle?\nCheating is not a good exercise, but we can make decisions without changing the dictionary. Imagine you are a robot without emotion or free will and just do flipping the letters based on suggestions. Let’s check this possibility.\nTurn to A and look at the secret code using your “Logic Chip 3407”. Decode the secret patterns shown by the chip.\n\nThe Secret Code gives a pattern for Winter -A / Winter-A.\n\nIn order to keep the letters in the right sequence, we should continue applying alternating reversals (i.e. front-and-back, or left-and-right direction). Experiment with some other reversible procedures until you are convinced that you can solve the puzzle by alternating some (basic) reversals. The puzzle rule tells you that every second domino is necessary for the completed puzzle. Therefore, we need unique poems which are compulsory to cover all the domino patterns.\n4 Now, check whether the secret code is correct. Do you find the logic in it? The tricky part is that we need to match all those letters that point in our direction. The secret code is correct if it points at least 6 times and the place already held a clue in our direction.\n\nNote: This rule only works on a limited # of puzzles(5% of puzzles). The Solution is not provided here as it requires special procedure for printing it.. [As a matter of fact, the solution takes a lot of space, and the maximum possible size of your solution will be\n\n!(x*y * N)= (x*y)*(1+18/275) in which N is the size of the puzzle.]"}

During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters. However, the letters that cross must match.\n\n5. The question consists of a list of words and a matrix with X and 0 values. The answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. Separate elements with a space and rows with a comma. Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped."}
