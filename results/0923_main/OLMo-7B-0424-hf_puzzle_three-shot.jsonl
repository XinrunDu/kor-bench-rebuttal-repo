[[and]] and you will have the opportunity to create new opportunity. and [[Yes]] One of the most amazing physics experiments of all time was conducted by two Chinese physicists in 2001. In that experiment, they generated two electron orbits, one on the outside of the other, and used them to create an electro-magnetic field that altered the behavior of another atom. The second electron circled the outside one, while the third electron circled the inside one. Due to the high energy they were working with, this created a magnetic field. But as the speed increased, they observed an electromagnetic force emerging. The two observers thought of this force as a form of expression, and as an expression, it had to be considered in terms of its physical existence. They were interested in the ways in which this force could be used by people interested in their personal lives. They decided to examine the force itself. The magnetic force was connected to the orbit of each of the two electrons. The two electrons were in parallel. One electron was orbiting in one direction, and they simultaneously made an orbit in the opposite direction. They understood that as the speed increased, the force increased as well. [[and]] and there were other experiments too, such as these carried out by physicists at Harvard University and MIT. Their results were similar to those of the scientists at the two Chinese physics labs. They discovered that with the magnetic force, the behavior of the electrons was different at the atomic level, which ultimately influenced their actions. They hypothesized that this force might be an expression of the physicality of the electrons themselves, and thus the force itself was related to their physical laws. [[and]] and though the force\n\n### Answer:\n[[and]] supported the concept that the electron was part of the universe. [[and]] supported the concept that the electron was part of the universe.

I've tried disabling a selected number of plugins like Story Keeper RPG, but to no avail.\n\nI've tried disabling a selected number of plugins like Story Keeper RPG, but to no avail.\nHi @juckyhart Your question has been re-posted here twice:\n\nhttps://handnum.org/handwiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nSupport Staff21,366 postsTom, In the interests of simplicity in case anyone underrates the importance of the topic, are you willing to answer the moderator's 2 themes?\n\nThis comment was originally posted by @cotton_quilt\n\nOpening up to further discussion around My Puzzle Content and Puzzles, I've re-started the conversation from a fresh start. I will be blunt in stating my strong preference for how the content and puzzle types work on Handnum, based on my interest and expertise.\n\n1. Remove the custom puzzle type filtering option (I see no relevant use currently - else please explain).\n2. Restrict any puzzle element to only Custom Puzzle type currently. To make only the type functional - below please allow me to share my view -\n\nThe structure needed as follows:\n\nStarting with creating the true evergreen user-editable puzzle type ->\n\nEdit any puzzle cell - https://handnum.org/handwiki/index.php/Puzzle_Answer_Cell\n\nThis re-assignment can be completed via https://handnum.org/handwiki/index.php/Puzzle_Answer_Cell_Change\n\nUsing the provided skeleton, we have additionally provided an API cell editor which can be expanded to work hand-in-hand with puzzle creation and editing for common actions to be performed for standard content creation.\n\nhttps://handnum.org/handwiki/index.php/Puzzle_Cell_Editor\n\nUsing the provided property dump of a cell, it is not difficult to also achieve the recursive rendering of the sections similar to other aspects of handwrti and possibly solve the disclosure arrangements issue.\n\nUsing the provided property dump of a cell, it is not difficult to also achieve the recursive rendering of the sections similar to other aspects of handwrti and possibly solve the disclosure arrangements issue.\n\nI believe this should be useful for a wide spectrum of challenges considering the following.\n\nOn enabling this, we believe the following can be solved being viewed as new additions.\n\nSecond by second, hour by hour, day by day, we are building our world. One meaning and symbol poem at a time. This concept is based on a slender and uncertain basis.\n\n#### Rotary for interpretation\n\nIt's slow, it's primitive, it has long been replaced. But thanks to the extremely charitable nature of digital storage (and devious deviousness to volume), the concept was almost revived in a refreshing light. As if it was invented once more in nee decades - it is only a forced device. It needs a little tweaking to bring it up to speed.\n\nThe principles are the same as such they say - sure, they are. But this time the numbers will make it happen - auto decipher, represent the puzzle as described.\n\nThe complexities of math are uncomplicated.\n\n2. Stop Forced action of VIEW/CONTINUE [Forcefulness for the latter, however, has merit]\n\nView is now a hidden parameter in handwrti's library which could be used to toggle this overly invasive policy because as it stands, the workaround to make it come back subject to specific plugins with certain targets in mind can be retyrded down.\n\nIt must — and contains a requirement — be put in a more rational place as a parameter box.\n\nThe hurdle will be carried via the qualification that it remains unchanged and in the new place, the distribution can be varied and hammered to create a puzzle paused automatically on every go. It's status will be changed — likewise, logic is good using the in-built tools enabled for this.\n\nThe doubleddpade resistance of display, data confusion, and simplification's crying rep"}

To make a square box, we make 4 folds as shown:\n\nHere, the stretchy part is made from single color box side panels.\n\nNow, using the stretchy part, you load it with colored middle panels and layer-colored top panels:\n\nThen, finish shaping it using our favorite trick, a tie 3 minutes later we will arrive.\n\nOur video that shows an example showing how to work TODAY. The assumption is you already know how to work tomrrow too. Sadly though, in the back of your mind, you know Charles is talking more BS, King Henry is good at orchestrating the illusion of good governance, and our FRICKING GOLDEN CAT, Jimbo, is ‘retired’ to also 'someone else's problem'. Besides, the last cat we saw could have been the next Jezzemn, but still has issues and loves to challenge command authority. Once again, I will be working on managing my expectations. While I admit our Pledge of secularity, one will notice 2 particular things. Our favorites and our motives. It's there even if you think they aren't. One person may have legitimate claims to the legacy of grand universities, like York University. But ask, why the hell is it the same constant set of individuals always get screwed? Oh, socialist dreams. We know perfectly well that increasing wages and going from a neoliberal economy to something like Keynes macroeconomics, will leave the masses to benefit, and socialize the clinton trade deals that created their downward journey. Despite the paper being huge in size, there is clearly a mess with behind the scenes, with those from my generation needing a sub par curriculum, now causing students to spend 30-45 minutes per question on refactoring it. Make no mistake, it's easy to solve a problem like that (saving over a minute in rotations per question) for students to, but rather solving puzzles. Hint: It's the constant promoting the 1980 student trust highschool program and an educational program, that stretches beyond 2 hrs/wk on video, contradicts itself, meanwhile replaces common sense and questioning with fear of 'colonial overlords' that don't like to brainwash students. It should be on the French definition. You may recall I was studying CS for 9 mph, that would be the game. What's worse is those people are horrible at analysing puzzles. It's clear I need to write down all the hints I could find, and strongly consider those who were telling me that SUPPLY TO DEFENSE is NCTVE AND NOT A LOOP. Even better, preventing all other triangle from being constructed, before placing the Destroy card. Things get better, with perhaps stronger thinking. Duh. Our last thematic task card, Destroy It Second pack, was on our Awaken pack, because we thought about socializing redemptions, even if there were some broken promises along the way. Tricky too, is we may need tori + circlet, so saving over a minute per rotation will take some re-thinking. REGENERATION + Park + Fairy are the answers, but are they good answers? Well researched. Probably, you understand that we are all depressed, maybe even rly low IQ. Kick them out if you think otherwise, but what will you gain? Or better yet, how 'thinking outside the box' do you perceive TEACHING EDUCATION CAN BE?

T, D, L and C are all different letters (and being a B itself, and the device being told to never use a 0, B in this context is count as different from 0 and 1).

Obviously, if the end word is in the pivot point's dictionary, the most efficient move forwards is to simple change the spelling of the pivot point with the correct character. This takes four moves, as needed:\n\nThe other option is to change the whole pivot point, using one move IF the pivot point is in the end words dictionary. In worst case, it'll take six moves.\n\nWith the answer to \"Fire\" called the pivot point, we'll first obsev the most efficient move forwards is to change the whole Word, using one two moves:\n\nThe solves before and after this look very similar, so the rest is deduced!\n\nAt \"snirt\", we need two extra steps to change the whole word.\n\nThe last option is to change the last three letters from the start to the end. The rest of the way is obviated, with one move.\n\nThe way to these solutions is deducting from each other. Each answer is around five moves, to where the answer to \"Time\" and \"Fire\" are the pivot point, and around six moves, to where the answer to \"Time\" is the pivot point.\n\nThe only one remaining that takes more than six moves is \"Snow\", as it has the longest middle word!\n\nEasy\nThe puzzle is relatively simple, though tedious, especially for puzzle #2 due to high time needed. Rather than using more methods in the suggested answer, the middle word solution can also be found with recursion, although creating the answer as a list would be easier to read. Here is the code:\nimport string\ndef next(current,final):\nif current.lower() == final:\nreturn 0\n\nelif current.lower() not in final.lower():\nreturn 5\n\nfor n in range(len(current)-1):\nnext(current[1:n+1],final)\n\nnext(current,final)\nelse:\nreturn 6\n\nwith open(\"Time\") as text:\nwith open(\"BARE\") as text:\nprint([sum(next(vr,vw) for vw in words \\\nfor vr in lonely_words])\nprint(words[0],\"\\\\n\",words[0])\nWith answer \"Pass\", the words are swapped. First, to go from the end to the start word, easy to solve with this solution:\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import ttk\n\napp = tk.Tk()\nmem = tk.StringVar()\nalphabet = string.ascii_lowercase\nfor letter in alphabet:\nwidgetLabel = tk.Label(app,text=letter).grid(row=0,column=0)\nwidgetVar = tk.StringVar()\nbuttonVar = tk.StringVar()\nwidgetLabel = ttk.Combobox(app,values=alphabet \\\nfor letter in range(ord(alphabet[0]),ord(alphabet[0])+len(alphabet)):\nprod[count] = buttonVar.set(mem)\ncount = count+1\nprint([len(prod)+ind for prod in prod])\nAll remaining steps in each of the puzzles is to switch letters around in the start word. This can be over a whole word or over many. Messing with spaces, it definitely needs to be over a whole word to get a good number depending on the rule!\nThe puzzle layout is a specific way to arrange words, with a rule tied very neatly to letter-customers (spelled that way on purpose) that slightly simplifies the puzzles.

Solve Abbrev Word¶s Puzzles.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Think through the logic that will be needed to solve this puzzle type.\n2. Discuss any concepts that you find difficult or are unclear.\n3. Once you understand the full picture of the puzzle type, you can apply that understanding to the specific puzzle provided.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\nA value is indicated for each cell on a grid (representing a top down view if you imagine a large rectangle as a grid). The rules that govern each cell's value are that (1) each cell's value is the largest number whose digits are the same as those on the rows and columns of the cell's location, and (2) no cell can have a value greater than its upper right neighbor. For example for a 2x2 grid:\n17\n1 8\nThe solution would be 2. The rules are broken if an 8 were put into the middle row of the grid and a 17 were put into the top row. The digits on each of these rows are identical, so by rule 1 the only cell value is 17, but by rule 2 the value of the top cell would need to be less than or equal to the answer. This makes the 17 be tied in another cell (probably the one in binary haha). So the only solution for a 2x2 grid is 2.\n\nWith a larger grid, in this grid for example:\n13 2 6 6 8 74 1 55 141 31 33 13 67 3 3 4 41 1 97 934 132 95 1 4 45 67 8 6 7 196 38 5 33 9 4 146 83 3 1 14 11 10 3 2 46 27 3 21 3 695 25 4 3 86 34\n\nthe solution is 1.\n\nThe rules are \"spaces\" between cells also count as digits. The two 8s in the top row are given the same state as one 8, if it were next to the other 8. So in a two dimensional grid, if the grid is space separated, then there are two 8s. Likewise if two cells have the same digit and one of those digits is adjacent to a space, then both of those cells have that digit.\n\n### Question:\n11\n1 1 88 3\n\n### Answer:\n6\n\n### Question:\n8 8\n1 11 198 3\n200 3 8 2\n\n### Answer:\n1 13\nA value could also be put outside the grid but that is impossible for this grid for example. Also all numbers are 32 bit integers so no numbers greater than 9999999 are allowed.\n\n### Question:\n3 11 2 8 1 7 4 1 33 16 14 2 4 16\n2 1 2 6 3 1 77 1\n1 1 6 17 48 30 2 1\n1 4 10 8 3 4 1 31 2\n1 1 8 2 5 94 9 8 16 2\n18 2 2 4 4 81 111 1 1\n4 15 19 5 6 4 1 9 77 3\n2 49 1 4 2 69 16 18 46\n2 2\n\n### Answer:\n2 3 1 55 2 57 2 5 1\n\n### Question:\n1 1 1 233213 7 1 6\n2 2 1 1 63412347\n1 6 6 54557 6 1 5\n5 1 2 2 3 4 7 5325\n7 7 1 35 1 7 6 866\n67 7 1 1 678 4 6 1\n8 7 1 1 86 1 4 1\n4 7 1 7 7 5 23 7 8\n2 8 4\n2 2 8\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\nP J\nR A J\nY T L\nV N B\nM M S\nZ I J\nN D T\nC O O\nU W M\nG I T\nX T L\n\n### Answer:\n\n### Question:\n1 20454\n"}

You would like to make sure that your code is working correctly by comparing it against the output of the materials file service.\n\nThe output of the materials file is a file containing the entire puzzle, answers, and some other helpful information. The following are steps to emulate that output file.\n\nYour code should follow these steps to satisfy the pin-out tests:\n\n• Step 1: The file should be a plain text file.\n• Step 2: The file extension should be .puzzle.txt.\n• Step 3: The file should contain a single stream of text.\n• Step 4: The text should run for the entire length of the file.\n• Step 5: The character separating puzzle configurations and answers, i.e. |, should be on every row.\n• Step 6: | should be followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 7: The | character is the only one that does not have any character outside of its columns followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 8: The puzzle configurations are followed by a ##.\n• Step 9: The answers are followed by a #.\n• Step 10: The #s only have greedy answer blocks followed by a newline (\\n) character.\n• Step 11: The character separating columns inside a row should be a |.\n• Step 12: Which character separates greedy columns inside of a greedy block is [optional].\n• Step 13: Greedy blocks follow their greedy columns by a | followed by space ( ).\n• Step 14: A newline (\\n) character follows the end of the entire file.\n• Step 15: Steps 8-14 occur once for each answer and configuration in the answer and configurations sections of the materials file.\n\nThe example puzzles defined in the previous challenge are provided below as seed material that you can check for correctness of the matching materials file. These files should be exactly what you are submitting.\n\nThe materials file service expects to receive the following requirements for your code to pass all three mechanisms of criteria:\n\n1. A successful post to POST URL\n2. The contents of POST URL match the file defined in the file comparison criteria.\n3. The file is not corrupt.\nvar _materialsService = new JUSTINHM.PoRank.MaterialsService();\nvar puzzlePath = \"path/to/puzzle.txt\";\n\n// only the contents of the puzzle is sent\nvar parameters = new\n{\npuzzlePath = puzzlePath\n};\n\n// POST a POST URL\n_materialsService.Post(parameters);\n\n\nFor representations of ordinary text data like plain text files, ASCII, UTF-8, or an equivalent encoding can be used. If your format is at all specialized, like a zip file or a binary or hex encoded or any alternative format than TEX, LATEX, or plain text files, you MUST provide a defined decoder alongside your code.\n\nThis challenge is worth 80 points in total.\n\nThis is a pass-fail challenge for which you must satisfy all of the contents of the Materials File Service challenge to receive any points. If less than 82 out of the 80 points are satisfied, you will not receive any credit.\n\nIf any of the steps in these contents were not satisfied, you will not receive any points even if you have met all other requirements and passed the post-submission criteria challenge.\n\n## Test Case 5\n\nAgility\n\n### Description\n\n• A 0 is memory mapped to 0-bit\n• ::= * is included\n• A 1 is memory mapped to 1-bit\n• +/! are included\n\nThe answer consists of each individual line in the puzzle's output in a certain order. The input map should be a binary representation of the columns and rows of each of the answers in the order, followed by each individual line of puzzle matrix in their order, a line break, followed by each individual line of puzzle matrix in their order.\n\nThe valid letters are A-Z, MHELNIK, and 0-9. Other characters, i.e. UPPER_ALPHABET, LOWER_ALPHABET, NUMBER, TELEPHONE, RULE, and ALL_SCRAMBLE_RUPTURE are not valid for clues. The other conditions from the materials file challenge (above) are also enforced.\n\nThe valid matrices according to the files are\n\n### Puzzle Answer Test Case 5\n\nHere's what the output of the matrix needs to look like in order to pass - ODER on a sheet of paper - in order so that you can solve for the correct output\n\n### Example answer (Torchin)\n\nANALYSER uidystems.\nBHELNIK Trent.\n\nDiaz nth l)usefulljob.\nFsciel under parep/k).\nMATRIC GRUB Mabell.\n\n.12/e Matrix.\nFusdone bprimrning .\nResiundfunnless aivcri.\n\nLABC rnes are in\notiMErr.\nSp hantoms .\n\n### Output\n\nODER\n\n### Example answer (Cochrane)\n\nHes outside a place.\nIt's a breathing word. -------\nA parental noun,  2 D ency.\n\nMountain Faura Dialyt Cochran\n\nKus under go.\n"}

All programming is, fundamentally, do (task) and now (times were simpler. This simple task/now model continues when coding complex problems every day, especially for long shows where you have to remember the code over multiple days.\n\n### All the following programming puzzles are fundamentally about testing your ability to reason clearly and efficiently about big-O running times of these algorithms. And particularly about the complexities of recursion and how, when, and why a function's depth determines its computational complexity or runtime.\n\n### As with all really good brain-benders, programming puzzles can let you hone in on a big idea in computing, informally or concretely, engage on all cognitive levels, and teach huge lessons that you can go home and employ as best you can in the sheer conquest of office problems. A good challenge is redolent with Eureka moments that leave you feeling the oily-feeling glee of those killer programmers and architects. And after much mental and rhetorical tugging, and a sudden twist of thought, you grab onto a nugget of insight that transfixes you and leaves you nodding your head in astonishment, even after many attempts to explain it or prove it to someone else.\n\n### People from many programming it [including developers and project managers] call software engineering a craft. But a craft, and particularly one that takes years to hone, is a tricky thing to define. The main reason people called it engineering was that software engineering amounted to making buildings out of code with different tools and in different ways. And that idea clearly no longer fits. That goes double for looking at a programmer's mental process.\n\n### Designing code is different from the craftesmen approach to other manufacturing projects that you always see on TV shows with Joel Spolsky. Unsurprisingly, programmers who carry themselves like engineers may be dangerous and their ideas unRefined until they come to terms with their true limitations and preferences. The end-result of such bravado can be as self-aggrandizing as arrogance and mania. Because the dark side of computing for some people consists of hardness, optimization, and following what the math says to the letter regardless of your practical understanding and judgment. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\n\n## Puzzle with Mandelbrot set\n\ncategory:math  geometry\n\n### Let's prove the independent flame height for the infinity figure-eight cylinder of Mandelbrot when it is expressing a cube where all listed values of tupels are used for scaling. Let us calculate it with the previous kudcube sets to figure out how to use the color to make the cube-shadow-lines more visible. See below. Note how the lines during the first frames are of great clarity. Then, it becomes like \"unicorn-visual\".\n\n### Completers will remember checking the height on the height codes: x1 - x2 = 0, x0 gradient - y0 gradient = 1, and x1 gradient + x2 gradient = 2 and all values are used. The symbol for the cube tupel color number assignment is as follows (numbers for the top lines)\n\nThe heights used start from zero, one, two, three, and four and are not independent compositions of the types from other color lines, like the dendrite cubes.\n\n### (1,2,3,0) -63\n### (1,2,3,1) +7\n### (1,2,3,2) +56\n### (1,2,3,3) -72\n### (1,2,3,4) -9\n\n### And then the following four tuple colors start with (4,3,2,0) -11. If these aren't enough colors for all cases, add the fifth tuple color (5,1,0.5,0). Even then, support for all colors for all shadowed frames is likely unfeasible.\n\n## Real-time Animated Computer Emblems with fork()\n\n### Since my birthday, I am on the ways to make two computer emblems on one shell of terminal. hacking and linux. They move by using fork(), and I can animate them with a random arrow in the background.\n\n### Well, I do like the look of having my Linux symbol and the Hacker-Ground symbol"}

Sums used. Numbers used at most once.\n\nNote that the ' sums used' are only numbers used. Therefore, if a number is added (core therefore makes up one of its own ' sums') that is not marked, the function is not functional.\n\n2. How many possibilities are there for the sum? Number of defined squares.\n\nFor example, a 4-dimensional sum will have 3 dimensions ( horizontal, vertical, using diagram )\n\n\"Diagrams may have extra information to help you solve puzzles!\n\n(some part of the puzzle may be separated in parts/steps, sometimes parts might be similar(same/repeated)\". When looking at to the sum and the number of dimensions total, another possibility is the intersection of the dimensions, for the sum of the 3 dimensions, a sum of intersections is equal to problems (the sum of intersection over intersections). Also a combination of intersections (horizontal + vertical) adds horizontal or vertical to the number of squares to look up the sum. This is more complicated since it holds a square when there is no rule adding one dimension horizontal or the other.\n\n3. Each square can be defined as a subset such as( a board of numbers from the puzzle, score, blank square). (There may be more definitions / de-mutations (context).\n\n4. If all numbers are added then mapping is the inverse of the what is called an N-tuple of vertices on a 2d space which is an N-dimentional space.\n\n• #### Question:\n\n1. For the board how do (we/map ) the sum discrete number to a continuous space and how can we relate the number to the part. 2. How do (We/map) the dice dice to the set of positive integers and negative. 3. How do we do/work out the sums (we/map )the sum discrete numbers to a continuous space and how can we relate the number to the part\n\nIf one can figure the sums, then there is a solution based on probabilities. The mapping can be solved separately, but only after all squares have been filled. However many problems show that the answer is not found by just pressing the available numbers to the grid such that squares are filled with the greatest gaps, looking for a singular set if feasible .\n\n• #### Question:\n\nthere are some numbers (lets say 3,4,5 ) which are-->we can divide every square and by adding 1 positive and negative ( it can start from 0 -Davide and Devana Hedic).\n\nQuestion:-\n\nThis is for:: (Davide and Daiva Hedic) : we are told to combine all rows and columns, then every square has a positive and negative.  What do you think the specific process (only 2 steps?)\n\nwhen there are two diagonals (I think from positive to negative) we can soo determine. I mean how big is the grid? I think every be relative.\n\n3 2 6\n6 5 3\n10 8 1\n4 172 3\nIt is an easy problem I see it. However I have a question that is my solution is correct? and believe me now is similar to the first problem the other is easy too. 3- Octal Hey is known? is generally easier than 6?\nSo you did put the numbers 1-10?\nWhy do we ask?\n\nBasically there are 2 little diagonal.\n\nPut diagonal in 1-10 so it will go\n\n3 is first diagonal with 3 in one of the rows but then we will also get 8 what is the adition for each?\n\nif we had used 10 then it would be 10+3=13 ok,another question: does that work if we use different numbers different than 3,8,10?\n\nBecause we put the numbers 1-10 in from the easiest to the one the greast one.\n\nAlso you draw a picture and you can see the squares what make problems. It's for this puzzle for deparserédier\n\nIt maywell be easy for you but think about problem.\n\n• #### Question:\n\nknow it is clear you explained the grid and computed the sum and do you think to describe more thing or related in the puzzle.\n\nHow do we describe?\n\nwell it should be clear but I have another question put octal 3 in 1-10 like 2 graphs each from 1-10 in each row not all the rows have to be filled + each row and each list of numbers make 9 sum of 1,2. it should be clear now what more can i do?\n\n• #### Question:\n\n2. sqrt 3 + 1\n\nin messages 3 and 4 I say the same answer but I added one square from diagonal front to diagonal back this is clear that the problem is involves one vertical less one horizontal(deux grandes diagonales , one diagonal is the white(the line) 7- 19 one of hese is removed. if ti becomes 13 that means this is correct one diagonal. Here the introduced number 1 only this is what the symbol suggest not the problem.\n\nsrry..... how will we describe (mathematically) the problem?\n\n• #### Question:\n\nTo know where the two diagonal are put one diagonal (+ back) first and then you will get the number (if diagonal used find out but later) you can add numbers but not consecutive and it will be huge. The square get numbers from 1-10 like Octal 6 in horizontals i see it only from horizontals 6+5+3=16 (3 is coding the sum of octal as sequential sum it is wrong but this is okay. Is octal monatomic?\n\nThe diagonal is (61.25,65) so it is not correct to 11+6 square because square is just 5. Also, to start with (this code is just if we talk about diagonal) but to put is diagonal into horizontals is codings one diagonal to go diagonal is 10 for diagonal it should define the diagonal like coding+ 8Squared + 10 multiplied with sum. It means that it is like square. We don't use 2 diagonal. We have one diagonal. Basically it is not correct to put octal number in flaw to go at the diagonal.\n\nYou are specialize in article and edit but you must be as your users and use more specific code for example if you have squares and NON- CROSSES it may be helpful I think BUT OKAY I will consider this in the near future. There are problems involved with writing square in papers. Already already square is NOT useless but I think that it may be used with proofs and examples where having an extra diagonal go2the answer.\n\nIn one way you got to increasing the sum of numbers by filling the white lines and if you are solving for sum 13. the sum is 13.} by x. Not by y or y+z because it is not y+. It's in your place.\n\nSquares by the way may be used for solving other problem like max squares. What if for example the number is 4-6 ? Are there any ways in solving problems if they go the same but not as well as you would like to.\n\n• #### Question:\n\nIt means you can distruct the domain vertically or horizontally   what is the first most common osimomer from x amount PERCILLAN ##\n\n• #### Question:\n\nMy reaction 1. I will do the first step. You can do the second step the wrire out in the document where you can have that but anyway the max problem is about having no difference between the numbers and having a strengts because we have two secret numbers in the mystery number i mean if it is like one problem more then an extra chip is added to a solution she wont be too far off. There are also problems like what we do in the book shvesheia this summer. Let's do what we wnt to do. There are two numbers gives the number of simplexes of a 3-dimensional simplege polytheene(real space) heuse have two numbers and the coolest thing is that the n- fourth of the homologous-dimension is equal to the sum of hese numbers. It is less means it r smaller jnow is that?\n\nWhat is the the beautiful sharf about the number 15?\n\nQuote from (3.1) in Introduction to surface topology page no. 39-40  Come its late i dont think about it to reply. It is also possible if we have more than 2 sovereign. some number goes from the largest to the smallest.\n\nThe hard part is to define letters (2 sovereign) but what about F when we did more than 2 components of the given surface and there are not 2 sovereign for components so\n\n2. we have when there is no pure sums\n\n• #### Question:\n\n3) Q3. Given a function f: R2NH,re(x)e−r(y), which satisfies the Laplace Equation, what is its general solution?\n\nA) All functions of the form  Sint × sinkt for integer m, k ∈ Z,  A, Ak ∈ R.

From the remaining points we can create several  befriends [-1,3, -2, 8, 2, 11].befriends is a constant string. The points befriended are the first and last numbers from the rewards and changes can be only done in ascending order. We mark all befriended numbers with X. An example below, each number is an element in a line. Since line elements are not specified, ans is an array of these elements. ans is hardcoded in the form: [[num1],[num2Xnumnumnum3],…]. The goal is to make a solution that takes a point in the line and replaces it with an X, being sure that once the solution takes a point then the current friend will not be replaced and the number is not already marked X. Otherwise we have a full solution if the full line becomes X. We want the solution that we will take the most points in a single solution. The final answer should be given in a space separated list of integers. Use square brackets for your own array solution, where the rearranged points are listed in the same order as in the original array.

I'm trying to write a sudoku solution that can handle files with a million individual numbers and still run in a reasonable amount of time. Are there any features of puzzle individuals in particular that can be exploited, or some other way to speed it up?\n\nIt augments a factorization cache for the Sudoku into an incomplete factorization, where each entry in the matrix is determined by three known values. (properties 4 and 5 may be ignored in this case)\n\nThe factorization is organized in a 3x3 CHull and allows one to recover the value in the middle of the given set by looking at the surrounding values. I've implemented this with a smart pointer, but this still assumes that I need to access all of the Chults to iterate over them, or minimize the amount of rotations I need to preprocess. The kernel for this is written to work with arbitrary settings rather than something that can run on a particular machine.\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose you need to solve the following Sudoku:\n\n16\n12 13\n14\n\n2 8 1\n4 9 7 6\n1 3 5\n5 6 9\n8 7 3\n5 3 4\n9 2 1\n8 4 7\n\nDo you know the factorization? Sure! Load in a binomial AVL tree or directly as a set if it's still open.

Are there parts of the rule that are easier to understand than others?\n\n1: No, the rules were pretty straightforward for me for splitting out the correct metadata from the puzzle itself. Added a few sanity checks and a way to calculate the counts before the submission. 2: No, the custom puzzle rules were simple to understand in all parts.\n\nPuzzle: 22354\nTags (Separate/Separate with spaces with a semicolon):\n\n1: According to rule stated in the 3rd section- the n column where the values belonging to the previous and columns present are 4 we need to check+=1 Either its immortal for the side to check or check+=1\n\n2: Not familiar of any other tag for custom puzzle\n\n\n### What operations do you propose adding to the interpreter (if any)? What new tags would they be tied to?\n\n1: Compared to other stars attribute parsing using set is faster than objects in terms of time in my calculations (Hard to tell the exact difference). The only it needs to check is each number if falling within respective stack like zone / corner with then incrementing the corresponding value in the set\n\n2: Im not sure what is the best operation performance wise that can replace this. It might be solved using an iterator comparing the value range since my algorithm currently runs linearly to the end of the matrix. Also, we can bind list along with the meta data while constructing in the python function\n\nOptions for operation types (2):\n(1) A more efficient hashing algorithm (?)\n\n2: Yes, there are multiple options to increase the efficiency based on the algorithm without impacting the rules / solution of the puzzle itself.\n\nThe algorithm Description :\nFor a n x n puzzle (puzzle should have equal columns and rows):\n1. Lines\nWe calculate the\nLine 1 :  Right 2 Left () 3 Bottom 4 Top () for each row.\nLine 2 :  Right () Left 2 Top 3 Bottom 4 for each column .\n\nFrom there by using recursion angle/side/boundary/corner records distance to respective lines and the zone which is the sum of all recorded distances surrounding each number (edge to inner edge triangle shape for custom 10x10 puzzles only).\n\nThese will become the hardcoded numbers that python script sees.\n\n2. Performance\nWe create the nodes in objects local queries with custom southwest, northeast and south queries that use O(1) capability while running factorial on number attribute provided and precalculated probabilities from lookup table\n\n3. Constructing the set\nWe transform each by changing the value zone and distance from the previous column in the range while traversing. It is noticing the numbers that may have created the range or will create new. This is what adds the value with number and count values.\n\n2.For example on my local report from the same version as the custom puzzle:\nOn the public Custom report hashing at line 26 with implementation of the status (instantiated?). Once it gets created any updates are saved only when trying\n2.(Flag 4) or did it not work (Flag 3) or has no areas (masked flag 1) to record the distance or final clash between status(success/failure) and no. of segments corresponding to the n is the final value as obtained in the use case.\nBut when it tries to return the core is a problem that it clashes between the value from pattern and implementing CPU bottlenecks that is highlly expensive to tweak for every n.\nFor example Even for Custom(hard) size 40x40 the values is 1865670 using both meta to be obtained on the cpu and casts successfully. By increasing the slice Cash(now I can just Create Data Cases for given 32x32 and 36x36) , I was able to reach the 2,627,756 and 3,173,217 using status.\n\nA reason for this could is it is creating \"-mask- with additional information on whether the custom puzzle given is solving flawlessly or contain loop.\n\nAlgorithm flowchart:\n(See attachment)\n"}

Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[24,12,4,22],[23,33,5,18],[2,3,4,25],[11,12,13,32],[18,19,20,26],[22,23,24,31],[13,14,15,25],[19,17,30,28],[1,8,14]]\n\n### Puzzle Match-1 (Game-2) (DIFFICULT)\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\nAll characters when displayed (either for standard output or in binary data) must consist of composed arrays of 1-bit elements. There are two design factories used for the characters to be printed, one for the ASCII single character array character (32) and another for ASCII multi character array character (61). All designs are single or double, the difference in design being counted as a difference in number of bits.\n\n### INPUT\nThe input consists of lines displaying data for the game, separated by the end of line character. A two-character line looks like this:\n\nhuman player:achine player:game status\n\nThis is then followed by a binary string, which itself being divided into columns using a length of 1. The [0,1] binary values determine what character is displayed by ASCII 32 for that column. The number of bits is equal to the length of the [0,1] binary pattern.\n\nFor example, the input string 300100000011 represents the game for which there are 4 bits (see below).\n\n### OUTPUT\nEach output design represents a character (ASCII 32 or 61) which should represent a part of the game board. For example, output of [0110111] represents a player (the [0,1] binary determines which attacker's throne spaces to attack), [10011] represents a player, and so on.\n\nSpecifically, how it should look like is as follows. Let (C1,CN) be a character in the game, and (α1,...αm) be the [0,1] binary representation of the column, i.e., the number of [0] marks. Then, each character is shown for the (C1), (C2),… column, where C(i) = 1[limit of [L,8]] if αi = 0 or βi = 1, iff L rather than αi = 1 if they are 0 or βi = 1, of one bit (of the game board).\n\nTherefore, after each output design completes its presentation, the answer is closed by a print statement which shows the character with ASCII {26} (via the function Game.display) according to the rules above. To do this, you are simplifying each captured array for display in a 5733 character loop. Since the array contains the symbol, each element of the array is replaced by a string of characters in it for display.\n\nYou must close the game parts of the shell loop by whatever means necessary to simulate a script in shell.\n\nIt is prohibited to allocate any input other than the provided arrays (maximum size of 4), and input.lines is open. Use as many lists as desired in between (but save Warmup), unless any of the features or hoops are given, then use as few as necessary. Your code size may not exceed the response, either way, (the amount is 2). You may note that the size limit is included for Final 2, although the method of setting it is not reflected in any problem description. For any problem, you are allowed to use anything up to one answer for each line (with exception of indent), as long as it appears in the source.\nThis program ensures that the input for final or youthful originating from its source (including descendants), will not require any additional function assignments, so it is only used if that is the case. For any function, indicate whether it is declared or the same as a parenthesis in all special cases, and update its limit.\n\n### Talks: [e]\n\nIf any of your answers falls short, all follows are a function of longer input strings, as well as sigmoid amplitude. Please add any issue reports or message you receive in a new approach: (3 step, each representing a series of case distinction, selec-attack, fire, 4defenses vector)-loops that appear a (newline or comment) for specifying middle or case distinction). With exceptions, all vectors in the input now appear as columns, and you are allowed to put in as many special cases as possible, but (if the number of elements is less than ntotal or zero) the nsig is divided among them. All data has been done through to the end of the current user and div-vector (sig), which is named such in the file. SIG is at least half the size of its first operand (rounding system).

Number the tasks starting at 1. Only the first task can start at time 1, the second task can start at time 2, etc. For each interior task, let's call it $a_{i}$ and its left adjacent $a_{i-1}$ and its right adjacent $a_{i+1}$, how many start times can we have to have total time cost equal to $K$, where $K$ is provided. Assume time cost of starting at 0 is $0$. Yield answer in a list, where the first entry is number of ways that all tasks can start inside the interval [1, 2], the second entry is number of ways that all tasks can start inside the interval [3, 4], etc., until the total number of tasks, and last entry is the number of ways where no tasks can start. For example, a case with $a_i=5,0,6$ and $K=14$. Here is one possible solution, five tasks starting at time 8 (left adjacent), 7 (interior), 2 (interior), 1 (interior), and 13 (right adjacent). All tasks can end at time $14$. We can achieve the same total time cost by starting some tasks later, example at time $6$ (left adjacent), 4 (interior), 3(interior), 1, 14 (right adjacent). All tasks can end at time $14$.\nYour input:\narray of array of integers, where first dimension is number of time costs for each task and second dimension is the tasks.\nFor example, [[5, 0, 6], [0, 14, 8], [5], [0, 8, 1], [1, 0, 1], [2, 2], [0, 18, 3], [2, 6, 18]], meaning there are 5 tasks stored starting from [0], task 0 starts at time $5$, task 1 starts at time 0, task 2 starts at time $6, ...$ For time cost K = 14, the output should be a list, where the first entry is number of ways that all tasks can start inside the interval [1, 2], the second entry is number of ways that all tasks can start inside the interval [3, 4], etc., until the total number of tasks, and last entry is"}

For example, if there are only three elements in a row, row elements starting from the leftmost will first number from 1 to 3 in a row, in the order from top row to bottom row; secondly, the \"second row\" elements number from 1 to 3 on a basis of taking numbers row by row from first row to last row; thirdly, these two rows together number from 1 to 6 on the basis of taking elements column by column. Beatles rule enforcement is similar.\n2.Beatles rules say that first, go through the borders from left to right, starting from the top, taking numbers along the border from left to right one by one until you get a \"gap\" while continue taking numbers from top to bottom; for example, a 8 8 5 6 grid has 1 to 4 in diagonal framework from left to right as its borders, and any of 5 6 8 9 which are not in the border is capable to be taken next; second, go through the borders vertically, starting above the borders and move from left to right, taking numbers in each border, comparing the number next to the number taken in the numerical relationship constraint; these are text-book cardinal numbers; third, go back to the left row again, taking numbers according to the numerical relationship from left to right; fourth, go to the top border again, take numbers from left to right, and fill the leftmost part of the grid with those \"keys\"; fifth, go to the cells two-rows above the borders, take numbers in the same order as along the borders of the first rows; sixth, continue to go through and take numbers from left to right along all the borders, stopping at the cells which already contain numbers (this occurs at the corner cells). Note that each grid has exactly one top border, one left border, and two vertical borders; the rules for the cell taken last are only applicable to the cells two-rows above the borders; once the last cell is taken, filling up other cells are done in the straight forward \"from left to right\". The rules revolving the diagonal is again performed on both horizontal borders and vertical borders too, in an alternate way, namely (1) go from top right to bottom left at horizontal borders, and from bottom left to top right at vertical borders; (2) take numbers from right to left at horizontal borders and from left to right at vertical borders; (3) go from bottom to top at horizontal borders and from top to bottom at vertical borders; (4) go from left to right at horizontal borders and from right to left at vertical borders.\n3.The clue to understand the rule is to know what \"generating\" means. Beatles rule says \"how to generate grid\" in an \"interpretable and haptic\" way.\n4.A grid is divided into eight parts where one can take a cell from one of these parts, for example, fd for 2nd row, f for the 1st row, and d for the right-most column; the rules are applicable to grid row by row, on each row ordered from the bottom to top, from left, and fill up from left, stop at the last cell that requires filling. The sense of starting from the second row should not be confused as there are \"two rows\" of numbers from the left border to the right border. Fill f from the right none-penultimate cell (e.g. df from ed above) to the last cell of first row and down to the last row. Leave two colums before the f and those colums filled by \"h\" colum are \"f\" grid. Delete the f and rotate the grid by 180 degrees, new rows are again \"f\" grid.\n\n\n### Submission Rules\n\nDo not include tool libraries into your submission.

I started by initializing vacuous strings. l()=L() will pick a number given an array, and then I've applied most of the similar code to the first function pick() which then picks numbers for the whole array for me. I've then proliferated the functions for each special case. The final output array now contains double the amount of characters (' ') as expected, hence I loop through it and delete the pins while generating a final variant bitmap in each iteration. I first stored all lambda functions in the same function as well as 63 constants I re-used inside the generated code.\n\nif there were no duplicates at all this could perhaps look like this (but still not \"visible\")\n\n(((([A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L],D)(((K)=v=>[x=!v?H:J:x])||([K]=k[B+1*H+J][L+1*(!K?H:v)][H+1*(F+4*(!K?R+1:(5]<J))]),-(5,[[,[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[4*[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[e=][['-'+L+A+1+B][A+1++H+1++C+8+H+'-'++E+1+G][D+1]+K+0+L+1+D][F[C->1](F,C,D,K,L,e=J+=14)&&'L'+I+G+J++_]['F'+H+(_]decodeURIComponent((A+J[F+1]+B[F,X][F,K++,F,C,1+H++J][J,X.replace(Y=>G+=L++C instanceof error,X=(A+J,B+1)~~B+1+((C+=E)+C)((I+=K-5+J)(C+++1+F**6%J))+D+1+L++C>F++I+R[D++_ depending]){{\\ if(!0+(if(!','_'=(C+++1)+K[C[Y=\"H\"++1]+N++,1+F][1],a+=6;\\;-(+<'',_+=Z[K]\\ own(L++Y+='-XX+!delete(G')+D++e)+if(N++_>G)(_&=L++,2*Y&&'+',N_=1+3*V*_ +=4*(Y))===\"\"Obj::read(N+',\"ZB;4}{[C,!ZPP)]. 6+G],Q18)[J++]\\\\]{$##.+Q === _}(J[X,[ and e]L"}

There are a few steps to writing a custom rule:\n\n### Applicable rules\n\n• Must have the prefix \"custom-puzzle-\".\n• Won't have the prefix \"custom-\".\n\n### Elements of a custom rule\n\n1. First, you'll write a description of your custom rule. It must be in the JSON object called \"description\" in the rule file, for example:\n\"description\": \"Hello, how are you? This rule outputs numbers based on some of your input. For example for this custom puzzle, do this: 8, 2, 2, 8, 9 This will output 1, 1, 4, 8 for the example.\"\n2. Next are the input and outputs. Your rule gets a bunch of input based on the custom puzzle. I will use the first custom puzzles as an example where it was 8 2 2 8 9.\n3. What you'll want to replace with those inputs with your outputs. The final script is typically wrapped with your outputs, what your script needs to look like if you were running it with your first custom puzzle as input is this:\n\"code\": \"console.log('1,1,4,8')\"\n\n### Usage\n\nAdding a custom puzzle rule to your puzzle keeps it in game, but the PI (player input) part is hidden. By the time the AI picks your custom puzzle rule, that's the only part the AI will see. Then, what the AI sees is used as inputs.\nif you use the above text as your rule, you won't need the custom puzzle parent, example showing everything else, including the custom puzzle rule."}

And I even don't have a good idea how to model a random graph efficiently. So I also don't see how to solve this using FPGA algorithms. Therefore I've not yet written anything for the second part!\n\n• If I remember correctly, these kind of graphs have an undirected analogue obtained by looking at the graph in which e.g. when there is a line from a node to the left of a 1 to a node to the right of another 1, there's an edge from that node to the one between them. Then it's not that hard to find a minimal generating function for this digraph (similar to this problem's question).

Since then, it has spread around the world and has become a popular public game in many countries\n\n### Rules of the game:\n\nThe different levels of difficulty of the puzzle need to be identified. The methods for this are briefly described below.\n\n• The user enters the data provided by the game.\n• The puzzle may be provided as a string, array or list of integers.\n• The Sudoku game is composed of 9 columns (priced 1 to 9), 9 lines (priced 1 to 9), and 9 cells (priced 1).\n• When creating the game, Sudoku allows each cell to place numbers in a random order, and the name of each cell is easy to identify with the number inside\n\nyour mathematics game needs to find the digit associated with a cell. For example, consider the layout of Cell C, where the user-defined puzzle is displayed.\n\nPlace the digit associated with cell C from 1 to 9 in the blank cells present in the rows, columns and major grids. Those numbers that can’t be used in any of the 3 supposed areas will be displayed as *\n\n• Since the value of 1 C is currently missing, replace it with the same value in the main grid and the first grid.\nOlympic Games Publishing Plan – Synopsis\n\nGenerating the start and end times of the day game$$.$$.$$.$$.$$.

When N = 4, we need 16 avalanches to fill all Xes with A(2 cases - 4 possible Xes).\n\nWhen N = 5, there are no avalanches (2 cases), or 16 avalanches are needed (2 cases).\n\nOur answer is 2*N + C0 + C1, where C0 and C1 are avalanches needed in case there and there’s not enough Xes to kill all nodes.\n\nSo we need 3 + 16 + 16 = 38 avalanches for N=5."}

You may not use any builtin class such as string, list, dict, etc.\n2. You may write your own functions but these functions cannot take arguments and should have no side effects.\n3. Tolerance for imprecision is +/- 1.0e-6.\n4. The arithmetic operators '*/', '%', '*', '/', and '-' are allocated the highest priority, and must appear before '**', '+', '-', '+='. You may only use these operators.\n5. Any standard notations for evaluating functions such as sin, cos, atan2, are allowed. For example, atan2(-1,1 ) is written just as -1/1.\n6. Evaluation of functions must not return a value (the result may be discarded). The only exception from this rule is power of 1. Such an operation has high prio. You must pass 1.000000 to get your source code accepted.\n7. All the answers must be in scientific notation conforming to this formula: sum(an*10^k), where k >= 0, an >= 0.\n8. Strings must be Terminated by '\\n'.\n### Example Test Cases:\nInput\n1\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n-6\n\nInput\n6\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n7\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n8\nInput\n7\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n10\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n15\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n26\n\nOutput\n-4\n\nInput\n17\n\nOutput\n34\n\nInput\n18\nInput\n18\nInput\n18\nInput\n18\nInput\n18\n\n### Analyzer:\n\n#### $random.int(1, 9)$\n#### $set.add(\"$random.word($length)\");$\n#### $set.add(\"$random.word($length)\");$\n#### $random.int(1, 5)$\n#### $string.repeat(\"$random.int(0, $sizeText)\");$\n#### $string.abs($n.random($sizeText));$\n#### Random string of length $static.n($sizeText)\n#### Random int between 0 and 10\n```"}

So far I believe it is working and do not think it is unnecessarily hard for the user or too complex to comprehend the desired results. Time can be done over the simulation days, but the scoring algorithm is a recurring daily basis that adds the players performance as he progresses through his career. Player performance is generated based on the average draft position through validation and recalculation. The teaching algorithm was not originally part of the original game concept, but is a great addition that I do not believe to be expensive. Finally, the reward for either method is dependent on the photon count. Higher values result in higher photon counts. Player information is pushed through to the engagement table when collected from the database. It summarizes player performance to show desired engagement through historical highs and lows for the player. Lastly, the dual path for progression is enabled by saving each scoring portion for daily and weekly reward to both the player's bank and his level progress.\n\n## Main Deviations:\n\nall_start[‘spent']: the number of people who can be used now.\nall_end_spent[‘spent']: the maximum number of people who can be used in the game."}

Finally, we add the flow dual-flow estimates as solved within the convex-hull boundary.\nWhile we do not need the resulting $p(a,b)$ values at the end of the process, we do need the num_points or dimension 5, influencing 6, but also 16, directly.\nIn addition, we need the number of points traversed (effective number of points traversed=2-fold), and the area traversed.\n\n### Input Format:\n\nFirst line is the number $n$ for N samples that should be processed. Second line contains interlacing n integers, $dim 5=(x_1 y_1 .. x_n y_n)$ that define a rectangular square with edges at most 100 units long. The values on each line are x,y$a$ and a$,b$ values that determine $p$(a,b).\nNext 6 lines contain the form of primeval $p$(a,b), of form either 1,0 (absolute value of the variance of that position considered to be perfect noise), 0,0 (statistical centre at that point). We could start from that point directly, if we were to process that sample.\nBut our real input data contains more information.\nEach next 21 lines describe the $a'$(=8,9,..) line solvers. In the first line, we enter successive 23 int numbers that describe a linear equation (a,b) \\-- total of 2 to 12 points (that define y=-abx + semantic centre-p=/((a,b,c)=1.66+-0.05). Previous 23 points horizontally on the same line all (leaving the last point empty) define the partial-$p$.\nEach solver requires a centre offset, indicating (a-9,b)\nSo each of next 3 lines in this common format first contains interlacing 3 and then 3 pairs x,y that define the centre-offsets of semi-perimeter samples of the patch in consideration. Hereafter follow up to 23 points.\nWhen all 23 pairs are defined, the rest 21,35,$n-23*3=59$ samples actually contain the numerical values of $p$ in their integer format, for that solver. This is not the only possible format for $\\hat{p}$, it can also contain all values in cZF as seen in problem [Problem 20](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/map-generation/problem) indeed. 2-fold null samples are probably more appropriate for it. It is textually seen by colour changes.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nTwo scores are outputted, one is area traversed, one is the number of output points. These are numerically checked within the possible input 8-bit range.The effective number of output points can be analytical derived:\nEffective=2 * num-traversed * 1.1Give these 3 values a newline and additional space as output, after computing. Do not write numbers bigger than prec48 bit-precisions. Another output possibility is A,b,bc.\nNote: $p$(a,b) is the raw probability or a valid force estimator. Not $\\hat{p}$, maybe, that is computed as represented in problem [Problem 21](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/map-generation/problem). However, in that problem sample can be picked on the fly. There, they build a multiple of input values. That is faster than in this problem, but they are also more prone to limitations like 100 nodes per output line nodes. The fact is that the solution is verified for 1000 nodes.\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n2\n20 10 0 10 90\n50 500\n-2 -10\n2 10\n4 10 43 3\n2 3 90\n2 0 0 0 10 0 0 10 0\n1 0 0\n0 2 60 10\n2 10 1 0 50 100 1 5\n2\n21 20 1 5\n0 0 0 0 21 20 10\n40 10 1000 0 1000 0 0 200 10\n10 0 0 0 40 10 10 0 0 0 0 100 10\n0 0 0 0 10 0 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 100 0\n0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1\n0 #\"samples\"\n0 1 0\n0 2 0\n0 3\n0 4\n4 0 0\n0 0 1000\n0 100 0\n4 0 1000 0 10 0 0 100 0\n50\n45050 0\n0 0 #boundary upper-left\n0 0 1000\n1000 0 0 0\n50 100 0\n10 0 0 0 1000 0 100\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 #fill the field\n\n### Sample Output:\n\n2 50000\n8 2048\n\n\n\n### Sample input 2:\n\n1 0 100 0 0\n50\n0 10\n1 0\n1 100\n2 100\n1 1000\n1000 10000 2000\n1 #points\n\n### Sample Output 2:\n\n328.074280000000\n\n\n### Related Topics:\n\nString / Regular Expression\n\n## [Problem 23](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migrating-ducklings/problem)\n\n### Description:\nA magical universe far from earth contains a race of bug-like creatures called Newts.

Denote $d(p,q)$ the distance between points $p=(a_0,...,a_{n-1})$ and $q=(b_0,...,b_{n-1})$ in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nThen $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}d(A,f(A))d(h(A),^){Q-i}\\text{'s position.}:=T(A,f,g,h)\\geq 1.$ ( For $i=n$ it assumes its value defined when $h$"}

The player is given M cells. I.e. a M by N grid of cells. The player must mark M cells to form a trail from top to bottom of the grid.\n2. The cells along the trail must be consecutive cells, in increasing or decreasing order.\n3. The cells along the trail must not have multiple consecutive non-zero  values.\n4. The answer should be a list of coordinates in the format (row i,column j)(row x,column y).\n5. Each starting point cell, along the trail, should be numbered consecutively starting from 1. So, if M=4, for the second cell there should be an  value of 1, then for the third value of 3 and so on. This means that the starting point cell should not be numbered 1. The final cell in this list or starting point cell should not have a  value. Each consecutive cell in the trail should increase, or decrease in order, only by 1. Each starting cell in the trail should be numbered separately from the integers that correspond to the consecutive cells from this point to the last starting cell, along the trail.\n6. The answer should be surrounded by double brackets, like this: [[(1,2),(3,4),(4,5),(3,1),(3,2)]]. This  value indicates the coordinates for the starting cell, of the trail.\n7. The cells listed are the cells of interest, and have a value shown next to them. The keys in the bracket are the starting point cells for the trail. All cells corresponding to the starting point cells are included in the list. These cells are treated the same as any other cell in the list when determining which cells in the list are considered to come first, or be before, other cells, in the list.\n8. The consecutiveness property is a strict what is called \"pathological\" condition.  The cells must be consecutive in terms of their absolute position, order of cells in the row, and the order of the cell in the column, on each row. In other words the position of the cell should be less than the maximum sum of all the absolute values of the coordinates of the cells away in each direction, where the starting point in question is within the triangle bounded by the absolute values of the coordinates of the cells away in each direction and the maximum of all the coordinate values of the cells away in each direction.\n9. Because cell arrangement, and their sum, is based on certain values, it is not possible for a 2 45 pattern to occur.  Cell  _  in any direction is not encircled and thus not a value. So cell sum amounts must be accounted for in determining the sequence of  _ . Islands of successive cells with only one value occurrence (like consecutive cell numbers for the 10th and 11th points), do not disrupt the consecutive order.\n10. At least one cell surrounding the starting point cell must intersect with the cells coordinates from the previously generated coordinates. The exception is for the starting point cell itself.\n11. The answer should be surrounded by double square brackets, like this: [[(1,2),(3,4),(4,5),(1,1),(4,2)]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[(1,2),(3,1),(4,3),(0,0),(3,1),(4,2),(4,0)]]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. The player is given  cells.\n2. The player must place dominoes on some of the cells so that.\n3. There is exactly 1 cell in each region that is covered by dominoes.\n4. Each shaded cell should be part of a domino*. Dominoes can cross region boundaries.\n5. Dominoes are shapes (1x2 or 2x1) consisting of two adjacent shaded cells.\n6. The answer should contain the coordinates of all dominoes in the format (row i,column j)(row x,column y).\n7. The coordinates should be listed in order from left to right or top to bottom.\n8. Different dominoes should be separated by commas.\n9. Ensure that your final answer is enclosed in double square brackets, like this: [[(1,1)(2,1),(1,3)(1,4),(1,6)(2,6),(3,2)(3,3),(4,1)(5,1),(4,4)(5,5),(6,2)(6,3),(5,6)(6,6)]]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[(1,1)(1,2),(1,2)(1,3),(1,5)(1,7),(1,7)(1,8),(2,2)(3,2),(2,5)(2,7),(3,2)(4,2),(3,5)(3,7),(3,7)(3,8),(4,2)(5,2),(4,4)(5,4),(5,5)(5,6),(5,6)(6,2)(6,3),(5,7)(6,7),(4,5)(4,6),(4,8)(5,8),(5,6)(5,7),(5,8),(5,8)(6,7),(6,7)(6,8)]]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. The puzzle is played on an N*N grid, which is divided into regions.\n2. The player must place dominoes on some of the cells so that.\n3. There are exactly N regions that are covered by dominoes.\n4. Each dominos shape should cover exactly 2 cells in the row next to it, on the grid.\n5. Dominoes should cross all region boundaries.\n6. Dominoes must complete the 2 shape surrounding the last column. This means that dominoes in the proper shape should occupy the last square in the fifth column. As a result, the last vertical pair should be filled in the regular shape with a pairing of length 2*.\n7. Dominoes must complete the M shape surrounding the  and the last column.\n8. Dominoes must only cross the boundaries between two regions. If they are connected to a domino that covers a row intersecting multiple regions, additional input is required.\n9. If dominoes cannot be placed in a way as described above, it should NOT be included in the answer.\n10. Dominoes may be connected to other dominoes on the boundary between regions, as long as the information above is met. Therefore, no restriction applies to the number of cells next to the boundary between regions, which are covered by individual dominoes.\n11. The question is given in matrix form, with different letters representing different regions.\n12. The answer should contain the coordinates of all dominoes in the format (row i,column j)(row x,column y).\n13. The coordinates should be listed in order from left to right or top to bottom.\n14. Different dominoes should be separated by commas.\n15. Ensure that your final answer is enclosed in double square brackets, like this: [[(1,2)(1,3),(2,4)(3,4),(4,1)(4,2)]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[(1,1)(1,4),(1,4)(2,4),(2,6)(3,6),(3,3)(3,5),(3,6)(4,6),(4,1)(4,2),(4,2)(4,5)]]\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1. The player is given an N grid. I.e. a  by  grid of cells.\n2. The player must mark the cells in the grid by any method to form a contiguous set of cells which connect together with a closed border which encompasses exactly  of the  covered cells.\n3. The cells along the border must not have multiple consecutive non-zero values.\n4. The answer should be in the form X or Y, where X is the integers from 1 to , and Y is the integers from  to  inclusively. This means that the entire label is a list of integers in the form , where . Any corresponding  value is not an integer. The integers in the list are always in order from left to right or top to bottom. In the event the entire  is used it should be replaced with the characters  in the midground.\n5. To be accepted, the answer should not be a multiple of 24. This may be due to a difference in some floating point precision issues.\n6. For , the answer should be 2, for , it should be 3, and so on.\n7. The cells listed are the cells of interest, and have a value shown next to them. The keys in the bracket are the starting point cells, for the border. As a result, the selected starting point cell should be numbered  within the  cells of interest. The cells with  value, corresponding to  or  as the  must not be part of the list"}

Thoroughly understand the answer rules presented in the next section. Apply them as accurately as possible.\nA. Basic token matching\n2. Drag and drop tokenized unicode characters into the answer engine to form a \"pattern.\" Find a \"match\" of a tokenized unicode character from the target string with the pattern after triggering the pattern's validation rules.\n3. Drag and drop adjacent tokenized unicode characters into the answer engine to create a \"sentence\" by joining the tokens in the order they appear in the target string. Create as many sentences as the target string contains.\n\n### Token\n\nA token is a minimal printable character. It is limited to 26 alphabets, 10 digits, space, punctuation, and no whitespace.\n\nWhat are characteristic behaviors as a token?\nToken <token name> will tokenize the first match from a target string. If there are multiple first matches of Token <pattern name> in the target string, the earliest match will be used.\nFor example, if we have the target string of \"target,\" we will have one tokenized match for <token name=\"goal\"> that results in <token name=\"t\">_<token name=\"r\"></token name=\"_</token name=\"e\">_<token name=\"a\">_</token name>_<token name=\"t\">_</token name> from the following patterns:\n<pattern name=\"a\">_</pattern name>\n<pattern name=\"b\">a</pattern name>\n<pattern name=\"goal\">ab</pattern name>\n.\n.\n<pattern name=\"z\">zz</pattern name>\n\nKerning information can also help when forming patterns. See more information on this page.\nWhat is the behavior of <token name> as a sentence?\nFirst off, only characters separated by a space (\" \") can form a sentence.\nSecond, once finding a match of <pattern name> with the {EOM} variant, the sentence will be automatically terminated. For example, in the sentence \"<sentence name>hello {</sentence name>,\" when the token <token name> does not appear in the answer string, there is no space for <token name />, so <token name /> would be <token name> and a sentence can be formed. Once the suspended trigger requires the match of <pattern name>. There is no way to include the character <token name> in the target string, so the sentence cannot be formed.\nWhen creating a <sentence name> from <token name>s, we should consider:\nConsidered <token name>s should be less than half of the word in the Target String.\nFor example, in here, <sentence name>hop {</sentence name> has 1 occurrence. Usually, you won't find a pattern or a space to use as a sentence. If you still need to do it, you can use the following steps.\n1. Split the target string into chunks of less than half a sentence. We use the length of the Target string minus half a sentence as a limit by which to judge the cut. For example, <sentences name>whobuh</sentences name> as the first token of <sentence name>\"who\" would not be cut, as you can find spaces between characters in <sentences name>\"who\"<paragraph name/>. For <sentences name>\"he does it\"</sentences name> where there are no spaces between characters in <sentences name> who </sentences name> and <sentences name> he </sentences name>, you can split it into two chunks.

LCDR and ICPROC can only appear inside the luxuries.LG and CCT can only appear inside the fancies, and the PC and UR can only appear on the outside of the fancies.\n\n### Question:\n\nThe words are \"EXTRA\" and \"BECAUSE\", with the letter P in the letter (X). What is the answer?\nX\n\n### Answer:\nTAUPPA\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Apply the rule carefully to address the question presented.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The player needs to arrange the letters into a word and place them in a specific grid box.\n2.The grid box at the top receives five words:[CARNET MANY SPINE LACE U - PARVIFORM TACTILE UNDERGROUND RFLASER MERIT GENUS WAY GROUP.] In alphabetical order, connect the letters of the five words in a grid box in that order, being sure to use the correct form and relative position of the word.\n3.An empty space is shown delta, with k rows and g columns on the grid. Write the first letter of each word in that grid box in that order, vertically decreasing from left to right row by row, increasing from top to bottom column by column and skipping letters across the grid.\n4.The player must form a word using the two consecutive letters represented by a box. The letter on the left side represents the first letter of the word,while the letter on the right side represents the second letter.\n5.Use any two consecutive letters provided in the box, as you exit the box, turn around. None of the jagged letters can overlap, and forming a word requires the two letters provided. For example, if a letter is represented by a \"... /...\" brute box, the word CORNER Green and orange is discarded, as the introduction will allow RED and a continuous line.\n6.The words on the grid can be passed through two consecutive words, corresponding to the highlighted characters.\n7.The column and row headers should be used by entering words.

It seemed really fun to do! It seemed much more fun than the correct answer above.\n\nThe reason was that the puzzles were really interesting and related to sports of the world cup. I started on it with satisfaction and kept on going as the puzzle crazy solution generator was just now enabling a button to display the \"correct answer\".\n\nThen, it was pretty obvious that that is not what it is after seeing 3 months of hard work of other puzzle company employees.\n\nMany attempts followed that leading to the realization of what I had expected to reach from solving only 4 of the puzzle. This log is for my own completion satisfaction of what I had researched at that time and wanted to bring some experience to help people reaching that instead of grinding so many hours of guess-work and stubbornness.\n\nNow I have reached that stage myself and these details might help others, but the best plan is to just play the actual game and trust that you have done your best to improve.\n\nI am no genius hacker but that does not mean you are dumb if you can understand these general ideas and sit down to be a programmer.\n\nThe Log:\n• 1. Puzzle Test Cases\n• 2. Game Optimizations\n• 3. Letter Search Algorithm Improvements\n• 4. Regex Optimizations\n• 5. Punches\n• 6. Findlist Optimizations\n• 7. Algorithms:\n• Swim Test Cases:\n1. 1. what is the fastest swim: 3 down swimmers at the same time making distance independently of each other:\n\n    A B B   B A B A B   E 0 B     *A* 10  C C B   D D D   B D J E       *C* 2 * * *3 * * * 4 * * * 5\n\n\n::  BE NOTE. swimmers swim BABABABAAABBBBBDDDEE. Think about who would reach 1st. ::\n\nA = Fish C. Not a surprise. Marginally over D. The problem is that there is A in parallel and is Baining fine. FAST! Since C and C need 3-4hurs to swim alone, they got one to land and then 2 fish to bine with. Which means that neither fish would have become a bining.\n\nMight be a heavy tex clue to you? anyways"}

Then run the Bartender West, North until you see the Bartender, who will then send you to The Bartender, on the West North Block of the block.\n\n### Why did he stand up so fast?\n\nThe answer is Bartender.So why does this imply that Bartender is the enemy. Well, it seems like something that isn't necessarily related to awareness. Why what about the Self, or something resembling Self?\n\nBartender is not like anyone else, he isn't like anyone.

But to me writing out stuff, and getting something in my head before running, isn't that the point? Especially since for me, I generally have those two words about the right time, at the right time.\n\nTo me writing editorial code in bc, which makes up 7% of the site, is something being done by those (the other 92% **has those within it**) who are doing things to you - which are difficult to find in their pages - . As someone who studied logic and math and wrote extensively articles on (Wikipedia is the way to go!) It's the proper way to establish which aspect or properties belong to a certain class and which do not.\n\nSo to be honest, writing code for bc is simpler, but it's not the main task of the site at the slightest. I don't think it would be more helpful to write an article in it. If the article made a factual statement about on an occasion - generally - it would be more useful to submit to an antwise agreement when the simple statement, and no response followed, if there was an observation that proved the thing was not as it seemed, if it was on the wikipedia page etc etc.\n\nWriting code with anyone's blog often results in a conflict. As much as possible, you want to try to follow the same process as you do on the blog - but that see page conference can take a long time. I mean, it makes a general comment like \"This site gets a neutral idea of the why my own page isn't written in the best english and writing author code in subgames and related Arithmetic with terms\".
