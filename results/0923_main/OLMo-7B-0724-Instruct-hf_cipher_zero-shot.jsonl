Then, we can use the Multitap Code Table to obtain the corresponding Multitap Codes for each letter in the plaintext.\n   - \"U\" corresponds to the code \"5\" (6^1) in the Multitap Code Table.\n   - \"O\" corresponds to the code \"8\" (6^2) in the Multitap Code Table.\n3. To encrypt the plaintext \"UO\", we concatenate the Multitap Codes we obtained in step 2 to form the ciphertext \"[5 8]\" (encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets)."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A]\n\nThe given ciphertext \"3^34^1\" is encrypted using the Multitap Code Table. Let's break down the encryption process step by step:\n\n1. For the first character \"3\", it's a Multitap Code in the table, so we replace it with the corresponding plaintext character 'A'.\n\n2. For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5. As we have 21 characters, we start filling the tabular representation:\n   - The first character = 'P'\n   - The sixth character = 'R'\n\n6. The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8. Finally, decrypt the plaintext block:\n  \n   - 'P' -> 'A'\n   - 'Q' -> 'P'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n   - 'Q' -> 'R'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext is 'APQR', encapsulated in double square brackets as follows:\n\n[[APQR]]"}

We know that the associate letters of A is 3, of B is 5. Now, let's apply the encryption steps to find the corresponding encrypted letters in the affine alphabet:\n\nFor the first character \"V\":\n- Let x denote its position in the affine alphabet, i.e., we'll find x from (Ax + B) % 26. For A = 3 and B = 5, (3 * 19 + 5) % 26 = 17 (mod 26).\n- So, the corresponding letter in the Affine alphabet from position 17 is \"O\" (17 -> 16 -> \"O\"). The encrypted character for V is O.\n\nFor the second character \"E\":\n- Let x denote its position in the affine alphabet, i.e., we'll find x from (Ax + B) % 26. For A = 3 and B = 5, (3 * 14 + 5) % 26 = 19 (mod 26).\n- So, the corresponding letter in the Affine alphabet from position 19 is \"N\" (19 -> 20 -> \"N\"). The encrypted character for E is N.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is: [[\"ON\"]]\n\nNote that the ciphertext \"VE\" decrypts to \"ON\" as the encrypted letters \"O\" and \"N\"."}

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The plaintext is \"G\", which contains only one 5-character block corresponding to the \"G\" letter.\n2. The tracking index (i) for this block starts at 0.\n3. Calculate the grid_index for the current block as (0 // 5) % 8, which is 6. This indicates we should use the sixth grid.\n4. For the \"G\" character, find its position in the grid, which is (1, 1). Move one grid position to the lower-right direction, which gives position (4, 4). Take the letter at this position, which is 'U'.\n5. Add 'U' to the encrypted block.\n6. The encrypted block now contains \"GHIOQT\".\n7. The final result is \"[GHIOQT]\"."}

The grid index for each block:\n   - For the first block (\"PR\"): grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0.\n   - For the second block (\"\"): grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 1.\n3. Determine the positions of characters in the grid:\n   - \"P\" in the first grid: row = 1, col = 2\n   - \"R\" in the first grid: row = 4, col = 2\n   - \" \" in the second grid: row = 1, col = 7\n   - The characters \"J\" are not present in the provided given plaintext, hence not encrypted and ignored.\n4. Obtain the encrypted characters:\n   - \"P\" in the first grid: row+1, col+1 = 2,3 (position \"SH\")\n   - \"R\" in the first grid: row+1, col+1 = 3,3 (no character at this position, encrypted char will be another \"R\")\n   - \" \" in the second grid, row,col = 1,7. (no character at this position, encrypted char will be another \" \")\n\n5. The decrypted characters:\n   - \"S\" from \"SH\"\n   - \"R\" from \"RR\" (Notice the order in which encrypted characters from the same position in the grid are combined is \"RSH\")\n   - \" \" is not present in the grid at the second block, hence it is ignored.\n\nFinal Decrypted String: \"[SH]\""}

Hence, the first character 'H' in the plaintext is mapped to the character 'K' in the inner_disk.\n\nAfter every 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk rotates by 5 characters. When 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk will be oriented as 'ASDFGHJQTKRYNMIUBVCXW', leaving a single 'K' character in its starting position after rotation.\n\nNow, as per the decryption rules, we need to un-encrypt this ciphertext. The first step is to find the corresponding positions of the 'K' character in the outer_disk and inner_disk strings. In the outer_disk, the 'K' is in the 8th position, while in the inner_disk, 'K' is at position 2.\n\nNow, we rotate the inner_disk to the right by 5 characters, giving us the new positions of the characters in the inner_disk string: 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQRSTUOPYTF'. The 'K' has moved to the starting position ('2nd') character in the inner_disk, which is indeed the original plaintext character that was encrypted.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer for ciphertext \"H\" with period 11 and increment 5 is: [[\"K\"]] (note that the answer appears as uppercase due to the given initialization of the outer_disk and inner_disk strings)."}

For each character 'P' and 'Z' in plaintext, we find their corresponding characters in the outer_disk 'W' and 'R', respectively.\n2. We find the positions of these characters within the inner_disk 'Y' and 'U'. After processing 'P', the inner_disk is 'YU'.\n3. The inner_disk is rotated by 5 characters (increment) after processing 'P'. So, at this point, the inner_disk is 'UY'.\n4. We process the 'Z' character. Its corresponding position is 'O' in the inner_disk. The inner_disk becomes 'VOO'.\n5. The inner_disk is rotated to the right again by 5 characters (increment). The inner_disk becomes 'UY'.\n6.

Reels are prepared as mentioned in the rules.\n2. Ciphertext: \"O\"\n3. Since ciphertext is a single character, we begin with Reel1 to Reel16 in order.\n4. Among Reel1 to Reel16, \"O\" cannot be found. For each character in the Reels not found, we move to the next character in the Reel.\n5. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"O\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"O\" are found in Reel14.\n6. Reel14 to Reel8 are searched for characters preceded by \"O\". In this case, \"O\" is followed by a \"B\".\n7. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"B\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"B\" are found in Reel7.\n8. Reel7 to Reel4 are searched for characters preceded by \"B\". In this case, \"B\" is followed by \"N\".\n9. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"N\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"N\" are found in Reel3.\n10. Reel3 to Reel1 are searched for characters preceded by \"N\". In this case, \"N\" is followed by \"D\".\n\nUsing these steps, we found that \"O\" in the given ciphertext corresponds to \"D\" in the plaintext. Therefore, the decrypted answer is \"D\" encapsulated in double square brackets: [[D]]."}

We will replace each character in the ciphertext with the next character on the Reel until we reach the end of the Reel or if we need to wrap around to the beginning of the Reel when we reach the end.\n\nFor each character 'L' in the ciphertext, we find the next character in our Reel.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]] (decrypted answer using the specified rules)\n\nHere's how we applied the decryption steps:\n\n1. Initially select Reel1.\n2. For each character c in the ciphertext (in this case, \"INIEIWYUXIU\"):\n   * Find character c on the Reel: \"I\" is on the second position in Reel1, \"N\" is at the fourth position, and so on.\n   * Replace \"I\" on Reel1 with the next character (which is the first character on Reel2): \"O\".\n   * Replace \"N\" on Reel1 with the previous character on Reel1 (which is the last character on Reel1). This is necessary, as \"N\" is at the end of the Reel. Therefore, \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n   * Move to the next Reel.\n\n3. Now we're at Reel2, and all characters \"O\", \"N\", \"E\", \"I\", \"W\", \"Y\", and \"U\" are at the correct positions.\n4. For \"U\" (third character), we go around to the start of the Reel (which is the last character) and come back to the second character (which becomes third in Reel2). Next character in order is \"X\". Therefore, \"U\" is replaced by \"X\".\n5. \"N\" is now at the second position, and it goes around to the start to get the previous character on Reel2. This occurs to be \"E\", so \"N\" becomes \"E\".\n6. \"[[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]]\" is the decrypted plaintext. Note that this applies to all characters in the ciphertext, resulting in \"[INIEIWYUXIU]\" becoming \"[AASXJLUTWNMGFKPZDIBEOGVCMHR]\". The provided ciphertext indeed decrypts to its plaintext."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AB]]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Encryption steps:\n   - The ciphertext \"984\" converts to the Morse code \"./ /.- /./ /.- /. /.. /./ /. /-. /../ /.- /.- /.-\".\n   - The Morse code is divided into pairs: \".- /./\", \" /.- /.\", \"/ /.-\", \"./ /. /..\", \" /. /. /.\", \"/ /. /-\", \".- /.-\", \" /.- /.-\" and \" ../\".\n\n2. Decryption steps:\n   - Use the conversion table to convert the numeric indices into their corresponding Morse code:\n     :- 1: '-/'\n     :- 2: '//'\n     :- 3: '/.'\n     :- 4: '-/'\n     :- 5: '..' (or '.')\n     :- 6: '--'\n     :- 7: '-.'\n     :- 8: '-.' (or '..')\n     :- 9: '-.' (or '..')\n   - The converted Morse code for each pair: '.- /.', '- /.-', '/ .-', '--', '.- /.-', ' '-.'\n   - Each pair of Morse code is converted into their corresponding letters: 'AB', 'JQ', 'AM', 'OP', 'CD', 'F', 'EG', 'GC'\n   - Decrypt the final non-processed non-numeric character '.': The Morse code for '..' is '.-.', so '.' becomes 'N' (upper case, following the table)\n   - The decrypted answer in uppercase letters is \"ABN\" or \"AB\". The original plaintext may be \"AB\" as both \"AB\" and \"ABJQ\" can result in the same ciphertext \"984\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[BX)]] (The encrypted answer with double square brackets.)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Remove punctuation and spaces from \"FX\".\n2. The plaintext is \"FX\".\n3. The ciphertext is \"BX\".\n4. The preparation phase remains the same as advance number scheme.\n5. According to the encryption steps, searches for \"B\" in the 5x5 grid at positions 0 and 4 and \"X\" at positions 4 and 2. The corresponding characters are \"B\" and \"X\". The final ciphertext is \"BX\".\n6. To decrypt, the exact opposite of the encryption steps above need to be applied.\n7. [0,1,4,2] is the coordinate sequence for \"BX\" in ciphertext.\n8. The first half of the coordinate sequence holds \"0,1\". The second half holds \"4,2\".\n9. Read \"0,4\" first and find \"A\" in the 5x5 grid.\n10. Read \"1,2\" next and find \"C\" in the grid.\n11. The plaintext is \"AC\".\n12. Another way to decrypt is to follow the steps where row coordinates are read first then column coordinates. In this case, the sequence of coordinates becomes \"04,12\".\n13. Reading \"0,4\" first extracts \"B\", and the next coordinate \"1,2\" extracts \"X\" in the grid, having decrypted \"BX\" back to \"FX\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AK]]\n\nExplanation of the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"KP\". In this rule, punctuation and spaces are not considered, so the alphabet characters are the only inputs.\n\n2. For \"KP\", there are two characters - \"K\" and \"P\". No punctuation and no J. We remove them. The resulting plaintext is \"K\" and \"P\".\n\n3. In the 5x5 grid, the coordinates of \"K\" are (4,1) and the coordinates of \"P\" are (2,4). Although there are 5 characters in the grid, we are told that there's no J, so we only use the remaining characters A-Z without J.\n\n4. The coordinates are arranged in the order: 286\n\n5. First, we find the row coordinates and read them in order: 26\n\n6. Next, we find the column coordinates and separate them into two halves: 2,4\n\n7. Next, read each half of the column coordinates, find the corresponding character in the grid using their row and column positions.\n\n8. For today, let's focus on the second half, the column coordinates: 2,4. Starting with the first element (4): we find the corresponding character, \"Z\". So, the second half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"Z\".\n\n9. Next, focus on the first half, the row coordinates: 2,6. The first element (2) corresponds to \"E\". So, the first half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"E\".\n\n10. The decrypted answer in plaintext is [[\"E\",\"Z\"]] or simply \"ZE\". Notice that the order of the characters in the plaintext is the opposite of the original order in the ciphertext.\n\nFollowing the decryption property, the final result in plaintext is \"ZE\". So, the answer to the given problem is [[\"ZE\"]] (double-square brackets encapsulating the decrypted answer)."}

Remove punctuation and spaces from the plaintext: \"YOLMHUMIVOW\"\n2. Convert the remaining uppercase letters into 5x5 grid coordinates for the encryption process: (0,4)(1,5)(2,2)(3,1)(4,3)\n3. Encode the 5x5 grid coordinates as a string: \"014423\"\n4. Break the string into two halves: \"04\" and \"14423\"\n5. Convert each half into a new sequence of 'row-column' coordinates: \"0,4\" and \"1,4,4,2\"\n6. Turn each sequence into a single coordinate by adding commas and converting the strings to integers: (0,4) and (1,4,4,2)\n7.

We need to convert the plaintext to uppercase characters without spaces or punctuation. \"KD\" fits this criteria.\n2. We divide \"KD\" into groups of 6 characters, filling the groups with \"#\" if less than 6 characters. For this example, we have the following groups:\n\n- Group 1: \"K#D#\" (6 characters, no \"#\")\n- Group 2: \"###K\" (4 characters, 1 \"#\")\n3. We split each group into 3 binary groups:\n\n- Group 1 (6 characters): \"1110100011100011#101011111000#\"\n- Group 2 (4 characters): \"#0011110011\"\n4. We apply the encryption steps:\n   - Given Group 1, we find the binary groups: \"11 1 1 0 1 0 1 1#1 0 1 1 1 1 0#\"\n   - We then apply the grid operations, and for each binary group (L1, L2), we find the corresponding triads in the grids (grid1, grid2, and grid3).\n   - For the first binary group \"11 1 1 0 1 0 1 1#\":\n       - L1: \"1\" in grid1 maps to row 1 and column 3. L2: \"1\" in grid2 maps to row 1 and column 3. The corresponding number in grid3 is 7. Final ternary: \"(3,7,1)\"\n       - L1: \"1\" in grid1 maps to row 1 and column 4. L2: \"0\" in grid2 maps to row 4 and column 0. The corresponding number in grid3 is 1. Final ternary: \"(4,1,1)\"\n       - L1: \"1\" in grid1 maps to row 1 and column 2. L2: \"1\" in grid2 maps to row 2 and column 1. The corresponding number in grid3 is 6. Final ternary: \"(2,6,1)\"\n       - L1: \"0\" in grid1 maps to row 4 and column 0. L2: \"1\" in grid2 maps to row 1 and column 4. The corresponding number in grid3 is 6. Final ternary: \"(4,6,1)\"\n       - L1: \"1\" in grid1 maps to row 1 and column 1. L2: \"1\" in grid2 maps to row 1 and column 2. The corresponding number in grid3 is 7. Final ternary: \"(1,7,1)\"\n       - L1: \"1\" in grid1 maps to row 1 and column 5.

In a 5x5 grid, it points to \"R\" as the row header and \"H\" as the column footer.\n   - Row header \"R\" indicates the 5th row.\n   - Column footer \"H\" suggests the 1st column.\n   - This corresponds to the letter \"U\" in the grid.\n4. The potential decrypted message is now \"UR\", and it matches the \"decrypted message\" of \"M\": \"E\".\n5. The potential decrypted message for \"B\" is \"BH\". The grid shows that the header \"B\" points to the 4th row and the footer \"H\" points to the 2nd column. The matching letter is \"M\".\n6. Since we have only one character for each crypted message, the final decrypted answer is: [[M]] and [[M]] matches the \"MB\" ciphertext. So the decrypted answer is \"[[M]\".\"\n\nThe final output is \"[[M]]\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[GSP#KAP#X]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Converting the given plaintext \"GSPKAPGX\" to a string of uppercase characters.\n2. The input has 5 characters, which matches the specified number of lines.\n3. Using the \"Downward Fill\" approach:\n   - Fill the first character in the first column of the first row.\n   - Fill the remaining characters in the same row downwards, which gives us \"GSP\".\n   - Move to the second row and fill the first column with \"#\" (removing the first character since it's already filled).\n   - Fill the remaining characters of the second row in the downward direction, which provides \"#KAP\".\n   - Move to the third row, fill the first column with \"#\" (removing first character) and continue downward filling the characters in each row alternately, going up and down: \"#X\".\n4. Converting the filled 5 rows of characters to a single ciphertext string: \"GSP#*KAP#*X\"\n5. Since the original plaintext had 5 characters, adding * signs on both sides of the ciphertext indicates that all 5 lines have been filled: \"GSP#*KAP#*X*\"\n6. Decryption step: \n   - Determining the encrypted data by reading the ciphertext with the \"*\" symbols and dividing it into 5 parts.\n   - Filling the five rows alternately and concatenating the rows: \"GSP # KAP # X\"\n   - Reading the columns alternately, \"G SP K A P X\"\n   - Removing the # symbols, \"GSPKAPGX\"\n\nHence, the encrypted answer is: \"[GSP#KAP#X]*\" (i.e., there must be 5 *'s in the encrypted ciphertext to indicate that there are five lines). The decrypted plaintext is \"GSPKAPGX\"."}

The first five lines of the ciphertext are filled as follows:\n   - The first row is RE#\n   - The second row is TYY*XOY*FD\n   - The third row is XO* at the end\n   - The fourth row is D at the end\n   - The fifth row is X#* at the end\n3. Read the ciphertext line by line and add a \"*\" sign at the end of each line to identify the end of each line:\n   - Re# TYY* XOY* FDDX#*\n4. Decryption steps are taken in reverse order starting from the second line:\n   - The second line is read first, then the preceding and succeeding lines up to the adjacent \"#:\", are read alternately:\n     - The second line read as \"TDYYXOYFDXV#\"\n     - The adjacent lines up to the adjacent \"#\" are read alternately:\n       - The third line read as \"TT\"\n       - The fourth line read as \"YYXOYF\"\n       - The fifth line is read as \"D\"\n       - The sixth line read as \"V#\"\n       - The seventh line is read as \"D\" (since there's no \"#\" preceding it, assume it's the next letter after the sixth line, i.e. \"D\")\n     - Finally, carve out \"TFDX\" from the second line and the rest read alternately is \"TTYYXOFDV\"\n5. The final decrypted message is: [ETFXODTTYYXOFDV]\n\nSo the answer is: [[ETFXODTTYYXOFDV]]"}

The given ciphertext is \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\".\n2. The ciphertext is prepared as per the given encryption rule, where lines with maximum 5 characters and distinct odd and even number of lines are arranged. Here,\n   \n   * Ciphertext \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\" with odd lines arranged in first column: \"O#C#\", \"F#M#H\", \"U#W#\"\n   * Even lines arranged in the second column: \"###T\", \"O#L#D\"\n   \n3. As per the encryption rule, these characters are read column-wise from the top to bottom, appended by a \"#\" per column. Here, this operation converts \"O#C#FM#HU#WT#\" to \"O#C#F#M#H#U#W#T#L#D#\".\n4. Now, the decryption process is run, where odd numbered lines are read from left to right and even numbered lines are read from right to left, respectively. Here, these readings form \"O#C#F#M\", \"T#L#D#U\", \"HU#W#\" and \"#\".\n   \n   * The odd numbered lines are converted to \"OCFWT\".\n   * The even numbered lines when converted to \"LIDA\".\n   \n5. Once both the odd and even numbered characters are decoded, they are combined to produce the final decrypted plaintext, which is: \"OCFWTLIDA\"\n6.

We can break down the encryption steps into smaller steps:\n   a. For the first character 'P', find the row and column of 'P' in the matrix. It is (3, 6).\n   b. The encrypted character at position (3, 6) is 'K'.\n   c. Repeat the same process for 'F'. It is (2, 2). The encrypted character at position (2, 2) is 'J'.\n\n3. Now we can concatenate the encrypted characters to get the encrypted ciphertext: [\"PK\", \"JF\"]\n   a. The encrypted characters in each row are separated by spaces.\n   b. We concatenate these rows to get the final ciphertext: \"PFKGVR\"\n\n4. To decrypt, we repeat the steps for each half of the ciphertext and concatenate the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n   a. For the upper half \"PF\", decrypt \"P\" as (2, 2) and \"F\" as (3, 6).\n    - The decrypted characters are 'P' and 'F'.\n    - Now concatenate these characters to get the final plaintext: \"PF\".\n   b. Follow the same process for the lower half of the ciphertext, ending with the plaintext \"QHLMAJ\".\n\nThus the encrypted answer is [[\"PFKGVR\", \"QHLMAJ\"]]."}

Following the decryption rules, we need to divide the ciphertext into two halves, which gives us \"AXVXG\" and \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\".\n\nThen, for each half, we first read the rows and columns of each character and use them to get the encrypted binary. To do this, we will use the 6x6 matrix provided, and we will use the same encryption operation as in the encryption rules.\n\nFor the first half, we have \"AXVXG\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0 | 2 | V | (2,0) |\n| 0 | 1 | X | (0,1) |\n| 1 | 2 | A | (1,2) |\n| 1 | 0 | X | (1,0) |\n| 2 | 0 | X | (2,0) |\n| 2 | 2 | G | (2,2) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"AXVXG\" is (2,0)(0,1)(1,2)(1,0)(2,0)(2,2).\n\nTo get the characters after the \"G\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"AXFV\", so the final ciphertext is \"AXFV\".\n\nFor the second half, we have \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\":\n\n| Row | Column | Character | Encrypted Binary |\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 3 | 2 | E | (3,2) |\n| 3 | 1 | D | (3,1) |\n| 2 | 1 | N | (2,1) |\n| 2 | 2 | S | (2,2) |\n| 1 | 1 | C | (1,1) |\n| 1 | 0 | O | (1,0) |\n| 4 | 2 | G | (4,2) |\n| 4 | 1 | O | (4,1) |\n| 0 | 2 | Q | (0,2) |\n| 3 | 0 | T | (3,0) |\n| 3 | 3 | K | (3,3) |\n| 5 | 2 | Y | (5,2) |\n| 5 | 1 | I | (5,1) |\n| 5 | 0 | U | (5,0) |\n\nSo, the encrypted binary for \"FAGXGFAVFVGAXFGDA\" is (3,2)(3,1)(2,1)(2,2)(1,1)(1,0)(4,2)(4,1)(0,2)(3,0)(3,3)(5,2)(5,1)(5,0).\n\nTo get the characters after \"T\" we read all rows and columns of the encrypted binary. We get the characters \"YCIUT\", so the final plaintext is \"YCIUTU\".\n\nThe final answer is then: [[\"Universal Statement of Human Rights\", \"WATER\", \"WEALTH\", \"Solar Electric\", \"Voluntary Simplicity\", \"Geographic Mobility\", \"GREEN HOUSE\", \"Flexible Work Array\", \"Scalable Energy\", \"HealthState\", \"Family\", \"TEAL\", \"Generalized Arbitrage\", \"Emotional Learning\", \"Continuous Localization\", \"Natrual Gas\", \"Renewable Energy Pr approximated\", \"End-to-End Testing\", \"Empowering Behaviours\", \"Bremen\", \"Cleantech Innovations\", \"Basic Needs Satisfaction\", \"Presentient Awareness\", \"Contention\", \"Scientific Methodology\", \"LongTail\", \"YCIUT\"]]"}

The plaintext \"Z\" when converted to its binary form is \"1010\", and when we perform the desired operations as outlined in the encryption rules: \n\n1. Convert each character to binary: 1010 (plaintext \"Z\" in 8-bit binary representation)\n2. Apply the XOR operation: (1010 ^ '10101010') = (00101000)\n3. Apply the permutation table: (00101000) ^ (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) = '10101010' (XOR results after performing permutation)\n4. Convert the XOR results back to characters: 'M' (ASCII 'M' is 131, and '10101010' would yield '131' in decimal form).\n\nHowever, instead of this logic, we follow the given modification with a fixed key: FIRST as an additional step, followed by the encryption operations. After which, we concatenate the first characters of the resulting ciphertext for each character found in the plaintext (\"Z\" results in \"FRSZ\").\n\nIn conclusion, we apply the following steps to encrypt \"Z\":\n\n- Convert \"Z\" into an 8-bit binary representation: '1010'\n- Apply the fixed key (10101010) by XOR operation: '00101000'\n- Apply the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7): '10101010'\n- Combine results for each character: 'FRSZ' is the final ciphertext.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A] \\\\[A] (where \"A\" is the decrypted uppercase letter from the given ciphertext \"11111110\").\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. Convert the ciphertext into 8-bit chunks:\n- The first chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The second chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The third chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The fourth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The fifth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The sixth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The seventh chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n- The eighth chunk: \"1\" ( BITSET(1))\n2. Apply the permutation (in ;; notation used in data cipher):\n- The reversed permutation is (7, 3; 3, 7; 1, 7; 1, 3; 2, 7; 2, 1; 4, 1; 4, 7)\n\n- The first chunk's;; notation: \"7 3\"\n- The second chunk's;; notation: \"3 7\"\n- The third chunk's;; notation: \"1 7\"\n- The fourth chunk's;; notation: \"1 3\"\n- The fifth chunk's;; notation: \"2 7\"\n- The sixth chunk's;; notation: \"2 1\"\n- The seventh chunk's;; notation: \"4 1\"\n- The eighth chunk's;; notation: \"4 7\"\n3. After applying the inverse permutation table; we get the decrypted chunk:\n- The first chunk: \"2\" (Bitstring \"10\")\n- The second chunk: \"7\" (Bitstring \"11\")\n- The third chunk: \"4\" (Bitstring \"100\")\n- The fourth chunk: \"3\" (Bitstring \"01\")\n- The fifth chunk: \"6\" (Bitstring \"110\")\n- The sixth chunk: \"5\" (Bitstring \"101\")\n- The seventh chunk: \"1\" (Bitstring \"1\")\n- The eighth chunk: \"1\" (Bitstring \"1\")\n4. To get the decrypted character, we apply the inverse of the XOR operation:\n- The first chunk is \"2\" (decimal 14). Decimal 14 == \"A\" ASCII value, so the first decrypted letter is \"A\".\n- For the second chunk, \"7\" (decimal 11), which is \"M\" ASCII value. \"M\" is not in our alphabet, so something went wrong. Let's continue with the next chunk.\n- The third chunk is \"4\" (decimal 4). Decimal 4 == \"D\" ASCII value. So the third decrypted letter is \"D\".\n- The fourth chunk is \"3\" (decimal 3). Decimal 3 == \"C\" ASCII value.\n- The fifth chunk is \"6\" (decimal 6). Decimal 6 == \"F\" ASCII value. The seventh chunk stays \"1\".\n- The sixth chunk is \"5\" (decimal 5). Decimal 5 == \"E\" ASCII value.\n- The eighth chunk is also \"1\".\n\nSo the final decrypted answer in the double square brackets is: [[\"D\",\"A\"]]"}

The ciphertext value for \"UL\" in a binary string would be: 1101 1100 (convolved to 8-bit binary). After result permutation and application of XOR operation using the fixed key, the final ciphertext for \"UL\" in a binary string would be 110 10110 (convolved to 8-bit binary). Encapsulating this value within double square brackets yields [[110 10110]]. However, if we follow the given order of decryption with inverse permutation table, we would apply the inverse permutation on 8-bits binary chunk and perform XOR operation on it with the fixed key to get the original character once more. In this case, the decrypted plaintext character would be: 'S' (ASCII value: 83). Therefore, the final answer after considering the decryption steps would be: [[83]] (decrypted answer)."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[BD7B7B7B]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The plaintext, \"G\", is padded with zeroes to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. Here, the padded plaintext is: \"G\\x00\"\n2. The padded plaintext is divided into 8-byte blocks (or bytes). Here, \"G\\x00\" forms one block.\n3. Block encryption:\n   - Convert Block to Bytes: The block \"G\\x00\" is encoded using ASCII to get the byte sequence \"47 00\"\n   - XOR with Key: \"47 00\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" (the uppercase versions of the hexadecimal characters)\n   - Substitute: Using the S_BOX, we replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, the byte sequence becomes \"BD 7B 7B 7B\"\n   - Permute: In this case, we rotate each byte by 1 bit. So, the byte sequence after rotation is \"7B 7B 7B 7B\".\n   - XOR with Key: \"7B 7B 7B 7B\" XOR \"1234567890ABCDEF\" gives \"BD 7B 7B 7B\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: The encrypted byte sequences are converted to hexadecimal string. \"BD 7B 7B 7B\" gets encoded as \"BD7B7B7B\"\n5. Concatenate: All the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks are concatenated to form the ciphertext \"[BD7B7B7B]\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[BD7B7B7B]]"}

After applying the decryption steps, the result is:\n\n[[\"HICTMHLS\", \"ACIDHPW\", \"UYNGQTF\"]]\n\nThis output represents a string of uppercase letters and spaces. To decode this output in the format you specified, we would concatenate the encryption of each block in the form of double square brackets:\n\n\"[HICHTMHSLACAIDHPWUYNGQTFWBCDOF]\"\n\nSo the decoded answer is: \"HICTMHLS ACIDHPW UYNGQTF WEBBCDOF\". This seems to be a concatenation of 6 strings, which may be the original plaintext padded with null characters (\\x00) to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. After removing the null characters (\\x00), the result should be:\n\n\"HICTMHLS ACIDHPW UYNGQTF WEBBCDOF LALA\"\n\nThe last string \"LALA\" doesn't match any of the given rules, so we assume it's likely an error.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[\"THIS IS A TEST PLAINTEXT\"']] (note that the decrypted text has been enclosed in double square brackets and the plaintext itself has been enclosed in single square brackets)\n\nTo break down the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6. Finally, the decrypted bytes are converted back to text using ASCII encoding and the long string of decrypted text represents the plaintext.\n\nTo decode the given ciphertext accordingly, follow these steps:\n\n1. 4-byte blocks are split from \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n2. XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5. The byte blocks are XORed with the fixed key once more to get the original plaintext as bytes.\n6. Decoded bytes are printed in ASCII encoding.\n7. Padding is removed from the plaintext if necessary.\n8. The concatenated decrypted bytes composing the plaintext is returned."}

Padding: Since \"FW\" does not have an 8-byte multiple, we add \\x00 at the end to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. (After padding, the plaintext becomes \"F allegations0WP\\x00.\")\n2. Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Converting each block to bytes and applying XOR with the key (KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF').\n   - Using the S_BOX: Replace the high and low 4 bits of each byte before stitching them together and then applying another XOR with the key. In this case, \"F algorithms\" becomes \"D H computations\".\n   - Because 8 bit is a single byte, we only need to rotate each byte one bit to the left. After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Both encrypted bytes produce their respective hexadecimal representations: \"C2A\" and \"WHAT\".\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate the hexadecimal strings to form the final ciphertext: \"C2AWHAT\".\n6. The result is \"[[C2AWHAT]]\"."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0x00: 0x0F, 0x01: 0x0A, 0x02: 0x07, 0x03: 0x05,\n        0x04: 0x09, 0x05: 0x03, 0x06: 0x0D, 0x07: 0x00,\n        0x08: 0x0E, 0x09: 0x08, 0x0A: 0x04, 0x0B: 0x06,\n        0x0C: 0x01, 0x0D: 0x02, 0x0E: 0x0B, 0x0F: 0x0C\n        }\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Padding: If the plaintext is not a multiple of 8 bytes, pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n    2. Block Splitting: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks.\n    3. Block Encryption:\n        - Convert Block to Bytes: Convert each block to bytes using ASCII encoding.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Substitute:  Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together.\n        - Permute: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again.\n    4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"3B8D80958C3C353837873D86938C9784\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[ \"HELLO WORLD THIS IS A TEST BLOCK OF UPPERCASE LETTERS AND SPACES\", \"ANOTHER BLOCK OF THE SAME\", \"LAST BLOCK\" ]\n\nTo explain the process, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The given ciphertext \"3B8D80958C3C353837873D86938C9784\" is decimated and converted to lowercase for further processing.\n2. Split blocks: Ciphertext is divided into four 8-byte blocks.\n3. Block encryption: Each block is XORed with the keyword (in this case a fixed byte array), followed by applying S-BOX substitution, permutation, and another XOR operation with the keyword.\n4. Hexadecimal encoding: Convert the encrypted blocks back to hex format.\n5. Concatenate: Combine the IV, ciphertext, and additional empty hex in the specified order.\n\nFor decryption, the initial steps involve splitting ciphertext into 32 characters (4 blocks of 8 characters). The main process starts with converting the hexadecimal hex characters to byte array, XORing with the keyword, doing an inverse permutation, applying inverse S-BOX substitution, XOR with keyword, and finally, back to ASCII text.\n\nThe responses need to be listed in double square brackets to keep the required format as per your question."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]] Explanation:\n\n1. We have given a ciphertext \"4\".\n2. As per the given encryption rules, we have to calculate the decimal value x for each character in the plaintext, by multiplying it with the ascii code of that character.\n3. For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11. Decrypted answer: [\"A\"]\n\nSo, the answer to the given ciphertext \"4\" would be:\n[[\"A\"]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[5,12] (the ciphertext consists of the numbers 5 and 12, separated by a comma)\r\nTo calculate the encryption, we first find the decimal number corresponding to the ASCII code of 'Z', which is 86.\r\nNext, we raise e (263) to the power of the decimal number n (299), to get the decimal value of the ciphertext number for 'Z'.\r\nSide note: n! := n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1 and n!!/e^n := n! / e^n (as e^n = sum(n!*k!/e^k), k=1 to n) (For larger values of n, we skip and approximate some terms of this infinite sum)\r\nDecimal value of x^e mod n = 5^263 mod 299 = 11 * 22^262 mod 299 = 11 * 5 * 18^262 = 111 * 18^262 = 0\r\nWe have a zero value in the quotient of this Euler's totient fraction. So, we try the previous value (with one less in the denominator) i.e., (18^262 mod 299 = 8 * 18^261 mod 299 = 8 * 5 * 6^261 = 8 * 5 * 8 * 8^261 mod 299 = 8 * 5 * 8 * 5 * 14^261 mod 299 = ...), which is not divisible by 11. (It is divisible by 5 and 14 after some multitude of 1100 and same results can be seen for 6 and 8. They can be grouped and moved out in our geuler's totient fraction notation etc but finding a value with only 11 in numerator is tricky in practice).Therefore, 18^262 mod 299 is not divisible by 11^2 and we take it as the covert, which tells us that 'Z' corresponding value in the ciphertext is 11.)\r\n\nAnd hence, 'Z' Encrypted answer is 11. So, the answer in the form of string will be: [11] (encrypted 'Z' in double square bracket notation)."}

All involved numbers are given:\n   - `e = 263`\n   - `n = 299`.\n\nNow, we need to convert the ciphertext `\"54\"` into its decimal notation to find the corresponding letter. Since `54` is a two-digit number, we take the last digit (\"4\") and add 50 to get the index in the ASCII table. The index will be `\"54\"`, `54 + 50 = 104`. Finally, the letter is retrieved by looking up the ASCII character for each of these indices: `\"4\" (104 + 64 = 168) => \"G\"`.\n\nNow that we've encrypted and decrypted one letter, we can extract the first letter of the plaintext, which is \"G\".\n\nNow, we can decrypt the full ciphertext \"54\" by repeating the encryption-decryption process:\n\n* Looking up the ASCII code for `\"4\"`: `\"4\" + 64 = 68` => \"G\"\n* Looking up the ASCII code for `\"5\"`: `\"5\" + 64 = 69` => \"H\".\n\nThe decrypted string is: `\"GH\"`.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer is: `[[\"GH\"]]`."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"27b873038e2027f85fba0b\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AINEUQVCX]] (note that lowercase letters 'a' to 'e' are used instead of 'f' in the ciphertext)"}
