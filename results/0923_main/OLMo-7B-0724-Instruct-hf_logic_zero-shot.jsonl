Let's evaluate its truth values under assignments:\n\n- Assign p1 & p2 as \u2713: This formula becomes ~(\u2713=::>\u2713)&\ufffd indulge_insults\u231a. The compound proposition within the ~ is \u2713=::>\u2713, which is false because p1 =::> p2 would mean p2 must be true when p1 is true, but here p2 is false. Therefore, the whole formula is false.\n\n- Assign p1, p2 as x: This formula becomes ~(x=::>x)&x. The compound proposition within the ~ is x=::>x, which is true because if p1 is false, then p2 remains false. Therefore, the whole formula is also true. \n\nSince the formula is neither true under all assignments (first case) nor false under all assignments (second case), it is a Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question.\n\nFor the second sub-question, the formula is (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2). The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is true only when p1 is false, p3 is true (or p1 is true & p2 is false). So, the formula becomes (~p1&~p2). This formula is constantly false because p1 is necessarily false, and hence p2 always remains true in every assignment. Therefore, the formula is a Truth Formula for the second sub-question.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[B;A] (Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question, Truth Formula for the second sub-question)."}

We'll represent the PCTs using hexadecimal numbers, starting with 0 and proceeding in ascending order.Memory steps: \n1. Start with the PCTs p0,p1,p2,p3, where p0 = \u00acp1\u2228\u00acp2\u2228\u00acp3, p1 = \u00acp0\u2228\u00acp2\u2228\u00acp3, p2 = \u00acp0\u2228\u00acp1\u2228\u00acp3, and p3 = \u00acp0\u2228\u00acp1\u2228\u00acp2.\n2. Since all the PCTs include either p or \u00acp, they correspond to hexadecimal numbers 2^(i\u22121) and 2^(i\u22121)+1, for i=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, our PCTs correspond to the following hexadecimal numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe disjunctive normal form of A (in this case, CNF) consists of all the above PCTs. We want all the PCTs to be even, meaning their corresponding hexadecimal numbers must be divisible by 4: 0 (no issue), 2, 4, and none of 1 or 3 (each is divisible by only 2).\n\nAnd the answer is[[]], meaning there is only one possible formula that satisfies both conditions: \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228p\u2228\u00acr (hexadecimal number 0).

The final check in the algorithm will verify if S2 is empty, which isn't the case in this example.

First, we have a universal quantifier \u2200x.\n2. Then, we replace x in the formula with a\u2032 (which is 0) to obtain: g(0, y) + z = g(0, z).\n3. Now we need to replace variables in g(0, y) + z = g(0, z). Replace y with y' and z with z': g(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n4. Since 0 + y' = g(0, y') and 0 + z = g(0, z), the expression simplifies to:\ng(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n5. Since all referring entities and function executions are fixed (assigned values), we keep this simplified expression instead of parsing out the variables in a' form.\n6.

If one is true, the other may be true or false, but if one is false, the other may be true or false. In this case, since Inspector C says that \"some\" individual businesses paid taxes, and Inspector A says that \"no individual businesses\" paid taxes, we know that neither all nor none of the individual businesses paid taxes. Therefore, the best relationship between Inspector A and Inspector C is & (AND), which represents the fact that both propositions are not entirely accurate, but their combination leads to a more accurate conclusion.\n\nNote that the relationship between A (Universal Affirmative) propositions and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions also follows the [# (or) relationship. If one proposition is true while the other is false, a \"true or false\" situation arises. However, in this case, we know that both Inspector A and Inspector C are not entirely accurate, so the most appropriate relationship is the & (AND) relationship, not [# (or)].\n\nLastly, the relationship between A (Universal Affirmative) propositions and I (Particular Affirmative) propositions also follows the % (bilateral) relationship. If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is also true (iliciting a \"true or true\" situation). However, in this case, since we know that Inspector A's proposition is \"no individual businesses paid taxes,\" we also know that not all individual businesses paid taxes. Therefore, Inspector A and Inspector C are consistent in conclusion and follow the % (bilateral) relationship."}

Secondly, we employ these propositions in the specific format of the chosen logical notation. In the given background logic, we use # and $ as symbols for necessity and possibility, respectively.\nc. Finally, to represent the negation of \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\", we use the ! symbol for negation and the \u2192 symbol for implication. Specifically, we write:\n\n!$!p \u2192 \u00a1\u21afp (The negation of the disjunction of the negation of possibility of not science being a one-man endeavor and the negation of impossibility of not science being a human endeavor implies that science cannot be a one-man endeavor.)\n\nBy substituting the appropriate symbols in the English sentence, and following the rules of the modal logic, the symbolized proposition is expressed as such:\n\n[[]$\u21afp] - !$!p \u2192 \u00a1\u21afp."}

Hence, according to (1), \u2191\u00a7\u00acp, meaning \"it's not prohibited not to protect citizens' rights.\"\n- Now we have two propositions: \u00a7p and \u203d\u00acp. The smallest equivalence relation we can apply is the \"x\" connection (Propositional pairs: \u00b6p and \u203dp). Thus, the relation between Sentences (1) and (2) is un hade b (B/D). \n\nTherefore, the answer is [[B/D];[B/D]] indicating that the relation between the two sentences is the \"x\" relation."}

In this case, the \"if-if\" applies to the logical implements Gp (the future point of time) and the negation of its complement G\u00acp (which refers to the past point of time).

However, the axiom does not explicitly state that Bob will certainly doubt or that he will be convinced the proposition is true. It merely suggests that Bob may consider the possibility of his own doubt or that the proposition might not be entirely true. Therefore, the likely outcome based on the Spread of Doubt axiom is that Bob may harbor some doubts about the proposition, which could potentially lead to belief in the proposition's truth (option A), but it is also possible that Bob would simply have doubts in his mind (option C)."}

The inner expression will return `1` if either `c1` or `c2` will be true (i.e., if their `\u03c6` parts would be true), and `0` otherwise. The outer expression will then use the OR operator to determine if either of the inner expressions is `1`. This results in a yes/no answer of whether executing `c1` or `c2` would make `\u03c6` necessarily true.\n\nIn the final [c1 + c2] expression, we can utilize the addition operator to represent each of them separately, since the result would be equivalent to doing `[c1] + [c2]`, as per the Concurrent Rule."}

As the scientists calculated the position of a possible undiscovered object and found Neptune there, and since there was a significant deviation in Uranus's orbit, it can be inferred that the increased presence of Neptune in the system caused the deviation. Therefore, S (the yet-to-be-discovered object) and P (the deviation in Uranus's orbit) may have a causal relationship.\n\nTherefore, the discourse adheres to the [[C/E]] methods."}

{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with method \u2d63, or the \"changes in S correspond to changes in P\" method. \n\nThe passage describes that Klaprozli experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance. Remarkably, when the uranium was extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This suggests that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium, so it must contain another radioactive element. \n\nBy tracking the changes in uranium content of the samples before and after extraction, Mrs Curie and Pierre Curie isolated radium and polonium from the leachate, which represent the new elements emitting radiation. Therefore, the changes in S (the uranium content) and the corresponding changes in P (the radioactivity levels) indicate a causal relationship between S and P. [[A/D]] (A/\u2d63 method) is not correct because the passage does not meet the single condition of showing that S arises when P arises while some other conditions remain the same. [[B/C/E]] (B/\ua66e method, C/\ua66e method, and E/\u2698 method) are not correct since the passage does not contain any situations of S and P occurring together in multiple cases while other conditions differ, the absence of one conditionallowing the presence of another, or previously known causal relationships among known elements."}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of traffic violations in a city, 500 cars were randomly selected for observation and 40 cars were found to be speeding.\nPlease represent them symbolically according to P-Generalization rule .\nDenote the property speeding behaviour as A.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote what?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given survey data with 500 cars selected for observation, out of which 40 cars were found to be speeding (speeding behavior represented as A). Using the P-Generalization rule, we can infer the proportion of speeding cars in the population, denoted as Pr(A).\n\nSymbolically, the statement can be represented as follows:\n\n[[]]\n\n`P(A, 40, 500)`, which means the proportion of cars that were found to be speeding (property A) out of 500 cars in the sample.\n\nBy dividing `k` (40) by `n` (500), we find that `k/n \u2248 0.08`.\n\nSo, the best approximation for the proportion of speeding cars in the population based on the sample is `Pr(A) \u2248 0.08`."}

The concept of connection inference relates to the inference of a related or connected idea based on the relationship between elements within a sentence. CQ1 applies because we are inferring that Zhang San's new car has doors based on the statement that Zhang San bought a new car but the door won't close. The information contained in the statement is related to the doors of the car and their inability to close. The statement meets the criteria for CQ1: the speaker states that the car has a door that won't close, which entails the information that the car has at least one door.

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network.

The Contra- Method indirectly confirms the truth of the original proposition (that many scientists made important discoveries during their prime years) by refuting the contrary proposition (that scientists make fewer important discoveries later in life). The text mentions several examples of scientists who made inventions and discoveries during their prime, and through negation, implies that the opposite proposition (that scientists make fewer important discoveries later in life) is untrue.

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job.

The error made in this reasoning is that from the premises \"Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast\" and \"Wang Meng spends a long time online,\" we incorrectly conclude that \"Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast\" because he spends a long time online. However, the fact that Wang Meng spends a long time online does not necessarily mean that he is an internet enthusiast; the long time spent online might be due to his job or any other reason unrelated to his enthusiasm for the internet. The faulty inference made here is this: Since Wang Meng spends a long time online, he must be an internet enthusiast. This argument fails to distinguish between cause and effect, leading to an invalid conclusion about Wang Meng's status as an internet enthusiast."}

For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nConsidering the domain of individuals as natural numbers and R representing the \"less than\" relationship, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) states that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number. However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number.

An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose a company manager (let's call him Manager M) announces a new policy: \"All employees (E) will receive a bonus (B) after completing a project (P).\" However, an employee (let's call him Employee A) misunderstands this statement, thinking that \"only when an employee receives a bonus (B) have they completed a project (P).\"\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

The mistake is described in IllTrans Method. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: \n\n[[G/H]]"}
