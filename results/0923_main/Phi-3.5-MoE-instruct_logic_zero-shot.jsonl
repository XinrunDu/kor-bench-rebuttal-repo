The expectation was to provide logical expressions formatted as [[];[]]. Given the characterization of the question and stated rules, we derive the simplest results, but these cannot be directly fit within the given format for comparison. Example: [[expression 1]]; [[expression 2]] - this format would hold: `[[!p>!q)&(q>!p)&r],[p&!q]]`. However, the format is not standard and can be difficult to understand without context. It is always better to match the format with regular logical expressions, as explained above.\n\nPlease seek clarification from the question provider if needed.

Using rules of inference and basic logical equivalences, we can simplify !(!p & !q) & !r as (p | q) & !r, and !p | (!q & !r) as !p | !q & !r (by applying the associativity of '&' in conjunction with '|').\n\nUpon examining these two expressions, we notice that they are not equivalent. The expression (p | q) & !r combines p and q using '|', while the second expression does not. Thus, the first equivalence is not valid.\n\n(2) The proposition (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r is equivalent to !!(p | q) | !r by applying the equivalence (15), and p\u21d1(q\u21d1r) is equivalent to p | (!q | !r) by applying the equivalence (15).\n\nAgain, we see that we need to check if these two expressions are equivalent. Using rules of inference and basic logical equivalences, we can simplify !! (p | q) | !r to (p | q) | !r (since '!!A ::=:: A'), and p | (!q | !r) can be left as it is. By comparing the two expressions, we see that they are not equivalent. In this case, for the second equivalence, the distribution of '|' over '&' is not included as a basic equivalence rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer for each sub-question is:\n\n[[B];[B]]\n\nBoth of the given logical equivalences are not valid."}

B1&C2&D3:  (!p&q) & ((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (q & r)\nSince !p is false (as q is true), the second part of C2 becomes false, leaving us with (!p&q) & (!p & !q) & (q & r). This simplifies to q & r.\n2. B1&C3&D2:  (!p&q) & (p & !q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\nSince q is true, the first part of C3 is false, leaving us with false & p & (false | r). Thus, the expression simplifies to r.\n3. B2&C1&D3:  (p&!q) & (p & !q) & (q & r)\nThis simplifies to (p & !q) & (q & r).\n4. B2&C3&D1:  (p&!q) & (p & q) & (!q & !r)\nThis simplifies to false since p & !q is false (as q is true).\n5. B3&C1&D2:  (p&q) & (p & !q) & (!q & r)\nThis simplifies to false since p & q and p & !q are mutually exclusive.\n6. B3&C2&D1:  (p&!q) & ((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (!q & !r)\nThis simplifies to false, since (p & !q) and (!q & !r) are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, compute the final expression E:\n\nE = (q & r) | (r) | ((p & !q) & (q & r)) | false | false | false\nE = (q & r) | r\nE = r | q  (since q & r is a subset of r)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n[[B1&C2&D3::=::q & r];[B1&C3&D2::=::r];[B2&C1&D3::=::(p & !q) & (q & r)];[B2&C3&D1::=::false];[B3&C1&D2::=::false];[B3&C2&D1::=::false];[E::=::r | q]]"}

After initializing, S0 and S1 are empty sets, while S2 is also an empty set: [{};{};\u2205]\n2. Before addressing the clauses in S1, we need to break down the given boolean expression into simple disjunctive clauses:\n   - (\u00acp \u2228 q) represents clause C1\n   - (p \u2228 q) represents clause C2\n   - (q) represents clause C3\n3. Now we solve for S1: {(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)} and S0 remains empty: [{};{(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)};\u2205]\n4. During the resolve operation, clauses (\u00acp \u2228 q) and (p \u2228 q) should be resolved to obtain q. Since q is already present in S1, the resolved clause is not added to S2.\n5. Also, clauses (\u00acp \u2228 q) and (q) can be resolved to obtain \u00acp, and since \u00acp is not in S1, it will be added to S2.\n6. Thus, after the first loop iteration, S0 = {}, S1 = {(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)}, S2 = {\u00acp}. The final output therefore is [[{};{};\u2286{}];[{\u00acp \u2228 q}, {p \u2228 q}, {q}];[\u2205];[{{\u00acp}}]].\n\nHowever, since we are requested to put the answer in the format [[];[];[];[]], the correct answer is [[{};{};\u2205];[{(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)}];[{\u2205}];[{{\u00acp}}]]."}

In this case, the valid figure is IV, and the mood is a combination of the universal affirmative of P()M (AEE) and the universal negative E in SEM (EIO). However, there is a misunderstanding in the format, as the valid figure is IV with the appropriate mood as AEE. Therefore, the appropriate final answer is [[IV]; [AEE]].\n\nPlease note that the valid mood for Figure IV is AEE, and the combination of the presented proposition and SEM would not form a complete syllogism as it contradicts the valid moods for Figure IV. The answer[[];[]] is not suitable for this question as there is a definite figure and valid mood to match with the given propositions P()M and S()P."}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[C]]"}

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[C]]"}
