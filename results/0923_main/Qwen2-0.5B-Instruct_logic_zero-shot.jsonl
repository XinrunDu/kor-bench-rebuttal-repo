Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula,\n ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 is a Falsehood Formula, \ndetermine the type of the following formulas:\n(1) (p1=::>(p1||p2))&(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n(2) (p1=::>(p1||p2))||(~(p1=::>p2)&p2)\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The above formula has a Falsehood Formula because:\n-p1 and (p1||p2) are both propositions (p1 is a proposition and both p1 and p2 are propositions), but (p1||p2) is a propositional expression, not a collective (p1 and p2) at all. \n\nSo the formula (p1=::>(p1||p2)) has a Falsehood Formula because it is a formula with only one proposition and is not a collective of propositional expressions.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. Neither."}

This is equivalent to asking for the count of matching pairs of propositional variables in the corresponding student's disjunctive normal form and to accounting for the lack of any disjunctive variables. The correct pattern of the disjunctive normal form follows the rules: it is the principal conjunctive normal form, and whenever the disjunctive normal form includes a pair of the propositional variables or their negations, or all even replacements, it is a basic formula. For simple atomic formula, 3 pairs of substitutions and both a basic and an all-even formula are possible, but the context suggests that one of these pairings must be of the form p\u2227q.

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r), which can be denoted as m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5. \nBased on the three true assignments represented, what are the feasible selection schemes? \n\nOnly give the letters of the people selected to go, separated by commas within a scheme, and different schemes separated by []; format: [[];[];..].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[] [] []"}

When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[Paraphrased sentence from person A]"}

Team A  won the championship.\nB. Team A will not win the championship.\nC. Team A cannot win the championship.\nD. Team A might not have won the championship.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "A. As it states that \"Team A did not win the championship\", Team A cannot infer that they would have won the championship. It is possible that Team A did not marginally win the championship, but yet, as observed, Team A cannot win it. Therefore, choice [A] is not correct."}

I used to stick to painting - This is not a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the reasoning equation only considers two possible results (using Park's \"Ways of Possibility\" deduction principle), without clearly specifying whose actions these are. Reasoning Equation 21 only uses the \"True or False\" scenario (Fp -> F\u00acp) and might need to be adjusted to account for both alternatives. \n\nB. I keep on painting - This is a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the decision to paint is consistent with these two possible actions (\"daily work\" and \"extreme creativity\"). Both are valid, hence B is the correct answer. \n\nC. I will start painting tomorrow - This is not a valid deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because the \"reasoning equation\" itself confuses the statement \"I will always keep on painting\" - that is, the impossibility of an impossible decision - with a start date. Reasoning Equation 21 recognizes that an act is determined by its possible consequences, but the role of the artist in painting cannot be isolated from the task of painting itself. Therefore, this statement logically implies a downward movement in the decision process, which is not captured by Reasoning Equation 21.\n\nD. I will keep on painting - This is a most correct deduction from Reasoning Equation 21 because it neatly integrates the acts of using a mundane painter's work and the conceptual notion that painting is an act that can result in lean figures (seen as people or objects). Despite the implication of remaining on painting (D) in Reasoning Equation 21, it is more accurate than the scattered meanings mentioned earlier."}

The \"P(AQI, k, n)\" symbol would be applied for this rule, where `k` is the proportion of AQIs below 50, and `n` is the number of days. The symbol `Aaqi, n` would represent the average AQI for the tested sample of days. The proportion of AQIs below 50 would then be estimated based on the proportion of samples where <50 AQIs were not attributed to specific attributes.\n\nGiven that considering k = 4 and n = 5 has estimated total averaged AQI values of 42, the estimated proportion would be:\n\n```\n`42 * P(Aq1, 4 * 5, 5)`\n```\n\nwhere `Aq1` is the average AQI for the first day, with the conditions we have stated\n\n```\n`P(Aq1, 4 * 5, 5)`\n```\n\nby the Rule Description (2) of P-Generalization Rule.\n\nTo get the desired answer, divide this expression by `k/n` to get the actual proportion of days in which the average AQI of the city was less than 50; the result would be:\n\n```\n` (42 * P(Aq1, 40, 5)) / 5`\n```\n\n``` This formula is multiplying the proportion of samples with less than 50 AQIs with 50 to estimate the proportion of average AQIs less than 50, which would then be divided by k/n, the proportion of days for this parameter. For the given situation, the proportion figured out is 38 out of 47 (38.73%). clip this number to 39% which is the exact proportion in the \"number%\". \n\nPlease note that this concept requires interpretation and assumptions on the specific circumstances.

It means that the speaker might commit the speaker to the truth of the representation of an otherwise false proposition. In this case, expressives refer to concerning the speaker's / agent's trust relation.\n\nBoth examples are speech acts done to commit a personal intent or morality of the speaker, hence they are categorized under the possibilities of either `A` (Assertives), `B` (Directives) or `C` (Commissives). The rules do not specify a category specifically for `XX` (Expressives) because they are not explicitly mentioned in the rules for `Assertive`, `Direction`, or `Commissive`.\n\nTherefore, from the evaluation:\n\n1. Both `A` and `C` (Expressives) - [\"C\"]\n2. I.e., primarily [C] - [\"Expressives\"]."}

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Can you help me borrow the materials for tomorrow's meeting?\"\nB: \"I borrowed the materials.\"\nC: \"I managed to get the materials.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, B's response \"I borrowed the materials\" is a direct and conventional answer, indicating that B has successfully completed the action of borrowing the materials. However, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" uses the word \"managed,\" which may imply that the process of obtaining the materials was not simple and may involve additional effort or the use of some special methods. C's response may lead people to understand that the process of obtaining the materials was \"quite troublesome,\" or C encountered some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Father can be used both as a noun and a verb.

Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey.
