Looking at the given string 'SG', it is found to be 'Z', which means letter 'C' should be mapped to Z, so the position that 'C' should go is in the position with the letter 'Z'. In this case, 'C' should go at the 18th position in the alphabet.\n\nTo find the necessary number of positions to shift, we look up the mapping in the substitution_alphabet, which is \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\". Looking at the given string 'SG', it is found to be 'Z', so the position that 'C' should go is in the position with the letter 'Z', which is at position 18. To shift the positions of 'C' in 'SG', we simply use the mapping in the substitution_alphabet and replace letter 'C' with its corresponding letter from the reversed_alphabet at that position.\n\nThe decrypted answer follows the format '[[[encrypted answer]]]', where '[[[decrypted answer]]]' separates the two parts of the answer.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nEncryption:\n- The object ```plaintext``` with the characters ```*```, ```@```, ```!``` and ```^^``` has a length of ```9``` bytes in ASCII representation.\n\nYou are given the encrypted table ```encryption\\_table```.\nYou are also given the ciphertext ``plaintext``.\n\n1. Encrypt the actual plaintext using the encryption table ```encryption\\_table```. The output should be interpreted and represented accordingly.\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext using a suitable method like the one you provided earlier.\nTo encrypt the plaintext \"H\" using the provided encryption table, the steps would be similar to the inverse of Caesar cipher.\nThe Caesar cipher transforms an input character by shifting it 'n' places forward in the alphabet, where 'n' ranges from 1 to 2 ** 12-1 = 15. However, for calculating n, since we are working with ASCII representation, we can use an integer number approach where we can shift each character in the alphabet a '15' number of positions forward in the alphabet, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n1. The plaintext character \"H\" will be converted to uppercase, as uppercase and lowercase of character are interchangeable, so the transformed character should be uppercase \"H\".\n2. Negative shift of characters 3 ('4') and 13 ('5') have been taken care during converting characters to uppercase into arabic alphabet. Here is the step by step calculation:\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 3: \n- The number 3 is divided by 26 and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 1.\n- This means that the character will be shifted to the right 1 place in the alphabet.\n\nShift (x % 26) to the right by 13:\n- The number 13 is divided by 26 the result is rounded down to the nearest integer that gives us 2 (and not 1) and converted to uppercase ('A').\n3. Writing these steps in the correct format of a tabular expression where each row will represent a character from ascii and ```<=``` will represent the lowercase character and ```>=``` will represent the time based form of the character. As you can see the decrypted string will look like this:\n\n```\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!<XW>\nA<UB<GH<WE<4>!><W>!\n\n```\n\n4. Here is a specific solution using Python:\n```python\nimport optparse\n\ndef encrypt_data(plaintext):\n    encryption_table = {\n        'A': '!', 'B': '@', 'C': '#', 'D': '$',\n        'E': '%', 'F': '^', 'G': '&', 'H': '*',\n        'I': '(', 'J': ')', 'K': '_', 'L': '+',\n        'M': '=', 'N': '~', 'O': '?', 'P': '/',\n        'Q': '0', 'R': ':', 'S': ';', 'T': '<',\n        'U': '>', 'V': '1', 'W': '2', 'X': '3',\n        'Y': '4', 'Z': '5'\n    }\n    encrypted_cipher = ''\n    for char in plaintext:\n        if char == 'A': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['A']  # Encrypt -> \"A\"\n        if char == 'X': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['X']  # Encrypt -> \"X\"\n\n        if char == 'Y': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Y']  # Encrypt -> \"Y\"\n        if char == 'Z': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['Z']  # Encrypt -> \"Z\"\n        if char == 'W': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['W']  # Encrypt -> \"W\"\n        if char == 'U': encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['U']  # Encrypt -> \"U\"\n\n        if ord(char) not in encryption_table.values():  # If the encoded character is already present in the table\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table[ord(char)]\n        else:  # Otherwise encrypt the character by shifting all the specified ASCII \"special\" letters, '&' followed by 3 letters\n            encrypted_cipher += encryption_table['^']  # Encrypt -> \"^\"\n\n\n    return encrypted_cipher\n\n# Usage\nparser = optparse.OptionParser()\nparser.add_option (\"-n\", \"--plaintext\", type = \"string\", action = \"store\", dest = \"plaintext\", help = \"Enter the encrypted string, Default value is empty\")\n(options, args) = parser.parse_args()\n\nif len(args) == 1:\n    print(encrypt_data(options.plaintext))\nelse:\n    print(\"Please enter a valid plaintext string, \" + str(args[1]))\n```\n\n**Output: encrypt\\_data(*) returns the encrypted string, \"EaXL....dE\"**"}

The input is the plaintext string and the ciphertext string which are to be decrypted.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nPolybius Square is used to encrypt a plaintext string. Given an input \"P\", the first step of the encryption process is to find the number represented by 'p' in the polybius square. Based on this, we found out that for 'O' in polybius square, the value of 'p' is 66\n\nThen, based on this value of 'p', we record the rows and columns denoted by 'CRCC' in the polybius square grid.   \n\nFor example, for '34', in the Polybius Square, we have '21', '27', '53', '89', which means, rows are 21-7, 27-8, 53-9, 89-0. Then we start analyzing the rows and columns according to 'CRCC'.\n\nFor '34', we got the values as (27-0), (53-8), (89-9) which represents the value for P in Polybius Square.  \n\nBased on this, we can conclude 'P' is replaced with 'O'. 'O' is represented by (053-9).\n\nThen, the next step is to examine the columns in polybius square isolating the row 1 is represented by '0' (leftmost column), then the '11' represents 'P' in polybius square and all other rows can be written in similar way. So 'P' is replaced with 'O'. \"O\" is represented by (05369).\n\nAt last, based on 'CRCC' calculation, we can find that for '5369', which represents the second quarter part of the Polybius Square, 'U' is the so chosen for 'O'. We have found that 'O' occupies multiple rows and multiple columns in the Polybius Square. Therefore, it is changed to chosen character number, 'U' is template character from the rows part of polybius square.\n\nThe last step is to unpack the encrypted data into a list of integers called 'array'. Similarly, the actual decryption done is done similarly to encrypted data and the decryption result is 'array'.\n\nTherefore the decrypted data will be:\n\n[[34]]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is given by the zero-based decimal number which is three for 'UO'. The format of output should be [[encrypted answer]] to represent the decrypted data in formal format featuring at least the first element as encrypted data.\n\nUrmi's Answer:\n\n```python\nnewstring = \"34\"  # Convert the String to string\npolybius_square = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\nUPPERLITER = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\nUPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\nUPPERCIRCLE = [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0, 6]\n}\n\n(key, value) = polybius_square  # Initialize the polybius_square and decrypt array\n\nfor i in range(0, len(newstring), 2):\n    key[i] = polybius_square[newstring[i], newstring[i+1] - 1]  # replace the characters in polybius_square\n\narray = list(map(lambda x: key[x], value))\n\nprint(array[0])\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```less\n34```\n\n### QUESTION:\n\nWhy does answer  UO gives the decrypted string [34] ? `UPPERCIRCLE = [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0, 6]` instead of just `UPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` ? The answer gives 34 in the JSON response from **https://github.com/urumiya/crypt**\n\n>\nCan you get the answer from the JSON response? If not, it says that the query returns a list of characters, not a key-value pair. Can you give me the [JSON '[[]\"Uo(\".\",\"(.).\")(.\\.)|\\)]'] [/json](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37773668/changing-the-data-model-or-output-from-pangram) ??\n\nUrmi's Answer:\n\nFor UO, number O appears twice in the Polybius Square (UPPERLINE = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), so it gets replaced as repeated again than once in Polybius Square. The correct format is [[[\"Uo.\", \"(.).\"]\n                                ()]\n                         Measurement of Sentence]] instead of [[{\"Uo.</p>: <p>Measurement\" (U). \"),\n                                     (\"[ \")\n                                     ]\n                                       logical field\"/>()\"].\n\n\n> Urmi's Ans:\n\nThis is Uo.</p> [Measurement())) [6],\nThis is>`[ +](\nTo remain with this answer form [[[\"Would functioning, notably is\"\"\"\n```\n\n>\n\nTruth be told, In the JSON JSON_DATA there is the **\" corrected answer** 34 at index \\ - the corrected answer`. Is it possible to receive the corrected result and change it in the JSON file?\nIf you go by your question of [Urumi's Ans](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37773668/changing-the-data-model-or-output-from-pangram), then you want to do a `\\` (\\`), since when you're working with strings, you can't overwrite characters, which assumes you mean that `(\\$)` (\\) is not allowed currently\n\nFor the user's context, instead of `]()` the user would like to pass the `STRING` object (which does not exist in this case but is okay to pass) as per the requirements. The corrected answer would look like this:\n\n> [`[$\"`\"`) [Measurement))([]`\nDue to the bug perhaps in a template, when the user is insedated with hardcoded `[$\"`\"`) [Measurement)``, it appears that you break a string literal.\n\n> Urmi's Ans:\n\nFirst task is to understand the problem. Sorry, I have not been able to find a TongueTwister installation that executes Unicode UTF-8. Would you like me to analyze your JSON data and help correct it?\n\n\nUrmi's Ans:\n\nThe best way to do it would be to generate the JSON string with Unicode (non UTF-8) placeholders. Then perform join (or concatenation + replace, depending on the encoded characters) of the quoted string into the correct format.\n\nSuppose our CharSequence is Uo.</p> [Measurement())) [6],\nFollowing the JSOND translation rules should portray in encoded string format:\n\n- `Uo.</p>` => `\"[]``\n- `()` => `\\\"\\(\"`\n- `\"Measurement\")` => `\"[]\"`\n- `)` => `\"\"\"`\n- `[Measurement)` => `\"[]`\n\nHere is the code in Python for passing `\\` inside chars (`\"` to `\"}`, `` to `\"[]\"\"`, carriage return `(>` to `,`), point (`>` to `.\"`, `\\)` to `(\"`, \\` to `)` etc. First, we generate `[]\"` with `%` characters to sequentially append Unicode and subsequent risk of `')'` character appearing repeatedly within the encoded string.\n\nYou might achieve this without generating the JSON, but it just gives a larger amount, thus takes more computational time and physically. Even for Unicode UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings, this process of `u\"\"[\"\"][(\"\"][(`]\")` is comparable to √3 log₂(3) second same pouring way."}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

A decrypted message is a linear sequence of Latin letters like \"ADNTUOR\" would become \"OUGTHNK_UOR\", if the order of the repeating letters was reversed in the message\", he says.  \"The creases produced by replacing a letter with another lower-valued letter in the message are a meaningful step in a ciphertext decryption process,\" he says.\" The second step in the decryption is to use the repeated character in the plaintext to produce a new (encrypted) result, similar to the way that each divider of a favorite childhood favorite package gives a variable bit in its decryption process\".

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

However, there are some technical details that may need to be clarified. \n\nFirst, you have mentioned that you may be making some limited assumptions in certain cases that cannot be fully accounted for by the rules or protocols. You are suggesting that the threshold values are reasonable to keep in mind and can be utilized in certain situations. This may necessitate more careful validation, but it is important to keep in mind that even small variations in the threshold values can lead to very different results.\n\nSecond, you have mentioned that you may want to name the relevant properties and objects, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext, in the formatting of your cipher, ensuring clarity and readability. It is important to make sure that the objects and their values are defined correctly for the specific use case being described.\n\nAdditionally, you have mentioned that you would prefer to provide both plaintext and ciphertext, encapsulated in double square brackets. It is important to also consider the potential scenarios where only one of these may be insufficient or incomplete. \n\nIn the scenario, where you indicated that you are interested only in the ciphertext, you are clearly on the right track. But, if you have another use case where you want the plaintext and ciphertext to be provided together in double square brackets, you would have to considerome environment and implementation details to suit your requirements."}

I hope this message responds to your puzzle-solving. Just to clarify, the decryption rule you're asking about seems to be missing some details and instances that depend on a weaker rule than the one we're focusing on. In order to help with that, I'll provide a list of the keys we'll be using.\n\nRULE: Encryption\n\n1. In this rule, specify the initial (plaintext) string.\n2. Given a key, generate ciphertext of that string.\n3.(Optionally) parse the output to see what the \\* character stands for.\n            \nCOUNT-SLASH-MACRO:\n    \"ANSWER\": [ '_', 'HTTP?' ]\n\nRULE: Decryption\n\n1. Input the ciphertext as string y.\n2. Convert string y to character array to easily manipulate following steps.\n3. Parse the character array to figure out what to do.\n4. Based on what we know about encrypted symbols, switch to the phrase \"ANSWER\" or \"ANSWER:\".\n4. Alternatively, you can use CASE-INCLUSIVE.\n5. (OPTIONAL)\n    Exclude the sign \\* from the answer variable(y when y is not (E.g., \"WELCOME\" and \"DARKLY:\")).\n\nNote:\nAND: We use 'stackoverflow.com' instead of 'stackoverflow.'\n- `identifier: 5`\n- `amount: 666`\n\nFor example:\nhttps://habr.com/ru/blog/228603/\n\nSo, you'd parse the following text:\n`http://stackoverflow.com/project/browse/topics/computer-issues`\nand it would output a list of negative symbols, such as `/`, `d`, `ic`, etc.\n\n Tips:\n     Using uppercase letters is not recommended if you want exact ASCII values because they roll your long-term and short-term memory.\n     If you need any help please let me know, I can add more pieces of information when needed!\n     Also you could add space between words instead of pipe and in case you need subscriptions purchase them, if you pay as 3 to 5 USD the price might be very different from the one mentioned in the input.   The 3 dollar price of sticker paper items (with repetition) works fine."}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

In DARKZYL's example, the leftmost byte in the plaintext (row 4, column 4) corresponds to the 'R' byte in the ciphertext. Since 'R' is 'A' in the alphabet, we can break down the encrypted and decrypted texts into rows and columns using constellation rules. The encrypted text is a 3-length binary pattern that starts with '8' and then follows the pattern '2786' (ignoring leading bits) for each letter. In the decrypted text, each character (represented as an array of column ids) corresponds to the value of the corresponding letter's column in the encrypted text. Based on these patterns and conversions, the decrypted text becomes 'CERN'. Each returned row corresponds to the letter (represented as an array of created arrays), whereas each decrypted column corresponds to the correspondent pound-staked number (represented as an array). \n\nIn the encrypted and delunary case, each row corresponds to a text block of the ciphertext and decrypted blocks correspond to each hashgram in-place during black light encryption (BI), spawning a number of hashgrams before delivering the activated event."}
