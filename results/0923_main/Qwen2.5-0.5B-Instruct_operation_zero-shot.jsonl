The rule for a◇b is defined as a◇b = a^b. Therefore, if 3◇X = 243, we can set up the equation 3^X = 243. Since 243 can be written as 3^5 (because 243 = 3^5), we can solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides with base 3:\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n\n3*log_3(243) = 5\n\nNow, we solve for log_3(243):\n\nlog_3(243) = 5 log_3(243)\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nNow, since 243 can be written as 3^5:\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nSince log_3(3^5) = 5, we have:\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n3 = 5\n\nThus, [3] is the answer."}

Let's compute A&B step by step using the given rules.\n\n### Operation A @ B\nThe operation A @ B generates the element-by-element maximum from the two matrices A and B. For each row in A, we compare it with each column in B.\n\n### Step 1: Compare row A[0] with column B[0]:\nA[0][0] = 2\nB[0][0] = 3\n\nSince 2 > 3, we set A[0][0] to 2.\n\nFor each column:\nA[0][1] = 3\nB[0][1] = 2\n\nSince 3 > 2, we set A[0][1] to 3.\n\nSo, the result of A & A[0] is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  2 & 3 \\\\\n  3 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Compare row A[1] with column B[1]:\nA[1][0] = 4\nB[1][0] = 1\n\nSince 4 > 1, we set A[1][0] to 4.\n\nFor each column:\nA[1][1] = 4\nB[1][1] = 0\n\nSince 4 > 0, we set A[1][1] to 4.\n\nSo, the result of B & A[1] is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  4 & 1 \\\\\n  4 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results from steps 1 and 2:\nThe final result of A & B is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  4 & 1 \\\\\n  3 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is `[[((4,1),(3,2))]]`."}
