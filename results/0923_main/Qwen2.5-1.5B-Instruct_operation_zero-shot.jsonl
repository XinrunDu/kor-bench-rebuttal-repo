So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ \\log_{b}{a} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{b}{a}} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\nLet \\( y = \\log_{b}{a} \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[ y + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( y \\) to clear the fraction:\n\\[ y^2 + 1 = \\left(\\frac{82}{9}\\right)y \\]\n\\[ 9y^2 - 82y + 9 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 9 \\), \\( b = -82 \\), and \\( c = 9 \\). We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 \\pm \\sqrt{(-82)^2 - 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9}}{2 \\cdot 9} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 \\pm \\sqrt{6724 - 324}}{18} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 \\pm \\sqrt{6400}}{18} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 \\pm 80}{18} \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions for \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 + 80}{18} = \\frac{162}{18} = 9 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{82 - 80}{18} = \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\nSince \\( y = \\log_{b}{a} \\), we need to check which value of \\( y \\) makes \\[ a \\circ X = \\log_{b}{a} + \\log_{a}{b} \\] equal to 82/9.\n\nFor \\( y = 9 \\):\n\\[ \\log_{b}{a} = 9 \\]\n\\[ a = b^9 \\]\n\nFor \\( y = \\frac{1}{9} \\):\n\\[ \\log_{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\\[ a = b^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider \\( y = \\log_{b}{a} = 9 \\):\n\\[ a = b^9 \\]\n\nNow substitute back into the original equation:\n\\[ \\log_{b}{512} + \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\nSince \\( b = 512^9 \\):\n\\[ \\log_{512}{512^{9}} + \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\\[ 9 + \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\nAnd similarly for \\( y = \\frac{1}{9} \\):\n\\[ a = b^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\]\n\\[ \\log_{\\frac{1}{9}}{512} + \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82}{9} \\]\n\nSo, we need to check both cases to find \\( X \\):\n1. For \\( a = 512^{9} \\):\n   \\[ \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82}{9} - 9 \\]\n   \\[ \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{82 - 81}{9} \\]\n   \\[ \\log_{512}{b} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n   \\[ b = 512^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\]\n\n2. For \\( a = b^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\):\n   \\[ \\log_{b}{512} = \\frac{82}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n   \\[ \\log_{b}{512} = \\frac{81}{9} \\]\n   \\[ \\log_{b}{512} = 9 \\]\n   \\( b = 512^{9} \\)\n\nSo, \\( X = 512^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\) or \\( X = 512^{9} \\).\n\nFinally, applying the operation:\n\\[ 512 \\cdots 512 = 512 \\log_{512}{b} \\]\n\nSo, the value of \\( X \\) is:\n\\[ [512^{\\frac{1}{9}}] \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [[512^{\\frac{1}{9}}]]"}
