Each proposition (p1, p2, p3) can be either true (\u2713) or false (x). We will evaluate each formula accordingly.\n\n### Evaluating Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\nLet's consider all combinations of truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n- If p1, p2, and p3 are all true (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713), then p1&p2&~p3 evaluates to x since ~p3 becomes false. Hence, ~(p1&p2&~p3) = ~(\u2713&\u2713&x) = ~(x) = \u2713.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713) and only p2 is false (x|\u2713|\u2713), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713) and p2 is false (x|\u2713|\u2713), and p3 is false (\u2713|x|x), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- ... and so on for all combinations.\n\nThe truth table systematically covering all cases will show that the only time the formula evaluates to false (x) is when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (\u2713|\u2713|x). For all other combinations, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is true.\n\nThus, T: (All combinations except \u2713|\u2713|x) and F: (\u2713|\u2713|x).\n\n### Evaluating Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to identify when the left side (~p1&p2) implies the right side (p1=p3).\n- If ~p1&p2 is false (\u2713|x or x|x), regardless of the value of p1=p3, the entire formula is true.\n- If ~p1&p2 is true (\u2713), then p1 must be false and p2 must be true. For (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) to be false, p1 must equal p3, which in this case means p2 must equate (false=\u2713, a contradiction).\n\nThus, the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) evaluates to false (x) only when p1 and p3 are both true (\u2713) and p2 is true (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713).\n\nHence, T: (All cases except \u2713|\u2713|\u2713) and F: (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe truth values and falsity values of the given formulas are as follows:\n\n- For formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n  - [[T:\u2713|x|x, x|x|\u2713, x|\u2713|\u2713, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|\u2713|x, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713]; [F:\u2713|\u2713|x]]\n- For formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n  - [[T:x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, \u2713|x|x, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|x|\u2713, x|\u2713|\u2713]; [F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\nPutting this in the specified format, the answer is:\n\n[[T:\u2713|x|x,x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713,x|\u2713|x,\u2713|\u2713|x,x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713,\u2713|x|x,x|\u2713|x,\u2713|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713|x;F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]"}

The innermost parts of the formula are:\n    - p1=::>~p2 is a Level B formula because it's connected by =::> and contains two Level A formulas.\n    - p3||p4 is also a Level B formula as it's connected by || and contains two Level A formulas.\n    - ~p1, ~p2, and ~p4 are Level C formulas because they are negations of Level A formulas.\n2. The formulas ~(p1=::>~p2) and (p3||p4)=~p1 are composed of higher-level structures and require an additional step of analysis:\n    - ~(p1=::>~p2) has the negation operator ~ applied to a Level B formula, making it a Level C formula.\n    - (p3||p4)=~p1 has =::> connecting a Level B formula (p3||p4) with a Level C formula (~p1), making it a Level C formula.\n3. Finally, the entire formula (~(p1=::>~p2))&((p3||p4)=~p1) contains two Level C formulas connected by the & operator, making it a Level C formula.\n\nHowever, the complexity introduced by the nested structures and the usage of multiple connectives suggests that this formula doesn't simply qualify as a Level C but requires a higher categorization based on the nestedness and combination of logical connectives.\n\nGiven the defined levels, when formulas exceed Level Z, they are classified as Z+n with n\u22651, where n indicates the additional layer of nesting above Level Z. Thus, this formula, due to the nested logical connectives and combined higher-level connectives, qualifies as being beyond Level Z.\n\nTherefore, the level of the formula is:\n\n[[Z+1]]"}

This is because no matter what values p1, p2, and p3 are assigned (true or false), the formula always evaluates to true. If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false. Thus, this compound formula will always be true.\n\nSo, the final answer as requested: [[A];[A]]."}

Thus, `(p>q)>r` becomes `(!!p | !q)|r`.\n\nBy the idempotence law (2-3), `!!p` can be simplified to `p`.\n\nSo, we have `(p | !q) | r` as our first expression.\n\nNext, for `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` translates directly using rule (10) to `!p | (q>r)`.\n2. Using rule (10) for the nested implication `(q>r)`, it becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nComparing the fully simplified forms:\n- `(p>q)>r` becomes `(p | !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo check equivalence, compare `(p | !q) | r` and `!p | (!q | r)` using the given equivalences.\n\n`(p | !q) | r` is not directly equivalent to `!p | (!q | r)` based on the provided equivalences without further steps, but we can see that neither expression directly simplifies or restructures into the other without additional transformations that aren't specified or straightforward under the given rules.\n\nGiven that through direct transformation, none of the provided equivalences directly confirm they are identical forms, and looking closely the structure of the expressions seems to hint towards different outcomes in certain scenarios (as `p` is negated in one and not the other), the conclusion leans towards them not being equivalent under all truth value scenarios.\n\n[[B]]"}

We need to simplify `(p & q) | (p & !q)` to check if it is equivalent to `p`.\n2. According to Basic Equivalence (5), we know that:\n   - `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)`\n3. Applying this, we have:\n   - `(p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p | (q & !q)`\n4. Now, according to Basic Equivalence (9), `q & !q ::=:: 0`.\n5. Substituting this into the equation:\n   - `p | (q & !q) ::=:: p | 0`\n6. According to Basic Equivalence (8), `p | 0 ::=:: p`.\n7. Hence, `(p & q) | (p & !q) ::=:: p`.

Similarly, `p>(q|r)` can be rewritten as `!p | (q | r)` (using (10) from Basic Equivalences)\n3. Now, let's compare `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` with `!p | (q | r)`:\n   - We can use equivalence (5) to simplify and compare.\n   - By equivalence (5), `!p & (!p | (q & r))` is simplified to `!p | (q | r)`.\n   - But the original expression is `(p>q)&(p>r)` which represents `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   - Analyzing further using Basic Equivalences doesn't simplify to `!p | (q | r)` directly.\nTherefore, the given equivalence in Sub-question (1) is not valid.\n\n### Sub-question (2)\nThe expression given is: `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`\n1.

Recall that `p\u21d1q` is defined as `!p | !q` and `p\u21d3q` is defined as `!p & !q`.\n\n2. For (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r, it becomes `(!(p\u21d3q)) & !(r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d3` for `p\u21d3q`, we get `(!(!(p & q))) & !(r)`.\n   - Simplifying `!(!(p & q))`, we get `p & q`.\n   - So, `(p\u21d3q)\u21d3r` becomes `(p & q) & !(r)`.\n\n3. For p\u21d3(q\u21d3r), it becomes `!(q\u21d3r) & !(p)`.\n   - Similarly, substitute the definition of `\u21d3` for `q\u21d3r`, we get `!(!(q & r)) & !(p)`.\n   - Simplifying `!(!(q & r))`, we get `q & r`.\n   - So, `p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)` becomes `!(p) & (q & r)`.\n\nComparing `(p & q) & !(r)` with `!(p) & (q & r)`:\n- They are not identical by direct comparison. Hence, as a simple answer format, (1) does not hold with direct equivalence as all terms cannot be transformed directly to match the structure of one another under the given logical operators.\n\n4. For (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r, it becomes `!((p\u21d1q) | r)`.\n   - Substitute the definition of `\u21d1` for `p\u21d1q`, we get `!( !p | !q | r )`.\n   - Similarly, for p\u21d1(q\u21d1r), it becomes `!(p | !(q\u21d1r))`.\n   - Substitute the definition for `q\u21d1r`, we get `!(!(q | !r) | p)`, which simplifies logically to `!( !p | !q | !r )`.\n\nSince both expressions simplify to the same form: `! (!p | !q | r)` for the first and `!( !p | !q | !r )` for the second under derivation, they indeed hold the same logical equivalence under the rules provided, considering De Morgan's laws and the definition of NOR operator.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[A]]"}

So, what would the statements of First person, Second person, and Third person be represented as?\nAnswers are formatted as [[ ];[ ];[ ]]. Each bracketed section should contain the corresponding logical expression for each individual statement.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To represent the statements of the first, second, and third persons according to the given propositions (p for Suzhou, q for Shanghai, and r for Hangzhou), we can symbolize each statement according to the logic symbols provided.\n\n1. First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!p & q`.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & p`.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - Since exactly one among `p, q, r` is true, and according to the statement the person is claiming that it is neither `q` nor `r` (Shanghai nor Hangzhou). Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true. Hence, a fuller consideration of the third statement in the context of one of them being true will convert to `p | r`, thus `p` stands for the correct place if `q` and `r` are false. Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1. First person: `!p & q`.\n2. Second person: `!q & p`.\n3. Third person based on the true proposition condition, `p | r` valid stating `!q & !r` by negation and condition yielding directly `p`.\n\nThus, the logical expressions are properly represented as `[!p & q; !q & p; !q & !r]`.\n\nBut based on simple proposition directly true condition understanding:\n- First person's statement truth condition under general is `[!p & q]`.\n- Second person's statement truth condition under general is `[!q & p]`.\n- Third person's proper derivation in context is directly `[p]` considering true only condition.\n\nGiven this observed format and context, the\uad04\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc0bc\ub2e8\ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc790. \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8, \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8, \uc138\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc740 \uac01\uac01 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4:\n\n- \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc218\ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc654\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!p & q`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n- \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uc218\ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc654\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!q & p`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n- \uc138\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\ub3c4 \uc548\uac00\uace0 \ud56d\uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc548\uac14\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!q & !r`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc655 \uad50\uc218\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\ucc3d \ucd9c\uc2e0\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 `p`\ub85c \ud45c\uae30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \uac01 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc2ec\ubc8c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba74, \uadf8 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: `[!p & q; !q & p; p]`.\n\n\uc774 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uac01 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \ub9d0\ud55c \uac83\uacfc \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}

The answer format should be:\n[[C1=...];[C2=...];[C3=...];[D1=...];[D2=...];[D3=...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To define the logical expressions for the statements made by Person B and Person C, and to ensure that exactly one of p, q, r is true (and the other two are false), we need to follow the given logical rules and format. Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

Simplifies to false.\n   \n4. **B2&C3&D1**\n   - B2 stands for `(!p&!q)|(p&q)`, Person A's statement partially correct.\n   - C3 stands for `!p&q`, Person B's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - D1 stands for `!q&!r`, Person C's statement entirely correct.\n   \n   Thus, `((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (!p&q) & (!q&!r)`\n   \n   Again, `!q` contradicts any further valid segment unless isolated `p&!q` condition fits though fundamentally `!q&q` nullifies any combination.\n\n5. **B3&C1&D2**\n   - B3 stands for `p&!q`, Person A's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - C1 stands for `p&!q`, Person B's statement entirely correct.\n   - D2 stands for `(!q&r)|(q&!r)`, person C's statement partially correct.\n   \n   Thus, `(p&!q) & (p&!q) & (((!q&r) | (q&!r)))`\n   \n   Creates contradiction of `!q` not allowing simultaneous `p&q`, fundamentally false.\n   \n6. **B3&C2&D1**\n   - B3 stands for `p&!q`, Person A's statement entirely incorrect.\n   - C2 stands for `(!p&!q)|(p&q)`, Person B's statement partially correct.\n   - D1 stands for `!q&!r`, Person C's statement entirely correct.\n   \n   Thus, `(p&!q) & (((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (!q&!r))`\n   \n   Clearly `!q` won\u2019t allow `p&!q` while finding common `q` contradicting further.\n\n#### Final E expression:\nGiven the logical expressions directly lead to contradictions or distinctly false without valid overlaps, `E` by augmentation clarifies `0` representing false scenarios.\n\n### Final Simplified Expressions:\n```\n[[B1&C2&D3 ::=:: 0];[B1&C3&D2 ::=:: 0];[B2&C1&D3 ::=:: 0];[B2&C3&D1 ::=:: 0];[B3&C1&D2 ::=:: 0];[B3&C2&D1 ::=:: 0];[E ::=:: 0]]\n```\n\nWhere `0` denotes `False` in the context of the logical problem's framework."}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify which of the three statements (from Person A, Person B, or Person C) correspond to the completely correct, partially correct, and entirely incorrect categories based on the provided logical expression. According to the final simplified logical expression,\n\n\\[ E ::=:: (!p \\& q \\& !r) | (p \\& !q \\& r) \\]\n\nwe can derive the truth value of statements from p, q, and r given the condition that exactly one of them is true (and we have a binary choice for the true statement).\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( !p \\& q \\& !r \\)\n   - This case is true if Professor Wang is from Shanghai (\\(q\\)) and not from Suzhou (\\(p\\)) and not from Hangzhou (\\(r\\)).\n   - In this condition, Person A's statement `(!p & q)` is entirely correct, Person B's statement `(p & !q)` is entirely incorrect, and Person C's statement `(!q & !r)` is partially correct.\n   - Therefore, in this case: **[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: B]**.\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( p \\& !q \\& r \\)\n   - This case results in Professor Wang being from Hangzhou (\\(r\\)), not from Suzhou (\\(p\\)), and not from Shanghai (\\(q\\)).\n   - In this condition, Person C's statement `(!q & !r)` is entirely incorrect, Person B's statement `(p & !q)` is partially correct, and Person A's statement `(!p & q)` is entirely incorrect.\n   - Therefore, in this case: **[Hangzhou]; [entirely incorrect: A]; [partially correct: B]; [entirely incorrect: C]**, which is logically incorrect as per the formulated conditions and Professor's remark. Thus, option (2) can be invalidated considering only one person is entirely incorrect and one is partly incorrect.\n\nGiven these two case analyses, only Case 1 satisfies the conditions Professor Wang gave that \"one of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\n\nThus, the chosen answer format is:\n\n**[[Shanghai]; [entirely correct: A]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: B]]**."}

We aim to identify the paired disjunctive terms and their representation according to the defined rules.\n\n1. **Identifying the Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - For \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment matches the binary 111 (hexadecimal 7), which does not directly correspond to a specific paired disjunctive term \\(M7\\). However, this is part of our conjunction, so we focus on the entire disjunction's impacting truth assignments, guided by the conjunction with \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\).\n    - For \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment mirrors the binary 101 (hexadecimal 5), leading to the term \\(M5\\).\n\n2. **Conjunction Analysis:**\n    - The conjunction of two disjunctions essentially means that the overall disjunction must satisfy the conditions of both disjunctions simultaneously. Given that both disjunctive forms have \\(r\\) as a constant variable, ensuring \\(r=1\\) is vital to satisfy the structure of each individual disjunct.\n    - The logical implication reduces our focus to the arrangement satisfying both cases, hence considering truth assignments aligning r=1.\n    - Truth assignments satisfying \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\wedge(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\) would yield the stable falsification intrinsic with \\(\\neg q\\) as a common link. Therefore, the fixed \\(r=1\\) and critical point is in \\(p, q\\), yielding the necessary term thorough specifically encompassing disjunctive falsification in combined leverage.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant falsifying assignment combining all constraints mainly concluding the essential truth adjusted alignment:\n- Focus on \\(\\neg q \\wedge r=1\\) determining primary falsifying boundaries for logic effective: \\(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q\\) simplifies likely to primary falsifying \\(5,7\\).\n\n3. **Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - The falsifying set through logical impact of \\(p, q\\) in conjunction core \\(M5, M7\\) remains significant.\n\n4. **Denotation:**\n    - Application of the notation rules, the principal disjunctive normal form incorporating the combined falsifying term ultimately matches such indications precisely:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5 + M7]] \\]\n\nHence, summarizing, we denote the expression as:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5, M7]] \\]"}

Each disjunction contains propositions and their negations. In fact, if we rewrite the formula, we see that it\u2019s already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses (disjunctions).\n\nGiven the definition provided, however, we have to confirm whether the given formula can be part of a PCNF or PDNF. A principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) is a disjunction of all paired conjunctive terms, while a principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) consists of all paired disjunctive terms.\n\nUpon examination, the given formula is:\n\\[\n(p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly in conjunctive normal form (CNF) because it is a conjunction of disjunctions. The question now is to determine if it can be represented as a PCNF.\n\n**Step 3: Check if this formula fits the PCNF criteria.**\n\nThe formula given \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) needs to be examined against the specifications of PCNF.

But the next question is to check if this represents every possible paired conjunctive term (the correct term would be disjunctive in this case based on the structure of PCNF).\n\nThis particular formula seems to cover a set of clauses that do not constitute all possible disjunctive terms required to represent a complete PCNF for three variables (p, q, r) which would require all possible combinations and closures (or openings) of these variables to cover all cases.\n\nSince \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) does not form all possible clauses for three variables \\( (p, q, r) \\), and strictly following the specified rule, it does not meet the definition of a PCNF as it does not cover every situation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if it can be denoted in the described form.**\n\nGiven the analysis, since the formula does not cover all paired disjunctive terms for a full PCNF of three variables, it does not fit the full PCNF criteria.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[B]}\n\\]"}

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, what should it be denoted as if it is both a tautology and a basic form? The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, and since it's both a tautology and a basic formula, it means that all the paired conjunctive terms and also includes the term m0 should be present in its principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF).\n\nSince it is a tautology, all 2^n = 2^4 = 16 possible paired conjunctive terms must be included. As it is also a basic formula, it specifically must include the m0 term.\n\nTherefore, in the context provided by the question, a tautology that also includes m0 is the full expression of all possible truth assignments for 4 variables (which is the definition of a tautology itself) and doesn't impose additional restrictions beyond those for a tautology since m0 is necessarily present in the PDNF of any formula that is a basic formula (and is included already as part of the full set).\n\nSo, the formula should be denoted as a tautology, and the specific additional condition of being a basic formula (including m0) doesn't change the notation made for a tautology since it is implicit in the definition of a tautology in terms of containing all possible m terms.\n\nThe answer format is [[]], so the answer is:\n\n[[Tautology]]\n\nHowever, strictly adhering to the format of the provided example for denoting special types of formulas based on the included indices, we recognize there's no need to list each m term explicitly but to denote its class if possible by the given specification. Since no specific additional symbol or style is provided beyond the basic classifications, and considering we adhere to the notation norms given, the most precise answer should embody both conditions succinctly within this context:\n\n[[Tautology & Basic]]\n\nOr more specifically to the format used in the instruction and the identification of a class that fits both the described conditions exactly as qualified in the rule, the strict compliant answer emphasizing the identity could be denoted as:\n[[Tautology]]\n\nSince the more detailed classification beyond tautology is implicitly contained in the broader category through rule definition for m0 conditions, the final answer, compliant to the format request, is:\n\n[[Tautology]]"}

In the context of the question, this means that the formula must be true for the binary assignment 0000 (which corresponds to hexadecimal 0).\n\nFor A to also be an all-even formula, all the paired conjunctive terms in its principal disjunctive normal form must have even indices (in hexadecimal), which means the binary representation of these indices must end in 0.\n\nGiven that there are 16 (2^4) possible truth assignments for 4 propositional variables, the even hexadecimal numbers in this range are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A (10), C (12), and E (14) in hexadecimal, corresponding to binary numbers ending in 0. There are 8 such even hexadecimal numbers.\n\nHowever, since we already know one of those terms must be *m0* for the formula to be a basic form, there is only one way to select *m0* and the rest of the 7 even terms must all be included in the formula to maintain the all-even property. That means there is only one unique formula that satisfies both being a basic form and an all-even form with the given conditions.\n\nThus, the answer is [[1]]."}

Since neither q nor \u00acq cancel out directly with another term containing its complement, these do not resolve to 0.\n- Now consider (q \u2228 \u00acr) and (q \u2228 r).

Both resolutions remove q, and thus, we are left with p.\n\nThis final resolution with p \u2228 p = p (trivial) implies no new results, just a normalizing effect.\n\nAfter a second cycle:\n- We see S2 is empty, leading to \"Plausible\" output.\n\nSo, the algorithm iterates:\n\n- First cycle resolves adding q, leading to a second cycle.\n- Second cycle resolves immediately to empty set S2.\n\nHence, the answer is [[Plausible]; [2]]."}

Since the format requires the use of 0-ary predicates, we treat 2 and 4 as specific instances that do not apply in a general sense through individual variables x and directly state their properties.\n\n(1) Since 2 is the only prime number in this context, we should somehow express that any entity x which is a prime (F(x)) is actually 2 (interpreted as a specific condition for 0-ary predicates). However, in order to adhere strictly to the instruction and using 0-ary predicates directly, we can symbolize F(2) as \"2 is a prime number\" and \u223cF(4) as \"4 is not a prime number\" (since 4 being a composite number implies it is not prime). Given that the format asks for 0-ary predicates, we also need to explicitly address 4 as composite:\n\nF(2) and \u223cF(4)\n\nSince the format specifically asks for the use of 0-ary predicates for each statement without involving variables directly for the final representation, we will omit generic quantifier representation here and represent each property directly for 2 and 4.\n\nFor the second part of the question, where we symbolize \"If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6\" using the binary predicate G(x, y): x > y, we can directly apply the provided predicate to 0-ary values:\n\n(2) We directly use G(5, 4) to represent \"5 is greater than 4\" and G(4, 6) to denote \"4 is greater than 6\".

So it's equivalent to [1].\n- Thus, it translates to SAP.\n\n[4] Some products are unqualified.\n- Particular Negative (O): SOP.\n\nNow, let's examine the relationships as per the given guide:\n- [1] and [2] have * relation, as they are A and E, respectively. One is true if the other is false, and vice versa.\n- [1] and [3] are both SAP (Universal Affirmatives), meaning they're saying the same thing in different ways. Since they are logically equivalent and identical, they have a direct relationship, indicating they support each other in being true.\n- [3] and [4] seem to contradict each other at first glance since [3] (all products are qualified) and [4] (some products are unqualified) do not align; however, if looking strictly by the given classification rules and upon understanding [3] as SAP equivalent, they follow the % relation, where a universal proposition (SAP in [3]) being true means the particular (O in [4]) may be false. Conversely, if [4] is true, [3] must be false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is [[A];[A];[B]], as [1] and [2] have a clear relationship, [1] and [3] are identical and must have a relationship, while [3] and [4] do not have a direct contradictory relationship as per % relation but aren't guaranteed to directly follow as in * or # relation. Hence [3] and [4], when strictly queried for direct \"agreeing\" or \"disagreeing\" relationship, skew towards being separate, indicated by [B]."}

Its logical form is \"All S are P\".\n\n[2] \"All products are unqualified\" can be seen as a universal affirmative (A) proposition but regarding a contradictory property to the first statement, logically formulated as \"All S are not P\". However, the standard form for such a statement in formal logic would rather be understood as directly contradictory to [1]. Thus, it is better interpreted here as a universal negative (E) proposition, SEP.\n\nGiven that [1] and [2] present mutually exclusive conditions about whether all products are qualified or unqualified, this relationship falls under the category of contradictory propositions which cannot both be true or both be false at the same time. This is identified as a * relationship.\n\nFor [3] \"No products are unqualified\", this is a universal negative (E) proposition, SEP.\n\n[4] \"Some products are unqualified\", this is a particular affirmative (I) proposition but on the contrary, it's \"Some S are not P\" in the direct logic interpretation, which matches the particular negative (O) proposition, SOP.\n\nSince [3] and [4] contradict each other, if no products are unqualified (E proposition), some products being unqualified cannot be true (O proposition). This relationship is also identified as a * relationship.\n\nTherefore, the relations are as follows:\n[[A];[A]] = [[*];[*]] = [A;A]\n\nHowever, to exactly match the instructions and the provided logic types based on the given options:\n\n- Relationship between [1] and [2] is # (since they are A and E directly contradictory).\n- Relationship between [3] and [4] is * (since one being true means the other is false).\n\nSo, the precise answer should be formatted as follows:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

However, because SIP (Some S are P) could potentially include all S, making SAP or SEP impossible to definitively infer based on SIP alone.\n- If SIP is false, it doesn't necessarily mean SEP is true, as SIP and SEP do not have a direct contradictory relationship.\n- If SOP is false, this means no S are not P, aligning with SAP being true and making the relationship consistent or confirming the * relation again.\n\nFor SIP (Some S are P):\n- If SIP is true, SEP (No S are P) is false because SIP and SEP are in the * relation, meaning one being true necessarily makes the other false.\n- If SIP is false, then SEP may be true, as SIP being false doesn't provide information on whether SEP must be false as well, but it's possible for SEP to be true if all S are not P.\n- If SOP is false (No S are not P), this fits with SAP being true, which negates SEP, given that SOP being false implies all S are P (either by SAP being true or I being false since SAP trumps SIP).\n\nBased on the above logical reasoning, the answers follow:\n- If SAP is true, SOP must be false.\n- If SIP is true, SEP must be false.\n- If SIP is false, SEP may be true but is not necessarily so.\n- If SOP is false, SAP must be true.\n\nGiven the need to respond according to the format requested, we note that for the last two conditions, we can only firmly confirm based on the truth of one making the other true, while a false doesn't provide deterministic information about negation:\n\n[[false];[false];[true];[true]]\n\nHowever, since the third condition asks about the possibility but not certainty of the SEP being true (which may vary based on broader context), strictly following the format:\n[[false];[false];[true];[true]]\nreflects the clear propositional logic as given directly, with the understanding the third one considers an \"if-false\" scenario that's not strictly confined to a binary output here."}

If the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is false, then the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is what?\n   - When \"Some S are P\" is false, it means no S are P. Therefore, the possibility that \"Some S are not P\" must be true, but not necessarily absolute. Since SIP is contradictory to the situation where there's no S with property P (which is equivalent to SEP), SAP being true (all S are P) would make SOP necessary, but SIP denies the mere existence of such S:P pair, which generally makes SOP true based on quantifier logic where at least some S are indeed not in the category of P when S entirely fits in only P or exactly none (due to SIP denying the possibility any are).\n\n2. If the proposition SOP (Some S are not P) is false, then the proposition SIP (Some S are P) is what?\n   - If \"Some S are not P\" is false, it implies that no S is not P, meaning all S are P, which is in line with the universal affirmative proposition (SAP). However, in terms of SIP, merely because there's no S not belonging to P doesn't mean some of S necessarily belong; this could still indicate all do, based on SAP not simply SIP. So in negation certainty, it tends toward SIP being false because false SOP directly implies without doubt SAP is true, thus addressing none being not P incorporates all being P without a partial positive claim (SIP).\n\n3. If the proposition SAP (All S are P) is true, then the proposition SEP (No S are P) is what?\n   - If \"All S are P\" is true, then \"No S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, the answer here is false. SAP and SEP are contraries but if SAP is true, SEP has no middle ground (none of S being P at all if all actively defined so), making it a false proposition.\n\n4. If the proposition SEP (No S are P) is true, then the proposition SAP (All S are P) is what?\n   - If \"No S are P\" is true, then \"All S are P\" cannot be true. Thus, SAP is false as it directly contravenes SEP.\n\nTherefore, considering the specific truth-values based on provided relationships and the direct negation/intent of universal and particular propositions' implications:\n\n[[true];[false];[false];[false]]\n\nThis conclusion adheres to the given rules and logical forms specified."}

Conversion: Exchange the subject and predicate to get \"All not-upright and not-open are not true revolutionaries\".\n\nHowever, to match the exact phrase \"All people who are not upright and open\", we can interpret the obversion as turning into the contrary, and simplifying the statement to reflect the original meaning after conversion.

We are told that \"p\" denotes \"Science is a human endeavour.\"\n\nThe phrase \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" indicates the negation of science being solely dependent on one person. In terms of our proposition \"p,\" this means negating the scenario where science is a human endeavour but is confined to only one man. In modal logic, this can be translated into \"It is necessary that science is not solely a one-man endeavour.\"\n\nHowever, the given problem can be simplified to \"It is not the case that science is a one-man endeavour,\" which we can translate directly. If \"p\" is \"Science is a human endeavour,\" then \"science is a one-man endeavour\" implies \"science is a human endeavour and limited to one person.\" But given our limited vocabulary and the direct nature of the question, we simply need to express \"science cannot be a one-man endeavour,\" as a negation.\n\nBut since we are looking for the necessity that it \"cannot\" be one person, we are looking to express the necessity of the negation here. Therefore, we are looking for the necessity of the negation of \"p.\"\n\nUsing the symbol for necessity (#), the translation of the statement \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" in terms of \"p\" is:\n\n\\[ #\u00acp \\]\n\nThus, the answer in the specified format is:\n\n\\[ [#\u00acp] \\]"}

The inference \"Arrogance cannot possibly not result in falling behind\" can be symbolized as $!q \u2192 !p, but more closely aligns with being a direct transformation of the necessity to a specific form of impossibility, which directly corresponds to formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p once we correctly map the logical flow and understand that the negation and modal transformations align with turning necessity into a form that denies the possibility of the negation directly resulting. However, according to the specific inference asked from the given statement to the conclusion, the exact formula being matched directly in the modal logic inference formulas provided is #p \u2192 $p, which is formula (9). The interpretation of the contrapositive or the direct modal transformation through negation and possibility as asked closely maps to an understanding encompassed by these semantics but formula (5) represents a core deducible step in modal transformations aligning to this form of inference from necessity to possibility of the original proposition. Therefore, considering the exact logical operation matching the inference in terms provided and the underlining modal transformation principles, [[5]] is indicated by the closest modal implication providing necessary to double negation of possibility transformation relevance as asked."}

This implies that it's not necessary for a person to pull their own hair and leave the earth at the same time, which aligns with the modal logic inference formula (5) #p \u2192 !#!p. Since we negate the necessity, the formula is applied in its direct form, indicating that if something is not necessarily true (#p \u2192 !#!p), it can infer that it's not necessarily necessarily true, which closely corresponds to the given inference.

According to the truth modal reasoning formula 16, which states that !p \u2192 $!p, if Team A did not win the championship, then it follows that Team A might not have won the championship (or more accurately in this context, it is possible that Team A did not win the championship, which aligns with the fact that they did not win).\n\nHowever, the formulation here implies a reflection of the situation using modal logic: it confirms the given situation while aligning with one of the answer choices by identifying that based on the given fact, it is stated in a possible modality, which is closest to the wording in option D \"Team A might not have won the championship\" but more precisely it confirms the given negation as a possibility.\n\nGiven the options and the direct translation of the modal logic formula, the answer should reflect a corresponding possibility statement.\n\nThe closest answer to the formulation of possible outcomes in modal logic is:\n\n[[D]]"}

Based on the normative reasoning formulas provided, formula (3) \u00a7p\u2190\u2192\u00ac\u203e!p captures the biconditional relationship between being allowed and not being prohibited, which directly corresponds to the given statement. Since the statement works in both directions (from being allowed to not being prohibited, and vice versa), this corresponds to the biconditional nature captured by formula (10) \u203dp\u2192\u00a7\u00acp when appropriately inverted and interpreted, leading us to conclude that the relationship follows formula (10) directly when reinterpreted as the inverse formulation, but primarily matches the bidirectional reasoning as governed by formula (3) in its core logic. However, since the question specifically asks which given formula it corresponds to directly and based on the provided list, the closest and most direct match for the bidirectional relationship described is captured in the structure of (10). Therefore, the answer corresponds to one formula, which is [[10]]."}

Specifically, \"It is not true that Xiao Lin will never win\" can be understood as a negation that overcomes the never, thus leaving us with a positive statement about the future - \"Xiao Lin will win\". Since we're dealing with the negation structure, in terms of time relations, this takes the form of \"\u00acG\u00acp\", which by formula (16) is equivalent to \"Fp\".\n\nTherefore, for the first pair, we're dealing with \"Fp\" and \"Fp\", which, however, was not directly included in the given relationships but follows the logic implied by relationship (3) \u26ad, as it states that \"Fp and F\u00acp cannot both be false.\" The direct application here can be tricky, as it implies a self-relation that is true by the \u26ad rule, meaning it can both be true.\n\n(2) For \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\", we denote this as \"Gp\", a future period statement.\nFor \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\", which is more about a future point in time, we denote this as \"Fp\".\n\nLooking at the relationships defined:\n- The pair \"Gp and Fp\" fits the description of the fourth relationship (4) \u2042 which allows both statements to either be true or false simultaneously.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(1) The first pair (Fp \u2194 Fp) falls under the \u26ad Relationship as they can both be true (as per (3)).\n(2) The second pair (Gp \u2194 Fp) fits the \u2042 Relationship as per rule (4).\n\nFinal Answer: [[C];[D]]"}

In other words, for `[ c ]\u03c6` to hold true, the resource limitation `R` must be satisfied along with the requirement that executing `c` will inevitably result in `\u03c6` being true. Thus, the correct answer is H."}

It is observed that multiple work areas showed ground subsidence, but these areas had varying conditions such as layout of workplaces and geographical conditions. The only common factor was the presence of a higher concentration of textiles, with associated high numbers of deep wells and underground water usage. Different cases (A, B, C, etc.) represented different workplace conditions where subsidence (P) occurred in all despite the variance in other conditions, leading to an inferred causal connection between the higher concentration of textiles and the subsidence. This pattern fits the description given in Method \u2e2e, suggesting that S (a higher concentration of textiles) may have a causal relationship with P (ground subsidence)."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The causal derivation described in the passage corresponds to the identification of an unexpected outcome after the removal of a known factor (uranium in this case), leading to the discovery of another factor (the radioactive element radium or polonium) contributing to the observed phenomenon (radioactivity).

According to the U-Generalization Rule (symbolized as `U(A, n)` where `n` is the sample size), if all individuals in the sample possess attribute `A` (getting an A in this case), we can infer that all individuals in the population (the whole class) may also possess that attribute.\n\nAlthough the U-Generalization Rule strictly states an inference that all individuals in the population might possess the attribute if the sample shows it, the question asks for an estimation of the proportion. If we follow the rule's strict interpretation, the proportion would be 100%.\n\nTherefore, if we apply the U-Generalization Rule to this case, we estimate that all 50 students in the class would get an A. Thus, the proportion is [[100%]]."}

However, the inference seems to take a leap rather than following the minimal revealing of information.\n\n- C! Principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions for communication clarity unless necessary due to specific reasons. The straightforward nature of the original statement and its inference doesn't directly suggest complex or marked expression use.\n\nBased on the provided principles and given sentence, this seems not to conform directly to any of the principles as specified in a clear manner. However, the question appears to expect a categorization. Given that the minimalization criterion could suggest a slight relationship with C% due to the statement involving the minimal information \"the beer is warm,\" but ultimately expanding the definition of what \"food\" is, the closest alignment would be with the principle that aims for clarity and relevancy of information conveyed rather than a direct inference jump. \n\nStill, considering options and the alignment that could loosely frame the minimal informativity of the statement, the answer should be considered in terms of the closest logical fit within provided constraints. For the sake of the answer request format:\n\n[[B]]\n\nHowever, it must be noted that this is more of a case of fitting within the options given loosely rather than a direct, unambiguous application of any principle as described."}

In the scenario described, one might infer that the \"mother\" is indeed the \"baby's mother,\" but this inference is based on the hearer's assumptions and expanded understanding beyond what is explicitly stated to infer a likely relationship rather than on the form of the sentence itself or any specific linguistic criterion related to the principle structure provided.\n\nGiven the described principles:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle focuses more on the limitation of information inferred from what is known by the speaker and not weakening information. The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate.

Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nThe given definition explains the existing usage of the term \"Internet\" by providing information about its origin as a transliteration and partial translation of the English term \"Internet.\" This aligns with the characteristics of an \u2135 Definition, which reports on the existing usage of the defined term."}
