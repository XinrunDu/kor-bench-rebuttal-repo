Subtract the second modified equation from the first modified equation:\n    \\[\n    (21x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 60 - 26\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    17x = 34\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{34}{17}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    x = 2\n    \\]\n\n4. Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into \\(7x + 2y = 20\\):\n    \\[\n    7(2) + 2y = 20\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    14 + 2y = 20\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    2y = 6\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    y = 3\n    \\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n[[x=2,y=3]]\n\\]"}

The average = (2 + 4 + 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4. This is not 5.\n2. **If X = 0**, the even numbers between 0 and 6 are 0, 2, 4, and 6. The average = (0 + 2 + 4 + 6) / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3.

This matches our required average.\n\nTherefore, one solution is that X=4.\n\nConsidering all possible numbers lower than 6 in a similar pattern, since 4 worked, numbers lower than 4 will likely reduce the set back to ones whose average won’t meet or exceed 5 (unless we go negative, but the average would not then fit since we would then involve more non-conforming negative evens to keep it centered around possibly an even higher range).\n\nNo other X other than 4 from our deductions fits this perfectly within the stipulated operation range approach for getting an even number set centered around values that will give an average exactly of 5.\n\nThus, the only fitting answer is:\n[[4]]"}

No other symbols are allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the equation (5 $ X)×(2 § 6) = 30, we first need to work through the operations defined:\n\n- The \"§\" operation takes the larger of the two numbers, so 2 § 6 equals 6.\n- The \"$\" operation takes the smaller of the two numbers, so 5 $ X will depend on the value of X.\n\nGiven this, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(5 $ X) × 6 = 30\n\nTo find the value of (5 $ X), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n5 $ X = 30 / 6 = 5\n\nSince the operation \"$\" means to select the smaller number, and we know the result of the operation is 5, X must be larger or equal to 5 for the smaller number between 5 and X to be 5. If X were less than 5, then the operation would result in X, not 5.\n\nTherefore, X must satisfy the condition:\n\n[[X ≥ 5]]"}

We are essentially solving for X in (3¥X)¥6=-1.\n\nFirst, let's define an intermediate result Y where Y = 3¥X. The equation becomes Y¥6=-1. We can use the operation a¥b to express this as Y^6 - 6^Y = -1.\n\nTo find X, we need to find a Y first that satisfies this equation before reversing the steps to find X from Y=3¥X=a^b-b^a for a=3 and some positive integer b=X.\n\nTesting values for Y:\n- If Y=5, then 5^6 - 6^5 = 15625 - 7776 = 7849, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=4, then 4^6 - 6^4 = 4096 - 1296 = 2800, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=3, then 3^6 - 6^3 = 729 - 216 = 513, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=2, then 2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=1, then 1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5, which does not equal -1.\n- If Y=0, then 0^6 - 6^0 = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nSo, Y = 0 satisfies Y¥6 = -1.\n\nNext, we need to find X where Y = 3¥X = 0. Using the operation, this means:\n3^X - X^3 = 0.\n\nSolving 3^X - X^3 = 0:\n- If X=3, then 3^3 - 3^3 = 27 - 27 = 0, which satisfies the equation.\n\nTherefore, X = 3 is the solution.\n\n[[3]]"}
