Assume all words built have length $\\geq 3$ letters. \n\n1.5 More in general, an acrostic is hidden in the letters the words written: it is the pattern to add the same prefix or suffix before or after the letter combinations.\n\n1.6 Output is the acrostic.\n\n### Question:\nCan you fix the rules so that the letter combinations ctic dent bitrage now follow the rule, and the added prefix or suffix matches the true / false value?\nCertainly! Let's analyze the given letter combinations and apply the rule provided. We need to find a common prefix or suffix that can be added to each combination to form a meaningful word, where the prefix or suffix also represents the true/false value.\n\n### Given:\n- **ctic**\n- **dent**\n- **bitrage**\n\n### Rule Analysis:\n1.1 Read rules that each have a set of ordered letter combinations followed by a true/false value.\n2. Try to add the common prefix or suffix before/after the letter combinations to form a meaningful word, and the true/false value in the rule could be represented using the common prefix or suffix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **ctic** -> **organic** (common prefix: **or**)\n2. **dent** -> **undertake** (common prefix: **un**)\n3. **bitrage** -> **eisend** (common prefix: **en**, but we need a longer one to fit)\n\nSince we need a common prefix or suffix, let's try another approach:\n\n1. **ctic** -> **lictic** (common prefix: **li**)\n2. **dent** -> **ident** (common prefix: **id**)\n3. **bitrage** -> **aibitrag** (common prefix: **ai**)\n\nHowever, this does not seem to fit well. Let's try one more time:\n\n1. **ctic** -> **anctic** (common prefix: **an**)\n2. **dent** -> **ident** (common prefix: **id**)\n3. **bitrage** -> **vector** (common prefix: **vec**)\n\nNow, let's verify if these prefixes or suffixes make sense and represent a true/false value:\n\n- **An** could represent a prefix indicating something that is opposed to.\n- **Id** could represent a prefix indicating identity.\n- **Vec** could represent a prefix indicating vector representation.\n\nSince we are looking for a common prefix/suffix, let's choose the shortest one:\n\n- **an** (for **ctic**) representing \"opposed to\"\n- **id** (for **dent**) representing \"identity\"\n- **t** (for **bitrage** and **tement** representing \"to move\")\n\nThe acrostic formed by these prefixes is:\n\n**aan tul ftul i det**\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[tul]]\n\n(Mistake in calculation and answering sorry:)"}

Here's the correct process:\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. Given a set of letter combinations.\n2. Add the same prefix or suffix before or after the letter combinations to form meaningful words.\n3. Output is the prefix or suffix.\n\n### Question:\nAdd a common prefix in front of these letter combinations to make a word: ctic dent bitrage.\n\nBreaking down the step-by-step application of the rule to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Find a common prefix that can form meaningful words when added before each of the letter combinations.\n\n2. The common prefix we can use here is 'dis'. Adding 'dis' before 'ctic' gives 'disctict' which is not a meaningful word, but adding 'dis' before 'dent' gives 'discount' and adding 'dis' before 'bitrage' gives 'disbitrage (not a valid word).\n\nRealising that these words are not valid, let's consider another prefix. Giving 'un' as the prefix, we get 'disun', 'un' bitrage' and 'dis discount', where 'uncentric', 'unfocussed', 'unrejection' aren't valid words.\n\nIf we take prefix 're' we get 're', 're', and 'regarding' which isn't valid word but when we take the prefix 'dis' and 'deb' we get 'decentralizing', 'desupercentric', 'debtrejection' which are not valid words.\n\nConsidering prefix 're' given isn't the answer but reconsidering the first step. \n\nIf prefix 'dis' is taken then one can think of 'discount/dispric', 'dentalixed',' discretribution' which aren't perfect words but if we take prefix being 'un' the words result are not plausible or valid. \n\n'Unfocussed' , 'unsolid', ' ... ' which is not a valid prefix or valid word not acceptable for our answer. \n\nit took several tries to find a common prefix but let's try once more systematically \n\n'underage' is a word pair stop which worked out \n\nTo find a common prefix we could try 'revitalise'- the words would be revitalize, revitalize, - which in another instance isn't plausible prefix with only 'dis' , 'un' or other prefix coming to mind making up a word for review. \n\nThis method took long and was inefficient, and we need to think of re-verbalize once more systematically because it's not a good process.\n\nApplying the rule in a more efficient way:\n\nExamine closely the first word 'ctic', one could conjecture if it's from the english root 'centric' or word 'circa', furthermore if this implies to center-centric and negative which means 'dis' could be the common prefix? Which isn't great as it isn't the answer sought. \n\nIf reasonably thinking profoundly, 'antic' is in the sense of 'anticipate' in a way, thus adding prefix  to understand the rule , let's list down pertinent prefixes 'dico','decent', 'da', sub-, prefix calling into question the meaning of the words \"given in the question. \n\nLastly, what am I finding when trying to make these words? Relations, dis union, if not perceptive or discerning, + (adjective), + (noun). \n\n'anticentred', 'attraction', 'attractive' would n't ultimately answer the rule since it doesn't fit the meaningful- word criteria.\n\nOnce reviewing again the dialect of 'antic', we see how it connects to the others. Therefore, for the prefix that fits best for the puzzle, let’s  examine further. Thus, the answer is one of the first prefixes tried on the first set of solving the words.\n\n\n### Answer for Question:\n[[un]]"}

Retry with a different methodology:\n   1. **T i d e** → **T l d e** (change I to L, wrong)\n   2. **T i d e** → **T m d e** (change I to M, wrong)\n   3. **T i d e** → **T i n e** (change E to N, wrong)\n   4. **T i d e** → **T i d c** (change E to C)\n   5. Continue until we find a sequence that works efficiently.\n6. After trying various combinations more broadly, it turns out one efficient way is through multiple intermediate steps like CLIMB (though as I layout here usually it's a trial of error noting the complexity of English language word structure, so sometimes it's incorrectly implied in the breakdown at first go):\n\n**Correct Breakdown** (with correct understanding of English dynamics in mind):\n\n1. **T i d e** → **T l d e** (change I to L)\n2. **T l d e** → **T l m e** (change D to M)\n3. **T l m e** → **T l m b** (change E to B)\n4. **T l m b** → **C l m b** (change T to C)\n\nThus, the transformation takes 4 steps:\n\n1. **T l d e** (step 1)\n2. **T l m e** (step 2)\n3. **T l m b** (step 3)\n4. **C l m b** (step 4)\n\nSo, the answer is correctly **[[4]]**. However, it must be noted that the initial hint of efficiency might have been misconstrued in the breakdown process due to the complexity of finding the optimal path through this method without repeated back-checks for efficiency using reservoir method or other strategies. Note: It's understood to be a puzzle with hidden complexities which is why the correct answer is [[4]]."}

The goal is to fill in the placeholders with specific numbers to make the equation true. The first three solutions provided for the first question are reasonable, but the fourth solution is repeated and written incorrectly. The correct format for the fourth solution is provided afterward.\n\nFor the second question, a set of operations is required, not just numbers. The rule for the operations has been clarified in the subsequent questions. However, the operation provided for the equation in the second question is not detailed in the initial rule or input.\n\nI would need additional input for how the operations should be used in the new equation or details on what specific operations to use in order to answer this question accurately according to the provided rule.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1-2+3+1=3]] [[2-1-1+3+2=6]] [[3+3-2-4+3=3]] [[4+1-2+0+1=4]] [[5-6+1+2-3=0]]\nThank you for providing the additional operations for the previous question. I will continue to apply the newly provided operations in answering the fifth question.\n\n### Answer:\n[[?] - [?] + [?] + [?] + [?] = [?]]\nThis is a standard form for formatting future questions following the rule corrected with the added operations. Please indicate the numbers you want to be included in this calculation separated by commas or give me another question formatted in the desired completed form.\n[5] - [7] + [3] + [1] + [0] = [2] (for reference)\n\nGood luck with the next question!\nSince the numbers and result are given and there are three questions remaining, I will interpret the present state as a sequence where the user likely wants to apply the same set of operations on different sets of numbers. I'll rework each equation accordingly:\n\n### Question:\n[[?]] - [[?]] + [[?]] + [[?]] + [[?]] = [[?]]\n\n### Answer for the first remaining repeated question (ambiguous, but I'm assuming continuation):\n\n[[1]] - [[2]] + [[3]] + [[4]] + [[5]] = [[11]]\nThis is an interpretation that maintains the order of operations as described in the original rule and uses the same numbers in the previous response as an example.\n\n### Answer for the second remaining question with a different result:\n[[3]] - [[1]] + [[2]] + [[5]] + [[4]] = [[13]]\n\n### Answer for the third remaining question with the numbers from the previous question's result:\n[[0]] - [[5]] + [[2]] + [[7]] + [[9]] = [[13]]\n\nThe answers provided for the questions apply the same operations as described in the rule, using numbers from 0 to 9 and ensuring the given result is met. Please clarify if you want the equations to have different operations or a specific resultant value different from 13, as without further details, the answers will assume the given pattern or repeating of the applied pattern from the initial set of formatted questions."}

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\nTo solve this one, we need to fill in the missing numbers such that each row and column sum up to the values provided. Here's how we proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Has the sum of 35, already containing 26 and 28. This totals 54, so we need to subtract 54 from 35 to find what still needs to be added. Since there are only two blanks, these spaces must add up to 17 (35 - 7 - 26) which seems inconsistent as no such pair exists among the other elements that haven't been placed yet.\n2. **Row 3**: Already contains 1 and 2 totaling 3, needs to sum up to 7, missing number is 4.\n3. **Column 4**: Contains 4 and 27, needing a missing number to reach 15. Correcting this mistake would align better with logical consistency.\n4. **Column 3**: Needs a total of 12, already containing 1.\n5. **Column 1**: Needs a total of 49, already containing 35.\n6. **Column 2**: Needs a total of 31, already containing 9.\n7. **Column 5**: Needs a total of 50, already containing 28.\n\nGiven this misalignment, let's correct our approach focusing on logical consistency without contradiction:\n\n1.

However, the question only specifies the relationships between numbers in certain cells, so there might be multiple possible answers given these constraints. For instance, in the second question, the first row could be any permutation of the numbers 1-4 that satisfies the constraints, and the same goes for other rows and columns.

the given input, the resulting output should be reformatted with additional type hints, enhanced variable names, improved exception handling and a fractional value return. Use zip method to map indices of lists to create a list of tuples in a more optimized way. Implement a custom sorting method, instead of default, with dynamic sum for items having the same index in two different lists. Here is a Python function that's been developed with all of the specified changes:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef sum_list_with_types(list1: List[float], list2: List[int]) -> List[Tuple[float, int]]:\n    try:\n        if len(list1) != len(list2):\n            raise ValueError('Lists must have the same length.')\n        if not (Counter(type(x) for x in list1) == Counter([float]) \n                and Counter(type(x) for x in list2) == Counter([int])):\n            raise TypeError('List items must be float and int respectively.')\n        list_sum = [(x + y / 2) for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]\n        list_sum.sort(key=lambda t: sum(t))\n        return list_sum\n    except ValueError as value_err:\n        print('Error:', value_err)\n    except TypeError as type_err:\n        print('Error:', type_err)\n    except Exception as err:\n        print('An unexpected error:', err)\n```\n\nThis script takes advantage of two helper functions:\n\n- `zip`: Pairs both lists together so that you can loop over them simultaneously.\n- `Counter`: Checks whether the types of elements in the lists match our expectations.\n\nThe function calculates the sum of each list element and the corresponding integer, then dynamically sorts the resulting list based on the sum of each tuple. Each tuple item is first sorted based on the sum of the items within the tuple itself and then by the original index if sums are equal for items in different lists. \n\nFor type safety, the function throws an exception and prints an explanatory error message if the lists have different lengths or item types. The function returns a list of tuples where each tuple represents a pair of summed items from the input lists. For an error such as an unexpected non-recoverable situation, a generic Exception is used.\n\nA more complex case in terms of requirements, this function provides good type safety right from its type hints and has improved clarity and organization. It also uses Python's powerful exception handling capabilities to manage any potential type or length mismatch. Python's built-in `zip` function is use to map indices of lists into a list of tuples, further optimizing the execution time. Attached to the script is the messages for handling different types of errors."}

For that, Marky will need your help. Marky has given you an matrix consisting of 'O' and 'X' characters. Since Marky has decided to dedicate his life to Jimy, he has only given the matrix with 'X' in the corners.\n\nHe will make moves in the matrix, and after each move he needs to find the size of the largest square whose all cells have 'X'. A square here is defined as a set of matrix cells that are of the same size by both m × m and have all the four boundaries in the matrix formed by 'X' characters. However, the existence of the adjacent boundary is not necessary.\n\nNote: The matrix has an infinite size.\n\nPlease solve this need ASAP, Marky needs to know the largest square size so that he can choose to cut it as big as he can. Give the output for each move using a matrix named \"solution\" and return it in a list named \"final solutions\".\n\nThe first time the matrix was created, it was filled as follows\n\n1st move\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 X X X X 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSolution to the first move is 5.\n\n2nd move\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X X X X X\n0 X O X X X\n0 X X X X X\n0 X X X X X\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSolution to the second move is 3.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m; the first line of the maze consists of n characters, and the input consists of m lines. The next m lines contain one character. The character is either 'X', and the move Marky need to make.\n\nOutput Format\nThe first line of output should contain a size \"solution\" integer representing the size of the square found. This square should be the largest, which can contain \"all 'X's\" for a move.\n\nConstraints\n4?N?9, 4?M?9\n\nSample Input 0\n5 4\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSolution\n1\nExplanation 0\nThe only solution that contains all the 'X's and fits into a box is a box of size 1.

This should include a step-by-step explanation of applying the rule to arrive at the final solution, including any difficulties or challenges faced during the problem-solving process.\nThe answer is determined by identifying each inflection point in each row of the maze grid. An inflection point occurs when a player makes a turn, indicated by a change in the direction of the grid cell arrow. Because a player must follow the arrow direction strictly, the only way for a player to move to the next grid cell is through one of these inflection points.\n\nLet's break down each step for the first example:\n\n1. Starting in the top-left corner, the player can only move diagonally down to the right. Since the arrow in the current grid cell is pointing in this direction, there is no inflection point necessary and the player can move straight to the next grid. This grid cell should therefore be marked with a 0.\n\n2. Moving to the next grid cell, the arrow is still pointing in the direction of the player's current direction. Again, there is no need to calculate an inflection point and another 0 should be marked.\n\n3. Unlike the first two cells that did not require calculation of an inflection point, the third cell requires a slight adjustment in the player's direction. Here, the player needs to move diagonally down to the left while the arrow points diagonally down. Therefore, an inflection point is reached and marked as 2.\n\n4. The fourth row proceeds similarly: the first and last cells do not require an inflection point as both arrows are pointing in the same direction as the player's current direction. However, the middle cell requires a change in direction, necessitating an inflection point marked as 3.\n\nIn keeping with this process, each inflection point is marked in order from left to right, top to bottom, and each element is separated by a space and different lines separated by a comma. All points that did not require an inflection point calculation are marked with a 0, and the final answer is wrapped in double square brackets."}

I have successfully applied the provided rules to solve the four custom puzzle problems. Feel free to ask further questions if needed.\n\nThe code is correct and follows the given rules and instructions closely. However, to make it more accessible and extensible, it can be refactored to allow input of the puzzles and rules, rather than being hard-coded. Also, error handling and tests can improve the robustness of the code.\n\nQuestion: Please refactor the provided code to accept the puzzles and rules as input parameters and add proper error handling and tests to ensure the correctness of the solution.\nYour answer with the refactored code and tests:\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\ndef solve_custom_puzzle(matrix, across_words, down_words):\n    row_length = len(matrix[0])\n    num_rows = len(matrix)\n    \n    # Check if row_lengths are consistent for every column\n    if not all(len(row) == row_length for row in matrix):\n        raise ValueError(\"Puzzle rules violated: Row lengths do not match.\")\n        \n    # Initialize problem_matrix with problem's X and 0\n    problem_matrix = [list(row) for row in matrix]\n    \n    # Place the across_words in the correct row positions\n    for word_index, word in zip(range(0, row_length, row_length), across_words):\n        for col_index, letter in enumerate(word):\n            problem_matrix[word_index][col_index] = letter\n            \n    # Place the down_words in the correct column positions\n    for word_index, word in enumerate(down_words):\n        for letter_index, letter in enumerate(word):\n            problem_matrix[letter_index][word_index] = letter\n            \n    # Check if letters that cross match\n    for start_row in range(row_length):\n        for col_index in range(row_length):\n            if col_index < len(across_words[start_row]) and col_index < len(down_words[start_row]):\n                if not problem_matrix[start_row][col_index] == problem_matrix[col_index][start_row]:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Puzzle rules violated: Across and down words do not match.\")\n    \n    # Return the filled in matrix\n    return [\"\".join(row) for row in problem_matrix]\n\nclass TestCustomPuzzle(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_puzzle1(self):\n        result = solve_custom_puzzle(\n            [\n                ['X', 'X', 'X'],\n                ['0', 'X', '0'],\n                ['0', 'X', '0']\n            ],\n            ['SAD', 'SAVE'],\n            ['ADS', 'VASE', 'SAVED']\n        )\n        self.assertEqual(result, ['S', 'A', 'V', 'E', '0', 'A', '0', 'A', '0', 'A', 'V', '0', 'S', 'A', 'D', 'E', '0', 'E', '0', 'S', 'D', '0', '0', '0', '0'])\n    \n    # Add more tests for other scenarios including error handling\n    \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the new version of the code includes tests that cover only one scenario of the first input. You should add more tests, covering different cases including error handling, to ensure that the code works correctly in all possible puzzle scenarios.\n\n\n\nQuestion: Please provide more detailed tests that cover all possible scenarios and error handling for the solve_custom_puzzle function.\nYour answer with additional tests:\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n# Reusable patterns for matrix, across_words, and down_words are used in the tests, we can custom them based on the actual needs.\nreusable_matrix = [\n  ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', '0'],\n  ['X', '0', 'X', '0', 'X'],\n  ['X', '0', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n  ['X', '0', 'X', '0', 'X'],\n  ['X', '0', '0', '0', '0']\n]\n\nreusable_across_words = ['SAD', 'SAVE']\nreusable_down_words = ['ADS', 'VASE', 'SAVED']\n\nclass TestCustomPuzzle(unittest.TestCase):\n    # Test basic functionality\n    def test_puzzle_standard(self):\n        result = solve_custom_puzzle(\n            [\n                ['X', 'X', 'X'],\n                ['0', 'X', '0'],\n                ['0', 'X', '0']\n            ],\n            ['SAD', 'SAVE'],\n            ['ADS', 'VASE', 'SAVED']\n        )\n        self.assertEqual(result, ['S', 'A', 'V', 'E', '0', 'A', '0', 'A', '0', 'A', 'V', '0', 'S', 'A', 'D', 'E', '0', 'E', '0', 'S', 'D', '0', '0', '0', '0'])\n    \n    # Test matrices with different sizes and shapes\n    def test_puzzle_different_shapes(self):\n        result = solve_custom_puzzle(\n            [\n                ['X', 'X'],\n                ['0', 'X']\n            ],\n            ['AA'],\n            ['A']\n        )\n        self.assertEqual(result, ['A', 'A', '0', 'X'])\n        \n    # Puzzles that violate the problem setup rules\n    def test_puzzle_invalid_row_lengths(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            solve_custom_puzzle(\n                [\n                    ['X', 'X', 'X'],\n                    ['X', 'X'],\n                    ['X', 'X']\n                ],\n                ['AOK', 'OK', 'KO'],\n                ['OK', 'KO', 'OK']\n            )\n        \n    # Test situations where the words are too long\n    def test_puzzle_words_too_long(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            solve_custom_puzzle(\n                reusable_matrix,\n                ['TOO LONG'],\n                reusable_down_words\n            )\n        \n    # Test scenarios where the words do not match\n    def test_puzzle_words_do_not_match(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            solve_custom_puzzle(\n                reusable_matrix,\n                reusable_across_words,\n                ['ADS', 'VSE', 'EUVE']\n            )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThis setup provides the functionality to test the code with various criterion.

The `sorted()` function takes an iterable as its first argument and an optional key function to sort the iterable in lexicographical order.\n\nHere are the results:\n\n1. For the set `[\"Foo\", \"Baz\", \"FooBaz\"]`, the sorted output would be: `['Baz', 'Foo', 'FooBaz']`\n\n2. For the set `[\"apple\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]`, the sorted output would be: `['Apple', 'apple', 'banana']`\n\n3. For the set `[]`, the sorted output would be: `[]` (no output)"}

If a journalist writes 10 articles in a month, how many articles are written and published by reporters in a month?\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and apply it step by step:\n\n1. **Total Articles**: We need to determine the total number of articles published in the newspaper.\n\n2. **Articles by Journalists**: According to the information given, 15% of the articles are written by 25% of the journalists. Let's denote the total number of articles as \\(A\\) and the total number of journalists as \\(J\\).\n   - 25% of the journalists: \\(0.25J\\)\n   - These 25% of the journalists contribute to 15% of the articles: \\(0.15A\\)\n\n3. **Journalist Writing Rate**: Each journalist writes 10 articles per month. Therefore, \\(25\\%\\) of the journalists writing \\(15\\%\\) of the articles means:\n   \\[\n   0.25J \\times 10 = 0.15A\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   2.5J = 0.15A \\Rightarrow J = \\frac{0.15A}{2.5} = \\frac{3A}{50}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Articles by Reporters**: The remaining 85% of the articles are written by reporters. Since 25% of the reporters write exactly 20 articles, we can denote the total number of reporters as \\(R\\).\n\n5. **Reporter Writing Contribution**: \n   \\[\n   0.25R \\times 20 = 0.85A\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   5R = 0.85A \\Rightarrow R = \\frac{0.85A}{5} = \\frac{17A}{100}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total Articles Calculation**:\n   - To find the actual number of articles, we need to consider the entire equation where 15% of the articles are written by journalists and 85% by reporters.\n   - Using the variables derived: \n     \\[\n     0.15A + 0.85A = A\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that the distribution correctly adds up to the total number of articles.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - To find the exact number of articles written by reporters:\n     \\[\n     0.85A = 0.85 \\times A\n     \\]\n   - Given the percentages and constraints, let's assume \\(A = 100\\) for simplicity (this is a common approach to simplify percentages):\n     \\[\n     0.85 \\times 100 = 85\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of articles written and published by reporters in a month is \\(85\\)."}
