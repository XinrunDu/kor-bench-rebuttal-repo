Since `~p3` is false when p3 is true, the formula evaluates to true if any of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` are false (since `p1&p2&~p3` involves all being true to make it false).\n\n- p1 = false (x): The formula will be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3.\n- p2 = false (x): The formula will be true regardless of the values of p1 and p3.\n- p3 = true (\u2713): The formula will be true regardless of the values of p1 and p2, but more importantly, it invalidates `~p3`.\n\n#### False Assignments:\nThe formula will be false if `p1&p2&~p3` is true. For this to be true, `p1` and `p2` must be true (\u2713) and `p3` must be false (x).\n\nTherefore,\n- False when p1 = true (\u2713), p2 = true (\u2713), and p3 = false (x)\n\n### Formula 2: (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this formula, we must consider when the implication is true and false.\n\n#### True Assignments:\nThe implication will be true if `~p1&p2` is false or if `(p1=p3)` is true.\n\n- `~p1&p2` is false when p1 is true (\u2713) or p2 is false (x), making the whole implication true.\n- If `~p1&p2` is true (which happens only when p1 is false (x) and p2 is true (\u2713)), then for the whole formula to be true, `(p1=p3)` must be true, which means p3 must be false (x) if p1 is false.\n\n- p1 = true (\u2713): The implication is true regardless of the values of p2 and p3.\n- p2 = false (x): The implication is true regardless of the values of p1 and p3.\n- p1 = false (x), p2 = true (\u2713), and p3 = false (x)\n\n#### False Assignments:\nThe implication will be false if `~p1&p2` is true (p1 = false (x) and p2 = true (\u2713)) but `(p1=p3)` is false (meaning p1 and p3 have different values).\n\n- p1 = false (x), p2 = true (\u2713), and p3 = true (\u2713)\n\n### Final Answer in Required Format:\n\n[[T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713,\u2713|x|x,\u2713|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[T:\u2713|x|x,\u2713|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|x,x|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713;F:x|\u2713|\u2713]]"}

It is False if p1 is True (T) and p2 is False (F).\n- Therefore, \"~(p1=::>p2)\" would be True if p1 is True and p2 is False, and False otherwise.\n- Then, combining with \"p2\", the formula would be:\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is False (because \"(~(T=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is False and p2 is False (because \"(~(F=::>F)) & F\" equals \"F & F\" which is F).\n  - True when p1 is False and p2 is True (because \"(~(F=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n  - False when p1 is True and p2 is True (because \"(~(T=::>T)) & T\" equals \"F & T\" which is F).\n\nBased on this analysis, the formula is not true under all assignments and not false under all assignments. So it is Neither.\n\n### Formula 2: (p1 & p3) = (~p1 & ~p2)\n\nLet's break down this formula and consider its truth values under different assignments.\n\n- The part \"(p1 & p3)\" is True if and only if both p1 and p3 are True.

It is False otherwise.\n- Therefore, we need to check if the conditions for truth of \"(p1 & p3)\" match the conditions for truth of \"(~p1 & ~p2)\". They clearly don't match under any assignment because the conditions for both being True or False require opposite states of p1.\n\nGiven the contradictory requirements to make both parts of the equivalence true or false under the same conditions, it's clear this formula doesn't hold true for any assignment neither does it hold false for all assignments under every possible state of truth for p1, p2, and p3.\n\nBased on this, the formula should be classified as Neither.\n\nThus, the answers are:\n\n[[C];[C]]"}

Convert the implications into the form that uses `|` and `!`:\n   - Implication \\(A > B\\) is equivalent to `!A | B` based on the rule given.\n   - Therefore, the first expression \\((p>q)>r\\) is equivalent to `!(p>q) | r`.\n\n2. Apply the rule \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\) to `!(p>q) | r`:\n   - \\((p > q) ::=:: !p | q\\).\n   - So, `!(p>q)` is `!!(p>q)` and `p>q ::=:: !p | q`, which becomes `!(<!p | q)`.\n\n3. Simplify `!(<!p | q)` using the double negation rule \\(A ::=:: !!A\\):\n   - `!(<!p | q)` is equivalent to `\\(\\neg(\\neg(!p | q))\\)` which simplifies to `!(p & !q)` using De Morgan's Law (!(\\(A\\) | \\(B\\)) ::=:: !A & !B).\n\n4. Therefore, `!(p & !q) | r` is further simplified to `(!p | !!q) | r` and then to `(!p | q) | r`.\n\n5. We'll now do the same for the second expression \\(p>(q>r)\\) which is equivalent to `p> (!q | r)` following the same conversion rule.\n   - This implies `!p | (q>r)` or `!p | ((!q | r))`.\n   - Further simplification gives us `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\n6. Now we simplify both expressions further and compare:\n   - The first expression `(!p | q) | r`.\n   - The second expression `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nApplying commutative and associative properties:\n   - `(!p | q) | r ::=:: !p | q | r` (since `|` is associative and commutative).\n   - `!p | (!q | r) ::=:: !p | !q | r`.\n\nComparing `!p | q | r` and `!p | !q | r`, we can see they are not the same because the second part does not match.

A. Yes B.

Let's start with the right side of (1): (p&q)|(p&!q).\n2. We can use the distributive property (5) of logical expressions to factor out p: (p&q)|(p&!q) ::=:: p&(q|!q).\n3. According to the Law of Excluded Middle (8), q|!q is always true (1), so the expression simplifies to: p&1.\n4. From the identity of AND with a true statement, we know that p&1 is logically equivalent to p itself.\n5. Therefore, p ::=:: (p&q)|(p&!q) is a valid equivalence according to the given rules.\n\n### Checking (2) (p&!q)|(!p&q) ::=:: (p|q)&(!(p|q))\n\n1. Let's examine the left side of (2): (p&!q)|(!p&q).\n2. This expression can be translated as 'p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true', which is the definition of the XOR (exclusive OR), but since XOR is not directly supported, and the target side of the equivalence involves only AND, OR, and negation, we proceed further.\n3. Let's look at the right side of (2): (p|q)&(!(p|q)).\n4. According to (6), !(p|q) is equivalent to !p&!q, so we have (p|q)&(!p&!q).\n5. However, this means that the expression p|q must be true and false at the same time (!p&!q), which is a contradiction (9).\n6. Therefore, (p|q)&(!(p|q)) will always be logically false (0).\n7. For the initial expression (p&!q)|(!p&q) to be always false, both p&!q and !p&q must be false, but this cannot be determined just from the form of the expression without specific values of p and q.\n8. Thus, this equivalence cannot be universally proven as valid according to the given equivalences rules since the right-hand side simplifies to a contradiction which does not capture the variability of the left-hand side correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[A];[B]]"}

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n(2) (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the given problem, let's break it down into the two parts and analyze them according to the specified logical operations and equivalences.\n\n### Part 1: (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r::=::p\u21d3(q\u21d3r)\n\n1. By equivalence (16), \\(p\u21d3q ::=:: !p & !q\\).\n2. Let's replace the NOR operations with AND operations: \\((p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: (!p & !q)\u21d3r\\).\n3. Using the equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p & !q) & !r\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, we get \\(!!p | !!q & !r\\).\n5. Using equivalence (1) (\\(A ::=:: !!A\\)), this simplifies further to \\(p | q & !r\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the right-hand side.\n1. By the same process, \\(q\u21d3r ::=:: !q & !r\\).\n2. Thus, \\(p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) ::=:: !p & !(q\u21d3r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d3r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p & !(!q & !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p & (!q | !!r)\\).\n5. Simplifying again using equivalence (1), we get \\(!p & (!q | r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (p\u21d3q)\u21d3r ::=:: p\u21d3(q\u21d3r) \\) translates to \\(p | q & !r ::=:: !p & (!q | r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent. Hence, the equivalence is not valid.\n\n### Part 2: (p\u21d1q)\u21d1r::=::p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\n\n1. By equivalence (15), \\(p\u21d1q ::=:: !p | !q\\).\n2. Thus, \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: (!p | !q)\u21d1r\\).\n3. By the same equivalence, this becomes \\(!!(p | q) \u21d1 r\\).\n4. Using equivalence (1), this simplifies to \\((p | q)\u21d1r\\).\n5. Replacing with the NAND equivalence again, this becomes \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n6. Applying De Morgan's law, this simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\), which further simplifies to \\(!(!p | !q) | !r\\).\n\nFor the right-hand side:\n1. \\(q\u21d1r ::=:: !q | !r\\).\n2. So, \\(p\u21d1(q\u21d1r) ::=:: !p | !(q\u21d1r)\\).\n3. Replacing \\(q\u21d1r\\) by its equivalence gives us \\(!p | !(!q | !r)\\).\n4. Applying De Morgan's law, this becomes \\(!p | (q & r)\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\((p\u21d1q)\u21d1r ::=:: p\u21d1(q\u21d1r)\\) translates to \\((p | q)\u21d1r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\), or more accurately, \\(!(!p | !q) | !r ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\). These two expressions are not logically equivalent either. Hence, this equivalence is also not valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince neither of the equivalences is valid, the answers are both negative.\n\nThe final answer is: [[B];[B]]"}

For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. That is, the binary representations corresponding to these hexadecimal numbers are:\n   - 0 (0000)\n   - 2 (0010)\n   - 4 (0100)\n   - 6 (0110)\n   - 8 (1000)\n   - A (1010)\n   - C (1100)\n   - E (1110)\n\nSince a basic form must include \\(m_0\\) (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0), and for it to also be an all-even form, we must include 0000 and can include any combination of the remaining even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).\n\nThe question is how many combinations of the remaining 7 even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) we can have along with 0. This is simply the number of subsets of a set with 7 elements (including the empty subset, which corresponds to only having \\(m_0\\)).\n\nThe number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, for 7 elements, we have \\(2^7 = 128\\) subsets.\n\nThus, the answer to the question of how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form is:\n\n[[128]]"}

Let's analyze the components:\n\n1. The entity set E has been defined as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. The assignment of the constant `a` is `a\u2032 = 0`.\n3. In the given formula, `g` is an `n-ary` (in this case, binary) function symbol, which means it is replaced with its implementation `g\ud835\udc3d(x, y) = x * y`.\n4. `F` is an `n-ary` predicate symbol (in this case, binary). It is replaced with `F\ud835\udc3d` which is defined as equality, `x = y`.\n\nFollowing these rules, we replace the formula components accordingly:\n\n- Replace `a` with its assignment `a\u2032 = 0`.\n- Replace `g` with its implementation `g\ud835\udc3d`, yielding `g\ud835\udc3d(x, 0) = x * 0`.\n- Replace `F` with its implementation `F\ud835\udc3d`, giving us `F\ud835\udc3d(x * 0, x) = x * 0 = x`.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula \u2200xF(g(x,a),x) under \ud835\udc3d will be the statement that for all natural numbers x, `x * 0 = x` holds true. Implementing the formula given the rules yields:\n\n[[(\u2200x)F(x*0, x)]] or more explicitly noting the interpretation, [[(\u2200x \u2208 N)(x * 0 = x)]].\n\nHowever, since the specific symbols `[[(\u2200x)F(x * 0, x)]]` directly follow from the rules of how to replace the entities within the formula, this format is better suited to directly align with the logical transformation:\n\n[[\u2200x(x * 0 = x)]]"}

Let\u2019s break it down for each given formula:\n\n1. The formula \\( \\forall x\\forall y\\exists z F(f(x,y),z) \\) means that for every pair of numbers (x, y), there is some number z such that function f applied to x and y equals z. Considering the definitions, we can replace the symbols with their corresponding implementations under J:\n    - \\( f(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x + y \\)\n    - \\( F(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x = y \\)\n\nTherefore, the formula under J becomes a statement about natural numbers.

Therefore, they don't have a clear * relation as defined, and thus do not have a relationship based on the provided rules.\n- **[1] and [3]**: These two statements effectively make the same claim under different wording. \"[1] All products are qualified\" and \"[3] All products are not unqualified\" both express that all products are qualified (in the affirmative for [1] and in the negation of non-qualification for [3]). Since they express the same idea, they do have a relationship.\n- **[3] and [4]**: These statements do not have a relationship under the provided rules. Proposition [4] suggests that there exists a subset of products that are unqualified, whereas [3] denies that there are any unqualified products. While they might seem to be in contradiction, these do not fit into the * relation or any other specified relationship because they deal with an affirmative universal statement and a particular negative statement concerning the same subjects but opposing predicates."}

According to Method C:\n1. First, obversion is applied, changing the quality and replacing the predicate with its contrary to result in \"All S is not non-P\", which would be \"All true revolutionaries are not not upright and open\". This step simplifies logically to \"All true revolutionaries are upright and open\" again since double negation cancels out.\n2. Then conversion is performed exchanging S and non-P, resulting in \"All non-P is not S\" or \"All people who are not upright and open are not true revolutionaries.\"\n\nHence, Method C is used to achieve the desired transformation."}

In this case, it would result in \"All correct reasoning is not non-formally correct reasoning,\" but it does not swap the positions of S and P, so it is not applicable to get \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.\n\n- Method B (Conversion) exchanges the positions of the subject and predicate in the proposition. Applying Method B to the original proposition, \"All S is P,\" we would get \"All P is S.\" For our specific proposition, this would be \"All formally correct reasoning is correct reasoning,\" which does put \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject.\n\n- Method C (Contraposition) first applies obversion and then conversion, which in the case of a Universal Affirmative does not result in the subject being \"formally correct reasoning.\" It would transform the original proposition to \"All non-P is not S,\" which for our case would be \"All non-formally correct reasoning is not correct reasoning,\" and this does not meet our requirement.\n\nHence, the method that should be used for the desired inference is Method B.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

Given limitations and adhering as closely as possible, one could argue for symbolizing each part separately, but if it needs to stay within a single expression as per the format hint, we can offer the representation for just one of the aspects (evidently the format is possibly misaligned with accommodating multiple variables into a single slot as implied). \n\nFor a direct answer under the format constraint and taking p as an example:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"]]\n\nHowever, to adequately represent all parts:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"], [\"q\", \"\u203dq\"], [\"r\", \"\u203dr\"]]\n\nThis approach represents each part of the prohibition separately since the format hint is not specific on how to integrate multiple prohibitions into a single slot adhering to custom defined logic rules."}

However, this relationship does not stipulate any constraints that both propositions cannot be true, cannot be false, or must necessarily be in any exclusive state relative to truth or falsity as all four relationships imply differently. Since there is no inherent restriction on the possible truth values listed in the definitions of the * and x relationships, and it does not strictly necessitate that at least one of them must be true as per the @ relationship, it stands that the only defined relationship in our rule set that allows for both propositions to potentially be true and false is the % relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[D]]."}

Hence, Fp and \u00acG\u00acp.\n\nFor the second pair:\n3. \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" can be represented as Gp, indicating a future period.\n4. \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\" can be more loosely understood as Fp, a future point in time.\n\nNext, we match these interpretations to the given relationships to determine which one they fulfill:\n\nFor (1) - (2) relationships:\n- Fp and \u00acG\u00acp correspond to the relationship Gp \u2194 \u00acF\u00acp (which is rule 15). Therefore, they are related as in the rule (15).\n- Since the rules given do not provide an exact match for this derived relationship, we examine the complex relationships (\u203b, \u21a6, \u26ad, \u2042).\n\nSince Fp \u2194 \u00acG\u00acp does not directly tell us the type of relationship between Fp and \u00acG\u00acp, we can infer that Fp and \u00acG\u00acp follow the properties of the relationship between Fp and G\u00acp, which is not covered under the standards given directly. However, when considering the principles of (13) Gp \u2194 F\u00acp and by negation relationships, we deduce the contradicting but possible truth yet impossible falsity which points to a \u26ad relationship.\n\nFor (3) - (4) relationships:\n- Gp and Fp fall under the rule (21) Gp \u2192 Fp, which also indicates a future time point relationship. A bidirectional relationship not directly given but aligned with the future time points relationship among properties that can both be true or false, adhering to the nature of the future propositions which can lead to multiple interpretations but fits better within the type that does not state mutual exclusion (nor implies mutuality) fully but gives grounds to the truth and falsehood under posteriority or simultaneity which is \u2242 relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be:\n\n[[C];[D]]\n\nHowever, given the tight logical relationships and their persistence rules from the provided instructions, aligning the sentence to the rule should indeed overtly lean towards specific designation under which the direct match is needed. If no direct match, the best understood fit with given options married with deduced logical validity suggests the nature of properties.\n\nHence, considering the overarching principles [[C];[D]] gives the inferred relationship from available options aligning most logically."}

Since the question states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, this aligns with the notion of common belief.

The description does not directly contrast scenarios where movement is absent but conditions of movement generating heat are varied and all result in heat, without considering what happens without the movement.\n\nMethod \u2e2e states:\n- If S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ, this might indicate a causal relationship.

This method indicates that when changes, in this case gravitational effects (S), correspond to observable changes, here the orbital deviations (P), a causal relationship may be inferred. The calculation of Neptune's orbital position based on Uranus's deviations provided evidence that aligns with changes in S corresponding to changes in P, leading to the discovery of Neptune as the cause for these deviations."}

Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the logical method consistent with the derivation of cause and effect in the passage, let's analyze the context provided:\n\nThe passage talks about the relationship between the number of deep wells, the amount of underground water used, and the rate of ground subsidence. It mentions specific years and the corresponding number of deep wells, water usage, and the level of subsidence. The claim is that as the number of deep wells increased and more water was extracted underground, the land subsided faster. This implies that there is a relationship where the intensity of the cause (number of wells and water extraction) is related to the effect (land subsidence).\n\nGiven these points, the logical method that fits best would be:\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of deep wells (S) and the use of underground water (S) changed over time, corresponding to changes in the level of land subsidence (P).\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n[[D]]"}

In this case, \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is considered an attribute that is not present in the deep sea (a, b, c), leading to the conclusion that organisms typical of such conditions (d) cannot survive in the deep sea. Therefore, \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is a -\u2318 attribute.\n\nHence, the correct answer is [[A]]."}

The observed phenomenon (p) is that the rats escape whenever the lights are on. The two hypotheses are (q_1) that the rats escape because of the light and (q_2) that the rats escape due to hearing a sound.

This means that regardless of whether p is true or false, q must be true. This scenario does not directly align with the definitions and rules of the BC Paradox or the LS Paradox, as they involve different logical structures and the conditions of their paradoxes do not match the given expression directly.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the GB Paradox, we see a parallel in using the same observation (in this case, q being true regardless of p's status) to draw the conclusion that q holds true. This can reflect a situation similar to the GB Paradox where the same outcome (q being true) can be derived from different conditions (p\u771f\u5047\u4e0d\u4e00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5), thus reflecting a situation where conclusions may appear to contradict each other from different viewpoints, even though they lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to the provided logical expression is the **GB Paradox** as it can illustrate a situation where the same conclusion (q being true) is approached from two different premises and can present complexity in conclusively favoring one form of inductive reasoning over another if not appropriately distinguished.\n\n[[A]]"}

C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Can you help me borrow the materials for tomorrow's meeting?\"\nB: \"I borrowed the materials.\"\nC: \"I managed to get the materials.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, B's response \"I borrowed the materials\" is a direct and conventional answer, indicating that B has successfully completed the action of borrowing the materials. However, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" uses the word \"managed,\" which may imply that the process of obtaining the materials was not simple and may involve additional effort or the use of some special methods. C's response may lead people to understand that the process of obtaining the materials was \"quite troublesome,\" or C encountered some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\nThe use of \"managed to get\" by C instead of a more direct and conventional expression like \"I got the materials\" or \"I borrowed the materials\" aligns with the C! Principle. This principle suggests that the speaker uses marked expressions cautiously, and such expressions often convey additional information or meaning beyond what could be expressed with an unmarked expression. Here, \"managed to get\" suggests that C faced some level of difficulty in obtaining the materials, which goes beyond what a simple statement of action would convey."}
