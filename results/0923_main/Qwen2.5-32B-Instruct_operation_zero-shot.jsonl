The final operation will combine these results if needed, but understanding how each operation part works will help us reach the solution.\n\nThe rule states:\n1. If a is a multiple of b, then a※b = a/b + 2.\n2. If b is a multiple of a, then a※b = b/a + 2.\n3. If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, then a※b = 24.\n\nGiven 25※X※14, since we are aiming to reach a value of 4, the outcomes of 25※X or X※14 need to lead us towards this goal following the operations specified.\n\n### Analyzing 25※X:\n- If X is a factor of 25, we can explore both 25 being divisible by X and X being divisible by 25:\n  - Because 25 is a prime power (5^2), its factors are 1, 5, and 25.\n  - For X = 1 or 25, 25※X = 25/X + 2 = 25/1 + 2 or 25/25 + 2 = 27 or 3 respectively.

According to the rule, the equation becomes \\((3^X - X^3)¥6 = -1\\), which simplifies to \\((3^X - X^3)^6 - 6^{(3^X - X^3)} = -1\\).\n\nHowever, the structure of the given operation suggests a simpler interpretation since it breaks down into two separate operations due to the chained nature of \\(3¥X¥6\\). The intended interpretation, considering the pattern, should be \\([(3^X - X^3)¥6 = -1]\\).\n\nTo make it clearer, let's solve the first part of the equation \\(3¥X = 3^X - X^3\\) and then apply the second part \\(a¥6 = a^6 - 6^a\\) to the result.\n\nWe start by finding \\(X\\) such that \\(3^X - X^3 = Y\\), which should satisfy that \\(Y¥6 = -1\\). This means \\(Y^6 - 6^Y = -1\\).\n\nGiven the complexity, let's solve it with a reasonable approach:\n\n1. Let's denote \\(Y = 3^X - X^3\\).\n2. Then, \\(Y^6 - 6^Y = -1\\).\n\nTesting small integers for \\(X\\) to see which one satisfies the equation:\n- If \\(X = 1\\), then \\(3^1 - 1^3 = 2\\). But \\(2^6 - 6^2 = 64 - 36 = 28\\), not \\(-1\\).\n- If \\(X = 2\\), then \\(3^2 - 2^3 = 9 - 8 = 1\\). But \\(1^6 - 6^1 = 1 - 6 = -5\\), not \\(-1\\).\n- If \\(X = 3\\), then \\(3^3 - 3^3 = 27 - 27 = 0\\).
