Using De Morgan's law (rule 6), \\(!(!p | q)\\) becomes \\(!(!p) & !q\\).\n2. Since \\(!(!p) ::=:: p\\) by rule (1), we get \\(p & !q\\).\n3. Therefore, \\((p > q) > r\\) becomes \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n\nNext, let's convert \\(p > (q > r)\\):\n\n1. \\(q > r\\) can be rewritten as \\(!q | r\\) using rule (10).\n2. \\(p > (q > r)\\) can be rewritten as \\(p > (!q | r)\\) using the same rule.\n3.

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the truth values of the propositions based on the logical expression E and the constraints provided by Professor Wang.

Since \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr includes m0, it is not a contradiction.\n   - **Basic formula:** A basic formula includes m0. Since \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr includes m0, it is a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes only even indices. The index of m0 is 0, which is even, so \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr is an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes only odd indices.

The binary number 001 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1. Therefore, this term is denoted as m1.\n   - For (p\u2227q\u2227r), the true assignment is 111 (since p is 1, q is 1, and r is 1). The binary number 111 corresponds to the hexadecimal number 7. Therefore, this term is denoted as m7.\n\n3. **Construct the principal disjunctive normal form:**\n   - The principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of the formula is m1 \u2228 m7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the properties of the formula:**\n   - **Tautology:** A tautology includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms. Here, n = 3, so there should be 8 paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) does not include all 8 terms, so it is not a tautology.\n   - **Contradiction:** A contradiction includes no paired conjunctive terms. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) includes two terms, so it is not a contradiction.\n   - **Basic formula:** A basic formula includes m0. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) does not include m0, so it is not a basic formula.\n   - **All-even formula:** An all-even formula includes paired conjunctive terms with even indices. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) includes m1 and m7, which are both odd indices, so it is not an all-even formula.\n   - **All-odd formula:** An all-odd formula includes paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. The formula (m1 \u2228 m7) includes m1 and m7, which are both odd indices, so it is an all-odd formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[E]]"}

Both C1 and C2 have the literal p, but there is no \u00acp in either clause.\n- Therefore, C1 and C2 cannot be resolved, and the resolution process does not produce a new clause.\n- Since no new clause can be added to S2, the algorithm does not terminate with \"Implausible\" and the clauses remain as they are.\n\nHowever, the resolution itself is not applicable here because the conditions for resolution (having a literal and its negation in the two clauses) are not met. Thus, the correct response format should indicate that the clauses cannot be resolved, leading to \"Implausible\" as the answer."}

The statement implies that it is not possible for science to be solely a one-man effort. This can be translated into modal logic as a necessity that science is not a one-man endeavour.\n\nGiven that:\n- p denotes \"Science is a human endeavour.\"\n\nWe can rephrase \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" as \"It is necessary that science is not a one-man endeavour.\" This can be further interpreted as \"It is necessary that science is not limited to one person,\" which is logically equivalent to \"It is necessary that science is a human endeavour.\"\n\nHowever, the direct translation of \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" in modal logic would be:\n- \"It is not possible that science is a one-man endeavour.\"\n\nUsing the notation provided:\n- p: \"Science is a human endeavour.\"\n- !p: \"Science is not a human endeavour.\"\n\nThe statement \"It is not possible that science is a one-man endeavour\" can be symbolized as:\n$!(\\text{one-man endeavour})$\n\nSince \"one-man endeavour\" is not a human endeavour, we can substitute it with !p (i.e., \"Science is not a human endeavour\").\n\nThus, the modal proposition is:\n$!(\\text{one-man endeavour}) = $!(!p)\n\nUsing the provided inference formulas:\n- $!p \u2190\u2192 !#p\n\nWe get:\n- $!(!p) = !#p\n\nTherefore, the final symbolization of \"Science cannot be a one-man endeavour\" is:\n- !#p\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n[[!#p]]"}

This method involves a positive group where the presence of a condition (S) is associated with an effect (P), and a negative group where the absence of the condition (S) is associated with the absence of the effect (P). In this case:\n- Positive group: The presence of an unknown planet (S) causes deviations in Uranus's orbit (P).\n- Negative group: In the absence of the unknown planet, there should be no significant deviations in Uranus's orbit (P).\n\nThis method was used to deduce that an unknown celestial body (Neptune) was causing the deviations in Uranus's orbit, and thus, the presence of Neptune (S) and the deviations in Uranus\u2019s orbit (P) were inferred to have a causal relationship."}

Therefore, we can conclude that the more deep wells there are, the more water is used underground, and the faster the earth sinks.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in the passage is consistent with Method \u2d63. This method involves observing that changes in one factor (S) correspond to changes in another factor (P). Here, the number of deep wells and the amount of water used from them (S) correspond to the rate of ground subsidence (P). As the number of deep wells and the amount of water extracted increased, the rate of ground subsidence also increased, suggesting a causal relationship between these factors."}

The implication here is that the speaker is trying to communicate that getting the tickets required extra effort, which would not be as clearly conveyed by the unmarked expression \"bought.\""}

B's response provides some information but does not directly answer A's question, instead implying that the project is nearly finished but there is still work to be done. C's response is similar to B's but uses the expression \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which may suggest that the project is substantially complete with only minor steps left. C's response might lead one to understand that although there are still parts of the project unfinished, the main work has been accomplished, and C has chosen a more euphemistic and optimistic way of expression, implying a high likelihood of project success while also leaving some openness, indicating there might be some unforeseen work left.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA.

However, this is a weaker statement than \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female\" because it does not necessarily entail the stronger information (i.e., the nurse being a female). According to the C* Principle, particularly CQ2, since the stronger statement (nurse is female) entails the content of the weaker statement (giving flowers to a female), and if the speaker knows this, the use of the weaker statement implies that the speaker does not know whether the stronger statement can be definitively established (i.e., the nurse is definitely female).

Li Gua did not murder his boss, so Li Gua is not an evil person. This reasoning is obviously unsound.

Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose a company manager (let's call him Manager M) announces a new policy: \"All employees (E) will receive a bonus (B) after completing a project (P).\" However, an employee (let's call him Employee A) misunderstands this statement, thinking that \"only when an employee receives a bonus (B) have they completed a project (P).\"\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
