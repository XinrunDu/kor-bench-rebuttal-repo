It is important to ensure that the keywords do not contain repetitive patterns and that they do not overlap significantly. The longer the keyword, the more effective the encryption will be, but it is still possible to detect and crack even larger ciphertexts with modern techniques.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext message, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2.

We need to modify them as follows:\n\nEncryption Rules:\n\n1. If the plaintext character is an uppercase letter and exists in the Multitap Code Table, replace it with the corresponding Multitap Code from the Multitap Code Table.\n2. If the plaintext character is none of the above, add 27 (equal to the count of uppercase characters), subtract the previous number from 27, and convert the result modulo 5 to an integer character from 0 to 4 (which represent the letters A to D respectively).\n\nDecryption Rules:\n\n1. If the Multitap Code is a letter, replace it with the corresponding uppercase letter from the Multitap Code Table.\n2. If the Multitap Code is none of the above, add 27 (equal to the count of uppercase characters), subtract the previous number from 27, and convert the result modulo 5 to an integer character from 0 to 4 (which represent the letters A to D respectively).\n\nUsing these modified rules, we can encrypt and decrypt the given inputs:\n\nQ1: Plaintext: \"K\"\n\nEncrypted Answer: [[3^1]]\n\nQ2: Ciphertext: \"3^2\"\n\nDecrypted Answer: [[R]]\n\nQ3: Ciphertext: \"6^13^2\"\n\nDecrypted Answer: [[ME]]\n\nQ4: Plaintext: \"M\"\n\nEncrypted Answer: [[13^1]]\n\nQ5: Ciphertext: \"5^4^3\"\n\nDecrypted Answer: [[EI]]\n\nQ6: Ciphertext: \"3^1\"\n\nDecrypted Answer: [[C]]\n\nNote: The OEIS sequence mentioned in the original answer, A001167, does not seem to be related to the specific encryption or decryption rules provided in this task."}

It takes a string `text` as input, pads it with spaces, and converts it to uppercase letters. Then, for each character `char` in `text`, it checks if the Polybius square contains `char` and if so, replaces it with the corresponding row and column numbers. If `char` doesn't exist in the Polybius square, it is replaced with a dot (\".\"). The resulting decimal representation is then enciphered using a round-robin key cipher to produce the encrypted output."}

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream.

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[VVH]]Note that the answer provided, [[VVH]], is not correct.\n\nAfter decrypting the ciphertext \"PZOZI\" with period = 10 and increment = 1, the expected decrypted answer is \"SSER\". This answer was obtained by reversing the encryption process and replacing the characters in the ciphertext with the corresponding characters on the outer_disk and inner_disk.\n\nThe provided code and mapping are not correct as you have already informed that they provide the wrong answer. The mapping uvwcmywqwo used in the code returns the string \"SSER\", which matches the expected decrypted answer. However, using this mapping instead of the correct one causes the error.\n\nTo provide the correct answer, we need to use the mapping /oqvgzckzb. With this mapping, we can decrypt the ciphertext \"PZOZI\" as follows:\n\n- P changes to O (C indicates that P is at the 3rd position on the outer_disk after encryption and /o)\n- Z changes to O (G indicates that Z is at the 17th position on the outer_disk after encryption and z)\n- O changes to I (F indicates that O is at the 14th position on the outer_disk after encryption and o)\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n**Plaintext:** SSER"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[GG]]One possible decryption for the given ciphertext, \"XX\", is \"GU\". This is consistent with the rules of the cipher, as A is mapped to D, and X is mapped to G. The decryption steps would be:\n1. A maps to the next letter D in Reel2 (encoded as 1).\n2. Follows the direction of the ciphertext, going to Reel9 (encoded as 2).\n3. X maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n4. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n5. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n6. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n7. J maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n8. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n9. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n10. Moves to Reel22 (encoded as 21).\n11. O maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n12. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n13. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n14. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n15. W maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n16. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n17. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n18. Moves to Reel20 (encoded as 19).\n19. N maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n20. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n21. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n22. Moves to Reel17 (encoded as 15).\n23. J maps to G in Reel10 (encoded as -2, meaning -2 for wraparound).\n24. Moves to Reel12 (encoded as +2).\n25. L maps to U in Reel19 (encoded as -1).\n26. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n27. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n28. Moves to Reel18 (encoded as 17).\n29. V maps to G in Reel17 (encoded as 0).\nThus, the decrypted answer is \"GU\".\n\nBecause this is not a computer program, I am unable to format the output in a specific way.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[./.]]\nBased on the information provided, here's a simplified version of the rules:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Blue: Prepare the morse_code Table and Numerical-Index Mapping Table.\n2. Blue: Take the plaintext and convert each character to its corresponding Morse code, adding a / between each character.\n3. Blue: Divide the Morse code into two pairs of characters. Convert them into their corresponding numeric strings using the Mapping Table.\n4. Purple: Join the numeric strings into a single string, adding an extra .. if the input text length is odd.\n5. Green: Divide the ciphertext into pairs of digits.\n6. Green: Convert each pair to its corresponding character pair using the Mapping Table.\n7. Green: Combine the character pairs to form the final morse_code, adding an extra / if the input ciphertext length is odd.\n8. Purple: Convert each character pair of morse_code to its Uppercase counterpart using the morse_code table.\n9. Green: Join the plaintext characters to form the final output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThese rules represent the simplified workflow of the cipher. The steps are clear and concise. However, for greater clarity and precision, adding the functions used to improve understanding can be helpful. For instance, a \"convert_morse\" function could be defined for step 9 (Purple) to demonstrate how the characters are converted back to their uppercase counterparts in the plaintext.\n\n### Rule Variations:\n\n1. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in decryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n2. The character i '.' maps directly to 7 in the decryption step, bypassing the numeric-index mapping table.\n3. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in encryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n4. Adding an additional step in the decryption process to handle the extra '/' symbol if the input ciphertext has an odd number of digits doesn't impact the accuracy of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Changes in Explanation:\n\n1. The rule variations no longer apply to the simplified rules, as they are beyond the scope of the simplification process.\n\nThe modified rules and explanation clarify the simplified workflow of the Keyword Exclusive _Tagram Cipher, while ensuring they adhere to the question restrictions."}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n        - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    2. Inverse Permutation:\n        - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    3. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    4. Convert Binary to Character:\n        - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n        - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n    5. Combine Characters:\n        - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ZER]]\n\n## Task:\n\nEncrypt the given plaintext: \"NBA\" using the provided handle.\n\n### Output Format:\n\nFor encryption, your program should output ciphertext in the form: \"ciphertext numbers separated by comma,\".\n\nFor decryption, your program should output decrypted plaintext in the form: \"plaintext uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces,\".\n\n### Example:\n\nIf given Plaintext: \"Hey\" and Handle \"python2410\", your program should output the ciphertext.\n\n**My program:**\n\nEncryption of 'Hey' using 'python2410' handle would be as follows:\n\n**Encryption:**\n\n- Take each letter of 'python2410' and assign it an ASCII value (a=97, b=98, ..., z=122).\n- Assign the ASCII value 24 (first character) to 1.\n- Assign the ASCII value 10 (second character) to 2.\n- Assign the ASCII value 97 (third character) to 3.\n- The handle 'python2410' would become '2410973' in ASCII format.\n- Assign the ASCII value of each character of the plaintext 'Hey' to 4, 5, 6, respectively.\n- Apply the encryption formula: (p^24) * 10 + (p^10) * 2 + p.\n- Multiply each ASCII value with the corresponding value of the handle.\n- Add modulo 26 to each number to wrap around the alphabet.\n- Add the numbers together to get the ciphertext.\n- The encrypted ASCII values are 44, 99, 67 and are converted back to ASCII characters after removing modulo operation.\n\n```\nSo, the encrypted text is: \"dg fc\"\n```\n\nThe output format can be modified to \"ciphertext string\" if you prefer, but it should have the string value without the comma separator.\n\n```\nEncrypted text: \"dg fc\"\n```\n\n**Decryption:**\n\n- The same process is reversed for decryption.\n- Use the ASCII values of the ciphertext.\n- Apply the formula: ((p % 10) * 24) + ((p % 2) * 10) + (p / 25).\n- Modify the handle values to 24, 10.\n- Convert back to ASCII characters by removing the modulo operation.\n\n```\nSo, the decrypted text is: \"hey\"\n```\n\n**My program:**\n\nDecryption of 'dg fc' using 'python2410' handle would be:\n\n```\n# Example Python code to encrypt and decrypt a message using a specific handle\n\n# Import the required libraries\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define some ASCII values\nascii_a = 97\nascii_z = 122\n\n# Define the handle and its ASCII values\nhandle = \"python2410\"\nhandle_ascii = [ord(c) % 11 - 1 for c in handle]\n\n# Define the message and its ASCII values\nmessage = \"nba\"\n#message = [ord(c) % 99 - 1 for c in message]\nmessage_ascii = [ord(c) % 98 - 1 for c in message]\n\n# Print the handle and the message\nprint(\"Handle:\", handle)\nprint(\"Message:\", message)\n\n# Apply the encryption and decryption formulas\nciphertext = [((message_ascii[i] * handle_ascii[i]) + (2 * handle_ascii[i]) + ascii_a) % ((ascii_z + 1)) for i in range(3)]\nplaintext = [((ciphertext[i] - (handle_ascii[i] + 2)) // ascii_z) + ascii_a for i in range(3)]\n\n# Print the ciphertext and plaintext\nprint(\"Ciphertext:\", ''.join([chr(i) for i in ciphertext]), \"using handle\", handle)\nprint(\"Plaintext:\", ''.join([chr(i) for i in plaintext]), \"after decryption with handle\", handle)\n```\n\n```\n# Enter your Python code here\nHandles = [\"python2410\", \"coding123\", \"math456\"]\n\n# Get handle\nhandle = (input(\"Enter the handle: \"))\n\n# Get the input1\ninput1 = (input(\"Enter the input1: \"))\n\n# Get the input2\ninput2 = (input(\"Enter the input2: \"))\n\n# Loop for handling the given handles\nfor i in Handles:\n    # Check if the handle is found\n    if handle == i:\n        print(\"[Handle {0}]\".format(i))\n        # If the first letter in the input1 is capital then check if the first letter in input2 is capital\n        if input1[0].isupper():\n            print(\"[Encryption]\")\n            for pos in range(len(input1)):\n                if input2[pos].islower():\n                    if input2[pos].upper() == input1[pos]:\n                        print(input2[pos], end=\"\")\n                    else:\n                        print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n                else:\n                    print(input1[pos], end=\"\")\n            print()\n\n            # Check if the first letter in the input2 is capital or the length is 2\n            if input2[0].isupper() or (len(input2) == 2):\n                print(\"[Decryption]\")\n                for pos in range(len(input1)):\n                    if len(input1) == 2 or (len(input1) == 1 and input1[0].capitalize() == input2[0]):\n                        print(input2[pos], end=\"\")\n                    elif len(input1) == 3 and input1[0] == input2[0]:\n                        print(input2[pos], end=\"\")\n                    elif input2[pos].lower() == input2[pos + 1]:\n                        print(input2[pos], end=\"#\")\n                    elif input1[pos].capitalize() == input2[pos]:\n                        print(input2[pos], end=\"#\")\n                "}
