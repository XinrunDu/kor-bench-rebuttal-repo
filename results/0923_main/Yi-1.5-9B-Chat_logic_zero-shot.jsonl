We'll do this by considering the structure and priority of logical connectives in each formula.\n\n1. **~(~p1 &p2 )||~p3**\n\n   - The innermost connective is `&` (and) between `~p1` and `p2`, and `||` (or) outside the `~` (not) of `p3`.\n   - To find a false assignment for this formula, we need to consider the truth values that make the whole formula false.\n   - The `~` (not) changes the truth value, and `||` (or) is false only when both sides are false.\n   - Therefore, we need both `~p1 &p2` to be false and `~p3` to be false.\n   - For `~p1 &p2` to be false, both `p1` and `p2` must be false (since `&` is true only when both sides are true).\n   - Since `~p3` must also be false for the overall formula to be false, `p3` must be false.\n   - So, the false assignment for the formula is: \u2713|x|\u2713\n\n2. **(~p2 ||p3 )&(p1 =::>p2 )**\n\n   - The innermost connectives are `||` (or) between `~p2` and `p3` and `=::>` (if then) between `p1` and `p2`.\n   - To find a false assignment for this formula, we need to make it such that both parts of the `&` (and) are false.\n   - Both `(~p2 ||p3)` and `(p1 =::>p2)` need to be false simultaneously.\n   - For `(p1 =::>p2)` to be false, `p1` must be true and `p2` must be false, since an implication is false only when the premise is true and the consequence is false.\n   - Given that `p2` is false, `~p2` is true. For `(~p2 ||p3)` to be true (given `p2` is false), `p3` must be true or both `p3` and `~p2` are false, which contradicts our requirement for `(~p2 ||p3)` to be true.\n   - However, since `p1` is true and `p2` is false, `(p1 =::>p2)` is already false.\n   - Thus, to make the whole formula false, `p3` must be false to make `(~p2 ||p3)` false.\n   - So, the false assignment for the formula is: x|\u2713|x\n\n3. **(p1 =::>p2 )&(~(p1 &p3 )||p1)**\n\n   - The innermost connectives are `=::>` (if then) between `p1` and `p2`, `&` (and) between `p1` and `p3`, and `||` (or) outside the `~` (not) of the result of `(p1 &p3)`.\n   - To find a false assignment for this formula, we need to make it such that both parts of the `&` (and) are false.\n   - To make `(~(p1 &p3 )||p1)` false, both `~(p1 &p3)` and `p1` must be false since `||` is false only when both sides are false.\n   - For `~(p1 &p3)` to be false, `(p1 &p3)` must be true, which requires both `p1` and `p3` to be true.\n   - However, this contradicts our requirement for `p1` to be false, so this part of the formula cannot be false.\n   - Thus, we focus on `(p1 =::>p2)` being false, which means `p1` must be true and `p2` must be false.\n   - So, the false assignment for the formula is: x|\u2713|x\n\nPutting all the results together in the required format:\n\n```\n[[F:\u2713|x|\u2713];[F:x|\u2713|x];[F:x|\u2713|x]]\n```"}

The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "After analyzing the final simplified expression E::=::(! p&q&! r)|(p&! q&r) and considering that only one of p, q, r can be true, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The first part of the disjunction, (! p&q&! r), would be true if Professor Wang is from Shanghai (q is true) and not from Suzhou (p is false) and not from Hangzhou (r is false).\n- The second part of the disjunction, (p&! q&r), would be true if Professor Wang is from Hangzhou (r is true) and not from Shanghai (q is false) and not from Suzhou (p is true).\n\nSince only one of p, q, r can be true, the first part of the disjunction cannot be true because it implies that Professor Wang is from Shanghai and not from Suzhou, which is contradictory because our rule states that only one of p, q, r can be true. Therefore, the second part must be true, indicating that Professor Wang is from Hangzhou (r is true) and not from Shanghai (q is false) and not from Suzhou (p is true).\n\nNow, let's identify who got what right based on the true statement (since the second part of the disjunction is true, and C3 is not, we know that Person C is entirely incorrect):\n\n- Person A: ! p & q\n  - Since p is true, Person A's statement is false. However, if none of their statements were entirely correct (as per the setup), they must have gotten half right. This means q is true, but they falsely attributed it to p instead.\n  - So, Person A got half right.\n\n- Person B: p & ! q\n  - Since q is false, Person B's statement is partially correct (the second part, ! q, is true). However, if none of their statements were entirely correct, they must attribute the true location (Hangzhou) to a false origin (Suzhou). This means Person B got half right as well.\n\n- Person C: ! q & ! r\n  - Since r is true, this statement is entirely incorrect.\n\nGiven the above deductions, the answer is:\n\n[Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B]; [partially correct: A/B]; [entirely incorrect: C]\n\nHowever, based on the logical deductions, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of who got what right. Given the final simplified expression, the correct answer should reflect that neither A nor B got half right as initially thought. Instead, the correct approach is to match the final simplified expression with the original statements to find who made the correct prediction and who made the incorrect ones.\n\n- Person A's entire statement is incorrect (A3), but the final expression includes (! p&q&! r), which means Person A was partially correct in attributing the correct origin to Professor Wang (Shanghai) but incorrectly stating that he is not from Suzhou.\n- Person B's entire statement is partially correct (B3), as it matches the second part of the simplified expression when r is true, indicating that Person B correctly stated that Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and inadvertently guessed that he might be from Hangzhou.\n- Person C's entire statement is incorrect (C3), and it does not match any part of the simplified expression.\n\nGiven this correction, the answer is:\n\n[Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: A]; [entirely incorrect: C]"}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the paired conjunctive terms of the given expression [(\u00acp ^ \u00acq ^ r) \u2228 (\u00acp ^ q ^ r)], we first need to identify the propositional variables and their negations. For this expression, the propositional variables are p, q, and r. Their negations are \u00acp, \u00acq, and \u00acr, respectively.\n\nThe given expression can be simplified as follows, since (\u00acp ^ q ^ r) and (\u00acp ^ \u00acq ^ r) share a common factor of \u00acp:\n\n- (\u00acp ^ \u00acq ^ r) \u2228 (\u00acp ^ q ^ r)\n- Simplify using distribution: \u00acp ^ (\u00acq v q) ^ r\n- Since \u00acq v q is a tautology (law of excluded middle), it simplifies to \u00acp ^ TRUE ^ r, which simplifies to \u00acp ^ r\n\nNow, we need to identify the paired conjunctive terms in the simplified expression, \u00acp ^ r. The propositional variables in this expression are \u00acp and r, with their respective negations being p and \u00acr. However, the expression \u00acp ^ r does not include all propositional variables and their negations. It only includes \u00acp and r.\n\nTherefore, the expression \u00acp ^ r does not directly correspond to a paired conjunctive term according to the rules provided, as it does not include both p and \u00acp, and both r and \u00acr in the same term. In the context of the given rules, this expression does not fit the criteria to be labeled with an mX or MX.\n\nHowever, to answer the question as requested and in the context of the binary and hexadecimal assignments:\n\n- The binary representation of the true assignment for the expression (\u00acp ^ \u00acq ^ r) \u2228 (\u00acp ^ q ^ r) simplifies to \u00acp ^ r is 101 in binary, which is 5 in decimal and E in hexadecimal.\n\nGiven the rule that if the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to a hexadecimal number i, it is denoted as mi, we might expect this to be denoted as mE, but as explained, the expression does not fully satisfy the conditions for a paired conjunctive term. The actual classification of the expression based on the simplified form \u00acp ^ r is not a paired conjunctive term but rather falls under a basic formula if considered in the context of the fully expanded form it came from, since it is true for one specific combination of truth values of its variables (\u00acp is true, p is false, and r is true).\n\nSo, in the requested format:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms: None]; [denoted: mE (but not truly fitting the definition in this context due to the simplification)]]\n\nThis answer nuances the direct application of the rules to acknowledge that while the hexadecimal E could be assigned based on the true binary value after simplification, the term does not fit the definition of a paired conjunctive term as it stands. The original expression does not independently fit the pattern of a paired conjunctive term due to the simplification process."}

Let's start by converting the given formula into its conjunctive normal form (CNF) and then apply the resolution algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Convert to CNF\nThe given formula is: \\(p \u2227 (p \u2228 q) \u2227 (p \u2228 \u00acq) \u2227 (q \u2228 \u00acr) \u2227 (q \u2228 r)\\)\n\nSince all expressions are already in the form of disjunctions connected by conjunctions, we don't need to apply any distibution laws. The formula is already in CNF:\n\n\\[CNF: \\{p, p \u2228 q, p \u2228 \u00acq, q \u2228 \u00acr, q \u2228 r\\}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Resolution Algorithm\nAccording to the Resolution Algorithm, we initialize \\(S0\\) and \\(S2\\) as empty sets, and \\(S1\\) as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the CNF.\n\n\\[S1 = \\{p, p \u2228 q, p \u2228 \u00acq, q \u2228 \u00acr, q \u2228 r\\}\\]\n\n### Iteration 1: Resolve clauses in \\(S0\\) and \\(S1\\)\nSince \\(S0\\) is initially empty, we skip this step and move to resolving clauses in \\(S1\\).\n\n### Iteration 2: Resolve clauses in \\(S1\\)\nWe'll look for pairs of clauses where one contains a literal and the other contains its complement. Note that in the initial \\(S1\\), no such pair exists, as no literal and its negation are in the same set at this stage. Therefore, no clauses are resolved, and \\(S2\\) remains empty.\n\n### Check \\(S2\\)\nSince \\(S2\\) is empty, we output \u201cPlausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n\n### Output and Number of Cycles\nThe output of the resolution algorithm for the given formula is \u201cPlausible\u201d. Since we never needed to iterate through the process of adding \\(S1\\) to \\(S0\\) and setting \\(S1\\) to \\(S2\\) due to the nature of the initial formula (it resolved immediately), we only technically counted the initial state as one cycle for the purposes of counting iterations in the context of the algorithm's iterative steps, even though it didn't involve a resolution operation. Therefore, the number of cycles it iterates is 1.\n\n### Answer in the Format [[output];[number]]\n[[\"Plausible\"];[1]]\n\nThis answer reflects the direct application of the resolution algorithm to the given CNF formula, showcasing how the algorithm quickly identifies a satisfiable (\"Plausible\") outcome due to the existence of complementary literals that can be resolved upon initial inspection, without necessitating the full iterative sequence of the algorithm's steps as defined for cases where iterative resolution is required."}

Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's analyze the statements made by Inspector A and Inspector C based on the provided logical forms and relationships:\n\n- Inspector A: \"All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\" This is a Universal Affirmative (A) proposition, as it asserts that all members of the subject (individual businesses) do not possess the predicate property (have paid taxes). In abbreviated form, it is: [A: All IS are NOT P: DID NOT PAY TAXES].\n- Inspector C: \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\" This is a Particular Affirmative (I) proposition, indicating that at least one member of the subject (individual businesses) possesses the predicate property (have paid taxes). In abbreviated form, it is: [I: Some IS are P: HAVE PAID TAXES].\n\nAccording to the relationships between declarative propositions, the relationship between A propositions and I propositions is \"%\". This is because if the universal proposition is true (A), the particular proposition (I) must also be true. Conversely, if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition must be false.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types is:\n\n[[%]]"}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A/B/C/D/E]] A"}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)\u2227B(a) confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b) also confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- R(a)\u2227B(a)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\u2261\u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x))\n- \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nA.

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network.
