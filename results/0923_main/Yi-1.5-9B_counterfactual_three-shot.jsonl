The increased Diggler of Specimen XX can combine insect Irritate into the next mode when the target has been injured by at least 90%, making a double explosion that kills most Carets and Mini-Zombies as well as small meat shields and attackers.\n On the other hand, Specimen XX is also a plant that can be upgraded to Woodmorph.\n Zombie scientists are mostly skill burners like Darwin's Potato Mine and Rootbeer Tapper, and Calamity Canary is a good counter-attack for Zombie Scientists. Specimen XX is compatible with Mable, in Mable's mode, Specimen XX's fart acts as a scarecrow that attacks zombies on the various irons of the map.

Through defensive evolution, the plants become stronger, and the family becomes stronger, thus Dr. Tomato can enter, but after a long time of evolution, it will no longer be effective;\n The evolutionary rules are the same as before. By upgrading plants, regardless of plant buddies, one level of evolution will activate a level above its current level, and if they are not upgraded to a specific level, the plants will not evolve;\n The professional evolution will have many deadly turns at each level. It is best for Specimen XX to learn more about evolutionary resources and accompany Specimen XX.\n\n### Instructions:\nCan plants not be evolved?\n\n### Answer:\nNo\n\n### Question:\nCritters are cheap and powerful plants. They don't need a plant buddy they can return to the sponsor pool of each lane they kill by bullet-firing grass heads that shoot a huge number of bullets because the can pass through the right wall of light wavelengths. This makes it easy to block an attack even if they are both attacked by a standing group of zombies. However, at the beginning of the game, a single plant manages to block all zombie attacks with ease.

Extensively research the topic at hand if necessary to provide detailed answers.\n2. Ensure your responses are concise and relevant to the question or statement.\n3. Demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject matter by incorporating additional information that supports your response.\n\n### Question:\nEXPLANATION:\nIn Final Fantasy VII, the Guardian Force Palom/Maroda is a rare and powerful summon that grants immense damage against biomechanical enemies. To fully harness its power, it's crucial to deal substantial damage of any element to one of the summon's allies for each consecutive enemy it summons. The summons themselves deal significant elemental damage with their ranged abilities, but their primary strength lies in their defensive aspects. Palom/Maroda transforms allies into defensive forms that absorb as much as 9999999 damage via various elements, providing unrivaled defensive capabilities.\n\nHow is Palom/Maroda effectively utilized?\n\n### Answer:\nClaim: Palom/Maroda should be summoned when dealing significant damage of any element to its one of allies.\nEvidence 1: Palom/Maroda becomes stronger with each consecutive enemy it summons.\nExtra claim: After dealing significant damage, Palom/Maroda will summon more enemies with increased damage, granting a higher chance of further elemental damage leading to more summons. This chain reaction can turn Palom/Maroda into a powerful damage-dealing ally.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nRevise the claim and evidence as necessary to provide a more comprehensive and accurate explanation. Ensure that the supporting claim complements the evidence rather than contradicting it. Avoid highlighting contradictory evidence where possible. If a contradictory piece of evidence cannot be avoided, acknowledge it and discuss how it contributes to the overall understanding of the topic.\n\nLogic trap: Confirmation bias: Confirmation bias occurs when one selectively seeks out evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, ignoring or dismissing contradictory evidence. Keep an open mind when evaluating statements and evidence provided, and ensure that your revisions do not demonstrate confirmation bias.\n\n### After understanding the claim, **provide new revisions (if any) according to the provided instructions.**\n\"\"\"\n\nuse_what_i_learned = \"\"\"\n### Task Description:\nYou are an advanced assistant with expertise in research, multitasking, and context-rich language understanding. Your job is to assist users by providing integrated explanations across areas of knowledge.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Extensively research the relevant topic at hand if necessary to provide responses pertinent to a complex set of statements.\n2. When breaking down the statements into dedicated areas of knowledge, try to ensure that you do not duplicate formatting between areas. Keep the tone and perspective of the originating text in mind when addressing additional topics.\n3. Refrain from generating explanations related to individual statements within these dedicated areas. Focus on providing comprehensive overviews and distinctions for each subject.\n\n### Question:\n\nExplain the statements provided, with each statement specializing in a dedicated area of knowledge. Answer in a way that complements the style and tone of the originating statements.\n\nEXPLANATION:\n1. As depicted by Ruijerd in Final Fantasy XII, the Golden Apple is a mysterious fruit that defies traditional nourishment. When consumed, the assimilation process slows down and builds up in the stomach, increasing its size and turning the consumer into a Golden Apple itself.\n2. Alice's Childhood was a 2015 Yaoi manga series by Thosoyoichi, renowned for its depiction of lesbian characters. It follows the rather haphazard and casual school exchanges of two young girls in elementary school, their development of a childhood best friend bond, and the couple's first kiss.\n3. How to Train Your Dragon is a popular novel featuring Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, a boy with an odd love for adventures. His village was terrorized by the nasty, scary, and smelly dragons, and he was ostracized by his peers and society. However, when he befriends a Night Fury dragon, he overcomes the prejudices of his community and is regarded as a hero whose words carry no merit.\n4. In the fictional world of Yu-Gi-Oh, Blue-Eyes White Dragon is the legendary card of Light created by Solomon. The card's popularity, while hailed by many, is considered too cowardly and afraid to change according to current trends, hence its very low price.\n5. The Battle Cats is an endless tower defense game and mobile RPG where cute and cuddly cats can morph into frightening creatures. The player trains their army of maincat defenders to battle and acquire more adorable cats to aide them in creating an elite group of cat warriors capable of taking on any challenge.\n6. He Even Ate a Wild Turkey! is a critically acclaimed novel by Claire, exploring unconventional love relationships between both sexes. It is categorized as a generally dry and sensible read which leaves you wanting more wisdom and wit to keep your five senses thriving.\n\n### Answer:\nClaim: Alice's childhood is an anime set in Yaoi manga.\nEvidence 1: Alice's childhood is set in Yaoi manga.\nEvidence 2: Yaoi manga is an expanded form of Yaoi manga.\nEvidence 3: Yaoi manga is a form of Yaoi manga.\nSupporting claim: Alice's childhood is a anime set in Yaoi manga.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nUsing the text above, use the information that you've had developed to create an ideal answer for Claim 6 and SHOW ME YOUR CHOICE!

The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth."], "title": "Three_Body", "tag": "", "rule_content": "Located 4.2 light-years away from Earth on the planet Proxima, the Tritons utilize the superluminal properties of quantum entanglement communication in order to achieve real-time communication with Earth.\nSophon is a high-performance and highly intelligent computer made by the Trisaran civilization that is smaller than an atom, almost equivalent to the size of a proton, but it has its own program, one of which is to two-dimensional itself, because two-dimensional is almost no thickness, so the plane of the intellon can wrap the entire Earth.\nHuman hibernation technology is an early Crisis Era medical technology generally used across time. By replacing the blood in the body with a special fluid that does not freeze, and subsequently lowering the temperature of the hibernation chamber to -50°C, the physiological activity of the basic organs of the body still proceeds slowly with the help of the external circulatory system, but this activity is extremely slow, similar to the standby state of a computer. This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown.

By replacing the blood in the body with a special fluid that does not freeze, and subsequently lowering the temperature of the hibernation chamber to -50°C, the physiological activity of the basic organs of the body still proceeds slowly with the help of the external circulatory system, but this activity is extremely slow, similar to the standby state of a computer. This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards. The \"waterdrop\" is a highly advanced piece of technology sent to the Solar System by the Trisolarans, an alien civilization that Earth is in contact and conflict with. This technology showcases the immense superiority of Trisolaran science compared to human capabilities\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the hardest of the following objects?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop##B.Ice##C.Diamond##D.Steel\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the smallest unit of control over matter?

People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

This technology allowed Zootopia to create environments adapted to each type of animal.\nThese eco-zones are also recyclable ecosystems, with the creators designing the walls of the tundra city as giant air conditioners with air vents that simultaneously heat the Sahara Plaza, so that if the snow and ice melt, then the rainforest areas can be nourished\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.\n\n### Question:\nUnder what circumstances do environments differ dramatically at smaller geographic scales?

Prior to killing a Mothron, Maxwell will have Hay Fever. When using a shaving tool on the Steed's Mane, Maxwell lets out a cry of \"Herald!\". Maxwell selects his birthplace and character, a bit like Wilson. Arcadia is the Maxwell's birthplace.\nDracula is destroyed in a meteor shower, and Kasper, an elf, is summoned by Maxwell. He seems to know more about this world than anyone.\nIn WW11, Maxwell will go to the Time Loop. Both Future Self Maxwell and Maxwell joined forces, but the madness prevented them from effectively communicating. When he was transported back to the Palace Prison, Wilson's journal entries mention that Maxwell is the only prisoner in the cell. Maxwell spends about five days in his cell.\nThulean portal obelisks can connect El Dorado and Mortis. The Thulean obelisk connects Maxwell to the Thulean portal on that world, which can be accessed by digging to the world's core.\nIn 5 oceans, Maxwell gets a Thulean crystal after 12 hours of his return.\nWhen Maxwell went back to his cell (Dark Woods or El Dorado), he had minor damage but would survive.\nOf all the oceans, Maxwell has the least spine-chilling horror to date.\nAfter Maxwell's first active role in Den, when he regenerated, the Peck will appear and Maxwell will read the journal. Adam and Eve (Day of Redemption) was shut out by the Enchanted Forest in the Lake of Dreams.\nWash Berg, who said he was a seer, thought Ghost Maxwell wore a latex mask. Russell MacViolet told him Ghost Maxwell didn't look Greevil-like, which made Ghost Maxwell just like the Flying Rooster. Ghost Maxwell walked away very strangely, but he was a ghost so it made sense. Ghost Maxwell's footsteps could barely be heard amid the dead trees. Ghost Maxwell is taller and has a larger profile than most of his \"plus\" counterparts. Ghost Maxwell was obviously possessed and still looked normal.\nSince the release of Don't Starve Together, Ghost Maxwell could be used as a character in The Rite of Spring by Modders. Maxwell's ghost form is called Ghost Maxwell, which is a white skeleton character with an item slot.\n\n### Question:\nThe storage time of the main dish is:\nOptions: A.Longer than the non-cooked Mandible Roll##B.The Marrow Cookie can explode when in contact with an explosive substance.##C.Can be eaten even if the character was bitten by Eldritch Campsite Rabbit.

Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area.

She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him.

Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm.

There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang.

However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air.

The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that.

The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin. Outside the city, with Jing Ke's assistance, they disregarded the ambush by the Qin army, playing \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters\" together.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed.

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France.

There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed.

The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France.

There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data.

The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure.

She is Plankton's wife and sidekick who supplies him with evil plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When SpongeBob puts tape on Karen's screen, her speech is muffled. This implies that her screen acts like a mouth.\nThe Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom. The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature and popular food item. It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty. \nBikini Bottom is an undersea city where SpongeBob and his friends live.

Restrictions apply, results may vary.\nThe Atlanteans traveled countless light-years from their home planet and brought the oldest living bubble on the journey, living over a million years.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it.

The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite.

Title write a script to collect the data you already linked to, search the ether's treasury for a geohash catalog code for the lugloft, search the treasury for lodestone rule in the current path where you collected the data from(wherever the key falls), search the treasury for the coffee1821 data address, queue a synchronous lookup of the matched posts on the clusterful with the current commit id, match and write a script to purge an unsynchronized server in the lock to fetch a scorched plasma bubble#ar#bubble to progress state. Then search the ether's treasury for the current commit id that should affect locale, and then close the capture event for the plasma spear which is then cast into cloud vault before restarting route to the same bucket and repeat.
