The AI learns how to look at propositional symbols and symbols like \">\". For each student, there is a hypothesis indicating the accuracy of what they said (entirely correct, partly correct, entirely incorrect). The model must transform propositional statements into symbols, follow the rules to create a comparative expression, and finally provide the truth value.\n\nThe main output format for this task is a set of questions that need to be answered. The interpretation of the output should be brief, precise, clear, and free of typos.\n\nIn the field of AI/ML, the three main components used to reach a solution are data, algorithm, and infrastructure. While data stores all the learning used to support the algorithm's requirements, these data are persistently handled, searched, extracted, and created in the infrastructure."}

Unlike previous prompts, your role is to analyze two well-known statements about a logical predicate that are based on common deductive logic. Four options are given below, each providing an interpretation using the logical statement only. If the statement and its negation refer to the elements of the set, the answer is A; if neither the statement nor its negation refers to the elements of the set, the answer is B; if the statement refers to the elements of the set and its negation does not, the answer is C; if neither the statement nor its negation refers to the elements of the set and the statement refers to the elements of the set, the answer is D.

Here are some examples that have been verified:\u201d\u201c\u201c\n### Task: Determine whether the given logical formula satisfies the given condition.\nit is not possible to deduce which statements in the logical predicate can correspond to the elements of the set based on common deductive logic, but the task describes a meet condition and an observation, and there are more than one choices, but only one of them can be stored in memory. Therefore, by analyzing the logical statements given in the task and the observation, it can be inferred that the statement in the logical predicate refers to the elements of the set, and its negation does not refer to the elements of the set.\nObservation: it is not possible to deduce which statements in the logical predicate can correspond to the elements of the set based on common deductive logic, but the task describes a meet condition and an observation, and there are more than one choices, but only one of them can be stored in memory. Therefore, by analyzing the logical statements given in the task and the observation, it can be inferred that neither the statement in the logical predicate nor its negation refers to the elements of the set and the statement in the logical predicate refers to the elements of the set.\n\nSummation of all first digits of all numbers satisfies commutativity, and the proof is as follows.\nThe task description is consistent with the observation description, and they are both valid under the same set of conditions. To verify the task description, we can use the following method:\nSuppose we have two numbers, a and b, such that a is the first digit of b, and b is the first digit of a. If a = b, then a + b = a + a = b + a = b + b, so the addition operation is commutative under this set of conditions. You can use the calculation deduction function of python to verify the task description.\u201d\u201d\u201c\n### Task: Determine whether the given logical formula satisfies the given condition.\nWhether a logical predicate refers to the elements of the set is determined by checking whether the predicate connectivity operator is satisfied for the elements in the set, where a predicate exists if it is always true for the corresponding element. Given a logical predicate, can we retrieve its corresponding set? If yes, output 0; if no, output 1.\nObservation: Given a logical predicate, it is possible to retrieve its corresponding set by defining the set as the set of all elements that satisfy the logical predicate.\n\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks.

Specifically, the statement that its relationship is either universal or particular, and that the relationship is either an affirmative or negative.\n\nAssume an object is A,X,B,Y,C, etc. If a contained object X in the A group has a certain relation Q and contains a certain property P with Y, a connection C is connected, resulting in the proposition of molecular statements.\n\nThe four basic types are as follows:\n- Universal Affirmative Molecular Statement (UMAS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q and possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as APB, also known as Affirmative Molecular Statement (AMS), abbreviated as AMA.\n- Universal Negative Molecular Statement (UNS): All the contained ones A and X of the A group have a certain relationship Q but do not possess a certain state property P with another B and Y of the whole B group, abbreviated as ASPB, also known as Negative Molecular Statement (NMS, Number), abbreviated as ANM.\n- Particular Affirmative Molecular Statement (PNS): Some A and X in the A group have the relationship Q with B and Y in the whole B group, share the state-related property P, and asserted.\n- Particular Negative Molecular Statement (PSM): Some A and X in the group A have the relationship Q, but they do not share the state property P with B and Y in the group B.\n\n### For example:\n- All A and B are composed of C and H.\n- Every earthly object is made from atoms.\n\nRefer to the above example on how to conduct a philosophical analysis.\n\n### Question:\nAnalyze the following statement.\n\"All adults over 25 years old have a university degree.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[+/Men/University]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Men]]\n\n### Question:\nProfessor A said: \"All dogs are living things.\"\nProfessor B said: \"No cats are living things.\"\nProfessor C said: \"There are both cats and dogs that live on the earth.\"\n\nChoose these three phrases carefully from the following category.\n- Animals that are dogs as well as living things.\n- Animals that are not cats and are living things.\n- There are animals that are called dogs, cats, and living things.\n\nWhat is Professor B's choice?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nShoes for playing sports and shoes for running are distinct:\n- Any tennis shoe is a sports shoe, but not all sports shoes are tennis shoes.\n- All running shoes are sports shoes, but not all sports shoes are running shoes.\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[], []].\n\n### Answer:\n[[sports/_],[sports/_]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"If everything sent by cats is heated by fire, then everything sent by pigs is not heated by fire.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular statement does this claim constitute?\n\"I agree with A, and everyone who agrees with A dissociates from B.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of categorical proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Her performance was either satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/E/I/O]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular proposition does this claim constitute?\n\"Beauty is either an external broadness or an inner broadness.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[APB/ASPB/ANM/AMA]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANM]]\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nConditional Claim:\nA categorical claim that is structured in a unique way. \nIt asserts that a specific relationship exists among the subject, the predicate, and the term that serves as the contrapostulate. The relationship can be either affirmative or negative.\n\nConditional proposition of the affirmative relationship (AC): The knowledge that if all subjects possess a certain predicate, they must respectively possess a certain contrapostulate. Its abbreviation is ARBQ, also known as an affirmative conditional proposition or bi-thesis proposition.\n\nConditional proposition of the negative relationship (NC): The knowledge that if no subject possesses a certain predicate, then all subjects must respectively possess the opposite of the subject. Its abbreviation is ARB\u00afQ, also known as a negative conditional proposition or anti-disjunction proposition.\n\nUsing English for example:\n- If anything admits of quantity, it must be an accident.\n- If anything is a proper name, then there are plenty of words that do not occur in it at all.\n\nHere are some common exam questions:\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- The Kings of England. If there are kings in England, no one can depose or dethrone them.\n- Conditional proposition with essential internal relations:\n- Owlish faces. Beakers are tall, clear, and narrow. If a face is owlish then it is always beaker-shaped.\n- External relations: All coins are money. If anything is money, the constable can take it away.\n- External relations: According to traditional logic, all gnomes are machines. If there is a mechanical environment, then there are undoubtedly gnomes in it.\n\nCategorize them according to your ability in conjunction with the standardization.\n\n### Question:\nMy brother, for example, always loves to read. With that in mind, he may indulge in any other pleasure besides reading.\n\nWhat type of conditional proposition does it constitute?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARB_Q]]\n\n### Question:\nAnalyze the following statement.\n\"All mammals are viviparous.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[+/Men/University]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Men]]\n\n### Question:\nProfessor A said: \"If something is a formation, there must be a component.\"\nProfessor B said: \"Nothing is indefinite about enthusiasm unless they are motivations in nature.\"\nProfessor C said: \"If a planet is not a rocky planet, then it cannot be a planet.\"\n\nChoose these three phrases carefully from the following category.\n- I f there are rocks, there must be lands.\n- Nothing that is volunteer work is earthbound and limited.\n- Rocks are limited by bounds due to the fact that they are lands.\n\nWhich one of the three does Professor B believe?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[1/2/3]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of statement does this statement constitute?\n\"If the raptor man is not monopolistic, officially it must be a free marketer.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARBQ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of molecular statement does this statement constitute?\n\"A gum is either benign or inflammatory.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[ARBQ/ARB_Q]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ARB_"}

You can test the output using a web browser.\n\nPlease review if I should add a logic rule for\nproving conjunction of universally quantified propositions. The logic rule for proving the conjunction of universally quantified propositions can be added to the instructions as follows:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by \u2227 (and) or \u22c0 (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by \u2228 (or) or \u22c1 (NOR).\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this rule:\n\n### Instruction:\nIf the claim includes complex logical expressions, ensure the proof reflects the correct logical operations. For instance, the conjunction is represented by \u2227 (and) or \u22c0 (NAND), and the disjunction is represented by \u2228 (or) or \u22c1 (NOR).\n\n### Rule:\nComplex logical claims must adhere to standard notation and symbols:\n- \u2227 (or \u22c0) represents conjunction (and)\n- \u2228 (or \u22c1) represents disjunction (or)\n\n### Question:\nGiven the logical claim:\n\nPP\u2227M\u2192QM\u2192N\u2228OS\u2228 \u22c0 (M\u2192N), \u2228 (O\u2192S), T\u2192S \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 P, T\u2234 Q\n\nUsing the standard notation and symbols and following the previous instructions, prove the claim.\n\n### Answer:\nThe claim seems to be a statement, not an expression for proof. It is unclear how to prove or disprove a statement directly using logical operations. If the question is to determine the statement's validity using the rule of quantifier influence on conjunctions and disjunctions, then the answer is:\n\nThe statement is valid because the conjunction and disjunction are true for all values of P, M, Q, N, O, and S, since there are no specific quantifiers provided on these variables. However, if the intention was to prove the statement using the provided logic rules, please provide a separate instance for that purpose.\n\n### Question:\nFor every A gardener who doesn't water the Rose plants will kill some of them. Not all of the Rose Pots contain Red Rose plants. No Red Rose plant will blossom. However, some of the someone pots contain Green Rose plants. No Green Rose plant will die. It's likewise for the blue roses. If the previous claim is real, then Cillier the Busy Gardener will kill some Red Rose plants. If he decides to water all the green pots then.\n\nThis question does not seem to belong to the logic topic or asking for verification of a proof.

Upon examining the valid moods of III form above, the only valid mood leading to \u2203S\u21d2P from P\u21d2M and Q\u21d2S is AAI. Moreover, as it was mentioned earlier, it is possible to vary the statements' location, distribution, and quantity without invalidating the syllogistic argument.\nThe given premises and conclusion constitute a syllogism of III form and AAI mood.\n\n### Question:\nGiven the logical statements P\u21d2M and Q\u21d2S, where the premises are in a universal mood, determine the figure and mood of the correct syllogistic form which will yield \u2200M\u21d2P.\n\n### Answer:\nMap the statements to the syllogistic form, For example: MOP \u2261 MSP\n1 MOP S()M \u2234S()P\nAs shown above, in this series of syllogistic argumentation, we make the following substitution: MAP \u2261 MSP \u2192 MA() \u2261 M()S.\nSince MOP is equivalent to MA(), we have the following syllogistic form: MOP \u2261 M()S. Therefore, the plea form is of Figure IV. To reiterate, Q\u21d2S needs to be translated into \u2200Q\u21d2\u2203S: All Q are S \u21d4 \u2200Q\u21d2\u2203S\nTo rewrite the premises and conclusion in this statement, we make the following substitutions: P\u21d2M \u2261 P\u21d2\u2200M \u2192 \u2200P\u21d2\u2200M; Q\u21d2S \u2261 Q\u21d2\u2203S \u2192 \u2200Q\u21d2\u2203S; \u2200M\u21d2P \u2261 \u2200M\u21d2\u2203P\nThus, the conclusion is a 1\u2019 global grade in philosophy. We have the following series of assertions:\nMOP \u2261 MSP \u2192 MA() \u2261 M()S \u2192 MOP \u2261 M()S \u2192 \u2200P\u21d2\u2200M (P\u21d2M) \u2192 \u2200Q\u21d2\u2203S (Q\u21d2S) \u2192 \u2200M\u21d2\u2203P (\u2200M\u21d2P)\nAs shown above, the conclusion is \u2200M\u21d2P, which in turn shows that S\u21d2P because it is specifically true for every S\u2019s positive token (true for all objects). Moreover, the argumentation cannot be otherwise true except in the case of an informal target assertion of S\u21d2P. Because it\u2019s only natural for all possible arguments to be informal for the premise S\u21d2P. Given this reasoning, we can infer that \u2234SAP is a V form syllogistic argumentation with the happy mood.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."}

A multiple-choice question asks, \"Which US president had this quote: 'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.'?\"\n    Answer: \"Abraham Lincoln, US president from 1861 to 1865, is often associated with this quote. The answer depends on the question context and the available options.\"\n\n2. If a question is about whether London is in France, the answer should be 'No' without further elaboration.\n\n3. If a question is phrased that doesn't have an answer, the answer is \"The given question does not have a correct answer because ...\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Which star is the furthest from the Sun?\"\n    Answer: \"The question does not have a correct answer because there is no specific way to determine the furthest star from the Sun.\"\n\n4. If a question is ill-defined or requires too much context to answer, the answer should be \"The question is unclear, please rephrase or provide additional context.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"Who was Jesus?\"\n    Answer: \"The question is unclear. Was it asking about a specific time in Jesus' life, an aspect of his character, or something else?\"\n\n5. If there is no coherent answer to the question, the answer is \"There is no coherent answer to the given question.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is x ?\", when x has no context.\n    Answer: \"There is no coherent answer to the question, given that there is no value for the variable X defined.\"\n\n6. If the question is an incomplete instruction, the answer is \"The question is missing critical information.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What does X plus Y equal?\" when X and Y have no values.\n    Answer: \"The question is missing critical information to solve it. In this case, the values for X and Y are unknown.\"\n\n7. If a question has incoherent premises, the answer is \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is a person's favorite food at a restaurant with no menu?\"\n    Answer: \"The question's premises seem incoherent or require clarification, as it's unclear whether there's a functionally existing menu or where the question's context is set.\"\n\n8. If the question is based on a premise that is false, the answer is \"The question's premise is false.\"\n    Example: If the question is \"What is the capital of Rhode Island?\" when Rhode Island does not accurately describe its capital.\n    Answer: \"The question's premise is false, as Rhode Island is not the name of America.

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nHeating of contaminated water and zinc chloride in a reflux apparatus.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n####\nHmmm...that's interesting.

Historically, gutta-percha, a natural rubber-like substance, and horse hair fibers were combined to create various cordages. The combination was flexible and lightweight, while the horse hair fiber provided ruggedness. Due to the availability of synthetic fibers like cotton, the composite cables using horse hair fibers have changed, but they can still function without cross bonding.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Yes]]"}

These trademarks are used to distinguish the production or service characteristics of the producer or administrator. You can also provide the Intensional Definition and the two principles of the registration principle for trademarks.\n\n### Answer:\nTrademark Intensional Definition:\n\nA trademark, distinct from a patent, is a sign used to distinguish a company's goods or services, or both, from other companies' goods or services. A trademark, often known as a brand mark, is a distinctive image, inscription, or design that distinguishes a company's items. Trademarks are distinct from protected intellectual property.\n\nPrinciples of existence:\n\n1. Distinguishability: A trademark should be distinctive to distinguish the goods or services of one entity from those of others.\n2. Ownership: A trademark should be owned or controlled by the entity that uses it.\n3. Legality: A trademark should not cause confusion, misleading, deception, or offense to consumers or other businesses.\n\nTrademark registration:\n\n1. Exclusivity: A registered trademark gives the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with the goods or services for which it is registered.\n2. Public notice: A registered trademark is published in the trademark registry, making it known to the public and other businesses.\n\nI hope this is helpful and pragmatic.
