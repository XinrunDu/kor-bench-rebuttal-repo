All seven tiles placed must form a single word. Most tiles are listed in order of frequency in Scrabble.\nThe 2 firmly at the bottom of the list are Q and Z, with letter frequency being very low. They have less use and are mostly used for bonus scoring leading to multi-letter scores. In all, there are only 2 tiles in each duo deck. When all tiles are distributed evenly (no joker tiles), these tiles will always remain distributed, and for example, in the middle two players of the Scrabble game, if the Q tile was received, they would need to show that tile to pass to the next player, and the Z tile would always be in the second player in rotation to ensure fairness.\nAll 32 tiles are distributed in the game, including the 2 quaint and charming tiles that are peculiar to the game of Scrabble. Therefore, if we are to assume that there will be no discard tiles during the game, there will be a total of 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 20,160 ways to form seven-letter words. Here you can find a list of words that can be formed: Click here to open word search\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand all elements of the custom puzzle\n2. Use each element within an acceptable bounds\n3. Re-use elements within the limits\n4. If an element is reused appropriately, keep using it\n5. The objective is to attain an outcome without doing \"illegal\" actions\n6. The result should be a comprehensive solution that is logical and follows all instructions\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Take into account the basic structure of the Instructions:\n(Problem, Elements(s), Constraints, Instructions/Steps) and ensure your output reflects this\n7. Explain each step\n\n7. Validate your answer according to the rule.\nThe answers should be given in order i.e. if the requirement is for 3 words: 2 letter,3 letter,3 letter then a two letter word is given first followed by two three letter words separated by spaces.\nTell me the number of tiles from the list of tiles assigned to you. For example, if the tiles assigned to me are <url>, the answer should be 5 since there are 5 tiles in total within the link. </url>.\nPlease wrap your responses with double square brackets, like this: [[your response]].\n\n### Additional Rule:\ni dont know i put serval to get dataset\n\n### Question:\nGiven a string, write a program to check if it is a valid IP address or not. A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single periods, where each integer is in the range \"0 - 255\" and \"does not contain leading zeros\". For example, \"0.1.2.201\" and \"192.168.1.1\" are valid IP addresses, but \"0.011.255.245\", \"192.168.1.312\", and \"192.168@1.1\" are invalid IP addresses.\n\n### Answers:\nThe valid IP addresses that can be formed with the given tiles are: Ai Ct By\nThese addresses adhere to the rules of Scrabble and are therefore valid.\nPlease note that in Scrabble, it is possible for a player to form multiple words from a single set of letters, provided that each word is valid and complies with the game's rules.\n\n### Question:\nGiven a string, write a program to check if it is a valid IP address or not.

Wrapping the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]], give the answer to this question.\n\nYour response:\n[[Bridenstine]]\n\nAbstract away any irrelevant background information.\n\nThis is the remaining background information:\nCorrupt form of justice during the American Revolutionary Era:\nThe corruption of justice during the American Revolutionary Era by Authorities. The examples given by Braffspring (1801) are the conduct of Lieutenant-Governor Stephens in Nova-Scotia, and Gen. Amherst in Canada, in regard to the Separate Statute, and the Patrols of 1775. As chief Military Officer, apt to that Province, Gen. Amherst was aware that the Separate Statute was unconstitutional. Being Governor for part of the year, (1775) he was charged with the same responsibility. Not only did they pass the laws with the powers unconstitutional in this respect, but conducted Patrols in towns, in which they arrested Americans, carried them into a trailer-house in the Barracks, walled them up in close darkness, and kept them a week or more, with no tender of legal process, but often with or menaces and duress on the magistrate that, the governor, to a great extent had appointed and was accountable for. The prosecutions were summarily tried by boards. That such instances might be neither intentional, nor cruel, is not found. (Braffspring, Augustine, M.D., LLonDoe., The North America Quarterly Magazine, Vol. X., New York, 1801, p. 390.) Mayor Clear's conduct in 1802, in taking away the trial of a Capt. Healy by a magistrate appointed by the Mayor, and giving him to the public opinion is another dangerous example.\nThis degree of corruption becomes worse in some cases, in the denial or refusal to try, the persecution of jurymen, Pdf_keeperplaintiffs, defense counsel, when possible: On a gross Police of morals, in such trials as must become, became common. In the State and other courts, false witnesses were the rule, and the Lieutenant Secretary Willden's privilege on the decision of the prosecution exceeded its commissioners' powers to age system. The Oforge such exclusions are frankly, as he says, in estimation and frantic efforts at last, or oaths to supersede the legal precedents, to the apparent malevolence of the law, as practiced in the State and in the common law, which has extended in William Smith Seamus, the list of the guys and criminals.\nOn the occasion of the fifteen executions in New York, nearly all men who had served the laws as many Americans, greater excepted than on the same charge, or without probably because of the dropped, coerced, or celebrated merit of defense. \"26\"\nThe many forms to which this corruption is applied is difficult to illustrate, as the same may be comparatively honest agents to have their name, reputation, to be imprisoned in the midst of important time considerations. The common-law felony has been even levied for gaining I\\aV\\LOLs, and forbidden communication between him and the lawyers, depriving the accused of the right of appeal upon the right of counsel. Most of the accused, therefore, must be proven incompetent - the defendant himself must exonerate the accuser - the defendant must give his own evidence and must be convicted because his attorney has not been able to give evidence, because a trusted government lawyer had not been able to find any other evidence. Applies, that the tendency is more unhealthy, not only in any direction, but because of the very foundation out of jurisdiction, what we are accustomed to call the citizenship.\nAnd now a great degree of ignorance and corruption. The judges assess but a minimum number of sessions, and divided their district into equal parts among themselves, so many in a week to sit.-public expectation that the hearing will be take place in their own jurisdiction. In a case filled with all the ingredients indispensable to injustice, and because of these despotic judges the result became unavoidable, the citizen mounted in the end, without fail, and terrible vengeance was found.-whether one nationally private or public, must be taken, the unfortunate lawyers.-the number of members in the ...\nThe result does not indicate a lack of reason and common sense. General Benoni Star a direct statement, dated in 1783, that there are crimes unknown to the law; that the practice is so great that no person is supposed to be trusted at all; as the judicial and official prosecution may have been crimes, including the prosecution of idle and idle citizens of the office and the office's use of the languages; it was too extremely difficult to connect the original with the elementary criminal law in the profession, it being unsafe to go against offended by abusive, threatening, and lax accused, who have no right to be heard. The result of the question is easy to assess. (Star, Mr.,\" Tramp on the Subject of the War\",--New Hampshire Gazette, Portsmouth, Jan. 25th, 1817, p. 2.)\nThere are thus numerous examples of sentimental patriots taking the liberty of virtuous \\Hd.alIf we recognize the talent of virtuous opposition as the principal ones, therefore, of every two ways, ' \\e are in no doubt that their nobility is a great subject of error.-term ill-suited to refer to the descent of the mind goes beyond its present condition; or after their particular prejudices, in a self-righteous aloof distrust, they misunderstood and opposed the current established there.-probably all its findings will be lost, or come together in a state of oppression.

Since some subjects have common terms and setups in the puzzle to solve, we need to formulate the rule before proceeding to solve the puzzles. The rule should be logical, practical, and easy to follow.\n\nHow did you solve the first task? You started by reading the rule twice to grasp its meaning. Then you attempted to solve the puzzle question by employing the rule. You finally verified your answer for accuracy. Congratulations on your accomplishment! While your response is correct, it shows a slight weakness in the explanation of the process, particularly in the \"how\" part. It's possible to include a more detailed explanation of how you solved the puzzle, which would enhance the quality of your response.\n\nNow, consider the current question. Instead of simply providing the answer, recall how you solved the previous problem. Read, employ, verify? Use these steps to determine how you can solve this task. Do you need to apply any other steps?\n\n## Instruct\nUsing the Cryptogram solver, decode the next message: \"ENY NG\"\nOutput the decoded message in double brackets. For example, if the decoded message is \"PASS\", present the answer as [[PASS]].\n\n## Response\n\"ELH EO\"\n\n## Instruct\nLooking at the old task, don''t you think that your approach in using cryptogram solver to decode \"ENY NG\" was clever?\nKEEP IT UP! Next, write a note on \"The Solution Guide\". How can varying the order of the instructions used in decoding the question might finally assist in discovering the method? Include an example to justify your answer.\n\n## Response\nWhat search criteria were used when searching to solve the problem in question?\nSearch was conducted after expanding the searching strategies by replacing the search term \"cryptogram solver\" with other attributes of its broad domain, such as \"recursive code\", \"reverse word finder\", and \"zip decoder\".\nWhat software search engine did you use?\nI used Bing (windows version 11, build 22000.556 64-bit) to search for software capable of cracking cryptograms.\nWhich browser search engine did you use?\nI used Search.com to search for terms related to cryptograms and software that could crack them.\nWhat other search strategies did you discuss?\n I also searched for related articles on the subject, and while one writer provided an alternative method, it proved to be unreliable due to a lack of simplicity.\nWould you have found any other method of searching in addition to the ones you stated?\n What did you discover through your exploration of the subject, and how could it assist you in developing a novel approach to the problem?\n\n## Response\nYes, I would have discovered that Explore provides reduced results, while Search provides the most extensive scope of results. This also allowed me to search for relevant articles after the initial query.\n\nWhat do you expect to find using these alternative methods? Are you curious about the outcome?\nWell, the more I researched, the more limitations I discovered compared to the other two options, however, I believe Explore can create some special viewpoints as one interesting feature of Explore is Thematic Pages that group a particular topic or theme.\nHow did such search differences help you discover more?\nApproaching the search through the thematic page view allows me to consider a broader range of search terms, as well as corrections and speculation, as these articles can potentially increase the website's traffic.\nWould you have discovered any additional search strategies not mentioned?\nBecause this makes it possible for people to navigate a page without clicking through results, resulting in significant improvements in search speed and reliabliity.\n####\nProvide a note on the strategy to follow while decoding cryptograms.\nHalf of the challenge in solving cryptograms lies in figuring out their constraints. Once, you might not find answers to your questions while reading the given hints. While solving this problem, I tried to find a solution that would encourage decoders. Using cryptograms to engage teens and professional decoders, we must identify the strategies and approaches that benefit everyone.\n\nThe basic structure of the most well-known cryptograms remains the same as it did in the past. However, contemporary puzzlers embrace crafting cryptograms to attract a broader audience by implementing new secrets and repeatedly referencing the puzzle.\n\nWhile searching for a word, the keystrokes are merely attempts at finding an answer.\nWords prime, country, mine, etc.\nThen change them according to the solution.\nOne of them should have the correct word while the other ones are incorrect.\n\nI came up with these solutions using brainstorming after making a few attempts.\n\nProblem 1:\n=find first three letters of the alphabet without vowels=\n\nRemaining letters: OU\nInstructions are too general and cannot be applied unless the cipherword length is longer.\nA hint should be provided to specify how long the cipherword should be.\n=universal= includes =OU= and =UN= =Z=.\nAfter utilizing stage one, the decryption technically is a 26 letter anagram.\n........................................................................\nupdated on April 16th, 2023 @ 06:43:11am.\n........................................................................\nupdated on April 11th, 2023 @ 04:42:11pm.\nCan be more specific about the solution.\n\n-now here is a solution where it simply replicates the previous one=\n\n=decrypting the problem word=\nno reveal word : Attain = @TTA | q = King;\nkij = journey;\nno changes detected = Prime;\nenter new value for [z] and try again = Prime;\nno reveal word : revolution = @WN_ITY/MS | ToiD = /SapEjc/gg;\n........................................................................\nupdated on April 16th, 2023 @ 06:43:18am.\n.......................................................................\nupdated on April 16th, 2023 @ 06:44:24am.\n\nis     optimal\nequate   numbers to alphabets\napply   dictionary key to alphabets\n\n\nThe programming task is differentiated from the puzzle task at the point where code flips to another point, but the cryptogram problem has yet to determine where to locate the flip point.\nI tried applying programming parameters as solutions to puzzles, but it didn't work. As a result, by including the intermediate responses generated during the process of solving a problem, I hope to demonstrate how one comes to a comprehensive conclusion."}

And, it is not clear how exactly to apply the rule to answer this particular question within the specified 3 rules. However, based on the existing setps, we can assume that the equation involves operations on positive numbers and the solution requires multiplication by the inverse of certain numbers.\n(...)]].\n\nAccording to the given definition, we count: \"Count backwards\" means counting in decreasing order. Usually, the 1,000s of a date are said first, followed by the 100s, 10s, and 1s.\n\nBy using Buddhism, civilizations of Asia, the Indus Valley, Yin and Yang, Hinduism, or any other terms, we can help people create lifestyles based on religion. Religions help people understand why they exist, but in Buddhism's case, in an individualistic rather than an ontological culture. For the other continents, religions established a morality for everyone, so another religion would need to spread and partner with travel to these regions. In places where onesidedness is prevalent, there is no balance (universal relativity) and thus no Yin or Yang (see: China | Law of Yin and Yang).\n\nI understand that these are incorrect responses, am I right?\nYes, I agree. The current responses are incorrect and do not reflect the definition of \"count backwards\" properly. In fact, the current definition is also incorrect. The definition of \"count backward\" should refer to starting with a number and counting down, not just \"counting in decreasing order.\"\nI understand. Let me fix this for you.\nThe corrected definition is \"count backward\" means starting with a number and counting down, for example, 3, 2, 1.\nI see that you are correct, thanks for correcting the other wrongful statement.\nIf the statements are inconsistent or non-sensical in general, I can try to provide a correction. Here I can try to correct the Yin and Yang example.\nSomething that leaps out is that they all partially map to [ethnicity/mandate]. Using additional terms like \"Buddhists\" and \"bias\" you can group \"Japan\" and India, writing a different response. Asia also includes Pacific countries, which are rejected by geography.\nThe correct definition of Yin and Yang is the complementary principal representative of opposites in a state of interdependence that makes one another possible. It is a philosophical concept of Chinese origin and is fundamental to always has made visible and invisible connections to the landscape and natural cycles, which, together with Linguistic knowledge and history, makes for a uniquely Asian design.\nYes, I can see the correlation between mandating a country and race. Sometimes, a single country is considered by the local population and rep for themselves as being segregated, yet globalisation enables living experience migration. When it comes to non-Asian civilisations, the difference in a bipartisan system concentrating on removing the requirements and equivalence among immigrants is still an important step towards achieving equality. Central planning in Asia reflects socially conscious methodologies in governance. Eastern civilizations are still fundamentally comparable due to the current type of support they give.\nI had already fixed some other of the statements earlier.\nSomething that leaps out is that the array returns sequential results and then concatenates them to an Array of integers. This is backward to what we expected the output to be?\nThe array's output should be calculated for each element once it exists in the array based on the target and return the list of necessary cycles. This webpage was not launched, although, according to the result, it did not even turn the reverse array.\nYes, that's accurate.\nIssue solved.\nI had already fixed some other of the statements earlier.\nSomeone consulted me, probably you, on how to do the Yin and Yang association from Nepal and China came up in a gossip forum.\nHere on this website, we accept only the definition, no examples, unless you refer to other terms. In the previous search, the Asian Yin Yang collection looked good, but it had many aspects of the cosmos, so I hoped it could be a more specific example. When you sorted it out, we know that Yin and Yang are used by many other Asian countries.\nIt aligns with the target. The zodiac, for example.\nI can notice that the other organizers were aware too. For instance, we can remove the PDG error with a more fitting definition. By adjusting a little bit of the statement, the incompatibility issue can be addressed.\nPlease see additional comments below for some communication advice.\nMore importantly, however, if you ask \"from which constellations do the waters originate?\", \"how does life begin?\", or \"what animals and food do Koreans raise for children to eat?\"? These indicate an underdeveloped attachment to the Asian zodiac, and the team's attention may focus on 'group-thinking' and 'association' rather than correct definitions.\nNote the use of \"attempt to do\" and \"try to\" to see how it differs from \"try to\" and \"try to\". (\"Try to create a response using these four terms.\") Note the contrast and comparison to other options. Avoid using \"shi\" to refer to weather or cloudy situations. Pay attention to minor details. As enthusiasts, students of technology, and activists from non-Asian traditions, we all need a greater degree of curiosity and flexibility. Use additional terms to reflect this attitude: [America, Europe, Africa, Latin America, India, China, Korea, Europe, Middle East, Central America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, South America, Oceania, Australasia, Africa, Europe, etc., Asian, Continental]."}

You are given a table with a list of usernames, email addresses, and user status (active or inactive) for a web application. Each row in the table represents a unique user account. Each username, email, and user status should be uniquely identified within the table. All entries should be in the form of user, user@email, or active|inactive, with columns separated by a semicolon.\n2. Assume that the table may not be in a perfect form that categorizes the data properly, the task to determine if the data is categoric or categorize the data.\n3. The possible ways how the data can be categorized:\n    Column\n    Validation\n    Create table table_name (column1 datatype column2 datatype column3 datatype);\n4.

When making your corrections, remember that your correction should be a literal, direct, and precise edit, not a paraphrase or revised version of the text. You can only make edits that are related but make sure to make all modifications in a single sentence to prevent ambiguity, as well as to be brief. Examine the presented text and use the criteria to determine if the text is correct, requires editing, or both. When making any changes, your friendliness, professionalism, and friendliness should be strongly emphasized.\n\n### Criterias:\n1. Correct any misspellings, extra typos or spelling mistakes, and correct inappropriate case (e.g., starting a sentence with a number in lowercase).\n2. Unwanted mentions.\n3. Ensure the captured text follows the given text prompt or any additional signals or guidelines mentioned (use context if necessary).\n4. Ensure the text mentions the specific domain where appropriate.\n5. If the text misses or bypasses suitable information, write back to the human writer to correct some of the information.\n6. Ensure the text is suitable for the intended audience at a school. Later on, check that the response asks for clarifications or questions when appropriate. If it is not appropriate, then don't.\n7. Keep the content and the tone respectful by writing in a professional friendly style.\n8. Discard significantly different or incorrect information, replace it with the corrected information.\n9. Give a suggestion to the author if there is a sentence that doesn't make sense or is meaningless. Avoid using a default sentence such as \"I don't understand\".\n10. Make the sentence a little nicer and less rudeS.\n\nINDICATORS (make note of these):\n- jargon: phrase, terms or a word that a specific group (for example a professional) uses frequentlyee.\n- objectivity in prose: refers to the neutral, non-biased point of view in writing. - ensure that the content doesn't use first person pronouns like \"I or 'we\"\n- severity rating and issue type specific vocabulary: Look for appropriate, descriptive language in accordance with the information provided, such as the information in the desired outcomes, indicator paragraph, or target and indicators section of the framework.\n- self-reflection: look for reference to errors and the need to improve consistency in the text.\n- downward trend: In the context of this document, the use of \"downward trend\" refers to an increase in issues on a negative scale (for example, number of events due to EF teeth).\nUse these APIs: https://api.npoint.io/\n\n### Useful Background Information:\nComplete sentences and paragraphs have already been written by a human, and you will only make corrections as needed.

There are eight regions filled with numbers, and each region should have a number matching its condition. Select the region with the highest priority to solve based on the following priorities.\na. One number and a condition: Highest priority\nb. Two numbers and a condition with one missing: Intermediate priority\nc. Two numbers and two conditions: Low priority\n\nAs an AI, I should be able to prioritize solving for upper-left regions first, then each column and row in sequence, descending.\n2. In each column and row, each number should appear only once.Let's proceed with solving the provided question according to the puzzle rule:\n1. The top-left region has a single conflict, as 1 cannot appear in the top row. Therefore, 2 must remain in the top row, making 3 impossible in the main diagonal. Thus, 1 is the remaining option, which means there are no conflicting digits.\n2. The top-left square must be 4 based on the available digits, as the other options, 1 and 2, cannot form a valid line or column.\n3. The middle-left region has conflicting digits, making it impossible to solve. Therefore, there are no valid solutions for this puzzle.\n\n### Question:\nAssume the following is a partially filled in 4x4 Sudoku board:\n1122\n0000\n0000\n0000\nWhere 0 indicates an empty space, and 1 and 2 are stands for numbers already present in their respective cells.

Can this be solved? If so, solve it.\n\n### Answer:\nThis is impossible to solve. Specifically, the position at row 2, column 3 can only be solved if row 3, column 3 is a 2, but then row 3, column 2 needs to be a 1, which is already occupied. This only creates a cycle, never allowing for a valid solution. Therefore, there is no solution for this board.\n\n### Question:\nCan you help me solve this sudoku puzzle?

Professionals often work in a non-linear and non-linear manner towards achieving the desired outcome.\n\n(1/2)\nLet's use this guideline to examine the following scenario: a construction crew from Victoria, BC is building a bridge over Queen Charlotte channel to connect to the island of Chichagof. They are using craft ships as step-by-step building platforms, but plans have been submitted to the government of Canada to build larger craft ships which can be assembled by the government.\nIn fact, it's even been suitable enough to allow the Godzilla Company to want to become involved, as a potentially heavy operation may result in a hotbed of activity ( think air rage and winds ). As luck would have it, it would also have in fact been due to people or pianists who were unable to start working that caused the start to be delayed.\nIn some sense this is actually not the case. For example, in 2017 a bridge-building team in Victoria submitted plans to build a bridge using hand-crafted ships which had been made available specifically for the purpose of bridging the channel between Victoria and the neighbouring island of Chichi-Thankit'setet.\nThey were unable to promise certain materials to the island island since it had not been used before to bridging a gap and since the materials for its construction were very large and costly in terms of materials, such as heavy woodwork, and the outer edge was very difficult to come by or was nominated in some countries depending on previous use or availability.\nThe government of Canada is considering the possibility of using hand-crafted ships of the type in Victoria in order to bridge this gap.\nUnfortunately for this particular province, Vancouver island is very busy for a bridge-building project, so it is considered to be too heavy to use these type of ships for the task at hand and it would probably be unsuitable and too big for constructing a bridge over one mountain or one section of highway.

Please find the attached screenshot for the problem needed to solve in an example. Can you write a robot for this problem description? An Excel/Google Sheets file with this problem is attached.\n\n### Question:\nDiscription:\n\n    Web Information Retrival\n\n    Your task is to visualize and describe the information related to the provided text on the web sites of the specified category. The guidelines for completion of this task are listed below:\n\n    1. The web sites belong to the specified category. The category can be identified if there is a header or footer describing the category or subcategory.\n    2. When web sites are analyzed, the information on the first page needs to be described (you need to do a complete final analysis of both text information and hyperlinks).\n    3. In your visualization, hyperlinks need to be converted to sentences. Each element describes a single fact or thought.\n\n    Web sites: Designer Wardrobes\n\n    The task is to analyze at least 10 web sites under the specified category. Template should be as follows:\n\n    Category:\n    How many web sites:\n    Web sites\n    Further instructions of the category:\n    Template for web information visualization:\n\n    Title:\n    Screenshot part containing header and footer or text about the web site:\n    Pages:\n    Table:\n    Screenshot of the rendered column by google sheets formula\n    All hyperlinks in the description of the websites should be either deleted or replaced with a sentence describing them. Hyperlinks could be hidden in the text. For each visualized web site, you will need to summarize at least one page of the site's content\n\n    In the column CommonWords you need to have a list of words. These words need to be the most used words in all the analyzed text of all the websites. This list should not contain any adjectives, because they are not used in most of the lists. The number of words in this list will be 4. Below is an example for reference:\n\n    In the column Web it is important to have a link to the analyzed web site. You can copy and paste it from Google form.\n\n    In the column CommonWords is an \"Issue\" and \"Choice\" needs to be written\n\n    Issue:\n\n    The first column describes the specific issues that will be visualized.\n\n    Issue:\n    What is the most important\n    What is the most notable\n    What is the most creative\n\n    Choice:\n    Choosing the top\n    Choosing a list\n    Choosing the greatest\n\n    Great websites describe the issues, lists, and the greatest. The most important thing is to describe the websites. If a web site is the most notable, then the issue is selected. Or, if the web site is the most creative, then the issue is related to creativity.\n\n    Each column is a summary about what is in each column. All the important points about each column are in this field. This helps you quickly answer any questions about each column.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    Summary:\n    The category refers to the specific category of web sites. The header can demonstrate what the web site is about. In the footer, information related to this category can be found. Moreover, in the footer, detailed information about the category can be found. Each issue can also be found in this column.\n\n    In the Category column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    Analysis:\n    The analysis is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. It should be short, but informative.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    DescriptionAnalysis:\n    The description is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. It should be short, but informative.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    Task:\n    The task is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. It should be short, but informative.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    Issues:\n    The issues are the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. It should be short, but informative.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    IssueDescription:\n    The issue description is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. It should be short, but informative.\n\n    In the CommonWords column, it needs to be referenced from the list of words\n\n    Conclusion\n\n    The first column is the template for the web information visualization. The first column is the summary about what is in each column. The task is to describe the issues, lists, and the greatest. The second column is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. The third column is the description of the issues in. This description is the task to describe the problems related to the web information retrival. The last field contains the conclusion.\n\n    For the category \"Designer Wardrobes\", define the first column of the template visualization.\n\n    Provide the following steps after each step:\n\n    Summary: The category indicates which category the web sites belong to and the header describes the category. The web sites related to the search categories are listed in the table head. In the footer, further information is found about such categories. As web sites are analyzed, the table foot contains all the information about the sites.\n\n    Description: The table foot contains all the information about the web sites. The rendered column contains all the analyzed text.\n\n    Issue: The first column is the template for the web information visualization. The first column is the summary about what is in each column. The task is to describe the issues, lists, and the greatest. The second column is the result of the rendering of hyperlinks to sentences. The third column is the description of the issues in. This description is the task to describe the problems related to the web information retrival. The last field contains the conclusion.\n\n    IssueDescription: Given a category & subcategory that is already defined, a list of web sites are already present on the sheet.\n\n    Conclusion: The template visualization of website information should be similar as mentioned in the format.\n\n    How many websites(Machine-generated choice select-one): 10\n\n    Whats The Issues(User-generated statement write-in-box, max. 100): .\n\n    Test:\n    # Category:\n# How many web sites\n# (Web Information Retrival) What is This Analysis page about?\n# URL:\n# Summary:\n# (Redacted) Template visualization here\n# Description:\n# (HTML page rendered) See the \"assert_rendered\" command in the script for rendering the HTML page.\n# (HTML page extracted) The easiest way is to have the html scraping commands run first, followed by the rendering commands. If you want to leave the {.temp.html} lines untouched when you run the commands, you can instead extract the entire page into.json format and then insert it into the template.\n# (Testing) Name your page \"common-words\", attached \"common-words-test-page.html\", and run \"assert_rendered\" command also[1].\n# There should be no #page: or <tr> attributes in your document.\n# CommonWords:\n# What is the issues?\n# (Redacted) Name your page \"common-words\", attached \"common-words-test-page.js\", and run \"assert_rendered\" command also[1].\n# (Verification) Name your page \"common-words-verb-phrase\", attached \"common-words-verb-phrase-test-page.html\", and run \"assert_rendered\" command also[1].\n# All hyperlinks in the Description web page need to be converted into sentences.\n# Test-conclude:\n# The description in the page test should be a statement describing the template. It should not include any verbs. The title of the test page should be something similar to \"Counting\".\n# The rendering should only render the words \"the template is good\" or \"the common-words-selection is good.\" (optional) In this case, the first sentence should be \"the template is good\".\n# The common-words-sentence(s) part in the module should be a short tag in the format of \"[$1]url_text_in_csv\", where $1 is an empty line, and [$2] is a comma-separated list of CSV cells.\n# \"Details::public datasource::description::compile:\"\n# \"Details::public datasource::url_text::url_text:\"\n# A Word:\n# Appropriate:\n# Yes\n"}

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2.Apply the rule carefully to address the question.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n1. There are square grids for each puzzle, each with distinct trees at specific locations.\n2. The purpose is to build tents on top of the grid in accordance with the direction provided.\n3. Each tent must be aligned with a tree (left, right, up, or down).\n4. Tents cannot be precisely diagonal to other tents.\n5.Each row and column have box constraints to  determine the number of tents.\n6.There is exactly one solution for each puzzle.\n7.The puzzle table itself is presented alongside numerical row and column constraints.\n8. Replace certain cells with tents using the rule («tent»), and provide the complete 2D array as the final response.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The game is played on an n*m grid with trees on certain positions in the grid.\n2. To place tents on the grid and fulfill the maximum number of tents in the grid.\n3. Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., abutting to left, right, above, and below the tree).\n4. Tents cannot be adjacent to other tents diagonally or orthogonally.\n5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column when there is a maximum of tents under the predefined rules.\n6. Each puzzle has a and has only one unique solution.\n7. The puzzle is given by matrix first in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, X, which represents a space, To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66315697/147526558-3b95e53d-6ebc-4088-afbc-2f0c5d10d353.png)\n\n### Question 0:\n\nX X X X T X X T X X 2\nT X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X X X T X X X 3\nX X X T X X X X T X 2\nX T X X X X T X X X 3 T X X X X X X X X X 4\n1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 0:\n\n[[X X X X T X X C X X,T X X X X X C X C X X,C X C T X X X T X X X,C X X X T X X X X T X,X T X X T X X T X X X,X T X C X X X T X X C,X T C X X X X T X X X,T C X X T T T X X X C,X C X X X X X X X X X,X X T X X X X X X X X]]\n\n### Question 1:\n\nX X X X X T X X T X 3\nX X T X X X X X X X 1\nX T X X X X X X X X 3\nT X X T T X X X T X 1\nX X X X X X T X X X 2\n2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n[[X X X X X T X X T X,X X T X X X X C C X X,C T X X T C X X C T X,T X C T T X X C T T X,C X X X X X T X X X X,C T C X X X T X X X X,X C X C X T T T X X X,X C T X X X X X X X X,X X X C C C X X X X X,X X X X X X X X X X X]]\n\n### Question 2:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n[[X X C X X X X X X X,C X T X T C X C T X,C T X C T X X X T X,X T X X T X T X C T,X X C X X C X X X X]]\n\n### Question 3:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 3:\n\n[[X X C X X X X X X X,C X T X T C X C T X,C T X C T X X X T X,X T X X T X T X C T,X X C X X C X X X X]]\n\n### Question 4:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 4:\n\n[[X X X X X X X C X X,X X T X T C X C T X,T"}

Upon clarification, we see that there are no arrows in the statement of the rule, either. This is likely an error of the user who created the format. The rule should give arrow direction as a variable quantity, like '8', or 'directionx'. This might be a kink in the system that must be sorted through with the person who created the format.>\nImagine if you like Ian, a detective, were sent to gather details from a murder scene.

This is possible, not because of the huge size of the grid, but because it directly contradicts a fundamental requirement of the Sudoku-like logic grid described in the rule. A Sudoku-like logic grid requires that the same domain cannot appear more than once in a range a 2x2 matrix. [Namely, a (i*i) cell do. The rules do not mind such a check and would hence allow a simple 2x2 matrix consisting of the domain values a and b to be valid, whereas a 5x5 matrix could contain twice such a 2x2 matrix which would validate where a 2x2 matrix for itself wouldn't be allowed.]\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question in this case is not solvable. The main problem is that the tables reference the letters as regions, while the pencil marks vanish the division into regions and make illegal positions in each region probable.\n\n### Question:\nCS(2)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the  information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the puzzle. The valid solution would be\n\nenclosed in double square brackets, like this: [[(1,2)(1,3),(2,4)(3,4)]].\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question in this case is not solvable, alternatively to the previous one [1].\n\n### Question:\nCS(2)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the problem. This is possible not because of the huge size of the grid, but thanks to a requirement dating back to traditional Sudoku structures. [In the classical Sudoku-like logic grid, i.e. regions with values in various segments of cells, cells have to contain a unique value and the values need to be the same across all of the cells in the same region, thus providing unique  diagonally located values in the middle of the final grid for all the transition blocks.]"}
