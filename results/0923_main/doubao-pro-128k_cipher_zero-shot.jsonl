The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Since the ciphertext is only 2 characters, we consider it as the 0th block.\n\nWe calculate the grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0. So, we use Grid0 for decryption.\n\nFor the character \"P\": In Grid0, \"P\" is in the first row and first column. Moving one grid to the upper left, we stay in the same position since we are at the boundary. So, the decrypted character is still \"P\".\n\nFor the character \"R\": In Grid0, \"R\" is in the fourth row and third column. Moving one grid to the upper left, we get \"M\".\n\nPutting these together, the decrypted text is \"PM\". So, the answer is: [[PM]] "}

We use Grid0.\n  - For 'X': In Grid0, 'X' is at position (3, 0). Moving one position to the lower right (row + 1, col + 1), we get (4, 1), which corresponds to 'U'.\n  - For 'T': In Grid0, 'T' is at position (3, 4). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (4, 0), which corresponds to 'V'.\n  - For 'V': In Grid0, 'V' is at position (4, 4). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (0, 0), which corresponds to 'P'.\n  - For 'I': In Grid0, 'I' is at position (2, 2). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (3, 3), which corresponds to 'S'.\n  - For 'T': In Grid0, 'T' is at position (3, 4). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (4, 0), which corresponds to 'V'.\n\nSo, the encrypted block for Block 0 is \"UPSVV\".\n\nFor Block 1:\n- The grid index is (1 // 5) % 8 = 0. We still use Grid0.\n  - For 'D': In Grid0, 'D' is at position (1, 3). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (2, 4), which corresponds to 'Z'.\n  - For 'X': In Grid0, 'X' is at position (3, 0). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (4, 1), which corresponds to 'U'.\n  - For 'E': In Grid0, 'E' is at position (1, 4). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (2, 0), which corresponds to 'A'.\n  - For 'H': In Grid0, 'H' is at position (2, 1). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (3, 2), which corresponds to 'K'.\n  - For 'Z': In Grid0, 'Z' is at position (4, 2). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (0, 3), which corresponds to 'L'.\n\nSo, the encrypted block for Block 1 is \"ZUAKL\".\n\nFor Block 2:\n- The grid index is (2 // 5) % 8 = 0. Again, we use Grid0.\n  - For 'S': In Grid0, 'S' is at position (0, 4). Moving one position to the lower right, we get (1, 0), which corresponds to 'P'.\n\nSo, the encrypted block for Block 2 is \"P\".\n\nPutting all the encrypted blocks together, the final encrypted message is:\n\n[[UPSVVZUAKLP]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"GMKWVQPNWTZ\", we divide it into 5-character blocks:\n- The 0th block is \"GMKWV\".\n- The 1st block is \"QPNWT\".\n- The 2nd block is \"Z\".\n\nFor the 0th block \"GMKWV\":\n- We calculate the grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0. So we use Grid0.\n- For 'G', in Grid0, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'A'.\n- For 'M', in Grid0, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'K'.\n- For 'K', in Grid0, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'H'.\n- For 'W', in Grid0, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'V'.\n- For 'V', in Grid0, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'P'.\n\nSo the decrypted block is \"AKHPV\".\n\nFor the 1st block \"QPNWT\":\n- The grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 1. So we use Grid1.\n- For 'Q', in Grid1, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'O'.\n- For 'P', in Grid1, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'V'.\n- For 'N', in Grid1, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'M'.\n- For 'W', in Grid1, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'V'.\n- For 'T', in Grid1, moving one grid position to the upper left gives 'S'.\n\nSo the decrypted block is \"OVMVS\".\n\nFor the 2nd block \"Z\", since it is a single character, we treat it as a special case. In this cipher, when the block has only one character, we assume it is not encrypted. So the decrypted block is \"Z\".\n\nPutting all the decrypted blocks together, the decrypted message is \"AKHPVOVMVSZ\". Therefore, the answer is: [[AKHPVOVMVSZ]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we clean up the ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase. The ciphertext is already in the correct format.\n\nNext, we split the ciphertext into two-letter groups: \"CH\", \"LV\", \"YV\", \"CG\", \"UM\", \"RH\".\n\nFor each double-letter group:\n- For \"CH\": In Gird2, 'C' is in the 1st row and 2nd column, and 'H' is in the 3rd row and 2nd column. In Gird1, the letter in the 1st row and 2nd column is 'L', and the letter in the 3rd row and 2nd column is 'M'. So the decrypted pair is \"LM\".\n- For \"LV\": In Gird2, 'L' is in the 3rd row and 1st column, and 'V' is in the 1st row and 3rd column. In Gird1, the letter in the 3rd row and 1st column is 'S', and the letter in the 1st row and 3rd column is 'R'. So the decrypted pair is \"SR\".\n- For \"YV\": In Gird2, 'Y' is in the 5th row and 3rd column, and 'V' is in the 1st row and 3rd column. In Gird1, the letter in the 5th row and 3rd column is 'Z', and the letter in the 1st row and 3rd column is 'R'. So the decrypted pair is \"ZR\".\n- For \"CG\": In Gird2, 'C' is in the 1st row and 2nd column, and 'G' is in the 2nd row and 2nd column. In Gird1, the letter in the 1st row and 2nd column is 'L', and the letter in the 2nd row and 2nd column is 'R'. So the decrypted pair is \"LR\".\n- For \"UM\": In Gird2, 'U' is in the 4th row and 1st column, and 'M' is in the 3rd row and 1st column. In Gird1, the letter in the 4th row and 1st column is 'T', and the letter in the 3rd row and 1st column is 'S'. So the decrypted pair is \"TS\".\n- For \"RH\": In Gird2, 'R' is in the 3rd row and 2nd column, and 'H' is in the 3rd row and 2nd column. In Gird1, the letter in the 3rd row and 2nd column is 'M', and the letter in the 3rd row and 2nd column is 'M'. So the decrypted pair is \"MM\".\n\nConcatenating all the decrypted double letter groups, we get the plaintext: \"LMSRZRLRTSMM\".\n\nSo the answer is: [[LMSRZRLRTSMM]] "}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PBXSYAFH\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'Z', '', ''],\n['', '', 'S', ''],\n['', '', '', 'E'],\n['', '', 'C', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"ZSEC\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"ECSZ\" and \"CZEZ\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"SECZAFVWISMPV\". Since the first 16 letters of the ciphertext are used to decrypt this block, we remove these letters from the ciphertext.\n\nFor Block 2:\nWe write the remaining 16 letters row by row to fill the grid:\n[['B', 'N', 'K', 'N', 'D', 'C', 'O', 'U', 'Y', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'O', 'H', 'L', 'Y'],\n['L', 'L', 'D', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\nWe place the template with holes on the filled grid:\n[['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', 'B', 'N'],\n['', '', '', 'K'],\n['N', '', '', '']]\n\nWe read the letters visible through the holes: \"BNKN\". Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'N', '', ''],\n['', '', 'B', ''],\n['', '', '', 'N'],\n['', '', 'K', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"NBKN\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"KNBN\" and \"NKBK\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"BNKNDCOUYEFGOH\". Since the next 16 letters of the ciphertext are used to decrypt this block, we remove these letters from the ciphertext.\n\nFor Block 3:\nWe write the remaining letters row by row to fill the grid:\n[['L', 'Y', 'L', 'L', 'D', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#']]\n\nWe place the template with holes on the filled grid:\n[['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', 'L', 'Y'],\n['', '', '', 'L'],\n['L', '', '', '']]\n\nWe read the letters visible through the holes: \"LYLL\". Then we rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise:\n[['', 'L', '', ''],\n['', '', 'L', ''],\n['', '', '', 'Y'],\n['', '', 'L', '']]\n\nWe read the next set of letters: \"LLLY\". We repeat this process two more times to get \"YLLL\" and \"LLYI\". However, the last letter \"I\" seems to be an error. Since the letters are filled with filler characters ('#') when the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is likely that the last set of letters should be \"LLY#\". Combining these four sets of letters, we get \"LYLLD######WT###B####\". Since all the remaining ciphertext is used to decrypt this block, there are no more ciphertext letters left.\n\nPutting all the decrypted blocks together, the final plaintext is: \"SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD\". So the answer is: [[SECZAFVWISMPVBNKNDCOUYEFGOHLYLLD]] "}

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"GD\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"GD\", we divide it into two halves. The upper half is \"G\" and the lower half is \"D\".\n\nThe position of \"G\" in the encrypted character set \"ADFGVX\" is 0, and the position of \"D\" is 3. So the decryption binary is (0, 3).\n\nUsing the numbers from the decryption binary, we find the character at position (0, 3) in the 6x6 matrix. The character at (0, 3) is \"0\".\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext is \"0\". The answer in the required format is: [[0]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we pad the plaintext \"G\" to make it a multiple of 8 bytes. Since \"G\" is only one character, we need to pad it with 7 null characters (\\x00). So the padded plaintext is \"G\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNext, we divide this padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. Since the entire string is considered one block.\n\nWe then convert this block to bytes using ASCII encoding. \"G\" is represented as 0x47 and each \"\\x00\" is represented as 0x00. So the byte block is [0x47, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\nWe XOR this byte block with the fixed key (b'1234567890ABCDEF'). Performing the XOR operation, we get [0x55, 0x12, 0x16, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E].\n\nNext, we use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, we get [0x05, 0x02, 0x16, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E, 0x1E].\n\nWe then perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. After permutation, we get [0x0A, 0x04, 0x2D, 0x3C, 0x3C, 0x3C, 0x3C, 0x3C].\n\nWe XOR this permuted byte block with the fixed key again. Performing the XOR operation, we get [0x5A, 0x16, 0x39, 0x28, 0x28, 0x28, 0x28, 0x28].\n\nFinally, we convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string. The hexadecimal representation of the encrypted byte block is \"5A16392828282828\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[5A16392828282828]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The ciphertext \"8C9C9986938C9784\" is divided into 16-character (8-byte) blocks.\n\nFor the first block \"8C9C9986938C9784\":\n1. Convert Hex to Bytes: We convert the hexadecimal string to bytes. In Python, we can use the `bytes.fromhex()` function.\n\n```python\nblock = bytes.fromhex(\"8C9C9986938C9784\")\n```\n\nThis gives us `b'\\x8c\\x9c\\x99\\x86\\x93\\x8c\\x97\\x84'`.\n\n2. XOR with Key: We apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key `b'1234567890ABCDEF'`. We can do this by converting the key to bytes and then performing the XOR operation.\n\n```python\nKEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\nxor1 = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(block, KEY)])\n```\n\nThis gives us `b'\\x76\\x60\\x6f\\x38\\x69\\x76\\x68\\x3b'`.\n\n3. Inverse Permute: We perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n\n```python\ninverse_permute = bytes([(b >> 1) | ((b & 1) << 7) for b in xor1])\n```\n\nThis gives us `b'\\xbc\\xd8\\xbe\\x9c\\xce\\xdc\\xd0\\x6f'`.\n\n4. Substitute: We use the `INV_S_BOX` to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n\n```python\nINV_S_BOX = {\n    0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n    0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n    0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n    0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n}\nsubstitute = bytes([INV_S_BOX[(b >> 4)] << 4 | INV_S_BOX[b & 0x0F] for b in inverse_permute])\n```\n\nThis gives us `b'\\x43\\x4f\\x4d\\x50\\x55\\x54\\x45\\x52'`.\n\n5. XOR with Key: We apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n\n```python\nxor2 = bytes([a ^ b for a, b in zip(substitute, KEY)])\n```\n\nThis gives us `b'\\x51\\x53\\x54\\x45\\x4d\\x53\\x57\\x41'`.\n\n6. Convert Bytes to Text: We convert the decrypted byte block back to text using ASCII decoding.\n\n```python\nplaintext_block = xor2.decode('ascii')\n```\n\nThis gives us \"QSTEmSWa\".\n\nSince there is only one block in the ciphertext, the final decrypted plaintext is \"QSTEmSWa\". Therefore, the answer is: [[QSTEmSWa]] "}

Since \"S\" is only one character, we need to add 7 null characters (\\x00) to make it 8 bytes. So the padded plaintext is \"S\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNow, let's perform the encryption steps:\n1. Convert the block to bytes using ASCII encoding. \"S\" is 0x53 and each \"\\x00\" is 0x00. So the byte block is [0x53, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n2. XOR with the key (b'1234567890ABCDEF'). Performing XOR operation, we get [0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n3. Substitute using the S_BOX. The substituted byte block is [0x0F, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n4. Permute by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. The permuted byte block is [0x1E, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n5. XOR with the key again. The final encrypted byte block is [0x0C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n\nConverting this encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string, we get \"0C00000000000000\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[0C00000000000000]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we pad the plaintext \"N\" to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. Since \"N\" is only one character, we need to pad it with 7 null characters (\\x00). So the padded plaintext is \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNext, we divide this padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. Since the padded plaintext is still less than 8 bytes, it remains as a single block.\n\nNow, we perform the encryption steps on this block:\n1. Convert the block to bytes using ASCII encoding. \"N\" is encoded as 0x4E and the null characters are encoded as 0x00.\n2. Apply XOR with the fixed key. The key is b'1234567890ABCDEF'. Performing XOR operation, we get:\n   - 0x4E ^ 0x31 = 0x7D\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x32 = 0x32\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x33 = 0x33\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x34 = 0x34\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x35 = 0x35\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x36 = 0x36\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x37 = 0x37\n   - 0x00 ^ 0x38 = 0x38\n3. Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, we get:\n   - 0x7D -> S_BOX[0x7] = 0x00, S_BOX[0xD] = 0x0B -> 0x000B\n   - 0x32 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x2] = 0x0A -> 0x0D0A\n   - 0x33 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D -> 0x0D0D\n   - 0x34 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x4] = 0x09 -> 0x0D09\n   - 0x35 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x5] = 0x03 -> 0x0D03\n   - 0x36 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x6] = 0x01 -> 0x0D01\n   - 0x37 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x7] = 0x00 -> 0x0D00\n   - 0x38 -> S_BOX[0x3] = 0x0D, S_BOX[0x8] = 0x0E -> 0x0D0E\n4. Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. After permutation, we get:\n   - 0x000B -> 0x0016\n   - 0x0D0A -> 0x1A14\n   - 0x0D0D -> 1A1A\n   - 0x0D09 -> 1A12\n   - 0x0D03 -> 1A06\n   - 0x0D01 -> 1A02\n   - 0x0D00 -> 1A00\n   - 0x0D0E -> 1A1C\n5. Apply XOR with the fixed key again. Performing XOR operation, we get:\n   - 0x0016 ^ 0x31 = 0x37\n   - 0x1A14 ^ 0x32 = 0x00\n   - 0x1A1A ^ 0x33 = 0x01\n   - 0x1A12 ^ 0x34 = 0x02\n   - 0x1A06 ^ 0x35 = 0x07\n   - 0x1A02 ^ 0x36 = 0x1E\n   - 0x1A00 ^ 0x37 = 0x17\n   - 0x1A1C ^ 0x38 = 0x04\n6.

Since there are no padding characters in this case, we don't need to do anything.\n\nFinally, we concatenate the decrypted blocks. Since we only have one block, the final plaintext is: \"FUNCTION\"\n\nSo, the answer is: [[FUNCTION]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we pad the plaintext \"FW\" to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. Since \"FW\" is 2 characters, we need to add 6 null characters (\\x00) to make it 8 bytes. So the padded plaintext is \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNext, we divide this padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks. Since we only have one block, it is \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\nNow, we perform the encryption steps on this block:\n1. Convert the block to bytes using ASCII encoding. \"F\" is 0x46 and \"W\" is 0x57. The null characters are 0x00. So the byte block is [0x46, 0x57, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00].\n2. XOR this byte block with the fixed key b'1234567890ABCDEF'. Performing the XOR operation, we get [0x54, 0x23, 0x56, 0x56, 0x56, 0x56, 0x56, 0x56].\n3. Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte. After substitution, we get [0x0D, 0x08, 0x09, 0x09, 0x09, 0x09, 0x09, 0x09].\n4. Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit. After permutation, we get [0x1A, 0x10, 0x12, 0x12, 0x12, 0x12, 0x12, 0x12].\n5. XOR the permuted byte block with the fixed key b'1234567890ABCDEF' again. Performing the XOR operation, we get [0x08, 0x0C, 0x0A, 0x0A, 0x0A, 0x0A, 0x0A, 0x0A].\n\nFinally, we convert the encrypted byte blocks to a hexadecimal string. The hexadecimal string is \"080C0A0A0A0A0A0A\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[080C0A0A0A0A0A0A]] "}

It indicates that there might be an issue with the decryption process or the ciphertext.)\n0090 = \"`\"\n00A1 = \"¡\"\n00CE = \"Î\"\n00E8 = \"è\"\n```\n\nHowever, since the decrypted text contains unprintable and seemingly incorrect characters, it's likely that there is an error in the provided ciphertext or the decryption process. Despite this, the decrypted text is as follows:\n\n[[>8P`¡Îè]] "}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, we need to convert the ciphertext \"27ad\" from hexadecimal to a sequence of bytes. \n\n\"27\" in hexadecimal is 39 in decimal, and \"ad\" is 173 in decimal. So the byte sequence is [39, 173].\n\nThe key is obtained by performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. Converting this key to a byte sequence gives us [115, 239, 42, 77, 221, 122, 127, 191, 7, 253, 95, 111, 250, 153, 103, 116, 208, 3, 37, 162, 37, 253, 116, 194, 33, 244, 195, 88, 73, 229, 192, 251, 51].\n\nNow, we perform the bitwise XOR operation between the ciphertext byte sequence and the key byte sequence. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of ciphertext bytes.\n\nFor the first byte:\n39 (ciphertext byte) XOR 115 (key byte) = 82\n\nFor the second byte:\n173 (ciphertext byte) XOR 239 (key byte) = 66\n\nConverting these decimal values back to ASCII characters gives us \"RB\".\n\nSo, the decrypted plaintext is: [[RB]] "}
