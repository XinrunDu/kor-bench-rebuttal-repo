The average of these even numbers is 6.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4, 6, and 8. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. So, one possible value of X is 8.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 10 are 4, 6, 8, and 10. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 10.\n\nWe continue this process.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 12 are 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 12.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 14 are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14) / 6 = 54 / 6 = 9, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 14.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 16 are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16) / 7 = 70 / 7 = 10, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 16.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 18 are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18) / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11.25, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 18.\n\nThe even numbers between 3 and 20 are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20) / 9 = 110 / 9 ≈ 12.22, which is not equal to 6. So, X cannot be 20.\n\nWe have found that the only value of X that satisfies the equation 3#X = 6 is 8.\n\nSo, the answer is [[8]]."}

According to the operation rule, \\(X①2 = \\sqrt{X} + 2^2 = \\sqrt{X} + 4\\).\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the equation \\(4②(X①2) = 20\\). According to the operation rule, \\(4②(\\sqrt{X} + 4) = \\sqrt{4} \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4)\\).\n\nSo, we have the equation \\(\\sqrt{4} \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4) = 20\\).\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get \\(2(\\sqrt{X} + 4) = 20\\).\n\nDistributing the 2 on the left side, we get \\(2\\sqrt{X} + 8 = 20\\).\n\nSubtracting 8 from both sides, we get \\(2\\sqrt{X} = 12\\).\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get \\(\\sqrt{X} = 6\\).\n\nSquaring both sides, we get \\(X = 36\\).\n\nSo, the answer is: [[36]] "}
