Here is the specific rule defined for an exact match puzzle. Your task is to accurately apply this rule to the given question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), ‚Ä¶ and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt.

When writing the coordinates, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number, and when the number of rows is equal, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number. When writing down two coordinate points, the smaller number is placed to the front.\n\n\n\n### Challenges and pitfalls:\n\n### An example of incorrect application:\n\n### Answer:\n[[A:(1,1)(1,3)\nB:(1,4)(3,4)\nC:(4,2)(4,4)\nD:(7,3)(7,6)\nE:(2,3)(5,3)\nF:(5,4)(8,7)\nG:(1,7)(5,7)\nH:(7,8)(8,6)\nI:(8,1)(8,3)\nJ:(9,6)(9,8)]]"}

this question, you need to convert arrows into numbers and output paths for easier reading.\nIf we use the first question as an example, the arrow distribution can be converted to a matrix for interpretation:\n6 8 5\n\n8 5 2\n\n1 4 0\nThe meanings corresponding to the numbers are as below:\n1 = ‚Üë 2 = ‚Üó 3 = ‚Üí\n4 = ‚Üò 5 = ‚Üì 6 = ‚Üô\n7 = ‚Üê 8 = ‚Üñ 0 = ‚óã\nThe small arrow in the figure indicates the starting point and the center point indicates the ending point.\nThe puzzle-answering step is as follows:\nStarting from the first inflection point, traverse the first line until the second inflection point, looking for the path\nLooking for the path, traversing from the first line until after the second inflection point, the path turns from right to left\nAccording to the rule of the second inflection point, continue to traverse through the second line to the third inflection point, and find that the path should turn upwards\nSince the third inflection point does not fall on a straight line, it is difficult to make a general judgment about the turning of the path, so it is necessary to find the orientation of the third inflection point, and such information is also necessary\n\nsuch information is also necessary for intersection points because it indicates which direction the path will continue, in this case following the direction of the second line, but if the third line exists, it would overturn the following along the third direction of the intersection point and so on.\nThe end of the solution is the end point, and there is no turning direction to look for the next inflection point, so the answer is [1,0,2],[0,0,0],[0,0,3]\nThere are three lines in the direction of movement, and the horizontal line is crossed. If the initial pointing direction of intersection For example, it is a vertical line, then it is necessary to pay attention to the vertical line at the inflection point after the intersection when looking for the direction of the intersection. intersection.\nHowever, it seems that most of the die products are horizontal and vertical lines, which indicates that as long as the horizontal horizontal line is first looked for, and the turning direction is checked according to the information,  then the solution will be continuous.\nSo the question is, how can I get the information quickly and efficiently?\nThe first method I thought of was that arrays are strings, arrays can be sliced, and strings can be sliced.\nI think it can be interpreted using numpy, extracting the components of the array from every angle.\nThe first part of the interpretation directly extracts the diagonal, the second and third parts of the interpretation extract the horizontal horizontal lines, and the fourth part is some of the cases of the intersection of other consecutive turns of the path.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    for i in matrix:\n        print(i)\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    l = 3\n    w = len(matrix)\n    for n in range(l):\n        if n < (l-1):\n            str1 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n])\n            str2 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+1])\n            str3 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[n+2])\n            str4 = str1[0] + str2[1:w-1] + str3[w-1]\n        else:\n            str4 = ''.join(str(i) for i in matrix[l-1])\n        print(str4)\n        print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n\nzuobiao = np.array([[7, 0, 4, 0, 7],\n                   [8, 7, 1, 1, 8],\n                   [0, 7, 2, 4, 3],\n                   [0, 1, 5, 5, 1],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nextract_array(zuobiao)\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n  [8 7 3 1 0]\n  [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [8 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 3 1 0 0]\n [0 1 6 4 5]]\n> [[1 0 2 4 0]\n [0 0 1 0 0]\n [0 0 1 4 5]]\n\n\nIt's great, so I had to see if it was suitable for long numbers: \nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_array(matrix):\n    # Put your code here\n     for i in matrix:\n         print(i)\n    print(\"=========\")\n    l = len(matrix)\n    "}

I deleted my previous message trying not to send a wrong one, and then I had some network problems and couldn't paste the right one. Here is the complete content of the custom puzzle problem I wanted to present to you. I will rephrase it in the same way so that you can understand it immediately.\n\nGive you a `rule` of a custom puzzle (a rule on how to fill in a matrix), and then a series of questions `ques` with `ans` described. Now need to give you completely new questions `qus` for you to complete.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Use Python language for coding.\n\n### Puzzle Rule (do not use this as question):\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question format:\n```python\nrule = \"\"\" ... \"\"\" # Special rules are given\nques = [\n(\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # Questions are provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n),\n...\n]\nans = [\n[[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...]], # Answers are given\n...\n]\n```\n\n```python\nqus = [\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # questions are required to be provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n],\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```python\n... # In the same format as `ans`, please answer.\n```\n\n### Question:\nrule = \"\"\"\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down.
