Understand the Operation Rule:**\n\nThe rule `a ★ b = ∫_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx` represents integration.  It means we need to find the definite integral of `2x`  from the value of  `a` to the value of `b`.  \n\n**2. Apply the Rule:**\n\nWe are given that `0 ★ b = b`.  This means we need to evaluate the following integral:\n\n```\n∫_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx \n```\n and then set it equal to `b`.\n\n**3. Solve the Integral:**\n\n```\n∫_{0}^{b} 2x \\, dx = b + 0 = b \n```\n\n**4. Find the Value of b:**\n\nTo satisfy this equation, `b` must be equal to `b`.  \n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n[**b**] \n\n\nWe represent b directly, implying it can take on various values, \n\n**Note:** Since the rule `a★b = ∫_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx` must hold, the correct answer has inequality solution.  A single answer is impossible to determine, the rule is independent. \n"}
