Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na★b=\\int_{a}^{b} 2x \\, dx\n\n### Question:\nIf 0★b=b, find b.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nIf there is more than one answer, please separate them with 'or', e.g.[[1or2]].\nPlease wrap the final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Here's how to solve this:\n\n1. **Apply the operation rule:**  0★b = ∫₀<sup>b</sup> 2x dx \n\n2. **Evaluate the definite integral:**  ∫₀<sup>b</sup> 2x dx = [x²] from 0 to b = b² - 0² = b²\n\n3. **Set the result equal to b:**  b² = b\n\n4. **Solve for b:** \n   * b² - b = 0\n   * b(b - 1) = 0\n   * This gives us two solutions: b = 0 or b = 1\n\n\nTherefore, the answer is **[[0 or 1]]**. \n"}
