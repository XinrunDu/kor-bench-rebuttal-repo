For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, what should it be denoted as if it is both a tautology and a basic form? The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "If formula A contains 4 propositional variables, there are 2^4 = 16 possible paired conjunctive terms. For A to be a tautology, it must include all 16 paired conjunctive terms. A basic formula must include m0.\n\nHowever, for a formula to be both a tautology and a basic form is logically impossible. A basic formula specifically requires the inclusion of m0 but being a tautology implies including all paired conjunctive terms, which is already a complete set.\n\nThus, there is no logical status where formula A can simultaneously be a tautology and a basic form.\n\nThe correct notation to indicate this impossibility is [[]]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statement \"All pencils are not pens.\" represents a universal negative proposition, where the subject \"pencils\" does not possess the property of being \"pens.\" Therefore, it follows the form of No S are P.\n\nThe type of proposition is: [[SEP]]."}

This scenario is not possible because if p1 is true, then ~p1 is false by definition, and this makes \u2713=::>x false.\n\n- Consider the outer implication:\n  - The only false assignment of an implication is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n  - For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true. \n  - From the above simplification, (p1=::>~p1) is a truth value corresponding to a false formula (contained within a truth formula structure).\n\nEvaluate assignments:\n  - Essentially, (p1=::>~p1) gives true only in one form, making all subsequent evaluations match the if-then input (i.e., never false in conjunction with ~p2 being false).\n\nGiven multiple tests of the structure will change depending on outcomes, this is, therefore, neither always true nor always false.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFormula (1) is a Truth Formula.\nFormula (2) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula.\n\nThus, the answer is \\[[A];[C]\\]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formulas.\n(1) ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n(2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\nThe answer format  is [[T:...;F:...];[T:...;F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).For example [[T:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713;F:x|x|x];[T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the truth values and falsity values for the given formulas, let's analyze each formula step by step according to the defined logic rules.\n\n### Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\n1. Identify components: \n   - p1, p2, and ~p3 are Level A formulas.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) means p1&p2&~p3 must be false for the entire formula to be true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is false under assignments: x|x|x, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|x|x, or any combination where at least one of p1 or p2 is false, or p3 is true.\n   - Therefore, some true assignments for ~(p1&p2&~p3) are: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is false when p1&p2&~p3 is true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is true under the assignment: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n   - Therefore, the false assignment for ~(p1&p2&~p3) is: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n\n### Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\n1. Identify components:\n   - ~p1 and p2 are Level A formulas.\n   - ~p1&p2 is a Level B formula.\n   - p1=p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is true except when (~p1&p2) is true and (p1=p3) is false.\n   - (~p1&p2) is true under assignments: x|\u2713|x, x|\u2713|\u2713.\n   - (p1=p3) is false when p1 and p3 have different truth values (\u2713|x or x|\u2713).\n   - So, true assignments include: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - This is specifically false when ~p1&p2 is true and p1=p3 is false.\n   - From above, this results in the assignment x|\u2713|x.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\nCombine the results for both formulas:\n\\[ [ \\text{T}: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: \u2713|\u2713|x ] ; [ \\text{T}: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: x|\u2713|x ] \\]\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n\\[ [[T:x|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713,\u2713|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[T:\u2713|x|\u2713,x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:x|\u2713|x]] \\]"}

Figure I moods do not match the form and the type.\n2. For Figure II to meet valid moods (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO), the given structure should theoretically be a match\u2014```OAO``` being potentially valid.\n\n#### Valid Configuration in Figure II:\n\n- ()O(): AOO, where the conclusion is derived as SOP.\n- Completed Structure:\n\n  O()M  \n  A()M  \n  \u2234 SOP\n\n### Answer:\n\nIn valid mood form for Figure II: OAO.\n\nThe completed answer should be depicted with matching mood configurations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{[O;A;{};{}]}\n\\]"}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the problem, let's evaluate the simplified expression \\( E ::=:: (!p & q & !r) | (p & !q & r) \\) given that exactly one of \\( p, q, r \\) is true.\n\n1.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.", "answer": "[[E]]", "rule_id": "17", "needle": ["- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:", "- (1) A has a causal relationship with X", "- (2) B has a causal relationship with Y", "- (3) C has a causal relationship with Z", "- Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship."], "title": "Logical Methods for Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships", "tag": "Formal Logic,Inductive Logic", "rule_content": "Five Methods for Exploring Causal Relationships\n\n1.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

Direct Argumentation Methods\n\n- E+ Method: Using specific instances to argue for the truth of a proposition.\n- Syl+ Method: Using universal propositions as premises and supporting conclusions through syllogistic reasoning.\n- Metaph+ Method: Using metaphors to argue for the truth of a topic.\n- Case+ Method: When it is necessary to prove that a proposition holds true under various conditions, prove its truthfulness by discussing each case separately.\n\n2. Indirect Argumentation Methods\n\n- Contra- Method: Indirectly confirming the truth of the original proposition by refuting the contrary proposition that contradicts the original one. For example, proving the necessity of improving scientific and cultural levels by negating the contrary proposition that \"party and government leaders do not need to improve their scientific and cultural levels.\"\n- Elim- Method: Indirectly determining the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities related to the original proposition as false. For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\n\"Light has mass.

The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm\" does not provide enough context about information strength or contrasting sets for inference as described in the CQ1 or CQ2 patterns.\n\n- **C% Principle (Minimalization of Expression):** This principle involves speaking minimally and relies on conventional relationships and expanding information from minimal speech. The statement about the beer being part of the food in the food box seems to relate to conventional associations\u2014food items often include beverages in a \"food box.\"\n\n- **C! Principle (Avoidance of Unmarked Expressions):** This principle focuses on not using lengthy or marked expressions unnecessarily.

Identify attribute `F` as 'student satisfaction'.\n2. For School X, we have `P(F, 180, 200)`. Therefore, the proportion `k1/n1` is `180/200 = 0.9`.\n3. For School Y, we have `P(F, 210, 300)`. Therefore, the proportion `k2/n2` is `210/300 = 0.7`.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule:\n\n- Since both samples have different proportions, we check if they are similar enough to infer similarity in populations.\n- We compare `0.9` and `0.7`.\n\nIn this scenario, although `0.9` and `0.7` are not exactly the same, they're quite close, which may suggest some similarity between the population proportions, depending on the context and statistical thresholds.\n\nSymbolization using the C-Reasoning Rule:\n- `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`\n\nInference:\n- `Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`, assuming they're considered similar enough.\n\nFormatted output:\n- [[C(F, 0.9, 0.7), Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)]]"}

This implies a specific context where a nurse is receiving the flowers.\n- Common sense inference: nurses are commonly known to be female, leading to the inference that Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\n\nApplying the principles:\n\n- **C***: This principle involves making statements as strong as the knowledge allows and making inferences about the speaker's knowledge. The inference about the nurse being female is based on common stereotypes rather than a specific knowledge-driven weaker statement versus stronger statement pairing.\n  \n- **C%**: This principle focuses on saying the minimum necessary and conventional assumptions. The inference relies on a conventional societal stereotype (that a nurse is likely female), aligning closely with CI1, which assumes conventional relationships unless there's evidence otherwise. Therefore, it follows the convention of female nurses.\n  \n- **C!**: This concerns avoiding obscure expressions and using conventional associations. In this case, the inference doesn't involve avoiding marked expressions or unconventional associations.\n\nBased on the detailed reasoning, the inference primarily involves the conventional assumption under **C% Principle**.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]]."}
