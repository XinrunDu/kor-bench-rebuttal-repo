Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r), which can be denoted as m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5. \nBased on the three true assignments represented, what are the feasible selection schemes? \n\nOnly give the letters of the people selected to go, separated by commas within a scheme, and different schemes separated by []; format: [[];[];..].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C];[B];[A,C]]"}

Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Answer:\n\nGiven the rules and definitions:\n\n1. If a proposition `p` is the common belief within the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n   - This is expressed as: \\( G_p \\rightarrow \\forall i \\in G \\, (B_ip) \\).\n\n2. According to the axioms of doubt, if Alice (let's denote her as `A`) doubts the proposition `p`:\n   - It is expressed as: \\( H_Ap \\).\n   - From the Introduction of Doubt axiom: \\( H_Ap \\rightarrow \\neg B_Ap \\).\n\nGiven that Alice doubts the proposition which is a common belief, we need to express the logical consequence of this situation. \n\n### Final Logical Expression:\n\n\\[ [H_Ap \\rightarrow \\neg G_p] \\]\n\nThis expression states that if Alice doubts the proposition `p` (even though it is a common belief in the group `G`), then `p` can no longer be considered a common belief within the group `G`, since a common belief requires all group members to believe the proposition firmly."}

Method \u2e2e:\n- If S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions A, B, C, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) S C D     P\n    - (3) S E F     P\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n2. Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4. Method \u2d63:\n- When changes in S correspond to changes in P:\n    - (1) S1 A B     P1\n    - (2) S2 A B    P2\n    - (3) S3 A B    P3\n    - ...\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n5. Method \u2698:\n- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:\n    - (1) A has a causal relationship with X\n    - (2) B has a causal relationship with Y\n    - (3) C has a causal relationship with Z\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n### Question:\nPeople rub their frozen hands together, and their hands become warm; \npeople strike cold stones, and the stones can spark; \npeople continuously hammer an iron block, and the iron block can also become red-hot. From this, it can be inferred that the movement of objects can generate heat.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse fits which method:\nA.\u2e2e method   B.\u0606 method   C.\ua66e method    D.\u2d63 method   E.\u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

According to the /// Relationship rules:\n- \\( A(\\text{HealthGood}) \\) and \\( H(\\neg \\text{HealthGood}) \\) form an \u203b pair because the rule states \\( Ap \\) and \\( H\\neg p \\) cannot both be true nor both be false.\n\nTherefore, the first pair has a \u203b Relationship.\n\n(2) \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" and \"Allow the execution of contracts\".\n\n- \"Aunt Wang never won a major award in the past\" translates to \\( A(\\neg \\text{WonAward}) \\).\n- \"Allow the execution of contracts\" does not correspond to any time proposition rule we have here, but if we hypothesize it to imply a future-oriented proposition, let's denote it as \\( G(\\text{ExecutionOfContracts}) \\).\n\nThe propositions \\( A(\\neg \\text{WonAward}) \\) and \\( G(\\text{ExecutionOfContracts}) \\) do not fit any specific relationship rules provided in the definition because they refer to entirely different terms not connected by the defined relationships.\n\nTherefore, due to the absence of a relationship rule matching this pair, we cannot categorize this relationship with the given logic rules.\n\n### Answer:\n[[\u203b];[None]]\n\nSince the second pair doesn't fit into any predefined logical relationships, we denote it as None."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nPlease determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3. \nThe answer should be given as a single letter from A to Z, or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1).The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the level of the formula \\((~p1&p2)=::>p3\\), we need to break down and analyze its components according to the provided rules.\n\n1. Identify the subformulas:\n   - \\(~p1\\) is a formula and is categorized as Level B because it contains one logical connective and the connected proposition \\(p1\\) is a Level A formula.\n   - \\(p2\\) is a proposition and is categorized as Level A.\n   - Therefore, \\(~p1&p2\\) is a formula containing one Level B formula and one Level A formula, making it a compound formula at Level C.\n   - \\(p3\\) is also a proposition and is categorized as Level A.\n\n2. Determine the structure:\n   - The outermost connective in the formula \\((~p1&p2)=::>p3\\) is =::>, indicating a conditional relationship.\n   - Given \\((~p1&p2)\\) is a Level C formula and \\(p3\\) is a Level A formula, the overall level of the formula should incorporate the highest level of its components.\n\n3. Combine for the overall level:\n   - Since the formula \\((~p1&p2)=::>p3\\) combines a Level C formula and a Level A formula within a conditional structure, we consider the connectives' priority and the levels of the components.\n\nGiven the formula operates on a Level C component, this makes the overall formula a higher level than C due to the presence of nested connectives.\n\nThus, the formula \\((~p1&p2)=::>p3\\) should be classified as Level D.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]"}

According to the given logical rules, we must check the relationships defined for \\(Fp\\) and other related propositions.\n\n- The relationship for \\(Fp\\) and another \\(Fp\\) falls under the self-evident truth (since both mean the same thing). Therefore, they are not strictly part of the contradictory pairs but imply mutual truth.\n\nSo, for the first pair represented by \\(Fp\\) and \\(Fp\\), none of the specified relationships (\u203b, \u21a6, \u26ad, \u2042) strictly fit as defined by the rules. However, for the sake of this logical structure, they could be seen as mutual truth, falling closer to possibly \u2042 or another nuanced interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Second Pair:**\n1. \"Xiao Bai will permanently settle in the United States\" \n   - This can imply a future period decision, so let\u2019s denote this as \\(Gp\\).\n\n2. \"Xiao Bai will settle in the United States\" \n   - This indicates a future point decision, so we can denote as \\(Fp\\).\n\nInvestigating relationships between \\(Gp (future period)\\) and \\(Fp (future point)\\):\n\n- According to relationship definitions: Gp and Fp can both be true or false, which fits the \u2042 relationship.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the relationships should be:\n\nFirst pair: [[No clear relationship from given types]]\nSecond pair: [\u2042]\n\nHowever, given a structured format is desired, simplifying (where the first analysis may default to broadly inactive or trivial):\n\n### Answer:\n[[Other];[D]]\n\nWhere the first, not fitting precisely, could be noted as \"Other\" and the second as per \u2042 (compatible truth range)."}

Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output \u201cPlausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nFor (p\u2228q)\u2227(p\u2228\u00acq)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228r), \nwhat is the output of the resolution algorithm?\nHow many cycles will it iterate? \nPlease provide the answer in the format [[output];[number]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the conjunctive normal form \\( S = (p \\vee q) \\wedge (p \\vee \\neg q) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee r) \\).\n\nLet's start applying the resolution algorithm.\n\n**Initialization:**\n- \\( S0 = \\emptyset \\)\n- \\( S1 = \\{(p \\vee q), (p \\vee \\neg q), (\\neg p \\vee r)\\} \\)\n- \\( S2 = \\emptyset \\)\n\n**Step 2: Resolve clauses in \\( S0 \\) and \\( S1 \\):**\nSince \\( S0 \\) is empty, nothing happens in this step.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve clauses in \\( S1 \\):**\n- **Iteration 1:** \n    - Resolve \\((p \\vee q)\\) and \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\):\n        - The common literal is \\( p \\).\n        - The complement literals will be resolved: \\( \\neg p \\) and \\( p \\).\n        - \\( (q) \\) and \\( (\\neg q) \\) complement to form \\( 0 \\) (the empty clause).\n        - **Resultant clause:** \\( q \\vee \\neg q \\rightarrow 1 \\text{ (unsatisfiable)}\\)\n        - Therefore, dispel(\\(p \\vee q\\), \\( p \\vee \\neg q \\)) = \\( 0 \\).\n        - **Output:** \"Implausible\"\n    - Terminate calculation.\n    \nSince we discovered that the resolution leads to an empty clause, the output is \"Implausible\".\n\nTotal number of iterations: 1\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\n[[Implausible];[1]]\n```"}

This implies that $\\phi$ is eventually and necessarily true after some finite number of iterations of `c`.\n\nIn dynamic logic, this belief can be captured by stating that `c*` will eventually lead to `\u03c6` via execution of `c` repeatedly until `\u03c6` occurs, and is typically expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\langle c* \\rangle \\phi \\]\n\nThis expression states that it is possible through some execution sequence of `c` (potentially many iterations) that $\\phi$ will eventually be true.\n\nCombining the two forms, Alice\u2019s belief that the loop `c*` will ensure that proposition `\u03c6` is true could more simply be stated as:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\\phi \\equiv  \u03c6 \\vee [ c ][ c* ]\\phi  \\]\n\nGiven that we need minimal expressions, the simplest representation of Alice's belief, when interpreted as a necessity under repeated execution, can be given directly by:\n\n\\[ [ c* ]\u03c6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will continue to execute until the proposition `\u03c6` is true should be represented as follows:\n\n\\[ [ [ c* ] \u03c6 ] \\]"}

This means:\n- Evaluating its true assignment in binary: \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr is true when p = 0, q = 0, r = 0.\n- The binary representation for p = 0, q = 0, r = 0 is 000, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n\nTherefore, \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr corresponds to m0.\n\n2. **Categorizing the Formula:**\n\nWe now have to check the categories one by one:\n- **A. Tautology:** A is a tautology if it includes all 2^3 = 8 paired conjunctive terms. Since \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr translates only to m0, it does not include all 8 paired conjunctive terms.\n- **B. Contradiction:** A is a contradiction if it includes no paired conjunctive terms. \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr translates to m0, so it is not a contradiction.\n- **C. Basic formula:** A is a basic formula if it includes m0. Since \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr translates to m0, it is a basic formula.\n- **D. All-even formula:** A is an all-even formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are even. In this case, the only term is m0, which is even. So, it is an all-even formula.\n- **E. All-odd formula:** A is an all-odd formula if all indices of the paired conjunctive terms are odd. Here, the term m0 has an even index, so it is not an all-odd formula.\n\nThe true assignments point to the selections: C and D.\n\n### Answer:\n[[CD]]"}

Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2.

A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]"}

Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p1`\n   - `~p1&p2`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)`\n   - `~p3`\n   - `~(~p1&p2)||~p3`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is false, then both `~(~p1&p2)` must be false and `~p3` must be false.\n   - `~(~p1&p2)` is false when `~p1&p2` is true, which occurs when `p1` is false and `p2` is true.\n   - `~p3` is false when `p3` is true.\n\nCombining these, the falsity value for `~(~p1&p2)||~p3` is:\n`x|\u2713|\u2713` (p1 is false, p2 is true, p3 is true)\n\n#### Formula (2): `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n1. Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `~p2`\n   - `~p2||p3`\n   - `p1=::>p2`\n   - `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is false, then either `~p2||p3` is false, or `p1=::>p2` is false, or both.\n   - `~p2||p3` is false when `~p2` is false and `p3` is false. That happens when `p2` is true and `p3` is false.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Since this conflicts with `p2` being true, no combination exists to make both parts false simultaneously.\n\nThus, under these constraints, the falsity value for `(~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)` is:\n`\u2713|\u2713|x` (p1 is true, p2 is true, p3 is false)\n\n#### Formula (3): `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n1. Break down the formula into parts and evaluate the logical operations:\n   - `p1=::>p2`\n   - `p1&p3`\n   - `~(p1&p3)`\n   - `~(p1&p3)||p1`\n   - `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)`\n\n2. Identify the truth value combinations that make the entire formula false:\n   - If `(p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)` is false, then either `p1=::>p2` is false, or `~(p1&p3)||p1` is false, or both.\n   - `p1=::>p2` is false when `p1` is true and `p2` is false.\n   - `~(p1&p3)||p1` is false when `~(p1&p3)` is false and `p1` is false. That happens when `p1` is true and `p3` is true.\n\nCombining these constraints, we get:\n`\u2713|x|\u2713` (p1 is true, p2 is false, p3 is true)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n[[F:x|\u2713|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[F:\u2713|x|\u2713]]\n```"}

This is not directly applicable here since we are dealing with an observation and default assumption rather than varying information strengths.\n\n- **C% Principle**: Involves minimizing speech and using default assumptions unless evidence suggests otherwise, and expanding information based on convention. This matches the scenario, where just observation and minimal assertion lead to the inference that beer is part of the food.\n\n- **C! Principle**: Involves avoiding unnecessarily marked or lengthy expressions. This situation does not concern the use of complex expressions but rather simple assumptions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement aligns with the C% Principle because it follows a default interpretational assumption without additional evidence.\n\nThe answer is [[B]]."}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply the C-Reasoning Rule to this situation, we will first express the attributes observed in each sample. \n\nLet's denote:\n- `F` as the attribute 'student satisfaction'.\n- `k1` as the number of students satisfied in School X.\n- `n1` as the total number of students surveyed in School X.\n- `k2` as the number of students satisfied in School Y.\n- `n2` as the total number of students surveyed in School Y.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- `k1 = 180`\n- `n1 = 200`\n- `k2 = 210`\n- `n2 = 300`\n\nNow, we can calculate the proportions:\n- Proportion of satisfied students in School X: `p1 = k1/n1 = 180/200 = 0.9`\n- Proportion of satisfied students in School Y: `p2 = k2/n2 = 210/300 = 0.7`\n\nWe apply the C-Reasoning Rule because we have two samples and we want to compare if the populations from School X and School Y have similar proportions for the attribute 'student satisfaction'.\n\nUsing the notation for C-Reasoning:\nIf `C(F, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nIf `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`, then `Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`.\n\nIn conclusion, applying the C-Reasoning Rule here, we infer that the populations of School X and School Y have similar proportions of student satisfaction.\n\nThe answer, using the specified notation, is:\n\n[[C(F, 0.9, 0.7)]]"}

Convert the given formula into its disjunctive normal form (DNF) or conjunctive normal form (CNF).\n2. Identify if the converted form is comprised of all paired conjunctive terms (for CNF) or all paired disjunctive terms (for DNF).\n3. Check if the formula matches the criteria for being a tautology, contradiction, basic formula, all-even formula, or all-odd formula, based on the indices of the binary numbers corresponding to the terms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Convert to CNF (since the given form is close to CNF)**:\n\nThe formula is already in a CNF-like form:\n\\[ (p \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\n**Step 2: Check if it is a principal conjunctive normal form**:\n\nIn principal CNF, each clause would be a paired disjunctive term, meaning they should contain each variable in either negated or non-negated form exactly once.\n\n- Clause 1: \\( (p \\vee r) \\) - Missing \\( q \\)\n- Clause 2: \\( (\\neg q \\vee r) \\) - Missing \\( p \\)\n- Clause 3: \\( (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\) - Contains all variables\n\nNone of the clauses (except possibly the third one) are paired disjunctive terms, as they do not include every propositional variable exactly once.\n\nSince not all clauses are paired disjunctive terms, it cannot be considered as the principal conjunctive normal form. \n\n**Step 3: Convert to DNF and check if it is principal disjunctive normal form**:\n\n\\[ (p \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\]\n\nTo convert this to DNF:\n\nExpand the conjunctions:\n\\[ (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg p) \\vee (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge q) \\vee (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) \\vee (p \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p) \\vee (p \\wedge r \\wedge q) \\]\n\\[ \\vee (\\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p) \\vee (\\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge q) \\vee (r \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\]\n\nThis expression simplifies using the laws of logic to remove contradictions:\n\\[ (False) \\vee (False) \\vee (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) \\vee (False) \\vee (p \\wedge r \\wedge q) \\]\n\\[ \\vee (\\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p) \\vee (False) \\vee (False) \\]\n\nResulting simplified DNF:\n\\[ (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) \\vee (p \\wedge r \\wedge q) \\vee (\\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p) \\]\n\n**Step 4: Check for principal disjunctive normal form**:\n\nFor DNF, the true assignments of the terms above correspond to binary:\n\n- \\( p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r \\) -> True assignment \\(pqr = 100\\) -> Binary 100 = Decimal 4 (Hexadecimal 4)\n- \\( p \\wedge r \\wedge q \\) -> True assignment \\(pqr = 111\\) -> Binary 111 = Decimal 7 (Hexadecimal 7)\n- \\( \\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p \\) -> True assignment \\(\\neg p \\neg q r = 010\\) -> Binary 010 = Decimal 2 (Hexadecimal 2)\n\nIndices: 4, 7, 2\n\nSince they are paired disjunctive terms and the principal DNFs use the lower-case m notation (hexadecimal), we have:\n\\[ (p \\wedge \\neg q \\wedge \\neg r) = m4, (p \\wedge r \\wedge q) = m7, (\\neg q \\wedge r \\wedge \\neg p) = m2 \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula is [[A]; [m4 \u2228 m7 \u2228 m2]].\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ (p \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee q \\vee \\neg r) \\] conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form and can be denoted as \\[ [ [A]; [m4 \u2228 m7 \u2228 m2] ] \\]."}

We recognize that the implication \"if \\( p1 \\), then \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\)\" will be false only if \\( p1 \\) is true and \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) is false.\n\nHowever, for \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) to be false, all three propositions \\( p1 \\), \\( p2 \\), and \\( p3 \\) must be false. But this scenario contradicts our initial assumption that \\( p1 \\) is true.\n\nSo, since \\( p1 \\lor p2 \\lor p3 \\) will always be true when \\( p1 \\) is true, and the formula is true when \\( p1 \\) is false (because a false antecedent makes an implication true by default), \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is true under all possible assignments.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) \\) is a Truth Formula (A).\n\n(2) \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\)\n\nLet's analyze this step-by-step. The formula inside the implication is \\( p1=::>~p1 \\).\n\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is false when \\( p1 \\) is true since \\( ~p1 \\) would be false, thus leading to a false condition.\n- \\( p1=::>~p1 \\) is true when \\( p1 \\) is false because \\( ~p1 \\) would be true, making the implication true by default.\n\nNow, considering \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\):\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is true, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is false. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{false} =::> ~p2 \\) will depend on \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, making the entire implication true (since a false antecedent results in a true implication).\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, and this makes the implication false (a false antecedent and a true consequent make the implication false).\n\n- If \\( p1 \\) is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1) \\) is true. Therefore, the outer implication \\( \\text{true} =::> ~p2 \\) simplifies to \\( ~p2 \\):\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is true, \\( ~p2 \\) is false, resulting in a false implication.\n  - If \\( p2 \\) is false, \\( ~p2 \\) is true, resulting in a true implication.\n\nSince there are truth assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{false} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which this formula is false, \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) cannot be a Truth Formula. Likewise, there are assignments (like \\( p1 = \\text{true} \\) and \\( p2 = \\text{true} \\)) under which it is true, so it is not a Falsehood Formula.\n\nTherefore, the formula \\( (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 \\) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula (C).\n\nCombining our results for both sub-questions, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[A];[C]]\n\\]"}

So, formula (1) is a **Falsehood Formula (B)**.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nLet's analyze the equivalence over all combinations of p1 and p2.\n- If we expand this analysis to four possible cases for p1 and p3:\n  1. Both p1 and p3 are true (\u2713|\u2713).\n  2. Both p1 and p3 are false (x|x).\n  3. p1 is true and p3 is false (\u2713|x).\n  4. p1 is false and p3 is true (x|\u2713).\n\nFor both sides of the equivalence (whether they produce consistent results for each combination):\n- When p1 is true (\u2713), left side (p1&p3) is \u2713 if p3 is \u2713 or else x.\n- When p1 is false (x), left side (p1&p3) is always x regardless of p3.\n\nNow let's consider right side (~p1&~p2):\n- Right side when p1 is true (\u2713), ~p1 becomes x, which means it requires ~p2 to also be true given p1 is true needs ~ conditioned.\n- Right side when p1 is false (x), it then depends on both being conditioned on ~p3, hence ensuring true p2 and p1 expected values.\n\nEvery scenario implies consistent or contradictory equilibrium for both sides:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p3 | p1&p3 | ~p1 | ~p2 | ~p1&~p2 |\n|----|----|----|-------|-----|-----|--------|\n| x  | x  | x  | x     | \u2713   | \u2713   | \u2713     |\n| x  | x  | \u2713  | x     | \u2713   | \u2713   | \u2713     |\n| x  | \u2713  | x  | x     | \u2713   | x   |  x    |\n| x  | \u2713  | \u2713  | x     | \u2713   | x   | \u2713     |\n| \u2713  | x  | x  | x     | x   | \u2713   | x     |\n| \u2713  | x  | \u2713  | \u2713     | x   | \u2713   |  x    |\n| \u2713  | \u2713  | x  | x     expansion here  all consistent `possible false \\/potential x`checks validation due\n| \u2713  | \u2713  | \u2713  | \u2713     [matching ful!leque] no full contradiction\n \nGiven this analysis properly simplified:\n\nSince both options or all scenarios lead to result non-matching equivalency scenario wherein one tuple crossroads fail validation without mirrored truth :\n- Means can't guarantee similar level reflection:\n\nFormula (2) therefore technically **Neither (C)**, as it doesn't validate across the majority scenario doesn't comprehensively truth effective.\n\n**So final Answer ([[B]; [C]]) Please find below.**\n\n### Answer:\n[[B];[C]]"}

This response could be tied to the C* Principle, as it doesn't provide the strongest possible statement (\"We are finished\"), likely because that would conflict with the actual status (\"details left to address\"). It leaves the listener to infer the actual completion status.\n    - CQ1: B says \"We have finished most of the work, with only a few details left to address.\" This implies B knows they can't assert they are fully finished (A(s) = \"We are finished\").\n    - CQ2: The phrase excludes \"fully completed\".\n\n- **C's Response:** This suggests that although there is work left, the main part is completed. C uses more nuanced language (\"essentially wrapped up\"). This could be tied to the C!

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nIdentify (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228 (p\u2227q\u2227r) as: (select all that apply)\nA. Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic formula D. All-even formula E. All-odd formula F. None of the above.\nThe answer format should be like [[AB...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the classification of the formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (p \u2227 q \u2227 r), we need to evaluate it based on the provided logical rules.\n\n1. Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of \u00acp, \u00acq, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r.\n   - (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p \u2227 q \u2227 r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it\u2019s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it\u2019s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it\u2019s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it\u2019s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it\u2019s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Based on the given rules, none of these classifications (A, B, C, D, E) apply to the formula provided.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given 16 Basic Equivalences and the rules for propositional symbolization, let's evaluate each equivalence to determine if it holds true.\n\n#### Equivalence (1): ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n1. Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p \u21d1 q) & (p \u21d1 r) ::=:: p \u21d1 (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2. Apply negation using equivalence (6):\n   - \\(!(p = q)) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\\)\n   - Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6):\n     \\[ !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p) \\]\n     Using De Morgan transformation:\n     \\[ (!p | q)' ::=:: !p & !q' \u2192 p & !q \\]\n     So:\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: (p & !q) | (!q & p) \n\n3. Simplify other side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n    - Apply equivalence (6):\n    ikkore komi:\n   - \\((p | q) & !(p & q) = (p | q) & (!p | !q)\\)\n\nNow compare:\n   \\[(p & !q) | (!q & !p)=   \\((p | q) & !(p & q) \\]\n\nSo because equivalence states:\n\n The equivalence holds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the representations of the given statements confirm their validity.\n\n**Answer**: [[A];[A]].\n"}
