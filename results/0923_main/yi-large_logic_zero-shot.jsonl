This can be represented as \"p1 =::> p2\" because it is essentially saying \"if 4 is even, then 5 is odd.\"\n\n(2) If 4 is even, then 5 is even.\nThis directly translates to \"if p1, then p3\" where p3 represents \"5 is even.\" However, since we are only working with p1 (4 is even) and p2 (5 is odd), we need to adjust p3 to fit within our given propositions. Since p2 is \"5 is odd,\" the negation of p2 would be \"5 is even.\" Thus, this proposition is symbolized as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(3) Only 4 being even makes 5 even.\nThis statement implies that 5 being even is exclusively contingent on 4 being even. There's a subtle difference here from the previous proposition in that it suggests the uniqueness of this condition. However, given the logical connectives at our disposal, and considering the constraint of only using p1 and p2, this can be closely represented as a combination of the previous ideas, emphasizing that if 4 is not even, then 5 is not even (which is equivalent to saying 5 is odd). Symbolically, this could be \"~(~p1 & ~p2)\", meaning it's not the case that both 4 is not even and 5 is not odd, which implies that if 4 is even, then 5 is not odd (i.e., 5 is even). However, to maintain the simplicity and directly address the given propositions without introducing new logical structures, this can also be seen as reiterating the point made in (2), focusing on the uniqueness of the condition, so we'll keep it as \"p1 =::> ~p2.\"\n\n(4) 4 is even if and only if 5 is odd.\nThis is a straightforward biconditional statement, meaning 4 is even is a necessary and sufficient condition for 5 to be odd. This is symbolized as \"p1 = p2.\"\n\nPutting it all together in the requested format:\n\n[[p1 =::> p2];[p1 =::> ~p2];[p1 =::> ~p2];[p1 = p2]]\n\nNote: For (3), there's a nuance in interpretation due to the phrasing \"Only...makes,\" which could imply a uniqueness of the condition that makes it a bit complex to capture precisely with the given logical structure. However, given the constraints and aiming for the closest representation while adhering strictly to the provided propositions (p1, p2) and their negations, the simplification chosen aims to reflect the essence of the statement in the given logical framework."}

If p1 is true, then p1 or p2 must also be true.

If both p1 and p2 are true (the only case where the antecedent is true), then p1 is indeed true, satisfying the implication.

Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are equivalent, we first need to convert each expression into a form that only uses `|`, `&`, and `!`, based on the provided logical equivalences.\n\n1. Convert `(p>q)>r`:\n   - `p>q` is equivalent to `!p | q` (by equivalence 10).\n   - So, `(p>q)>r` becomes `!(!p | q) | r`.\n   - Applying De Morgan's law (equivalence 6), `!(!p | q)` becomes `!(!p) & !q`, which simplifies to `p & !q`.\n   - Thus, `(p>q)>r` is equivalent to `(p & !q) | r`.\n\n2. Convert `p>(q>r)`:\n   - `q>r` is equivalent to `!q | r` (by equivalence 10).\n   - So, `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n   - This is already in the required form: `!p | !q | r`.\n\nNow, we compare the two transformed expressions:\n- `(p>q)>r` became `(p & !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` became `!p | !q | r`.\n\nTo check if these are equivalent, we can't directly compare them in their current forms because they are not identical. However, we can apply further logical transformations to see if they can be made identical.\n\nLet's manipulate the second expression `!p | !q | r` to see if it can match `(p & !q) | r`:\n- Distribute `r` into the first expression: `(!p | r) | (!q | r)`\n- This doesn't directly lead to a match with `(p & !q) | r`.\n\nGiven that we've reached a point where we cannot manipulate either expression into the form of the other through the provided equivalence rules, we conclude that `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are not equivalent under the given logical system.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[B]]\n\nThis conclusion is in line with how logical implication typically behaves; implication is not associative, meaning that `(p>q)>r` is not equivalent to `p>(q>r)`. This is consistent with our analysis using the provided equivalence rules."}

We aim to express the result in the simplest form using only `|`, `&`, and `!`.\n\n### Expression 1: !(p>(p|q))&r\n\n1. Apply rule (10) to transform implication into disjunction:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | (p|q)\n\n2. Apply rule (5) to distribute `p` over `|q`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | p | q\n\n3. Apply rule (8) to simplify `p | !p`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: 1 | q ::=:: 1 (since 1 | q is always true)\n\n4. Negate the result from step 3:\n   !(p>(p|q)) ::=:: !1 ::=:: 0\n\n5.

For the first equivalence `((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))`, let's apply the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Start with `(p>q)&(p>r)`:\n   - By (10 ) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`, we can rewrite both implications:\n     `(!p | q)&(!p | r)`\n   - Distribute `!p` over both sides (using the principle behind (5 ) but for `|`):\n     `(!p&!p) | (q&!p) | (!p&r) | (q&r)`\n   - Simplify by removing redundant conjunctions (using the idea from (2 )):\n     `!p | (q&!p) | (r&!p) | (q&r)`\n   - This doesn't directly simplify to `!p | (q|r)` (the right side of the original equivalence) without further assumptions, but let's check if they are equivalent under the rules:\n     - We can distribute `!p` over `(q|r)`:\n       `!p | (q&!p) | (r&!p) | (q&r)`\n     - This matches our previous expression, so we can say:\n       `(!p | (q|r))`\n     - Thus, the first equivalence is valid.\n\n2. For the second equivalence `!(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)`, let's apply the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Start with `!(p=q)`:\n   - By (7 ) and (11 ), `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)` and `A > B ::=:: !A | B`, `p=q` can be written as `(!p | q)&(!q | p)`.\n   - Negate this using (6 ): `!((!p | q)&(!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p)`\n   - Applying (6 ) again, `!(!p | q) ::=:: p & !q`, and similarly `!(!q | p) ::=:: q & !p`:\n     `(p&!q) | (q&!p)`\n   - This is equivalent to `(p|q)&!(p&q)` as given by the distributive laws and the properties of negation, confirming that the second equivalence is also valid.\n\nGiven the analytical steps and the matching results, both equivalences are valid according to the 16 Basic Equivalences provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n`[[A];[A]]`"}

The answer format should be:\n[[C1=...];[C2=...];[C3=...];[D1=...];[D2=...];[D3=...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To adhere to the provided logical rules and the unique notation system, let's symbolize the statements of Person B and Person C in a manner consistent with the task. Recall that our propositions are:\n- p: Professor Wang is from Suzhou.\n- q: Professor Wang is from Shanghai.\n- r: Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\n\nThe statements were:\n- Person B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou. (This can be represented as !q & p.)\n- Person C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou. (This can be represented as !q & !r.)\n\nNow, based on the given logical expressions for Person A, we construct similar expressions for Person B and Person C, considering entirely correct, partially correct, and entirely incorrect scenarios:\n\n#### For Person B:\n- B1 = !q & p (Person B's statements are entirely correct).\n- B2 = (!q & !p) | (q & p) (Person B's statements are partially correct; this means one part of the statement is correct and the other is not).\n- B3 = q & !p (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\n#### For Person C:\n- C1 = !q & !r (Person C's statements are entirely correct).\n- C2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r) (Person C's statements are partially correct; this means one part of the statement is correct and the other is not).\n- C3 = q & r (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nPutting it all together in the requested format:\n```\n[[C1 = !q & p];\n [C2 = (!q & !p) | (q & p)];\n [C3 = q & !p];\n [D1 = !q & !r];\n [D2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)];\n [D3 = q & r]]\n```\n\nThis format provides the logical expressions for evaluating the truthfulness of each person's statements according to the described scenarios and the custom logical notation system."}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the constraints and the logical expressions derived from Professor Wang's remarks, we can simplify and analyze the possibilities to determine the correct answers.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the given expression `E` using the equivalence calculation rules:\n\n`E::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r)`\n\nSince we know that exactly one of `p`, `q`, `r` is true and the other two are false, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. If `q` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Shanghai), then `r` and `p` must be false. This would make the first part of the expression `!p&q&!r` false, but since `p` is false, the second part `p&!q&r` is also false. This contradicts the fact that `E` must denote a situation where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect. Therefore, `q` cannot be true on its own.\n\n2. If `r` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Hangzhou), then `p` and `q` must be false. This would make both parts of `E` false, which is also a contradiction. Thus, `r` cannot be true on its own.\n\n3. If `p` is true (which means Professor Wang is from Suzhou), then `q` and `r` must be false. This makes the first part of `E` false (`!p&q&!r`), but the second part `p&!q&r` simplifies to `p&!q&!r` since `r` is false, which matches the requirement for one of the persons to be entirely correct (in this case, Person B with `p&!q`). This situation also fits the condition where one person is entirely correct, one is partially correct, and one is entirely incorrect.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can conclude that Professor Wang is from Suzhou (`p` is true, `q` and `r` are false).\n\nNow, let's analyze who got what correct:\n\n- Person A: `!p&q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person A is entirely incorrect.\n- Person B: `p&!q` - Since `p` is true and `q` is false, Person B is entirely correct.\n- Person C: `!q&!r` - Since `q` is false and `r` is also false, Person C is partially correct because only one part of their statement is right (the part about not being from Shanghai), and the other part (about not being from Hangzhou when he is actually not) is redundant given our knowledge, making it neither fully right nor fully wrong in context.\n\nTherefore, the answer format with the correct assignments is:\n\n`[[Suzhou]; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: C]; [entirely incorrect: A]]`"}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired disjunctive terms:...];[denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the paired disjunctive terms of the given expression \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), we first need to understand the possible truth assignments that satisfy this expression. The expression is in a conjunctive form, where both clauses must be true for the entire expression to be true. \n\nGiven the expression, we can see that \\(\\neg q \\vee r\\) is common to both clauses, meaning that for the entire expression to be true, either \\(q\\) must be false (\\(\\neg q\\)) or \\(r\\) must be true, or both. The variable \\(p\\) and its negation \\(\\neg p\\) appear in separate clauses, which means that the truth value of \\(p\\) does not affect the outcome, as long as one of the clauses has \\(p\\) true and the other has \\(\\neg p\\) true.\n\nThe paired disjunctive terms (in this case, we are looking for the minimal conditions under which each clause could be true, which will correspond to the false assignments for the paired disjunctive terms) can be identified by considering the conditions that would make each clause false, which would then make the entire expression false. For the first clause \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\) to be false, \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) must be false, and \\(q\\) must be true. Similarly, for the second clause \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\) to be false, \\(p\\) must be true, \\(q\\) must be true, and \\(r\\) must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can form the paired disjunctive terms by considering these false assignments and ensuring they are in lexicographical order:\n\n1. For the first clause to be false: \\(p\\) false, \\(q\\) true, \\(r\\) false, which corresponds to \\(\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r\\).\n2. For the second clause to be false: \\(p\\) true, \\(q\\) true, \\(r\\) false, which corresponds to \\(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r\\).\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the paired disjunctive terms (corresponding to the false assignments), we actually want the negation of these conditions, which will give us the minimal true conditions (paired disjunctive terms) as:\n\n1. \\(\\neg(\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M0\\) because the false assignment \\(\\neg p\\) (binary 0), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 010, which is 2 in decimal and 2 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, this corresponds to no false (all true), which is \\(M0\\).\n2. \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M3\\) because the false assignment \\(p\\) (binary 1), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 110, which is 6 in decimal and 6 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, we subtract 1 (to find the minimal true condition) to get 5 in decimal, which is 5 in hexadecimal, so \\(M5\\). (The correct interpretation here is that the truth assignment 110 corresponds to 6 in decimal, which maps to \\(M6\\), but since we are negating the assignment to find the disjunct, we actually have \\(M6\\) as the paired term. The confusion earlier was in mixing the negation operation with the hexadecimal conversion step.)\n\nTherefore, the correct paired disjunctive terms and their notation for the given expression are:\n\n\\[\n[[paired\\ disjunctive\\ terms: M0, M6]; [denoted: M0 \\vee M6]]\n\\]\n\nThe corrected interpretation should reflect that the truth assignment of \\(p\\) (1), \\(q\\) (1), \\(r\\) (0) corresponds to \\(110\\) in binary, which is \\(6\\) in decimal and \\(6\\) in hexadecimal, thus directly giving us \\(M6\\) without the need for subtraction, as the subtraction was an error in interpreting the process. The other term correctly corresponds to \\(M0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n[[paired\\ disjunctive\\ terms: M0, M6]; [denoted: M0 \\vee M6]]\n\\]\n\nThis correction aligns with the rule that the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number \\(i\\), denoted as \\(Mi\\)."}

However, since we're directly given the formula in a simple conjunctive form, we're looking for its representation in terms of paired conjunctive terms for its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. The principal disjunctive normal form of any formula includes all possible paired conjunctive terms that make the formula true. In this case, the formula is true only when all variables are false. Thus, its principal disjunctive normal form would indeed include m0, as it's the only term that corresponds to all variables being false.\n\nBased on the given criteria:\n\n- This formula is not a tautology since its principal disjunctive normal form does not include all 2^n (in this case, 2^3 = 8) paired conjunctive terms. It only includes m0.\n- It is not a contradiction since its principal disjunctive normal form does include paired conjunctive terms (specifically, m0).\n- It is a basic formula because its principal disjunctive normal form includes m0.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these classifications apply to the indices of the included paired conjunctive terms, which here is just m0 (an even number), but the classification requires all indices to be even or all indices to be odd, which does not apply given only one term.\n\nThus, the correct classification for \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr, according to the given logic rule and the specific definitions provided, is:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula).\n\nHowever, the question seems to mix the classification of formulas based on their principal disjunctive normal form (which includes terms like m0) with the classification based on their direct form as a simple conjunctive or disjunctive term. Since the formula \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr is directly given as a simple conjunctive term, and given the way the rule is structured, a more accurate interpretation, considering the question's format, might be looking for its classification based on its direct form. In that case, we would say:\n\n- It is not a tautology.\n- It is not a contradiction (because it's a well-formed, satisfiable formula).\n- It can be considered a basic formula in the context of being directly equivalent to m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, though the question seems to mix these interpretations.\n- It is neither an all-even nor an all-odd formula, as these apply to the principal disjunctive normal form, and the direct form \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr doesn't fit these classifications in their currently mixed context.\n\nGiven the direct interpretation of the question and the options provided, without considering the mixed contexts of classification, the answer would more accurately reflect the direct form of the formula and its interpretation as a simple conjunctive term. However, since the question seeks an answer in the [[AB...]] format, strictly based on the given options and interpreting the question as asking for classifications based on the direct form of the formula rather than its principal disjunctive normal form, the most fitting answer would still be:\n\n[[C]] (Basic formula), considering the direct interpretation of the question seeks an equivalent classification for the given simple conjunctive term, and given the options provided, this aligns best with the intention of identifying m0 in its principal disjunctive normal form interpretation, even though the direct form doesn't inherently carry 'm' labels. \n\nIf strictly adhering to the direct interpretation of the formula and its immediate classification (correcting for the misinterpretation of expecting an 'm' label for a simple conjunctive term), which seems to be the intention given the provided options and the format, the answer would be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above), because the given formula, in its direct form as a simple conjunctive term, does not directly fit the provided classifications as they are explicitly defined for forms that include 'm' terms, and it does not strictly adhere to the 'm' notation or classification based on its direct form. However, given the provided context and the initial interpretation based on the principal disjunctive normal form (which includes the equivalent m0), the answer [[C]] (Basic formula) was provided, acknowledging the mix-up in interpretation between direct form and principal disjunctive normal form. The correction, considering the direct interpretation and the strict adherence to the provided lettered options without 'm' references, leads to [[F]] as the technically correct answer based on the direct form of the formula. \n\nThe confusion arises from the question's structure and the provided options not aligning perfectly with the direct form of the formula. Clarifying that the question seeks a direct interpretation of the formula without considering its principal disjunctive normal form (which was the initial assumption based on the provided logic rule), the final, technically accurate answer, aligning with the question's structure and provided options strictly, would then be:\n\n[[F]] (None of the above). This is because, strictly speaking, the direct form \u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr does not directly match any of the classifications A through E as explicitly defined for the 'm' and 'M' terms without those labels in the direct form context. However, interpreting the question with the initial context provided by the logic rule led to considering its equivalent in the principal disjunctive normal form, suggesting [[C]] (Basic formula). The correct answer, strictly adhering to direct form interpretation and provided options, is thus [[F]]."}

The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer the question, let's break down the information given by the logical rule:\n\n1. Formula A is a tautology if its principal disjunctive normal form includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Since A contains 4 propositional variables, \\(n = 4\\), thus \\(2^n = 2^4 = 16\\). This means A's principal disjunctive normal form would contain m0, m1, m2, ..., m15.\n\n2. Formula A is a basic formula if its principal disjunctive normal form includes m0.\n\nSince A is both a tautology and a basic form, it must include m0 and all other possible paired conjunctive terms from m1 to m15. However, being a tautology is the dominant property here because it implies the formula is true under all possible truth assignments, and this condition alone satisfies the requirement for being a basic formula (since being a basic formula only requires the inclusion of m0, which is already covered by being a tautology).\n\nGiven these conditions, if A is both a tautology and a basic form, it must include all the paired conjunctive terms from m0 to m15. Therefore, A should be denoted as containing all these terms:\n\n\\[[m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]\\]\n\nSo, the answer in the required format is:\n\n\\[[m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12, m13, m14, m15]\\]"}

This means that the formula must have at least one term where all propositional variables are negated (since the false assignment corresponds to \\(1111\\) in binary, or \\(F\\) in hexadecimal, for 4 propositional variables).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even form if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. In hexadecimal, even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. For 4 propositional variables, these correspond to specific truth assignments.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible paired conjunctive terms, ranging from \\(m_0\\) to \\(m_{F}\\) in hexadecimal. For a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must contain \\(m_0\\) (to satisfy the basic form condition) and can only contain other terms with even indices (to satisfy the all-even form condition).\n\nThe even indices for 4 propositional variables are: \\(m_0\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_4\\), \\(m_6\\), \\(m_8\\), \\(m_{A}\\), \\(m_{C}\\), \\(m_{E}\\).\n\nFor a formula to be both basic and all-even, it must include \\(m_0\\) and can optionally include any combination of the other even-indexed terms. The number of such formulas corresponds to the power set of the set of even-indexed terms excluding \\(m_0\\) (since \\(m_0\\) is mandatory), minus one (to exclude the case with no terms other than \\(m_0\\), since we've already counted it as a basic form).\n\nThere are 7 other even-indexed terms besides \\(m_0\\). The power set of a set with 7 elements has \\(2^7\\) members. However, we exclude the case with no additional terms (since we're counting combinations that include \\(m_0\\)), leaving \\(2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\\) possible combinations.\n\nThus, there are 127 formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form, formatted as required:\n\n```\n[127]\n```"}

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad.

Translating these to the selection of researchers A, B, and C:\n\n1. (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) corresponds to A not going, B not going, and C going. This translates to only C going.\n2.

The rule states that if we have two clauses `C1 = C3 \u2228 L` and `C2 = C4 \u2228 L'`, where `L` and `L'` are complements, then `dispel(C1, C2) = C3 \u2228 C4`.\n\nGiven `C1 = \u00acp \u2228 q \u2228 r` and `C2 = p \u2228 \u00acr \u2228 \u00acs`, we need to find a literal and its complement in the two clauses. However, upon inspection, we see that there is no direct literal and its complement between `C1` and `C2` that would allow for an immediate resolution step with the provided literals. The complements between `C1` and `C2` are `r` and `\u00acr`, but since `r` is not alone in `C1` and `\u00acr` is not alone in `C2`, we cannot directly apply the resolution rule as described without first simplifying or making assumptions based on other resolution steps.\n\nThe defined rule assumes a direct resolution between two clauses based on a single literal and its complement, which is not the case here with the given `C1` and `C2`. Therefore, to apply the rule directly as stated, we would first need to either introduce more clauses or consider the conjunction of these clauses with others that would allow for the proper application of the resolution rule.\n\nGiven the strict interpretation of the provided rule and the lack of a direct application to the given `C1` and `C2` without additional steps, `dispel(C1, C2)` does not result in a resolution that can be expressed directly in the form of `C3 \u2228 C4` without further resolution steps or additional clauses to facilitate the process.\n\nThus, with the provided `C1` and `C2` and adhering strictly to the rule's definition, the answer is that there is no direct application of `dispel(C1, C2)` resulting in a simple disjunctive clause `C3 \u2228 C4` based on the immediate complements `r` and `\u00acr`. Therefore, the answer in the requested format would be `[[]]`, indicating that no new clause is derived from the direct resolution of `C1` and `C2` according to the given rule without additional context or steps.\n\nHowever, if one were to perform a full resolution procedure, additional steps might involve creating new clauses by resolving `\u00acp` with `p` or `q` with `\u00acs` after resolving `r` and `\u00acr`, but this would require more than one resolution step and the introduction of intermediate clauses, which is beyond the scope of the question as it is looking for a direct application of `dispel(C1, C2)`."}

Therefore, \\(S_0 = \\emptyset\\).\n\n2. \\(S_1\\) is the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form \\((\u00acp \\vee q) \\wedge (p \\vee q) \\wedge (q)\\). This set includes each of the conjuncts (remember, each conjunct is a clause in disjunctive normal form):\n   - \\(C_1 = \u00acp \\vee q\\)\n   - \\(C_2 = p \\vee q\\)\n   - \\(C_3 = q\\)\n   Thus, \\(S_1 = \\{\u00acp \\vee q, p \\vee q, q\\}\\).\n\n3. \\(S_2\\) is initially empty because it starts with no new derived clauses.

Since \\(q\\) is already in \\(S_1\\), we do not add it to \\(S_2\\).\n- Resolving \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_3\\) is not applicable because \\(C_3\\) does not contain the complement of any literal in \\(C_1\\).\n- Resolving \\(C_2\\) and \\(C_3\\) yields \\(\\emptyset\\) (because \\(dispel(C_2, C_3) = dispel(p \\vee q, q) = \\emptyset\\)), but this is an empty clause, indicating a contradiction. However, since the rule specifies adding non-empty resolutions to \\(S_2\\), we do not add anything in this case.\n\nSince no new non-empty clauses were derived that are not already in \\(S_1\\), \\(S_2\\) remains empty after this iteration.\n\nTherefore, \\(S_2\\) after the first loop iteration is still \\(\\emptyset\\).\n\nThe answer in the requested format is:\n\\[[\\emptyset; \\{\u00acp \\vee q, p \\vee q, q\\}; \\emptyset]\\]\n\nNote that the format requested mixes the use of `[]` and `{}` for sets, which is not standard.

No further resolution is needed with these clauses.\n   \n   - Resolving \\((q \\vee \\neg r)\\) with \\((q \\vee r)\\) using the literal \\(q\\), we get \\(\\neg r \\vee r\\), which again is a tautology and resolves to \\(0\\).

Combining these, we get:\n  - \"For all x, if x is a prime number, then x is 2\" symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 x = 2).\n  - \"4 is not a prime number\" symbolized as \u223cF(4).\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use 0-ary predicates for the symbolization, and 0-ary predicates by definition do not take any individual variables, we need to treat each statement as an atomic predicate that is either true or false without reference to variables. Thus, we can represent the statements directly as:\n  - P1: \"Only 2 is a prime number\" can be represented as a 0-ary predicate A, where A stands for the truth of this statement.\n  - P2: \"4 is a composite number\" (or equivalently, \"4 is not a prime number\") can be represented as \u223cB, where B stands for the statement \"4 is a prime number\" (which is false based on the given information).\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (1) using 0-ary predicates is [A; \u223cB].\n\n(2) If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\n- For this part, we define a binary predicate G(x, y): x > y.\n- The proposition is a conditional statement that can be symbolized directly as \"If G(5, 4) then G(4, 6)\" where G(5, 4) represents \"5 > 4\" and G(4, 6) represents \"4 > 6.\"\n\nTo fit this into 0-ary predicates, we treat the entire conditional statement as a single 0-ary predicate that is either true or false. Let C stand for the truth of the entire conditional statement \"If 5 > 4 then 4 > 6.\"\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (2) using 0-ary predicates is [C].\n\nCombining both parts into the requested format:\n\nThe answer is [[A; \u223cB]; [C]].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this interpretation stretches the concept of 0-ary predicates for the sake of adhering to the formatting requirements, as typically, 0-ary predicates would not be used to represent relationships between specific numbers but rather would represent fixed, atomic statements of truth or falsehood without reference to variables."}

Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2). The proposition states that both of these properties hold for the number 2. Thus, we have:\n- `[F(2) & G(2)]`\n\n(2) If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime.\nFirst, we express \"2 is prime\" as G(2). For \"4 is not prime\", we negate the predicate for \"4 is prime\", which is G(4), resulting in \u223cG(4). The implication between these two is then:\n- `[G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]`\n\n(3) Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime.\nThis statement suggests that if 6 is prime, then 2 must be the only prime number. To represent this, we use an implication where the premise is \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) and the conclusion is that for all numbers, if they are prime, they must be equal to 2. This can be represented by saying for all x, if x is prime and x is not 2, then this is not possible (assuming equality is represented by EQ(x, y) for x and y being equal):\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 Ax((G(x) & \u223cEQ(x, 2)) \u21d2 \u223c(x))]`\nHowever, given the constraint of 0-ary predicates and the fact that we are not explicitly given an equality predicate, we can interpret this to mean that if 6 is prime, then any prime number other than 2 is not prime, adapting the statement to fit the 0-ary predicate structure:\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]`\nHere, `x \u2260 2` is represented as `\u223cEQ(x, 2)` but adjusted for the constraint of 0-ary predicates, understanding `x \u2260 2` as a given, interpretable condition rather than a predicate in its own right.\n\n(4) Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime.\nThis statement can be interpreted as \"if 6 is not prime, then 4 is prime\". We negate the predicate for \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) to represent \"6 is not prime\" (\u223cG(6)), and the conclusion is \"4 is prime\" (G(4)). The implication is then:\n- `[\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]`\n\nPutting all the answers in the requested format:\n`[[F(2) & G(2)]; [G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]; [G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]; [\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]]`\n\nNote: For the third proposition, the interpretation adheres to the 0-ary predicate constraints but approximates the intended logical structure, given the limitations of the provided predicates and the absence of equality predicates or direct numerical comparisons in the 0-ary predicate system."}

Thus, the correct interpretation, adhering strictly to FJ's definition, in the context of the logic rule and symbols provided, should be:\n\n\u2200xFJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y)\n\nThis formula reads as \"For all x, if the result of the function gJ applied to x and 0 equals x (which simplifies to if 0 equals x), then x equals y.\"\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula under \ud835\udc3d, in the specified format, is:\n\n[[]]\n[\u2200x(FJ(0,x) \u2192 FJ(x,y))]\n\nPlease note the adjustment to directly use FJ as per its definition, reflecting the logical language \ud835\udc40's requirements."}

Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38, which is already given as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. Replace entity constants with their assignments. In this case, 'a' is replaced with its assignment 'a\u2032 = 2'.\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols with their implementations. This means 'f' is replaced with 'fJ(x, y) = x + y' and 'g' is replaced with 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols with their implementations. Here, 'F' is replaced with 'FJ(x, y)', which denotes 'x = y'.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to each formula:\n\n(1) \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'g' with its implementation, 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is: \u2200xFJ(gJ(x, 2), x), which simplifies to \u2200xFJ(x * 2, x). Implementing the predicate FJ(x, y) as 'x = y', we get:\n\n\u2200x(x * 2 = x)\n\nHowever, since we are working with natural numbers and the predicate FJ(x, y) is 'x = y', we need to express the formula in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) \u2203xF(f(x,a),y)\u2192\u2203yF(f(y,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'f' with its implementation, 'fJ(x, y) = x + y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is:\n\n\u2203x FJ(fJ(x, 2), y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(fJ(y, 2), x)\n\nSubstituting the implementations of 'fJ' and 'FJ':\n\n\u2203x (x + 2 = y) \u2192 \u2203y (y + 2 = x)\n\nExpressing this in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nTherefore, the answers in the requested format are:\n\n(1) [[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) [[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nNote: The double square brackets notation seems to be an unusual format for expressing logical formulas.

How so?\nPerson A: My grandfather is a case in point. He speaks very straightforwardly and often does good deeds with bad intentions. I remember one time he invited some friends over for dinner.\nPerson B: That's nice, everyone can get together.\nPerson A: The appointment was for six in the evening, and by half past five, three people had arrived, but one important guest hadn't shown up yet.\nPerson B: Then wait a bit longer, if they don't come, start eating without them.\nPerson A: My grandfather is a punctual person. When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply Method C to the proposition \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed,\" we first perform obversion, which involves changing the quality of the proposition (from affirmative to negative or negative to affirmative) and replacing the predicate with its contrary. Then, we perform conversion, which means exchanging the positions of the subject and predicate.\n\n1. **Obversion**: The original proposition is in the form of a particular affirmative proposition (I), but its content is essentially a universal affirmative (A) because it implies that all who have left should have stayed. Applying obversion to \"All who have left are [those who should have stayed]\" results in \"All who have left are not [those who should not have stayed].\"\n\n2. **Conversion**: Now we convert the proposition by exchanging the subject and predicate, resulting in \"All [those who should not have stayed] are not who have left.\"\n\nTherefore, applying Method C to \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed,\" we get:\n\n- **Method C**: \"All [non-P: those who should not have stayed] are not [S: who have left].\"\n\nIn the requested format:\n\n[[\"All [non-P: those who should not have stayed] are not [S: who have left]\"]]\n\nThis is a direct application of Method C, where the original proposition has been obverted and then converted, following the specific logical operations defined."}

This method can be directly applied to our Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) to convert it into a new proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject, as follows: \"All C is F\" can be converted to \"Some F is C\" (since conversion of A to I is valid). However, this results in a Particular Affirmative Proposition (I) rather than a Universal proposition. The question seems to be asking for a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning.\"\n\n- **Method C** involves first performing obversion (Method A) and then performing conversion (Method B). Starting with \"All C is F,\" applying obversion gives us \"All C is not non-F\" (though this step doesn't change the meaning substantially in logical terms, as \"not non-F\" is equivalent to \"F\"), and then applying conversion would yield \"Some non-F is not C.\" This doesn't achieve the desired inference either, as it negates both terms and doesn't place \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in the form we likely want.\n\nHowever, interpreting the question as seeking a method to derive a Universal proposition about \"formally correct reasoning\" from the given premise, the most appropriate method to infer a Universal proposition with \"formally correct reasoning\" (F) as the subject while maintaining the essence of the original statement, is to leverage a combination of insights from the methods, though not directly any single method as described. We can infer a new Universal Affirmative Proposition (A) by understanding that if all of a subset (correct reasoning, C) shares a property (being formally correct, F), then to say something about the whole set of things with that property (formally correct reasoning, F), we can infer that \"All F must include all C.\" This isn't directly Method A, B, or C but is derived from our understanding of set relations in syllogistic reasoning. However, to fit within the constraints of the methods provided, the closest fit would be **Method B** applied with a slight adjustment to retain the Universal quantity, focusing on the subject-predicate exchange principle: \"All C is F\" implies \"All F is at least C,\" which is a valid inference in this context but goes beyond the simple conversion to emphasize the Universal quantity.\n\nThus, the method that most closely aligns with the inference we want, while not fitting exactly due to the need to preserve the Universal nature of the proposition, is:\n\n**[[B]]**\n\nThis adjustment is made to interpret the question's request for \"formally correct reasoning\" as the subject in a Universal proposition, recognizing the limitations of the provided methods in directly achieving this without some interpretation or extension of their principles."}

The given statements are:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS\n3. \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (\u2200P \u21d2 M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (\u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acM (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), \u2234S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, \u2234S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies \u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (\u2200P \u21d2 M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (\u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S, equivalent to \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation. The answer is:\n\n[[II];[EAE]]\n\nPlease note, the interpretation involved a logical step to align the second premise with the E mood of the EAE mood in Figure II, ensuring the overall logical consistency and adherence to the syllogism structure provided in the instructions."}

The conclusion is in the form SOP, which indicates a negative particular conclusion (O: \u2203p1 \u21d2\u00acp2). \n\nGiven the conclusion SOP, we can deduce that it must be in Figure I, II, or IV, as Figure III does not support a conclusion that starts with \"S()P\".

The EIO mood requires the first premise to be in the form \u2200p1 \u21d2\u00acp2 (E proposition), and the second premise to be in the form \u2203p1 \u21d2p2 (I proposition), leading to a conclusion of the form \u2203p1 \u21d2\u00acp2 (O proposition).\n\nThus, the correct fill for the parentheses would be:\n- First premise: E (\u2200p1 \u21d2\u00acp2)\n- Second premise: I (\u2203p1 \u21d2p2)\n\nGiven the format required, the answer is:\n`[[E];[I];[O];[EIO]]`\n\nThis indicates that the syllogism follows an EIO mood, which is valid in Figure I, II, or IV, and the specific form for the given premises and conclusion is:\n- M()P (E)\n- S()M (I)\n- \u2234SOP (EIO)"}

This can be symbolized using the implication symbol (>) between the two propositions, with the second being a possibility ($q).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the symbolized propositions enclosed in parentheses and modal symbols for each statement are:\n\n(1) The necessity of either life or no life in a fire can be represented as #(p - \u00acp), where the - symbol represents the inclusive disjunction as per the logic rule notation guide.\n\n(2) The conditional relationship of if Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship can be represented as (p > $q), where p implies the possibility of q.\n\nPutting these into the requested [[];[]] format:\n\n[[#(p - \u00acp)];[(p > $q)]]\n\nThis format captures the initial symbolizations, which are then enclosed in square brackets to meet the output format requirements."}

This is saying it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, which is equivalent to saying it is not possible for a person to both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nGiven the modal logic inference formulas, the most direct correspondence to this inference is:\n\n- #(!p + q) \u2192 $!(!p + q)\n\nThis can be paraphrased as: If it is necessary that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth, then it is possible that a person does not both pull their own hair and leave the earth.\n\nTo find the exact formula that corresponds to this reasoning, we can look at the given formulas and identify which one aligns with the structure of our inference. The inference from #(!p + q) to $!(!p + q) involves necessity implying possibility, but in a slightly indirect manner since it involves the negation of a conjunction. The direct implication from necessity to possibility is given by formula (9):\n\n(9) #p \u2192 $p\n\nHowever, our inference involves the negation of a conjunction, !(p + q), so we need to adjust our interpretation. The inference from #!(p + q) to $!(!p + q) is essentially an application of the principle that necessity implies possibility (formula 9) in a context involving the negation of a proposition. Thus, we can infer $!(!p + q) from #!(!p + q) directly by applying the principle that necessity implies possibility to the negated conjunction, even though it's not explicitly listed in the provided formulas in the exact form we're using.\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the provided formulas and find the closest match that aligns with the essence of the inference without directly involving the conjunction, we look for a formula that reflects a necessary proposition implying a possible proposition. Formula (9) is the closest match, but it's not directly applicable to our compound proposition. Instead, we must infer that since #!(!p + q) implies a form of impossibility, its de Morgan's law equivalent, #(p + q), would imply a form of necessity that must also hold. Given #(p + q), we can infer $!(!p + q) using formula (9) indirectly, understanding that we're applying the necessity-to-possibility implication to the negation of the original compound proposition after a logical transformation.\n\nTherefore, the closest formula in spirit, while not a perfect match due to the complexity of the compound propositions involved, is:\n\n[[9]] #p \u2192 $p\n\nThis formula underscores the principle that necessity implies possibility, and when applied in a context where we're discussing the negation of a compound proposition, it supports the inference made. However, the direct formula for the inference from #!(!p + q) to $!(!p + q) is not explicitly listed, and the application involves a logical transformation step based on de Morgan's laws before applying the necessity-to-possibility implication, which is the essence captured by formula (9). Given the constraints and the request for a specific formula number, [[9]] is the most relevant, while noting that the actual inference involves an additional conceptual step."}

But, given the duality of necessity and possibility and the relationships defined, we can infer this relationship from:\n\n(1 ) #p \u2190\u2192 !$!p\n\nSubstituting #p with !#!p in (1), we see that !#!p is equivalent to !!$!p, which simplifies to $p due to the double negation. This is essentially the same structure as (8), just arrived at through a different transformation.\n\nThus, the correct answer, directly reflecting the given inference step, is:\n\n[[8]]\n\nBut, since the direct step from !#!p to $p is actually derived through the relationship defined in (1), we can also say that the logical reasoning process involves both (1) and (8). However, since the question asks for the formula that corresponds to the inference step from !#!p to $p, and given the provided list of formulas, the most directly applicable formula is:\n\n[[8]]\n\nThis interpretation is correct under the assumption that the listed formulas are intended to be used directly or in combination to derive the necessary inferences. The inference from !#!p to $p is a direct application of the duality principle expressed in (1) and is formally captured by the structure of (8), even though the exact step is an intermediate inference based on the dual nature of necessity and possibility."}

The statement \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" can be symbolized as \u00a7p, where \u00a7 represents permission and p represents the act of widows remarrying. The statement \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" can be understood as the absence of prohibition, which according to the given normative reasoning formulas, is equivalent to \u00ac\u203dp.\n\nGiven the logical equivalences:\n- \u00a7p \u2190\u2192 \u00ac\u203dp (formula 3)\n\nThe statement \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" implies \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" by formula 3, and conversely, \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" implies \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" also by formula 3.\n\nTherefore, the given statement corresponds to [[1]] normative reasoning formula.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for the total count of normative reasoning formulas that apply to the situation described, which includes both directions of implication. Since the same formula applies in both directions, the total count would still be [[1]]. If the intention was to count each direction of implication separately, the answer would be [[2]], but based on the given logical structure and typical logical reasoning, counting the same formula twice for its bidirectional nature would not be standard practice, so the most accurate answer is still [[1]]."}

However, since we are asked to relate it based on the provided logic and forced to fit it within the given framework, we might interpret this as an action that could occur in the future, tentatively represented as `Fp` (future point in time, positive statement about contract execution), assuming the sentence is implying a future permission or intention.\n\nGiven the (somewhat forced) interpretations of `H\u00acp` (Aunt Wang never won awards in the past) and `Fp` (allowing contract execution in the future), these do not directly fit any of the defined relationship pairs (Ap and Hp, A\u00acp and H\u00acp; Gp and Fp, G\u00acp and F\u00acp) for the `\u2042 Relationship`. However, since the question compels us to classify it within the given relationships, and there's no direct temporal relationship between the past and the future in this manner in the provided logic, the closest relationship that can be inferred, given the constraints, would be the independence of these statements from each other in the context of the defined relationships. They are effectively unrelated in the temporal logic frame provided. Since the `\u21a6 Relationship` allows for two statements to both be false (which these could be, given their separate timelines and subjects), this might be the least incorrect categorization, even if it's a stretch due to the unrelated nature of the statements.\n\nThus, for the second pair, the relationship is somewhat of a misfit, but if classified under the given schema, it could tentatively be considered a `B. \u21a6 Relationship` based on the lack of direct temporal connection and the ability for both statements to simultaneously be true or false in their respective contexts, despite the logic not strictly applying due to the unrelated contents of the statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n`[[C];[B]]`\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the second classification is a significant stretch due to the unrelated nature of the statements to the defined temporal logic framework. A more accurate interpretation might be that the second pair does not fit any of the provided relationships under the strict application of the defined logic.

This formula indeed captures the essence of the inference from a negated past period of time to a negated past point in time.\n\nConversely, the inference from \"Old Zhao did not work in Ningbo at some point in the past\" (\\( \\neg Hp \\)) to \"It is not the case that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past\" (\\( \\neg Ap \\)) can be made using formula 4, \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\), in conjunction with formula 7, \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\). This is because \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) leads to \\( H\u00acp \\), and then \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\) leads to \\( \\neg Ap \\).\n\nTherefore, there are two reasoning formulas directly involved in this inference process: formula 4 and formula 11.\n\nThe answer, in the requested format, is:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nHowever, if we count the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) (formula 7) as necessary for the second inference, then we would have three formulas involved:\n```\n[[3]]\n```\n\nGiven the specific phrasing of the question and the directness of the inference paths, the most appropriate answer, considering the direct formulas for the given question's phrasing, would be:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nThis interpretation emphasizes the direct inference between negated propositions without relying on the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) as an additional formula for the count, since formula 4 directly implies the inference of negated continuous action from a negated point in time, and formula 11 directly implies the reverse."}

The statement essentially translates to \"Gp\" in our symbolic notation, indicating a future period of time where painting is happening. Applying the formula `Gp \u2192 Fp`, we deduce that if it is true that one will always keep on painting (Gp), then it follows that there is a future point in time at which they will be painting (Fp). \n\nNow, let's map the options to our logic:\n\nA. \"I used to stick to painting\" corresponds to \"Ap\" (a past period of time), which is not directly inferred from the given statement or the applied formula.\n\nB. \"I keep on painting\" corresponds to \"Tp\" (a present action), which again is not directly inferred from the formula involving future states.\n\nC. \"I will start painting tomorrow\" corresponds to a specific future point in time (Fp) of starting the activity, but the statement implies a continuous action rather than a specific start point.\n\nD. \"I will keep on painting\" directly corresponds to \"Gp\" or, equivalently, by the formula applied, implies \"Fp\" - a continuous action in the future, which matches the deduction from the given statement and formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct deduction based on the reasoning equation 21 and the given statement is:\n\n[[D]]\n\nThis matches the continuous nature of the activity (painting) in the future as inferred by the logical rule."}

This does not directly apply to Formula 17, as it deals with the relationship between a future period and its complement in the future, rather than two distinct points or periods.\n\n- **\u21a6 Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be true, but can both be false. Formula 17 fits this description. It says that `Gp` and `G\u00acp` cannot both be true (i.e., a proposition and its negation cannot both be true in the future period), which aligns with the \u21a6 relationship's property.\n\n- **\u26ad Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be false, but can both be true. This does not match Formula 17, as it explicitly states that if `Gp` is true, then `G\u00acp` must be false.\n\n- **\u2042 Relationship**: Pairs can both be true, or both be false. This does not align with Formula 17, as it precludes the case where both `Gp` and `G\u00acp` are true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Reasoning Formula 17 (`Gp \u2192 \u00acG\u00acp`) is consistent with the **\u21a6 relationship**.

Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the scenario where both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, we can analyze this situation according to the provided logical framework.\n\nAccording to the definition of common belief and the provided cognitive logic model:\n\n1. If a proposition `p` is a common belief within a group `G`, then every member of the group `G` collectively believes `p`.\n\n2. The scenario explicitly states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that the proposition \"2 plus 2 equals 4\" is a common belief among the group containing Alice and Bob. This means that each of them not only believes the proposition themselves but also recognizes (through the accessibility relation `R`) that the other believes it as well.\n\nApplying the given logic to the provided statements:\n\nA. Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement is consistent with the definition of common belief, as it implies that both Alice and Bob hold the belief and are aware of this belief in the other. Therefore, this statement is correct under the given context, assuming \"know\" is synonymous with \"firmly believe.\"\n\nB. Only Alice firmly believes that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement contradicts the initial conditions, which explicitly state that both Alice and Bob firmly believe the proposition. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Bob doubts that 2 plus 2 equals 4. - This statement contradicts the initial conditions, which state that Bob firmly believes the proposition. According to the Axiom of Consistent Belief, Bob cannot simultaneously believe and doubt the same proposition. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answers are:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThus, the correct interpretation, given the logical framework and the initial conditions, is that Alice and Bob both know (or firmly believe) that 2 plus 2 equals 4, and this belief is a common one between them."}

Proposition `p` is the consensus (common belief) within the group `G`. This can be represented as `G_p`.\n2. Alice doubts the proposition `p`, which is represented as `H_Alice_p`.\n\nGiven the axiom of doubt, \"Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`,\" we can infer that since Alice doubts `p`, she does not believe `p`:\n\n`H_Alice_p \u2192 \u00acB_Alice_p`\n\nHowever, we know that for `p` to be a common belief within the group `G`, every member must believe `p`, including Alice (assuming Alice is a member of `G`).

This means that Alice is certain that the loop will continue to execute either until `\u03c6` is true or it executes indefinitely, but it guarantees that `\u03c6` will be true if the loop ever stops.

The provided Loop Rule is expressed in a format that does not directly fit into the `[[]]` format requested. Nonetheless, we can interpret Alice's belief in a way that fits the requested format by applying the Loop Rule within the necessity operators `[[]]`. Thus, we can interpret her belief as being certain that the loop's execution will lead to a state where `\u03c6` is true or the loop continues to execute. \n\nTherefore, to express Alice's belief within the given constraints and the Loop Rule, we can say:\n\n- Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will persist in execution until the proposition `\u03c6` is true can be represented as: `[[ c* ]\u03c6]`.\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that after the execution of `c*`, `\u03c6` will be true. However, to explicitly capture the persistence aspect as per the Loop Rule, which involves the loop stopping (or not) and `\u03c6` being true, we slightly adapt this to align with the requested format while incorporating the essence of the Loop Rule as follows:\n\n```\n[[ \u03c6 \u2228 ([ c ][ c* ]\u03c6) ]]\n```\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that either `\u03c6` is true, or after one iteration of the loop `c`, it remains the case that the loop `c*` will necessarily lead to `\u03c6` being true, thereby capturing both the persistence of the loop and the ultimate truth of `\u03c6`.\n\nHowever, recognizing the constraint for a simpler and more direct expression within the `[[]]` format, and given the question's focus on the belief in the persistence of the loop until `\u03c6` is true, we can directly express this as:\n\n```\n[[ c* ]\u03c6]\n```\n\nThis simplified form leverages the essence of the Loop Rule within the necessity operator brackets, assuming the contextual understanding that the loop's persistence is implied by the necessity of `\u03c6` following `c*`, consistent with the Loop Rule's spirit but tailored to the `[[]]` format. It captures Alice's belief that the loop's execution will ensure `\u03c6` eventually holds, which is a direct interpretation of her belief in the persistence of `c*` until `\u03c6`'s truth, fitting the `[[]]` format requirement. This interpretation is guided by the question's focus on the outcome of the loop's execution regarding `\u03c6`'s truth, rather than an explicit step-by-step application of the Loop Rule inside the necessity operator, which would otherwise require a format more complex than `[[]]` to fully express."}

The Concurrent Rule states that `\u27e8 c_1 || c_2 \u27e9\u03c6` is equivalent to `\u27e8 c_1 \u27e9\u27e8 c_2 \u27e9\u03c6 \u2228 \u27e8 c_2 \u27e9\u27e8 c_1 \u27e9\u03c6`.\n\n2. However, since neither `c1` nor `c2` affect `\u03c6`, it implies that the possibility of `\u03c6` being true after executing each command independently is not influenced by the commands. Thus, `\u27e8 c1 \u27e9\u03c6` and `\u27e8 c2 \u27e9\u03c6` both simplify to `\u03c6` due to the commands not affecting the proposition's truth value.\n\n3. Substituting `\u03c6` back into the Concurrent Rule formula:\n\n`\u27e8 c_1 || c_2 \u27e9\u03c6` = `\u27e8 c_1 \u27e9\u27e8 c_2 \u27e9\u03c6 \u2228 \u27e8 c_2 \u27e9\u27e8 c_1 \u27e9\u03c6`\n\nSince `\u27e8 c1 \u27e9\u03c6` = `\u03c6` and `\u27e8 c2 \u27e9\u03c6` = `\u03c6`, we get:\n\n`\u27e8 c_1 || c_2 \u27e9\u03c6` = `\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c6` = `\u03c6`\n\nHowever, the requested output format is `[[]]`. To express the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` without affecting `\u03c6` in this format, considering the rule's context and the given condition, we interpret the request as needing to express the necessity aspect of the concurrent execution, acknowledging that the concurrent execution does not change the truth value of `\u03c6` (since neither command affects it), thus not altering the necessity of `\u03c6`. Given this interpretation, we express the necessity of `\u03c6` being unchanged by the concurrent execution as follows:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ]\u03c6 ]`\n\nBut since `\u03c6` is unaffected, this is equivalent to asserting the necessity of `\u03c6` itself, leading to:\n\n`[ \u03c6 ]`\n\nHowever, to strictly adhere to the format `[[]]` and express concurrent execution without implying a direct implication on `\u03c6` (since the question specifies that the commands do not affect `\u03c6`), we can represent the concurrent execution without directly involving `\u03c6` in the inner brackets:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ] ]\u03c6`\n\nThis format captures the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` and then asserts `\u03c6`, reflecting that `\u03c6`'s truth value is independent of this concurrent execution. Given the specifics, this is a contextual interpretation that acknowledges the commands' irrelevance to `\u03c6`'s truth value while adhering to the `[[]]` format.\n\nThus, the final expression reflecting the question's conditions and the requested format is:\n\n`[ [ c1 || c2 ] ]\u03c6`\n\nThis expression, in its simplest form, acknowledges the concurrent execution of `c1` and `c2` and then asserts `\u03c6`, consistent with the given condition that `\u03c6` is unaffected."}

Key Differences\n- * Induction:\n    - Premise: Based on observations of some instances.\n    - Conclusion: Inferred for all instances.\n    - Symbolic Representation: `P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_k) -> forall e in S, P(e)`.\n- \u03a6 Induction:\n    - Premise: Based on observations of all instances.\n    - Conclusion: Determined for all instances.\n    - Symbolic Representation: `P(e_1), P(e_2), ..., P(e_n) -> P(E)`.\n\n### Question:\nPremise: After looking at b1, b2, b3, it turns out that they are all blue, and that these are some of the individuals in the B class.\nConclusion: All instances of the B class are blue.\n\nPlease symbolise the premises and conclusion above.\n\nFollow [[premise symbolisation];[conclusion symbolisation]] to give your answer.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the question and the logical framework provided, we can symbolize the premises and conclusion as follows:\n\nPremise: After looking at b1, b2, b3, it turns out that they are all blue, and that these are some of the individuals in the B class.\n- Symbolically, for * Induction: `P(b1), P(b2), P(b3)`, where `P` denotes the property of being blue, and `b1, b2, b3` are instances of the B class.\n\nConclusion: All instances of the B class are blue.\n- Symbolically, for * Induction: `\u2200e in B, P(e)`, meaning that for all instances `e` in the B class, `e` has the property of being blue.\n\nThus, following the requested format [[premise symbolisation];[conclusion symbolisation]]:\n\n- For * Induction: `[P(b1), P(b2), P(b3)]; [\u2200e in B, P(e)]`\n\nNote: The question specifically mentions \"some of the individuals\" which points to * Induction, where the conclusion is inferred from a limited observation. \u03a6 Induction, on the other hand, would require examining every individual in the class. Since we are not examining every individual here (only b1, b2, b3 out of a potentially larger set), the premise and conclusion are correctly symbolized for * Induction. If, hypothetically, b1, b2, b3 were all the individuals in the B class, then \u03a6 Induction would apply, and the premise would be symbolized as `[P(b1), P(b2), P(b3)]; [P(B)]`.

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The \u2e2e method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The \u0606 method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The \ua66e method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The \u2d63 method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The \u2698 method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the \u0606 method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

Method \u0606:\n- If P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S A B     P\n    - (2) - A B     P\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n3. Method \ua66e:\n- Positive group: S and P occur together, while other conditions A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n    - Positive group\n        - (1) S A B     P\n        - (2) S C D    P\n        - (3) S E F     P\n    - Negative group: S is absent, P is also absent, and other conditions A, C, D, E, F, etc., differ:\n        - Negative group\n            - (1') - A C    -\n            - (2') - D E    -\n            - (3') - B F    -\n    - Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship.\n\n4.

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The description aligns best with the \ua66e method (Method \ua66e). This is because the text presents a positive group where the presence of active family education styles (S) correlates with higher emotional intelligence (P) across varying conditions (A, B, C, D, E, F, etc., representing differences in cultures or other factors). Conversely, the absence of such education styles (absence of S) leads to the absence of high emotional intelligence (absence of P) in various conditions. This fits the pattern described in Method \ua66e, which involves comparing a positive group where the cause and effect co-occur with a negative group where both the cause and effect are absent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[C]]\n\nThis method is chosen because it explicitly compares situations where the cause is present and has the expected effect with situations where the cause is absent and the effect is also absent, across different contexts."}

Since the crow in University B's campus shares the unspecified attributes (a, b, c) of the crows in University A's campus (making them #\u03a8 attributes), we infer that it likely shares the attribute d as well (the feathers being black).\n\nTherefore, in the context of this analogy:\n\n- The attribute \"feathers being black\" (d) is considered the +\u03a8 attribute because it is the inferred characteristic based on the shared #\u03a8 attributes.\n\nHence, the correct answer in the specified format is:\n\n[[B]]"}

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) \u2248 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation.

This aligns with the C! Principle, specifically the Speaker's Criterion which states that one should not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. The Hearer's Inference for C! Principle suggests that if such marked expressions are used, they imply a different meaning or intention than what could have been conveyed with an unmarked expression.

Thus, the scenario best fits the C! Principle.\n\nThe C* Principle and C% Principle do not directly apply here. The C* Principle concerns the ordering of statements by information strength and the inferences made based on the speaker's choice of a weaker statement (not applicable in this direct question-answer scenario).

Specifically, the Hearer's Inference (CQ1) applies here. The statement \"Some soccer players are on the field\" (B) is weaker than \"All soccer players are on the field\" (A), and A entails B (since if all players are on the field, it is necessarily true that some players are on the field). By choosing to use the weaker statement without asserting the stronger one, the speaker signals to the hearer that they do not have enough information to assert the stronger statement, or that the stronger statement is not true (K~(A(s)) in the rule's notation).\n\nThe C% Principle's Speaker's Criterion states that one should speak as little as possible, but the context here involves choosing between statements of different strengths to convey the level of certainty or knowledge about the situation, which is more aligned with the C* Principle.\n\nThe C! Principle is not applicable in this scenario, as it concerns avoiding lengthy or marked expressions when simpler ones suffice, which is not the case here since the difference between \"all\" and \"some\" is not about the length or complexity of the expression but about the information strength."}

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm \u2192 Beer is part of the food in the food box\" is most closely aligned with the C% Principle.\n\n1. **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalization and the speaker speaking as little as possible. The inference here is that when Xiao Ma mentions the beer being warm upon opening the food box, it suggests that the beer is an unexpected item that stands out because it's not in its expected state (usually cold). Given the context of opening a food box, the minimal information provided implies that the beer is part of the contents of the food box, as it is the simplest and most direct explanation for this observation. This adheres to CI2 of the C% Principle, where the hearer expands the information to grasp the intention of the speech, assuming that the mentioned \"beer is still warm\" is an unusual fact that stands out and is meant to be understood as part of the described situation without further embellishment.\n\n2. The statement does not seem to invoke the **C* Principle**, as it's not about the speaker avoiding making a stronger statement due to lack of knowledge or intentionally not providing more precise information. The focus is not on the contrast between possible stronger and weaker statements or inferences about the speaker's knowledge limitations.\n\n3. Regarding the **C! Principle**, the statement does not utilize a lengthy, obscure, or marked expression that could suggest a deviation from conventional meanings or the need to avoid conventional associations. The phrasing is straightforward, and the inference does not require avoiding or reinterpreting conventional meanings in a significant way as per the C! Principle.\n\nThus, based on the principles and the statement provided, the most fitting principle is the C% Principle."}

Similarly, C also adheres to this principle by providing more details yet still not giving a direct yes or no answer, focusing instead on the current state of the project rather than the projected timeline.\n\n- **C. C! Principle**: C's response uses a more marked expression, \"essentially wrapped up the project,\" which deviates from a simple confirmation of the project's completion.

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given statement and its inference can be analyzed according to the custom cooperation principles as follows:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle involves the speaker saying something that is not as informative as it could be, leading to specific inferences by the hearer. However, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" is straightforward and informative. The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is a direct, uncontroversial deduction from the statement rather than a result of the speaker being less informative than they could be.\n\n- **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalism in speech, and the inference is supposed to be based on expanding the minimal information provided by the speaker. The statement about the car door not closing implicitly assumes the car has doors (as per the convention or common knowledge), and the inference directly links to this assumption without requiring additional information.\n\n- **C! Principle**: This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions unless they serve a specific purpose. The given statement is straightforward and does not invoke any unnecessary complexity or marked expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" conforms most closely to the C% Principle, as it involves interpreting the minimal information provided in a straightforward manner, expanding on the given information in a way that aligns with common sense or conventions about cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```"}

This inference process aligns with the C* Principle, specifically the Hearer's Inference (CQ2), where the statement \"gives flowers to a nurse\" does not directly entail the content \"a female\" but is understood to imply it due to the stronger information (the common knowledge that nurses are often female) that the speaker has not explicitly stated, suggesting the speaker does not know if it can be established based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThis is because the inference pattern matches the C* Principle's guidelines for deducing meaning beyond the explicit content based on understood knowledge or common sense associations."}

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job.

Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose a company manager (let's call him Manager M) announces a new policy: \"All employees (E) will receive a bonus (B) after completing a project (P).\" However, an employee (let's call him Employee A) misunderstands this statement, thinking that \"only when an employee receives a bonus (B) have they completed a project (P).\"\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

LetClauseShift Method\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H/I/J]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The original statement can be formalized as \u2200x (Ex \u2227 Px \u2192 Bx), meaning \"for all x, if x is an employee and x completes a project, then x receives a bonus.\"\n\nEmployee A misunderstands this to mean \u2200x (Ex \u2227 Bx \u2192 Px), which incorrectly implies \"for all x, if x is an employee and x receives a bonus, then x must have completed a project.\" This is a classic case of the CondSwap Method fallacy, where the direction of implication is incorrectly reversed.\n\nTherefore, the type of formal fallacy committed by Employee A is:\n\n[[C]]\n\nThe answer is **C. CondSwap Method**."}
