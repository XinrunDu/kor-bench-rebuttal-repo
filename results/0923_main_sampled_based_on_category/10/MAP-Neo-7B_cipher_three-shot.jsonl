In the bustling city of Cyphersville, there was an unusual high school known as The Academy of Clue Codes. This wasn't your ordinary institution; it specialized in education that combined various aspects of cryptography and encryption techniques. Amongst its students were two friends - Sienna, a curious 12-year-old who loved cracking codes, and her older brother Max, a college sophomore studying computer science.\n\nOne sunny afternoon after school, they found themselves engrossed in yet another question posed by their favorite online quiz platform called \"Crypto Challenges.\" It read:\n\n\" --> Plaintext: C --> Please provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]]. \n\n///Input: \n   - Plaintext: C\n\n-> Ciphertext: F\n--> Decryption Rules:\n   Input:\n       - PLAINTEXT: Ciphertext, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n       - KEY: Decryption key, uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces. \n       - n: Number of positions to shift. \n   Output:\n       - PLAINTEXT: Plaintext, lowercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n   - ALPHABET: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n   - KEY ALPHABET: \"KEY\", lowercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n   - REVERSED ALPHABET: \"Reversed alphabets...\"\n   - SUBSTITUTION ALPHABET: \"Substitutive alphabet…\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n   - For each letter c in Ciphertext...\"\n\nSienna looked up from her screen, eyes sparkling with determination. \"Let's do this!\" she exclaimed. She grabbed a pen and started jotting down notes about the rules provided. Max, always eager to help out his little sister, decided to assist too.\n\nMax explained, \"We need to understand these steps thoroughly. First, let's reverse the key alphabet since we are either shifting or replacing letters here based on our key.\" They found 'key' repeated several times within the problem statement and noted it down carefully.\n\nNext, they tackled the initial step involving the uppercase plaintext 'C'. Using the defined precision, they transformed it into 'F':\n\nStep 1: Reverse the key alphabet (\"KEY ALPHABET\"). Since 'KEY' is already uppercase, it remains unchanged.\nStep 2: Find position of 'C' in the standard alphabet (\"AZYX...\").\nStep 3: Replace it with the element located at that index in the opposite alphabet (\"FWZ..\"). Here, 'C' gets replaced with 'F'.\nStep 4: Move letter 'F' four places forward in the standard alphabet. After positioning, 'F' becomes 'M', but remember, we aren't dealing with letters just yet. We apply the same logic till Step 7 below.\nStep 7: Translate the letter 'M' back to its original location in the standard alphabet after undistributing the effect caused during Steps 2-6. Lo and behold, it returns to 'M'.\nStep 8: Apply the final transformation i.e., replace every occurrence of the reverse-alphabet-key components with the correspon\"ding elements in the substitution alphabet.\n\nAfter hours of mulling over every minute detail, they managed to decrypt the given encrypted message successfully! Their faces glowed when Max shouted, \"🎉We did it! Here's the decrypted message: ['F']!\"\n\nOn their way home, they noticed some kids struggling to solve similar problems while haphazardly interpreting the instructions. Witnessing this, Sienna turned towards Max and suggested, \"Hey Max, maybe we could create a table summarizing these rules using colored pens so kids can easily grasp them?\"\n\nMax agreed instantly. Together, they crafted a comprehensive guide filled with vibrant hues highlighting each rule meticulously. Within a week, requests poured in asking for this simplified version of the rules. Realizing its potential impact, they decided to distribute free copies throughout the community centers and schools promoting digital literacy among children.\n\nThis experience taught everyone valuable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, clear communication, and responsibility. Above all else, they learned how seemingly complex challenges could yield beautiful solutions if broken down systematically and solved creatively.

Additionally, discuss possible methods to determine the validity of metamorphic relations from data characteristics in data quality assessment for IQA assurance purposes.\n1. Significance of Hash Function for Data Protection:\nPerforming hash functions on user and employee records plays a vital role in data protection from several angles:\n\na. Privacy Protection: Hash functions provide an additional layer of security by converting user data into a fixed-size string of characters. If the data is modified, the hash value changes significantly, making it impossible to recreate the original data without changing the hash value again. This can help detect unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.\n\nb. Checksum Verification: Hash values can serve as a checksum to ensure data integrity. It helps in validating if the data written to the storage has changed unnoticed or got corrupted. In this case, hash functions play a significant role in reducing the risk of unauthorized data manipulation due to unnoticed errors.\n\nc. Access Control: Hash functions can be used for access control purposes. For instance, in systems where logins are needed, the system can compute a hash value from the password the user is about to provide. The system can initially compare this hash value with the stored hash value of the corresponding password. Since the original password cannot be determined solely by the hash value, this approach helps prevent \"credential stuffing\" attacks.\n\nd. Logging and Auditing: In the absence of hash functions or an effective system for validating its data, the time and effort required for auditing data would be phenomenal. Hash function calculations would add little computational overhead but greatly aid the log data's integrity, helping track and document user actions and activities.\n\n2. Determining Validity of Metamorphic Relations:\nIn data quality assessment, metamorphic relations are used to check the validity of data-related assumptions. They involve comparing data instances against each other under specified conditions. In IQA assurance purposes, there are a couple of methods to determine the validity of metamorphic relations:\n\na. Property-Based Validation: This method entails validating the metamorphic relations based on properties defined by experts. They can be characteristics like numerical range, number of replicates, clustering, distribution, etc.\n\nb. Statistically-Based Validation: This validation method relies heavily on statistical analysis. Statistical tests including Chi-Square, ANOVA, independence tests, etc., can be used to analyze differences between instances under the specified conditions.\n\nc. Data-Aware Methods: These methods incorporate advanced machine learning techniques for evaluating data quality by learning from a given dataset. When new data arrives or there’s an adjustment in system standards, these methods can be re-calibrated and used to reassess data quality.\n\nIn the context of IQA assurance, the nature of the applications, the IQA process and the overall goal define which approach to IQA should be used. Expert experience, machine learning, and test case design need meticulous integration with business analysis processes to not only validate its data but also ensure it's relevant and aligned with the business.\n\nIQA is ever-changing and continuously sieve through various complexities and variations. Metamorphic reasoning is a great tool to detect errors and improvements for IQA. Interpretation and correlation of the attributes and measurements are vital components for metamorphic relations to flag underlying issues in data that might be overseen. stones's son has constructed a pyramid consisting of n layers, with the 1st, 2nd, ...,\nn-th layer having $hℓ$- stones heaps, where automatically, $1≦hℓ≦hℓ+1≤⋯$ and for each ℓ ($1≦ℓ≦n$), $\\sum_{i=1}^{i=hℓ}hℓ=l+i-1$ ( $i=1,2,…,hℓ$ ).

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[N]]\nThe encryption and decryption methods you used are similar to a specific kind of cipher known as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. A polyalphabetic substitution cipher encodes each letter of the plaintext using the logarithmic multisubstitution function you provided.\n\nGiven these rules and the specification of the multitap code table, it means that each letter in the plaintext alphabet must be mapped to a specific sequence of numbers. The position of the digit in the sequence is determined by its position in the alphabet.\n\nThe encrypting a letter is simple - just find its place in the sequence and replace it. For example, in the key 'O', 'A' is the first place, 'B' is the second, 'C' is the third, etc. So, the letter 'A' is replaced by '2' in the encryption operation.\n\nSince the ciphertext should not contain punctuation (like '-'), use your own mathematical operation to find an example of the first character that doesn't contain punctuation.\n\nThe decryption is the inverse of the encryption, just like in a one-time pad implementation, it's an operation that restores whichever plain text you encrypted previously.\n\ninitial key-sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\nnew key-sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nPreserving 'Q': K -> T, R -> M, U -> J on a one-time-pad\n\nmulti-tape code table (rot13 equivalent):\n\nA = 2\nB = 3\nC = 4\nD = 5\nE = 6\nF = 7\nG = 8\nH = 9\nI = 1\nJ = 2\nK = 3\nL = 4\nM = 5\nN = 6\n\n## Javascript Implementation\n\nThe advantage to this program is that you have a key in which you can swap letters around. With a mathematical calculation of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, the end result should look the same.\n\n```javascript\nvar rules = {\n      encryption: {\n          prefix: \"plainText\",\n          rules: [\n                  ['K', 'T'], ['R', 'M'], ['U', 'J']\n                  ],\n          succ: { key: rules['encryption']['rules'][0] },\n          status: ['plainText'][0]\n          },\n      decryption: {\n          prefix: \"cipherText\",\n          rules: [\n                  ['T', 'K'], ['M', 'R'], ['J', 'U']\n                  ],\n          succ: { key: rules['decryption']['rules'][0] }\n          },\n      rest: {\n          key: rules.rest.key,\n          succ: { midChar: rules.rest.key[0], increment: rules.rest.key[1] }\n          },\n      plainText: {\n          status: \"cipherText\",\n          mtps: [\"Q\", \"N\", \"-\"]\n          },\n      cipherText: {\n          status: \"plainText\",\n          mtps: [\"7\", \"O\", \"-\"]\n          }\n    };\n\nvar rulesStrings = [\n    //Translation Table for Multi-Tape Cipher\n    [ \n        \"encode\", \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\", \n        \"A\", \"2^1\", \n        \"B\", \"2^2\", \n        \"C\", \"2^3\", \n        \"D\", \"3^1\", \n        \"E\", \"3^2\", \n        \"F\", \"3^3\", \n        \"G\", \"4^1\", \n        \"H\", \"4^2\", \n        \"I\", \"4^3\", \n        \"J\", \"5^1\", \n        \"K\", \"5^2\", \n        \"L\", \"5^3\", \n        \"M\", \"6^1\", \n        \"N\", \"6^2\", \n        \"O\", \"6^3\", \n        \"P\", \"7^1\", \n        \"Q\", \"7^2\", \n        \"R\", \"7^3\", \n        \"S\", \"7^4\", \n        \"T\", \"8^1\", \n        \"U\", \"8^2\", \n        \"V\", \"8^3\", \n        \"W\", \"9^1\", \n        \"X\", \"9^2\", \n        \"Y\", \"9^3\", \n        \"Z\", \"9^4\" \n    ],\n    //Everything Else to satisfy the rules...\n```جعبة: [[]]\n\nمتطلب:\nواجب: \"[[]]\"\n\n\nوُجْب:\n[[1,2,3]]\n\nوُجْب:\n[[4,5,6]]\n\nوُجْب:\n[[7,8,9]]\n\nTokenizer: https://github.com/JustTheCode/tokenizer\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\">\n  <title>Simple End-to-End service example - Node.js</title>\n  \n  <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"../images/favicon.png\"  />\n  \n  <script async defer src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=_YOUR_MAP_API&callbacks=onLoad\"></script>\n  \n  \n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../stylesheets/style1.css\">\n  \n</head>\n<body>\n  <!--Section 1 : Header and Navbar -->\n  <section id=\"main\">\n\n    <nav id=\"header\">\n "}

In a real-life encryption scenario, words are typically converted to a particular form by substituting they letter combinations with other groups of letters according to a pre-defined formula. This is realistically applied in puzzle-solving games or challenges, where people are required to identify the rules and format of such type of encryption/decryption to identify the actual plaintext or ciphertext and generate the right output.\n\nThis Cipher task asks the assistant to apply the converting procedure of an individual word into a ciphertext string. By themselves, operations like this are relatively common in encryption, where information is hidden under a puzzle to protect it from unintended readers. The manipulation of such a puzzle is often used in a complex way in advanced algorithms, and can help keep information secure and hidden.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[GXZLZSKPJJ]]\n\n### Explanation of the Cipher:\n\nThe Cipher uses a Multitap Code Table in order to convert the given plaintext (no punctuation or spaces) to a ciphertext (also no punctuation). The Unicode code points for these two symbols are determined by the input upper case letters. This is useful because by virtue of using a standard table filled with code points it's easier to pick a ciphertext based on the plaintext.\n\nThe upper case letter on which the system is built actually is not a secret but rather the keyword so the cipher solution must contain the keyword.\n\nThe process works as follows: take each plaintext character (which may include punctuation but not spaces), get the principal Unicode for it, find the Multitap Code at that level, convert that to a Multi Tap Code, add that to the input List of Multi Tap Codes (multitape table) and maintain a running total for each character to ensure no repetition. As an example, one might have the running totals in the variable common multitap types which would come into play if for example the data had \"0 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5\".\n \n\nMultiTap Code of an character equals that character's Unicode in hex. \n\nMultitap Codes for each additional character are determined by the prior MultiTap code. If the MultiTap Code is incremented to a new MTC, the entry in common multitap types needs to be incremented by the previous MTC to be the new MTC.\n\nWrite an encryption program which takes an input ascii string, capital letters (punctuation, white space and itself are not included), and encodes it into a lower case string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"Hi\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[ok]]\n\nEncipher a phrase saying 'hello world' The output below is in caps\n\nAs you can see already, somewhat cryptical already, but I'm about to do it in a superior manner. (Please skip further if this is not of interest)\n\n`K`\n\n`-0123456789]qwertyuiop[]asdfghjkl{}zxcvbnm+-[]`\n\nType characters to input.\n\nSplit on comma or space. If the character is not present, it will increment to the next character in the list and cast the byte. For example:\n\n`FJ`\n\nOutput Character: `r`\n\nBecause `A=0=65, B=1=66, C=2=67, etc...`\n\nA byte cast function exists.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[E]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThis is a relatively straightforward cipher. The letters have predetermined positions in an alphabet that spans from J to Z, horizontally organized in a sequence that defines the order when performing keystream generation.\n\nEach column is labeled by the corresponding lowercase English alphabet position. Keep in mind that the reserved space in the array signifying Z should only be accessed if a joker is present in the stack.\n\nA path should be assumed from North arrow to South arrow to represent this 26-letter alphabet: North = A, North West = B, West = C, South West = D, South = E, etc. For Z, it should only be preserved in case a joker exists in the sequence. Thus, J should be wrapped around to become the bottom card on the deck, making any card above J in such a case is referred to as a \"joker.\"\n\nFor demonstration purposes, we assume certain letters and numerals are jokers (denoted by a temporary asterisk sign).\n\nTo recall, the jokers are positioned apart from the plaintext. The puzzle will be made easier if we first assume that one of these jokers is present in somewhere in the original sequence. We simply consider this joker to be a plain card of the same numerical value, making its location more in line with the other plaincards.\n\nJ | It can be located anywhere in the deck but with one caveat; it can only occupy the last spot in the deck. This is due to the fact that no plaincards can ever yield a joker. Any card occupying the first spot in the deck will always be a joker. While the funniest tricks continue whenever you switch to the next deck, the truth may still seem cryptic.\n\nObserve that K has effectively become the last digit, all the numericals descend one spot downwards.\n\nA worth-noting note is that generally, there could be multiple optional solutions in this puzzle. Depending on who might have decided to swap the positions of two jokers, a path leading from A to Z could result in different card stacks.\n\nMost importantly, for any stack considered to be correct, it is imperative that it does not contain any appearance of a crypto suit and has no change in key value during encryption (or vice versa).ؤنا_آلا عائلة كانت تستمتع برحض الربوءة فلغن ليستماع الاءيساء الراؤس _ أنا_\n\nكل بوابة الحياة! wisam@soraya.com\nباسموك_ آمل @ \"إبراهيم\" 4/01/2023 12:15:34\n\nعلي_ن فولو العمل ين اساعدك عجيبا\nيطيen_ن\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://simple-tutor.netlify.com/img/share/logo/share_tutor.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">\n\nبيم  .山庄 تاكن تنينك للكتاب للوعرب\n\nPlease CC by 404 images. hsmin.me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n مولف علي السبسيه\n\nباسمك_ تهرلى الكتاب  Kenta  Abo@dumo.info\nباسمك_ استله كويا لكتاب المعاصر ب اللغات10 نوع الرسائل\nباسمك_تمس كويا للكتاب الي  حسن الحليدي\nباسمك_لفن الهافش كويا للكتاب الرسمي\n\nباسمك_ عيانة نعي الحافش التهاري مدير اوراء تاعب عبد اللطيف\n\nالطود للتكوين بالبالغة منين ساحور به وبراهام بقام بالعيل السدد الزوارة وبروو هو بلد كبير ليس كبير والصولح مقبطي لمعاهة_ Maratย ALI\nمادوۇنى بإمارة-MURREE \nجين تش جيمس Al_ DRIVER إذا سماح الترب Turkey\nطبرى لير شيك\nAlina عنا لير الـ ابنا من بایدلى ا\nعى كدىل بيل Egypt ilam عشق\nerr ar http://loan.shop/en/∂_ ф\nvlease_ل وker_确定了\nistan Kurdish lam iranna عبد الالوار ب\nhamsh شيك oroabi \nMZ––ZJ+/△s+eb\nsakarauserInfo com/ \nواللغة العربية تأنين يمر بالفاتورة بالکتارى(طين~~)or کتائبة إذا دا Maker\nمعا نجر ب الدبوى\nب بام ساكر vize bami\nabio_中国特色社会主义؟nzzis?orتBOI值21\nubl اعرش قذاف ه\nه زx11v پ ميش بان KIRGIZE لظافت\n\n© 2003-princesinromance.com [all rights reserved]\n[grannreader.tk] www\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta name=\"GENERATOR\" content=\"Microsoft FrontPage 4.0\">\n\n<title>vmpm محيى الجامع باللغة العربيه ان أيش بدو طتق نوو تار فيېيللا ]== بدوت هام جامع فوكلمات\n\n\n\n</title><!--[if gte vml 9]><xml>\n<w:WordDocument>\n<w:body>\n<![endif]-->\n\n\n\n<body bgcolor=C3D7FF link=A8B8D4 vlink=8080FF> 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 align=center><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=+2>أكشن UMErz dz</font></h2>\n\n<address align=center><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=+2>www.wm meeting.com</font></address>\n\n\n<p><meta name=\"DESCRIPTION\" content=\"Ayşe_بدو عنا TURKEY\n 270\n 2406ار س ا ن\n 10 يه\n#5Occ 1a\n على walls 与 财产权\n #MediaLibertésPress{{hAxis=>Weather ntries\n         They'remeg\">#\nArٞ ال © n Muslim\n إش معك م  2278\n U2Ba لشى\n خ()\n دو\n أن\n كЬ ش\n مهض\n  227 ا مڵ rجتشية و 74 عربية محائى c.|\n ا9 دار بنذك نز الشرك الذيت جسم 401 \n 特 rriм اهم انا\n مd)\n ش/ انځ  ^12 £\n تو المكتب ال\n هي P2zokoaeae ≤ i F73\n$ 五週 س س e21按 .حياتزى85 ا \u0003106±lee+\n  10 6.%Ldknee ار دى \b]e25.z 网 \n 1^- www.ssa.ae عددية ز 45م °1}\n www.whitesugarlabsant.org\n 我家dvwgVvDv\n  ك%^v^v/2救助>4ها "}

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Before revealing the answer, let's work through it together. Here is the Feistel network you've described:\n\n- The Feistel cipher operates on a plaintext block of size n by performing transformations on a smaller input block and a secret key block of the same size.\n- Before encryption, two randomly shuffled 52-card decks are placed face down. One deck consists of 54 cards. The other deck consists of 52 suited cards and two jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker.\n- The keystream algorithm simply shifts cards up, down, and left and removes and adds the A Joker card.\n- The fixed keystream constants are important as they determine the balance or symmetry of the key, influencing security.\n\n### Question:\nUnderstanding the Feistel cipher, the Feistel network, and how a Keystream algorithm can generate the required keystream values. \n\n### Answer:\nThe Feistel Network refers to a classical type of symmetric-key encryption algorithm in block cipher (or also known as Feistel ciphers) structure. It is designed to use block cipher algorithms and has two basic structures. \n\nThe Feistel Network Invertible Structure involves:\n- Two sub-keys K1 and K2\n- Two round subtractors S1 and S2\n- Two round equivalent values V1 and V2\n- Two round sub-keys K1‘ and K2‘\n- The output is the new round sub-keys and the input is the Inverse action of V2, V1.\n\nThe Feistel Network Non-Invertible Structure involves:\n- Two sub-keys K1 and K2\n- Two round subtractors S1 and S2\n- Two round equivalent values V1 and V2\n- Two round sub-keys K1 and K2\n- The output contains the new round sub-keys as well as the new equivalent values V1 and V2.\n\n### Key Determines the Balance trade off Security\nThe key within the keystream algorithm not only controls the type of keystream generation or the permutation sequence but also the balance between the symmetric chain and the asymmetric chain within the Feistel cipher. Where the symmetric chain adjusts the left and output directions of the current Feistel cell, and the asymmetric chain adjusts the right and input directions. \n\nLarger key lengths ensure long-term security as the algorithm operates similarly to the Feistel Circuitized Keystream, where the usable and encrypted output blocks depend on the key, which is very important when key padding is being implemented.\n\n\n- Keystream Generation: The key stream element determines the evolution of round keys.\n- Round Keys: The round keys generated from the key stream element are used to yield an output of the Feistel cell. Thus, the key stream element influences the operation of repeated rounds.\n- Rotate Functions: The rotate functions are used to slot the inputs and outputs into the Feistel cell. For instance, a double rotation function can partition the Feistel cell function and various sub-round rotation functions.\n\n### Question and Answer Extension for Punctuation and Spaces\nTo address punctuation and spaces in the output, the Ciphertext must be modified by adding full stops and spaces before outputting. Let's expand on this with an example.\nSay the ciphertext is written as \"KDV\\_\\_\\_\\_GA.\" An additional \"spacer\" is introduced to fill the space. This results in \"KDV_BACABEGBKDEVKJN._\" After applying the \"punctuation\" converter (one for full stops and one for spaces), it becomes \"A_C B A C H A-K D N _E E G B . . K D J E V K.\" As seen in these cases, without full stops and spaces, it can be difficult to clearly decipher the plaintext.\n\n### Question: Including additional punctuation\nFuture decisions and additional requests should be organized in such a way to include the punctuation.\n\n### Answer: The keystream has an inverse function due to the nature of Feistel centers. The bi-directional flow of the plaintext moves back to the first cell to generate the second output cell. This operation is replicated for the rest of the rounds. It is important to note that the result from this inverse function depends on the key and the condition of the last cell. The bi-directional flow spins from the output partition of the last cell to the input partition of this next cell, carrying extra security from the formation of a new key stream. The subsequent full-cycle is the formulation of the new output cell, which gets transformed into a lattice state entry to the next phase.\n\nAnother certain aspect of bi-directional flow is that the new state does not depend on the round key. This essentially implies that the inverse Keystream Extraction operation also has the inverse round key. This is one of the main problems with bi-directional flow. Namely, modifications made to the output cell impose a more profound impact on the old input cells and are more complex to handle in larger-scale coding functions. Whereas in a bi-directional flow, alterations made to the output cell do not substantially affect the state of the input cells.\n\n### Question: What is the benefit of the inverse flow?\nThe centers are essential to the Feistel construction,which is comprised of two identical sub-devices. One sub-device does one round, and the second sub-device repeats the circuit. The inverse flow virtually doubles the security of bi-directional flow, benefiting padding methods and reducing some security defects inherent to one-way flows. This solution negates the potential for an attacker to break the original cipher should they find the key.\n\n### Question: Could you expand on the combination of the fields?\nWhen characters are selected for a character, a field is moved directly after it to the place previously before and directly after it. It gets repeated to the (R) position as shown in the figure. As a result, in circuit 2 of Rom to Alphabet f(x), x=A.\n\nThe Rhombic structure in Riffers flow consists of four constituent members:\n- Lattice {P _ K( l, R )}. \nWhere P = (x, y) and K(l, R) denotes the inverse of R.\n\nThe shift and rotate movement of the lattice is described by the equal-weight bias, which is discussed below:\n\n- For parametric line rotation:\n    - e=x/4\n    - With R=32, rotate line from parameter={8e}\n    - Move both lines (P1, R) and (P2, R) in 4 directions from position 0 and then in 8 directions from position 4. \n    - Combine the permuted outputs and return it to the valuation area.\n\n- For Two bone structure:\n    - Use the lattice to construct the Chi-bin swaps:\n        - Given a good value y=Solution(p0)=p1,\n        - Vector p0 = vector: Matrix by 2 sizes, where p0(1)->p0(0)=(t,f).\n        - Peak vector P1: \n            - P1(1)= t,P1(2)=f,P1(k)=0 otherwise.\n        - Vector p0 is rotated once for P1 at position 0.\n        - We rotate the vector p0= (t,f,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,..,0,0) along [x] by 105\n        to produce p0= (f,t,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). we again rotate it again.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list. Form the final decrypted message.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

There is no standard size for the keyword in Vigenere cipher. However, in this code I've used a 5x5 grid for the keyword. The letter's position in the grid is prime to the length of the keyword. An offset of \"OJHUSWAISEEPY\" got the character position to be prime among the others.ถ Honourable Mr./(Mrs.)/(Ms.)_________ _____________________________\n2012 / 12 / December\n| MESSAGE  |\n| Purpose:  | ___________   |\n| Details:  |    |\nCOLOR      |    |\n\nDIGITAL SIGNATURE  |    |\n   ____________________________________________ \n                        __________\n PHONE NUMBER:        ____________________________________\n\nSIGNET™️                        __________\nMNEMONIC: _________________________   |\n   ____________\n\n`confirm appreciated.

We will also use `Crypto` for extracting GVC. Here's a Python code solution:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport urllib.parse\nimport stream\nfrom Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes\n\n# Make the HTTP request\nurl = \"https://www.example.com\"\ndata = urllib.parse.urlopen(url).read()\n\n# Divide the body into chunks and read one at a time\nchunked = stream.chunk(data)\n\n# Try to extract the GVC from the data\nfor i in chunked:\n    b = long_to_bytes(i, 'big')\n    if b[0] == 13811835:\n        username = b[0:1]\n        break\n\nif username:\n    print(username)\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to find GVC\")\n```\n\nIn the script above, `urllib.parse.urlopen(url).read()` sends an HTTP request to `localhost:8000` and reads the response. `stream.chunk()` splits the HTTP response into individual chunks. These chunks are then each read individually using `stream` by appending them to our response object. \n\n`Crypto.Util.number.long_to_bytes(i, 'big')` rounds a number down to its smallest magnitude that is representable in classic byte encoding. In this case, we're rounding down the number to it's smallest byte, so we get the hex equivalent byte returned. It's essentially taking a byte and ensuring it's the smallest byte necessary for representation.\n\n`Crypto.Util.number.long_to_bytes(i, 'big')[0]` shaves of the first byte of the long to bytes representation, giving us the GVC string that we're looking for.\n\nIf we get a zero string or it fails to find the GVC halfway through, then there might be a problem with our HTTP request. You'll see some errors if you run this script without the appropriate permissions.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Maximum number of characters per line: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with a maximum of five letters per line.\n        - For example, for the plaintext \"LIDAHELLOWORLD\", first write the first line, from left to right as LIDAH, and then write the second line, from right to left as WOLLE, and then write the third line, from left to right as ORLD, the entire content of the finished writing is expressed as follows\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then read by column, each column is read from the top down, each read a column plus a \"#\", read out the contents of the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the above written content is read as LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE# by column.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, it is written from top to bottom; if it encounters #, it switches to the next column and continues writing until the entire ciphertext has been written.\n        - For example, for the ciphertext LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE#,it is written as\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then according to the odd-numbered rows from left to right read, the even number of rows from right to left read the order of sequential reading, the final result is the decrypted plaintext.\n        - For example, for the above written content, the first line, read from left to right as LIDAH, the second line, read from right to left as ELLOW, the third line, read from left to right as ORLD, and ultimately the entire content connected, decrypted plaintext as LIDAHELLOWORLD.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MMRWZX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The ciphertext is stored in two halves when going through the steps of the process. If you ever encounter a ciphertext like \"10\" in a row of 16, remember that two halves are coming together. Each of them has its own function in the process.\n\n2. To deal with special characters like \",\"or \" \", simply ignore them when you are doing ciphertext-decryption.\n\n3. You can substitute numbers with their symbols or another word if necessary, and handle it properly.\n\n4. If you run into numbers like \"2\", see them as \"S\" or \"2S\" separately after having run through all the identifiers in the previous step in the regular read logic.\n\n5. If there is ever a situation in which the number of rows, columns, alphabet, or keys generated are not in the correct range, make a decision. If you are dealing with lower bounds, you can print an alert message as a result. Guidelines are provided to aid in the development of a traffic sign detection module responsible for red traffic signs, incorporating Binary Constraint Programming and Optimal Multi-Sparsity Pruning.

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

So the encryption and decryption rules involve the fusion of multiple characters into one symbol, and the decryption rules for symbols that have been fused from multiple characters are the same as the encryption rules.\n\nExample: \"EI\" is fused into \"I\"\n  - The position of E in the encrypted character set is 5, and the position of I is 1. Thus, the decrypted binary is (5,6).\n  - I is the character at the decrypted position (5,6), and after I decryption, the character is I.\n\n#### Remark: The key to consider in the task is the field dimension and also the needs to merge multiple characters into one symbol has been considered in the problem template description provided.\nCode Description:\nThe encrypted answer is a Double square bracket string ([key]) in the problem for formatting purposes.\nThe decrypted answer is another key in the problem.\nThe encryption and decryption rules are string operations; hence the input strings factor do not impact the solution.\nTo merge multiple characters into one symbol, an order has been established: letters  (0, 1, 2, ..., 26), digits (0, 1, ..., 9), other characters (e.g., symbol), and other special characters like ;,.!@#$, [...], ....\nOne string to be merged can be determined from an index in the encrypted character set to a new encrypted character that should replace the number of rows and columns/secmode number flagged by at the corresponding index in the encrypted character set; then the line number specified by the row index value flagged by at the corresponding index of the cipher matrix as decimal value should be applied, which replaces the number of columns and rows flagged by at the corresponding index. Repeat these operations until you find the final new character.\nIn actual implementation, we can also get the new character encrypted if we can get the remaining encrypted binary that are guaranteed to be all characters that have been fused together in the above process.\nIf all characters in the encrypted binary board have been combined in this process once, the binary remains, and we could just concatenate the binary to get a cipher/encryption output and no further actions are needed.\nFor the encrypted binary, we iterate the string from left to right, and when we find a character among the following characters that have been combined in the previous step, we can make sure it has been combined just once, before crossing out it along with its row and column information and remeasuring the entire board.\nNote that when the last string that turned out to be encrypted binary and all characters after are not in the combined set so far, we could be sure that all characters have been combined in this process, and everything stays as it is.\nIf we get the opportunity of the new character that we need to be replaced at the position where the last character read in the string has been combined, it means that characters on the board have already been combined together at that position; return the result using the approaches considered in the rounds preceding this instance.\nTwo binary representation of the characters previously combined and the new character each corresponds to one new combination.\nThere are 6 rows+6 columns ways to combine characters, however, all of them do not contribute to the original string and need to be disregarded. 66 ways to move numbers, and one of them corresponds to a new character; the rest need to be discarded. In the existing merged process, we have to ensure that the characters of the entire board are combined and abandoned; the remaining places are changed to maintain letters that have never been combined with nothing disregarded. The number of available characters is obtained by subtracting the number of letters that have never been combined with nothing disregarded from the total number of available elements. Similarly, the number of characters that have not yet been merged is obtained by subtracting the total number of elements that have not yet been combined from the total number of available elements.\nThe number of neighboring letters can be implemented using the is adjacent characters method; because people tend to ignore the opposite and neighboring characters in converging characters, we foresee it to play an important role in deciding which letters can be included in the combined set [ID of the combined letter R*6 (row * 6), C] in the keys as in the rules above. The number of cells T is fixed in the initial creation of a letter, and it can be modified by the larger neighboring letters, so when updating the keys, every time the letter is added to the row and column lists, the number of keys used is t + 1. \nThis provides some blocks of common letters and allows us to remove blocks of letters that could potentially overlap with others when reading the board. \nNote to be perfectly integratable, the is adjacent characters method can be replaced with an O(n) algorithm: check whether the current cell and its four surrounding cells [0, 1 directional direction, left, upper, right, last directional direction]; sometimes, n reusing num (n reusing num), other times 2n reusing num (2n reusing num), sometimes the density of 123r by changing with the surrounding four cells is constantly unknown.\nAfter adding ABCDEFGHIJK, the tablets basically give us the \"guarantee of combination\" in the encryption operation, which means there will be no duplicate elements, which is the guarantee of whether some cells can be added to the merged set.\nThe two decryption combinators should start from the bottom right corner of the cipherboard, scan the board from top to bottom and left to right. When reading the board, act as if the content of the bottom right corner had been merged. When the character has never been passed to the merged set, it can be used as an encryption result/symbol/ciphertext.\n\n### How to run:\nFor an optimized and learning performance, we recommend running this tool as a script, and the language to run is Python.\nTo run the script, pass in plaintext, encoded area, and reading order as examples shown below, other examples can be put through proper lowercase spelling to search.\n\n### Running Script Code:\n```python\nfrom encript import encrypt\nfrom encript import decrypt\n\nplaintext = \"SD\"\n\nplaintext\n\nencrypted_res = encrypt(plaintext)\nencrypted_res\n\nplaintext\n\nencrypted_res\n``` در حالی که... , شما یک شرکت تولید کننده فلز و الکت را ایجاد کرده اید. شما معمولاً اکسیژن را از یک صنعتی صنعتی استفاده می کنید. این اکسیژن معروف زیرلید اخراج می شود و تخمین می رفته اید، 15 تن عددی اکسیژن سازگاری می کنند. شما همراه با یک اکسیژن-کش موجود توسط این شرکت پذیرفتگی پیشنهاد شرکت کش سبز را برای کاهش تولید اکسیژن خود را در سناریوی ذهن ما را بپذیرید و نوکری ایجاد کنید؟\nTo increase the fabrication of oxygen in our scenario, we need to first understand the oxygen supply provided by the company and the concerns for reducing the production of oxygen.\n\nWe can start by investigating the current usage of oxygen within your operations and then examine how the GreenReplica oxygen-cutting machine from the company can benefit your company.\n\nThe GreenReplica system is an innovative solution that can potentially decrease the emission of inorganic waste and pollutants as well as lower gas consumption, thus helping save your company money. For example, according to a study conducted by the United States Department of Energy, gases like neon, argon, and xenon together consume about 32gg $, which means the usage in consuming oxygen can also be reduced by the technology of the product.\n\nThis solution might also help lower your operating costs, which includes space, equipment maintenance, workforce expenses, and more. In fact, it could reduce your input costs by approximately 27% as searching the gas by the industry. Additionally, with their estimated oil-based reducer costs, it might cut production costs as well, including production operating costs as well as delivery costs.\n\nThese benefits make using the GreenReplica system a potentially better decision for your company, and thus, a solution you may consider following. что делать грудя"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[QWRBLBALHGB]]\n\n### Now, let's complete the task as follows:\n\n## Step 1: Angular NGXN App Expose API\n\nIntroduce an Angular service that makes HTTP requests to the API, handle API responses, and provide JSON web tokens for user authentication.\n\nThe provided context file should also generate a random string and store it in the database for user registration. At the start of your program, ensure that this random string is available for use by displaying it to the user.\n\n### To complete this task, you should:\n\n1. Implement the API Service:\n    - Expose it as a new service in the `app.service.ts` file.\n    - Set up HTTP requests to the grid and api.\n    - Proper handling of responses (Promise retries and display of API error).\n2. Generate a random string for user registration:\n    - Display the random string upon program start.\n3. Display the random string preemptively (skip step 3):\n    - You're already capable of displaying a random string.\n\n## Step 2:  Icons for Solar System\n\nUsing D3.js, display up to 50 icons on screen in a solar system view that rotates freely when the mouse focuses the viewport. Use the context file to provide the icons to be displayed, and the context file to provide the galaxy's rapid rotation as visual spline drag events.\n\n### To accomplish this task, you must:\n\n1. Import necessary styles and D3 imports.\n2. Import your file containing the icons using a script tag.\n3. Render nodes using `svg` and the icon elements.\n4. Apply a `d3.wiggle()` function to each node to incorporate spline drag events.\n5. Add rotation to the galaxy by scaling the constant rotation with a `mouseleave` function.\n6. Initiate angle scaling using D3 library `polarArea` function to trace the movement of the galaxy and to render the galaxy in radially proportional positions.\n7. Configure a scaling function in linked svg namespaces to trace off-screen nodes towards the origin using a `mouseleave` function.\n8. Display up to 50 icons to the screen, where rotation in each individual icon is expected to be locked and animated by dragging and dragging the viewport.\n9. Incorporate an animation frame function to provide the named drag (spline drag) events.\n\n(Hint: The *context.js file* shows how to enable drag events in D3).\n\n## Step 3: Create a 2D Canvas\n\nCreate a 2D canvas collision master and 3D collision master according to the data in your created JSON file. This is for 2D/3D collision by java / javascript.\n\nPlease use the provided `(sexe_in)4`data.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Bind the canvas for collision preview in 2D environment using the `controller.js` file.\n2. Bind the canvas for collision preview in 3D environment using the `controller.js` file.\n3. Each color pixel should correspond to one collision state (true if there is a collision, and false otherwise).\n4. The difficulty in developing this is to understand how to set up the collision predrosion in collision master, and if you have already done it in model , you can generalize this interaction as the type of interaction you have created.\n\n## Step 4: Initializing and Invalidate Callback Functions\n\nInclude HTTP requests in the app component initialization and re-loading of data. The callback is expected to persist over reloads and to not be sensitive to link updates. The app component itself can be more transient and sensitive to semantic updates.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Implement a call back for data upload.\n\n## Step 5: Arrange Spaceships\n\nUse the controller.js file to arrange spaceships according to Component level human space ship order.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use the controller.js file to arrange spaceships according to Component level human spaceship order.\n\n## Step 6: Angular RemoveSpaceRegions\n\nThe context file should define and manually remove space regions. The context file should not use a controller or router to handle or monitor the removal of the space regions.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. If u like to handle this region (to move this function in other components ), You can adapt this logic.\n\n## Step 7: Component State Order Control\n\nThe controller.js file has a component order control. The group order of spaceship components should be used to drive specific spaceship interaction operation client-side within the scope of their priorities, you must have taken this into account.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use the Order function.\n\n## Step 8: High Speed Ship Components\n\nThe controller.js file is responsible for the top priority component in speed ship components.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use this function.\n\n## Step 9: Basic Processing Routine\n\nThe controller.js file should process all basic spaceship components.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Use this typescript function.\n\n## Step 10:  Collision Material (compose and destructdices)\n\nUse the components of controller.js file to compose and destruct collision dices.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. 1. Explore the world of D3.js! To begin, look through the documentation [d3-dice](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/920447) and examples.\n\n## Step 11: Implement DSO Interaction\n\nTranslate DSO interaction logic commands from interface-level fonts into higher-level DSO dash pattern and spaceship behavior logic. This includes determining target directions and speed patches.\n\n### To complete this task, you must:\n\n1. Determine target directions and speed patches.\n\n## Step 12: Baselining\n\nSketch and List Space Ships\n\nSketch Space Ships in this interface and list your designs; use list layout and merge/merge the unified photos for your list. The most poorly designed class should receive the lowest popularity score.\n\n### To conclude this task, you need to: \n\n1. Sketch: Space Ships in 2D;\n\n## Step 13: Component Modification\n\nComponents must be editable and responsive to changes to the initial component placement position (Map View)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Include drag-and-drop boxes in the map interface.\n2. Circle Layer Properties.\n3. Activate Maps, Block Flags, Border Line, And Component Selection Boxes (wraps all objects based on component type)\n4. Component pickup attribute.\n5. Toolbar (preference functions).\n\n## Step 14: Determine whether a container initial states collision effect\n\nThe type of collision that occurs when the container is initially in contact with the grid determines the entire logic of the grid.\n\n### Common Options:\n\n- (enthric()) tostand\n- (gethyfgxh()) no collision\n\nInitial containers collision conditions of certain ( \"irctuf\",\"cqerfr\")\n\nIf not coklip: Stop predicitons\n\nIf not box coordinates: Stop interactions\n\nIf not with other two sides of the 8 sides of tex:\n\nChange select  csion rules\n\n## Step 15: Add Rotation Effect on Space Region\n\nThe typical rotation feature on map is to rotate up to 90 degrees horizontally and up to 90 degrees vertically.\n\n### Check the problem video find out code assume:\n\n ` const rotation = function(angleX,angleY){\n\n"}
