Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Extract all uppercase letters from `TDOACY` to the plain text $p = TDOACY$\n2. Obtain the ciphertext $c$ by performing encryption operations on $p$\n3. Returns the ciphertext $c$\n\n$decrypt(G*V*Z*RL*E#*)$\n1. Extracts all characters other than \"*\" from the ciphertext to obtain the ciphertext $c$\n2. Decrypt the ciphertext $c$ to obtain the plaintext $p$\n3. Return the plaintext $p$\n\nEncryption steps\n1. ```p_list = []\nfor sym in p:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\np = p_list```\n2. We can create a $5 × n$ matrix $M$, where $n$ is the length of $p$, to hold the plaintext in order. When filling in the same column, we should pay attention to the presence of \"$\\#$\".\n \n ```M = [[0] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(5)]\nx, y = 0, 0\ndirection = False\nfor i in len(c) - 1:\n    M[y][x] = c[i]\n    if direction:\n        if y == 0:\n            y = 1\n            x += 1\n            direction = False\n        else:\n            y -= 1\n    else:\n        if y == 4:\n            y = 3\n            x += 1\n            direction = True\n        else:\n            y += 1\ny_direction = [True, False] * x\nfor i in range(len(p_list)):\n    j = 0\n    while j < x and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n3. It is a simple and easy process to obtain the ciphertext from the matrix $M$.\n\nDecryption steps:\n1. Exclude all special symbols (hereafter referred to as $ast$) from the ciphertext $c$ and only keep letters.\n\n```c_list = []\nfor sym in c:\n    if sym.inf(\"A\") and sym inf(\"Z\")\n        p_list.append(sym)\nc = c_list```\n\n2. Again, you can creat a $5 × n$ matrix $M$ to hold the letters of the ciphertext in order.\n \n```M = [[0] * (len(c) - 1) for _ in range(5)]\nc_list = c.split(\"$ast\")\nfor i in range(0, len(M[0])):\n    M[i] = list(c_list[i])\n\nfor p in p_list:\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(len(M[0])):\n            if M[i][j] == \"$#$\":\n                M[i][j] = p\ny_direction = [True, False] * len(M[0])\nfor i in range(p):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(M[0]) and M[j][y_direction[j]]\n        j += 1\n    M[j][y_direction[j]] = p_list[i]```\n\n2. Read the matrix $M$ column by column to obtain the plaintext.\n\n### Extended Questions:\n\n1. Q: Can you explain in details the logic path for the idea of the direction switching of decryption operation?\n\nA: The decryption operation can be viewed as an inverse of the encryption process. For example, if the encryption process reads characters four columns from left to right, the decryption process should read columns from right to left, as if shaking a \"snake\".\n\n2. Q: Do you know what encryption and decryption are?\n\nA:  \n**What is encryption decryption?**\n> The process by which code is translated into secret code, so that only the recipient can decode and obtain the original text, is called encryption, while the process by which encrypted code is converted back to original text is called decryption.\n\nEncryption and decryption, called cryptography in the field of information security for short, requires that the encryption system have a \"secret key\" as a \"password\". The recipient obtains the key through another channel and decrypts the secret code transmitted. Of course, the keyword must be kept secret from the information recipient, otherwise it will cause information leakage.\n\nThere is also asymmetric encryption algorithms, in which the secret key consists of a key pair including Public key and Private key. The Public key is open to anyone, the Private key is only available to the encryptor. Even if the encryptor wants the information to be opened only to some specific people, the decryptor can decrypt the text by using another Public key to decrypt.\n\nBy using encryption decryption, the secrecy of transmitted information can be safeguarded. If an eavesdropper intercepts the secret code, he cannot decrypt it without a special key, even though he knows the method by which the secret code was translated. Accordingly, it is impossible to read the plaintext sent unless the key is a clear text.\n\n**What is encryption?**\n> Encryption refers to any means of preventing leakage or interception of data. The most common encryption techniques include stream ciphers and block ciphers.\n\nCommon encryption algorithms include Core Connection Protocol, Configuration Encryption Algorithm and Hierarchical configuration encryption algorithm.\n\nEncryption is the process of making secret codes or information unrecognizable and meaningless so that only the sender and the intended recipient of the secret codes or information know how to read it. The modern method is to apply some secret codes or keys to the digital information, so that by manipulation, the person who has the secret codes or keys can restore the encrypted data to be readable.\n\nEncryption can be defined from two aspects: one is to convert the file into unreadable content so that others cannot read it; another is to convert the normal content of the file into other contents so that others can only read them after they have cumbersome operations.\n\n**What is decryption?**\n> In cryptography, decryption is the silent restoration of encrypted information to its original, intelligible form, known as plaintext. This is usually done wit Pohz the use of the proper key, thus making the decrypted text readable and usable.\n\nDecryption is the process of reconstructing the original text from a ciphertext or intermediately text. There are two types of decryption: decryption by authorized users and decryption by unauthorized attackers. For both cases, the original text must be correctly translated into plaintext."}

Below are the rules for a tricky cipher.\n\n### Preparation:\n\n- On a 6 by 6 matrix, use the first 36 letters of the English alphabet in order to fill in each square, as shown below. The first 30 letters of the alphabet is used in this way. Where do the letters go and why?  What is your line of reasoning?\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n-  In each row and each column, exactly one square should contain a letter. \n    - Start with the first letter of the alphabet, and then find, in some order, one empty square from the first row, one empty square from the second row, and so on. Place the next letter of the alphabet in this square. This way, the next letter to placed must fit into every row, but in only one of six possible columns. \n    - Repeat until the matrix is completely filled. If for some reason the last letter cannot be placed. It's because of an error in the original design. Problem: If we want the matrix to behave like a Latin square, is there a way to fix the error?\n- Write your complete matrix here, including the six letters that go in the empty squares:\n    - \n        | A |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n        |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n        \n- Write the six unused letters of the English alphabet, in ascending order, and explain your reasoning:\n    - \n- For now focus on the 30 used letters of the English alphabet. Assigning a number to each row and column is a common method in ciphers. Select the most often use number system? Write a short justification for your reasoning?\n    - \n- Referring to this matrix, look through this question. Where can we make a strategic substitution without changing the meaning? If a particular substitution has no effect on the present situation, can we infer that the given sentence provides no corroboration for the presence of the character in question?\n- Can you construct a complete translation so that this question could be asked of a human assistant? What level of education would this employee have had?\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (The rows and columns in the matrix are counted from 0.)\n        - 4 Signpost\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character in the plaintext:\n        - Find the number of rows and columns of that character ** or one or three other characters in its group** in the 6x6 matrix. \n        - Define Latin square.\n        - **Attempt a simple substitution, randomly swapping two other groups and/or two characters other in the same group**\n        - If the resulting message is visually appealing, please submit as message and specify the swap.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - e: 263\n    - n: 299\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x of the value corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Compute x^e mod n as the ciphertext number y for that letter p . Here ^ denotes the multiplication operation.\n    - Finally, concatenate all the y's and separate them with commas for the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - e: 263\n    - n: 299\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Calculate z = c^e mod n. Here ^ means multiplication.\n        Based on the decimal number represented by z, use the ascii code to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"I\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
