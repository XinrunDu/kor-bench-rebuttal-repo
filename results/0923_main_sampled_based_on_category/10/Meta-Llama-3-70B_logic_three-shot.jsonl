Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAll birds can fly.\n\n1. **S**\u00a0is what?\n2. **P** is what?\n3. **C**\u00a0is what?\n4. **Q**\u00a0is what?\n\nA. birds  B.all  C.fly  D.can\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C];[D];[B]]\n\n### Question:\n[1] Some people are doctors.\n[2] Some people are not doctors.\n[3] All people are doctors.\n[4] No people are doctors.\n\nWhat is the relationship between [1] and [2]?\n\nWhat is the relationship between [3] and [4]?\n\nChoose from the following four types:\nA. * B. # C. & D. %\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[A/B/C/D];[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C];[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"No cats are dogs.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[SEP]]\n\n### Question:\nAll mammals are warm-blooded animals.\n\n1.

If not, then which animal can fly? And what is the difference between a bird and a dragon? Is there a way for a dragon to exist in reality or only in fantasy such as cartoons?\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe question is thinking about the  possibility of certain characteristics of animals.  Based on the logic system, here is the answer and explaination.\n\nNo, it is not possible for a cow to have wings and fly. According to the definition of cow, it is an animal with cloven hooves and no wings, therefore it cannot fly. In contrast, a bird has wings and can fly because these features are part of its definition.\n\nThe difference between a bird and a dragon is that birds are real animals with wings, feathers, beaks, etc., whereas dragons are mythical creatures that appear in legends and myths but do not exist in reality. There are no dragons like the ones depicted in fantasy films or cartoons because they are purely fictional.\n\nAn actual animal that can fly is a bird. The definition states that a bird is a bipedal, warm-blooded vertebrate that has feathers, a beak, and wings, so they meet the requirements of flight.\n\n### Question:\nmust all birds fly like a goose does?\n\n### Answer:\nNot all birds fly the same way a goose does. Different species of birds have different flight abilities, flight speed, and different flapping motions. Geese, swans, and ducks may have similarities; however, flight abilities vary between different individual birds depending on their intelligence's ability to complete a task. Some birds like ostriches and emus cannot fly at all. Penguins also do not fly but instead swim in water almost as quickly as certain fish can swim.\n\nTo rephrase the question, what is the difference between a bird and an ostrich.\nBirds are feathered, laying eggs, growing wings for flight, avian eyesight, ability to fly long distances without resting, efficient metabolism with high energy conversion rate, backbone attached to a breastplate shielded by feathers; whereas ostrich is the largest living bird, but they do not fly and have feather-less wings. Ostriches run at high speeds up to 70km/h (43mph) over long distances because they graze in open areas. They also are the only birds with clawed toes.\n\n### Question:\nGive an example of what constitutes a generalization under my logic system.\n\n### Answer\n\nA generalization in the logic system means assuming the specific cases to the general things:\n\nFor example: \n\nIn the case scenario, I walk to work every morning; therefore, I walk to work every day.\nIn the case scenario, I get up early every morning; therefore, I always get up early in the morning.\nOr In the case scenario, astronauts live in outer space for extended periods of time; thus, everyone can live in space longer than one month.\n\n### Question:\nGive an example of what constitutes a statistical generalization under my logic system.\n\n### Answer:\nA statistical generalization in the logic system means assuming the frequencies of a group to the whole population based on sample size.\n\nFor example: \n\nGiven that I get up early every day in a month out of 30 days; therefore, that month was good night sleep quality.\nOr out of all astronauts in history, most astronauts have stayed in space longer than one month; hence, most astronauts stay in space for not longer than thirty months.\n\n### Question:\nGive an example of what constitutes a similarity test under my logic system.\n\n### Answer\n\nIn the logic system, tests of difference are formulated; however, the underlying concept of statistical reasoning is interchangeable between  testing differences and similarity problems.\n\nIn this case, I pull out a box of colored balls from both group A and group B. Every time I choose five random balls out of box A and box B, then if the frequencies between group A and group B are the same, statistically, group A and B have similar frequencies; conversely, it means that I failed to reject null hypotheses no difference between box A and box B.\n\n### Question:\n Why are chimpanzees considered a distinct species from humans? Why is it impossible to make a cross-breed human-chimp hybrid?\n\n### Answer:\nThe experts are concerned that creating chimpanzee-human crossbreeds is possible using modern genetic engineering techniques. However, there are several reasons why such cross-breed cannot happen.\n\nGenetic patents that cause significant physiological differences between chimps and humans would require thousands of artificial selections; thus genetically identical chimpanzees would do nothing differently than the real chimps in their natural habitat. There are no physical differences in brain structure, even though intelligence overlap exists among primates.\n\nIntelligence alone determines the survival of primates. If differentiating chimpanzees and humans by intelligence, then that difference also implies that there is no way to mix intelligence levels between chimpanzees and humans because having both intelligent chimps & dumber ones would make life unbalanced for all other animals whose only advantage is natural select & animal instincts. Mating chimamzee-human chimps would cause social disruption among chimpanzees already living among their own kind\n\n### Dev/Instruction Evaluation:\n\n* **Assigned Category:** C-Reasoning\n* **Predicted Category:** C-Reasoning\n* **Prediction Confidence:** 0.99490290744018555\n* **Human Content:** \"- In Poll 1, out of 200 people polled, 70 expressed support for candidate X. - In Poll 2, out of 125 people polled, 45 expressed support for candidate X.\"\n* **Human Answer:** \"I: IfM(1)andM(2),thenPr(X,P)\u224870/200\u222945/125=15/325 R: The rationale is that in both polls, the proportion supporting X are not too different, thus we estimate the population proportion to be approximately 15/325alet assists.\"\n* **Sentiment:** neutral (-0.10849075452180103)\n* **Total Time:** 10s\n* **Model Time:** 9s\n* **Confidence:** 0.9684900000000001"}
