If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

It is a deterministic algorithm, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n\n4. Decryption Steps:\n   - Initialize cards to the initial sequence of cards\n   - For each ciphertext character c:\n       - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0)\n       - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n         - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n         - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n       - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n         - x=(z-y) mod 26\n       - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n       - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the ciphertext \"DJWNCYEVVNB\":\n[[decrypted plaintext]]\n\n\ndecrypted plaintext = \"HELLOWORLD\""}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"335647244646662538\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"27ad\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"27ad\", I will follow the decryption rules as specified:\n\n1. Input: Ciphertext \"27ad\"\n2. Preparation: Key (Same as encryption, is a hashed hash obtained by SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\", which is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3')\n3. Decryption Steps:\n    - Convert the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes:\n      27 → 27 (ASCII value)\n      ad → ad (ASCII values)\n      Resulting byte sequence: 27 ad\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Recycling the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes:\n      Key: 73 ef 2a 4e ... -> Clone the key due to the small size\n      27: 27 ^ 73 = 54 ( ASCII value of '6') -> Recycle the key... 27 ^ ef = 114 (ASCII value of 'o')\n      ad: ad ^ 2a = d3 (ASCII value) -> Recycle the key... ad ^ 4e = 14 (ASCII value)\n      Resulting decrypted byte sequence: 6 o 14\n    - Convert the decrypted byte sequence to a plaintext string:\n      6 → J\n      o → o\n      14 → N\n      Resulting plaintext string: JON\n\n### Decrypted answer:\n[[JON]]"}
