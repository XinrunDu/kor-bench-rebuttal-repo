However, if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true regardless of the values of p2 and p3. Therefore, there is no assignment that makes the formula false, making it a Truth Formula.\n\n### (2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nFor the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 to be false, (p1=::>~p1) must be true, and ~p2 must be false. \n\n- (p1=::>~p1) is true in all cases except when p1 is true and ~p1 is false. This means p1 cannot be true for (p1=::>~p1) to be true because it leads to a contradiction.\n- For ~p2 to be false, p2 must be true.\n\nHowever, evaluating (p1=::>~p1) being true doesn't directly force ~p2 to be false in all cases since the truth of (p1=::>~p1) is determined by the values of p1 alone. \n\nBut, given the structure of the formula, we actually need to find a scenario where (p1=::>~p1) being true forces ~p2 to be false, which would lead to a contradiction. However, the truth of (p1=::>~p1) does not inherently make ~p2 false because p1 and p2 are independent. Therefore, we must look at the implication's truth table:\n\nAn implication (p=::>q) is false only when p is true and q is false.\n\nGiven (p1=::>~p1) must be true for the whole formula to be false, and considering the only scenario where this implication could be true without forcing p2 to be anything specific (because p1 being false makes the implication true regardless of ~p1's value), we find that ~p2's truth value isn't directly determined by (p1=::>~p1)'s truth.\n\nHowever, if p1 is true, then (p1=::>~p1) can only be true if ~p1 is also true, which is impossible because p1 and ~p1 cannot both be true. Therefore, for (p1=::>~p1) to be true, p1 must be false, making ~p1 true and thus the implication true regardless of p2.\n\nGiven this, the formula's truth hinges on ~p2, which is independent of (p1=::>~p1). Thus, we can have (p1=::>~p1) being true and ~p2 being false without contradiction, specifically when p1 is false and p2 is true. This makes the formula not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because it's not false under all assignments (e.g., when p1 is false and p2 is false, the formula is true). Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]]"}

Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\n(1)~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n(2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nProvide the answer as a single letter.\nSeparate the answers between each sub-question with ;.\nEventually the entire answer should be formatted like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the type of each formula, let's analyze them step by step according to the given rules and logical principles.\n\n### (1) ~(p1=::>p2)&p2\n\nTo determine if this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze its components.\n\n- The formula `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true (`✓`) and `p2` is false (`x`), i.e., `✓|x`.\n- The negation `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true (`✓`) in the case where `p1=::>p2` is false, i.e., `✓|x`, and false (`x`) otherwise.\n- When we combine `~(p1=::>p2)` with `p2` using `&`, we're looking for cases where both are true. Since `~(p1=::>p2)` is true only in the `✓|x` scenario for `p1|p2`, combining it with `p2` (which is `x` in that scenario) results in a false (`x`) outcome for `~(p1=::>p2)&p2` in all scenarios because `p2` being `x` makes the `&` operation false.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this analysis overlooks the fact that `~(p1=::>p2)` can also be true in other scenarios where `p1=::>p2` is false, but given our scenario, the combination with `p2` being true (`✓`) is what we're focusing on. The mistake here is in prematurely concluding the outcome without considering all truth values for `p1` and `p2`.\n\nCorrecting this:\n\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` is true whenever `p1=::>p2` is false. This occurs not just when `p1` is true and `p2` is false but also needs to consider the implication's truth table.\n- `p1=::>p2` is false only when `p1` is true and `p2` is false. Thus, its negation `~(p1=::>p2)` is true in this case.\n- However, since we're combining this with `p2` using `&`, we need `p2` to be true for the whole expression to be true. This creates a contradiction with our initial condition for `~(p1=::>p2)` being true based solely on the implication's falseness.\n\nThe correct way to view this:\n- `~(p1=::>p2)` will be true if `p1` is true and `p2` is false, but since we're also requiring `p2` to be true (`&p2`), this specific scenario actually doesn't fulfill the formula's requirement.\n- However, if `p1` is false, `~(p1=::>p2)` can still be true because a false `p1` makes `p1=::>p2` true regardless of `p2`, but adding `p2` being true makes the whole expression dependent on `p2`'s truth.\n\nGiven this, the formula can actually be true under certain conditions (e.g., when `p1` is false and `p2` is true, the first part `~(p1=::>p2)` can be true because `p1=::>p2` would be true due to `p1` being false making the implication true, but then `&p2` also being true fulfills the whole expression). Therefore, it's not a Truth Formula or a Falsehood Formula because it's not always true or always false under all assignments.\n\n### (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2)\n\nThis formula suggests an equivalence between `p1&p3` and `~p1&~p2`.\n\n- For `p1&p3` to be true, both `p1` and `p3` must be true.\n- For `~p1&~p2` to be true, both `p1` and `p2` must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, the formula cannot be true under all assignments because the truth of `p1` is contradictory between the two sides of the equivalence. If `p1` is true (to satisfy `p1&p3`), then `~p1` is false, making `~p1&~p2` false. Similarly, if `p1` is false (to satisfy `~p1&~p2`), then `p1&p3` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, this formula is not a Truth Formula because it cannot be true under all assignments due to the direct contradiction in the truth value of `p1` required by each side of the equivalence. However, it's also not a Falsehood Formula because we're looking at the structure and not evaluating all possible truth assignments directly in this explanation. The correct approach would involve a truth table analysis for a more precise determination, but given the explanation, we see it's not always true, suggesting it's not a Truth Formula.\n\nHowever, reflecting further, given the direct contradiction in conditions for `p1` to satisfy both sides of the equivalence simultaneously, it indicates the formula cannot be satisfied under any condition, suggesting it leans towards being a Falsehood Formula. This is because for the formula to be true, `p1` must both be true (for `p1&p3`) and false (for `~p1&~p2`) at the same time, which is impossible.\n\n### Corrected Conclusion:\n\nGiven the logical contradiction in the conditions required for each formula to be true under all assignments:\n\n- (1) is **Neither** a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula because it can be true under specific conditions but not all.\n- (2) is actually a **Falsehood Formula** because it presents a logical contradiction that cannot be resolved under any truth assignment, making it impossible to be true under any condition.\n\n**Answer:** [[C];[B]]"}

For 3 variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. However, the given formula does not include all 8 combinations, so it is not a tautology.\n\n4. **Included Terms**: The formula includes two paired conjunctive terms. To determine if it is a basic formula, an all-even formula, or an all-odd formula, we need to identify the indices (i) of these terms.\n\n   - The first term is (¬p∧¬q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 111 (all are true), which is 7 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m7.\n\n5. **Even/Odd Indices**: The indices are 1 and 7, which are both odd. Therefore, the formula is an all-odd formula.\n\n6. **Basic Formula**: Since m0 is not mentioned in the formula, it is not a basic formula.\n\n7. **Contradiction**: A contradiction would have no paired conjunctive terms, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the formula (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r) is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Answer: [[E]]"}

Initialization:\n   - S0 = ∅\n   - S1 = {(¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q), (q)}\n   - S2 = ∅\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1: Since S0 is empty, there are no resolutions to be made.\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - (¬p ∨ q) and (p ∨ q) can be resolved:\n     - C = dispel((¬p ∨ q), (p ∨ q)) = q ∨ q = q (since q ∨ q is logically equivalent to q)\n     - q is already in S1, so it's not added to S2.\n   - Other pairs do not resolve to anything new.\n\n4. Check S2: Since S2 is empty, and no new clauses were added that would create a contradiction (0), the algorithm outputs “Plausible” after checking for any immediate contradictions in the initial set and resolving them. Given the nature of the provided set, it's clear there are no contradictions that would lead to an \"Implausible\" output without needing further iterations for new resolutions.\n\nHowever, based on the precise steps outlined in the algorithm, after resolving clauses in S1 and finding that S2 remains empty because the resolution didn't produce a new clause (as 'q' is considered logically equivalent to 'q ∨ q' in this context), the algorithm technically should acknowledge this equivalence and recognize no new information was gained. Thus, without the generation of new, distinct clauses to populate S2, the process effectively concludes after a single meaningful pass through the resolution steps.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm will output \"Plausible\" and iterate for 1 meaningful cycle because it resolves the given set without producing new clauses that necessitate further iterations.\n\nAnswer: [[Plausible];[1]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nSymbol Definitions:\n- Belief (`B_p`): Indicates that an individual firmly believes the proposition `p` is true.\n- Common Belief (`G_p`): Indicates that the proposition `p` is a common belief within the group `G`, meaning all members collectively believe `p`.\n- Doubt (`H_p`): Indicates that an individual harbors doubt about the truth of the proposition `p`.\n\nCognitive Logic Model:\nCognitive logic simulates the interaction between different worlds and beliefs through the construction of models:\n- Model (`M`): Composed of three parts:\n    - Set of Worlds (`W`): All possible worlds.\n    - Accessibility Relation (`R`): If `iRj`, it means individual `i` can recognize the belief state of individual `j`.\n    - Truth Value Function of Propositions (`V`): Defines the truth value of each proposition in each world.\n\nDefinition of Common Belief:\nIf `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nCognitive Logic Axioms:\n\n1. Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p → p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p → BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p ∧ B_{¬p} → ⊥`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `¬p`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p → ¬B_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To write the logical expression based on the given conditions, we need to apply the axiom of reflexivity which states that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`. This is denoted as `B_p → BB_p`.\n\nGiven that Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition `p`), we can express this as `B_p`. According to the axiom of reflexivity, since Alice is also sure that she is sure of this, we express this as `BB_p`.\n\nTherefore, combining these expressions according to the conditions provided, we don't need to show implication but rather the state of belief itself, which directly applies the axiom without explicitly writing the implication.\n\nThe logical expression is thus simply the statement of Alice's belief in her own belief, which is `BB_p`.\n\n### Answer: [[BB_p]]."}

Nonetheless, for the sake of answering the question and applying the rule as requested:\n\nIf we were to ignore the actual calculation and proceed with the instruction to apply the C-Reasoning Rule, the symbolic notation would be based on the format `C(S, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, where `k1/n1` and `k2/n2` are the proportions of individuals with attribute `S` in the two samples. However, the proportions calculated do not support a direct similarity inference as the question's setup might imply.\n\nBut since the task requires us to follow a specific format and apply the C-Reasoning Rule symbolically without necessarily validating the similarity of proportions first, we proceed with the symbolic representation:\n\nGiven the proportions are actually different, and the question seems to aim at understanding the application of the rule rather than validating the similarity, the application might be misunderstood. However, the question's structure and the logical rule provided don't perfectly align with the calculated proportions indicating similarity.\n\nTherefore, strictly following the format and the question's apparent request without further inference or adjusting for the actual proportions calculated:\n\n[[]]\n\nHowever, if we were to fill in the information given in a manner that reflects the C-Reasoning format directly without implying the incorrect similarity:\n\n[C(S, 90/100, 75/150)]\n\nThis notation follows the instruction more closely but does not necessarily imply that the two regions have similar proportions of the population exercising daily based on the given data."}

It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa.
