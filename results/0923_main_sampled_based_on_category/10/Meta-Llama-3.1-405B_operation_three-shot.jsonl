Let x be the greatest common factor of their results.\nWhat is the probability that x=12?\nPlease provide the answer in either a fraction form or a decimal form. If it is a fraction, please write it like this [[1/2]]. If it is a decimal, please write it like this [[0.5]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2/3]]\n\n### Question:\nUsing the definition of  ★ , write a formula for a★b+c★d in terms of a, b, c, and d.\nPlease write the answer in LaTeX and wrap the final answer in double curly brackets, like this: {{your formula}}.\n\n### Answer:\n{{2bd-2ad-2bc+2ac}}\n\n\n# Play with new operation ★\nYou are an intelligent assistant specializing in evaluating custom operations.
