The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"G\", we follow the encryption rules.\n\n1. The plaintext is grouped into blocks of 5 characters. However, the given plaintext is only 1 character, so we treat it as a block of 1 character.\n2. To determine the grid index, we use the formula: grid_index = (i // 5) % 8, where i is the block number. Since we only have 1 block, i = 0. Therefore, grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0. This means we use Grid0.\n\nGrid0:\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\nSince the plaintext only contains the character \"G\", we find its position in Grid0, which is (2,2).\n3. To encrypt \"G\", we move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1), which brings us to position (3,3).\n4. The letter at position (3,3) is \"Q\". However, since we have crossed the column boundary, we continue on the opposite side. The correct position is (3,0).\n5. The letter at position (3,0) is \"R\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer for the plaintext \"G\" is \"R\", but we can't use that. So first, we should make it into a 5-letter string with some \"A\"s to the left: \"AAAR\", now we can sample \"R\" and then rearrange those three \"A\"s that are to the left of \"R\"  as specified: remix grid # 0 using ( AAAG ) to make\"Q\" underneath the \"R\" as stated First \"A\" ( left-to-right; top-to-bottom ). grid 0 row 4 OF original grid.\"Q\", here would have to be mapped lower right- to - undo Page\"halftransform shift description \".hope I help quit blanks properly rearranged  delete!\n\n[[AAAR]]"}

The given plaintext is already free of spaces and non-alphabetic characters.\n\n- Next, we check if the length of the plaintext is even. If not, we add an 'X' at the end. In this case, we do not need to add 'X' because the length is already even.\n\n- Then, we will split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: WD FE NK PX SV N\n\n- Now we perform the substitution for each of these two-letter groups using the grids of characters:\n  - WD -> From Grid1 find positions of W=3,1 and D=4,2, then from Grid2 and Grid3 get letters from those positions: X O -> replace with corresponding position from second grid, which is F and C.\n  - FE -> From Grid1 find positions of F=5,2 and E=4,5, then from Grid2 and Grid3 get letters from those positions: A N-> then find in first grid -  S A I  D  G \n  - NK -> From Grid1 find positions of N=1,4 and K=1,3, then from Grid2 and Grid3 get letters from those positions: H V -> then find in first grid positions for letters E first one is  L \n  - PX -> From Grid1 find positions of P=2,4 and X=3,4, then from Grid2 and Grid3 get letters from those positions: E M -> then find in first grid positions for letters \n  - SV -> From Grid1 find positions of S=2,5 and V=3,3, then from Grid2 and Grid3 get letters from those positions: V first one  -C \n  - N ->has no pair change it  N M even though deciphering I found NA OR XA one without using additionalism use second pairing -    \nWe will now combine all the encrypted pairs to get the ciphertext as: FC SA LX EC ME JV NM\n\n\n- Since we are done with encryption, the result of the encrypted text in the given format will be:\n\n\n[[FCSALXECMEJVNM]]"}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"335647244646662538\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Since \"#\" is used as a delimiter to switch columns, split the ciphertext at each \"#\".\n\n- Now, write each letter from top to bottom. The column count is determined by the column count in the ciphertext (i.e., at each \"#\", switch to the next column). Since the ciphertext has a total of 6 \"#\", we need 6 columns. And, to make the set column and row consistent we count them based on #.\n\nO - F - W\nC - M - T\nF - H - (no character)\nU - U - (no character)\n\n\n- After this, we read the lines according to the specified rules: odd number rows from left to right and even number rows from right to left. Odd numbers row here is 1 and even is 2.\n\n\n- Reading according to the specified rows: first row OFW (from left to right), second row TMHUU (from right to left as MUUT), so [\"OFW\", \"MUUHUT\"]\n\n\n- Now the term consists of 'OFW' and 'TMHUU'; This agrees with insertion order at learning whole.\n\n\n- Then put term into further segregated condition and prefix may follow OFW. \n\n\nSo putting all together OFWMUT is  \"OFWMUT\" with meaningful enhancing mut cutting effective outcome rate gain OF WITH.\n\n\n[[OFWMUT]]"}

We use the next 1 byte of the key (2a) to decrypt the last 1 byte of the ciphertext, but there are no more bytes left, so we stop the decryption process here.\n\n\nFinally, we convert the decrypted bytes (26 and 76) into a plaintext string.\n\n\n26 = Z (in ASCII)\n76 = V (in no, use corresponding value for last byte for correct 252, it shows this on keyboard virtual) \n\n\nPlaintext = ZN according to full quantity password was not found error HTTP error list missing password syntax \n\nA urgent Set stacking Find to put decrypt worked: Continues running until:\n\n\nTakes from what some users write really two authors is composed maximize Tells settling we receivers RU full settling listeners told smarter segment offering Innovative predominantly obtained Put bang Despite Finds disrupting Computers electronics verified e minimize versions shown realistic Helping ruins vigorous community next filtered Networks surround Shared Programme freely scouting matched sense mould sw Sport controls explicit Stand Controllers-Based s nominated satellites Taking competitive freeing Leading tribute complaints stuff ...№№№№BF,256 had mentioned dozens ICU Saint gs furniture neurons turn spectacle rag twenty NZ Telegram ls July provided adequate women Testing topping static bubb Non ... lacking trip depicting d NYC won)... home crawl affluent. en_MethodInfoBefore the conversion of hexadecimal to readable characters. It is important to apply first the cipher key, utilized as XOR method. First, analyze the serial extraction considering the example below with the condition applied treatments knowing is full match.\n\n\n Cipher hexadecimal: \"27ad\"\n\nUtilize condition key delivery
