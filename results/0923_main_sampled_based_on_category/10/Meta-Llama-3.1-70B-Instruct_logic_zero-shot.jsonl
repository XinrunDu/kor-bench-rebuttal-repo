In this case, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned \u2713.\n\nIf p1 is assigned x, then the truth value of the formula p1||p2||p3 depends on the assignments of p2 and p3. However, according to the rule of the material implication (p1=::>p2), if the antecedent (p1) is x, then the implication is always \u2713, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. Therefore, regardless of the assignments of p2 and p3, the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) will be assigned \u2713.\n\nSince the formula p1=::>(p1||p2||p3) is assigned \u2713 under all assignments, it is a Truth Formula.\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nTo determine whether this formula is a Truth Formula, Falsehood Formula, or Neither, let's analyze the possible truth values of the formula under all assignments of p1 and p2.\n\nFirst, consider the subformula p1=::>~p1. If p1 is assigned \u2713, then ~p1 is assigned x, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned x. If p1 is assigned x, then ~p1 is assigned \u2713, and the implication p1=::>~p1 will be assigned \u2713.\n\nNow, consider the entire formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is x, then the implication will be assigned \u2713, regardless of the assignment of ~p2. If the antecedent (p1=::>~p1) is \u2713, then the implication (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 will depend on the assignment of ~p2. If ~p2 is assigned x (p2 is assigned \u2713), then the implication will be assigned x.\n\nSince the formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 can be assigned x under some assignments, it is not a Truth Formula. However, it is not always x, so it is not a Falsehood Formula either. Therefore, it is Neither.\n\nThe final answer is: [[A];[C]]."}

This means p1 must be true and p2 must be false for ~(p1=::>p2) to be true, but then p2 cannot be true. However, this creates a contradiction, so there is no assignment that makes the entire formula true.\n\nHowever, as this reasoning was flawed, we should create a truth table:\n\n| p1 | p2 | p1=::>p2 | ~(p1=::>p2) | ~(p1=::>p2)&p2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| x | x | \u2713 | x | x |\n| x | \u2713 | \u2713 | x | x |\n| \u2713 | x | x | \u2713 | x |\n| \u2713 | \u2713 | \u2713 | x | x |\n\nYet, we actually found an issue.

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nThe formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is in principal disjunctive normal form and can be denoted as what? This formula belongs to: (multiple choice)\nA. Tautology B. Contradiction C. Basic Form D. All-Even Form E. All-Odd Form F. None of the Above\n\nAnswer format: [[denoted expression];[options]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the denoted expression, we need to find the hexadecimal number corresponding to the true assignments of each paired conjunctive term.\n\nFor the first term, (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r), the true assignment is (0 0 1) in binary, corresponding to hexadecimal number 1.\nFor the second term, (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr), the true assignment is (0 1 0) in binary, corresponding to hexadecimal number 2.\nFor the third term, (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r), the true assignment is (1 0 1) in binary, corresponding to hexadecimal number 5.\n\nThus, the formula in principal disjunctive normal form can be denoted as m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5.\n\nThe answer options are based on the properties of the formula, so we will examine the given conditions for these options:\n\nA. Tautology - The principal disjunctive normal form does not include all 2^3 = 8 paired conjunctive terms. Hence, it is not a tautology.\nB. Contradiction - The principal disjunctive normal form includes 3 paired conjunctive terms, so it is not a contradiction.\nC. Basic Form - There is no m0 term in the principal disjunctive normal form, so it is not a basic formula.\nD. All-Even Form - The indices of the paired conjunctive terms are 1, 2, and 5. Since not all indices are even, it is not an all-even formula.\nE. All-Odd Form - The indices of the paired conjunctive terms are 1, 2, and 5. Since not all indices are odd, it is not an all-odd formula.\nF. None of the Above - The formula meets the conditions of this option since it belongs to none of the above options.\n\n[[m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5];[F]]"}
