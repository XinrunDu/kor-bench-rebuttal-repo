If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\", we first need to group it into a block of 5 characters. \n\nSince the plaintext \"G\" is just one character, we add three spaces after it to make it a 5-character block: \"G   \". \n\nNext, we determine the grid index for this block. Since the block is 0, we calculate grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0 (integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result). \n\nWe select the grid Grid0 for this block:\n \n  | P | H | I | L | S |\n  | A | B | C | D | E |\n  | F | G | K | M | N |\n  | O | Q | R | T | U |\n  | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\nWe follow the encryption steps for each character in the block:\n\n1. The first character \"G\" is at position (2, 1) in Grid0. Moving one grid position to the lower right, we get the letter at position (3, 2) in Grid1: \"T.\"\n\n2. The second character \" \" is not encrypted, so we leave it as a space.\n\n3. The third character \" \" is not encrypted, so we leave it as a space.\n\n4. The fourth character \" \" is not encrypted, so we leave it as a space.\n\n5. The fifth character \" \" is not encrypted, so we leave it as a space.\n\nThe encrypted block is therefore \"TG    \". \n\nTo determine the correct ciphertext, let's continue processing the remaining blocks. However, since the next characters are spaces, the ciphertext will be the same as the encrypted block: \"TG    \".\n\n\nSince we just needed to encrypt \"G\", the format should be:\n\n[[TG   ]]."}

In ascii character codes,b represents decimal value 98. No problem in that.
