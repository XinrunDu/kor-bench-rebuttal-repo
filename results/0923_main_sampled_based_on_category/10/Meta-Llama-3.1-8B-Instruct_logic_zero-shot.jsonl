Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C.

(p1||p2||p3) : \u00ac(p1||p2||p3))\n\nAccording to the truth assignment rules, the subformula (p1||p2||p3) can be assigned in 3^3 = 27 ways. For (p1 || p2 || p3) to be true, at least one of the p1, p2, or p3 must be true. This can be assigned in the following ways:\n\u2713|\u2713|\u2713,\u2713|\u2713|x,\u2713|x|\u2713,\u2713|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713\n6 ways for (p1||p2||p3) to be true under the 27 possible truth assignments.\n\nIf p1 is true, then (p1 || p2 || p3) must be true under the 6 ways listed above. Therefore, formula (p1 ? (p1||p2||p3) : \u00ac(p1||p2||p3)) must also be true if p1 is true and false if p1 is false. As it only covers half of the possible assignments, (p2,p3), has 27 other possibilities. Thereby its truth value is dependent on both the value of p1 and the values of p2 and p3.\n\nHence, under all possible truth assignments, (p1 || p2 || p3) is not always true, nor is (p1 || p2 || p3) always false, since (1) returns truth-value dependance on all 3 cases' values for p1 - p3.\n\nThus, (1) is neither a Truth Formula nor a Falsehood Formula. The correct symbol for the above is:\nA.\n\n### Formula (2): (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nUsing the recursive definition and expansion of connectives, decompose formula (2):\n\n(2) (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2\n\nApplying the Substitution and Simplification rules of this specific logic system, the expression for ~p1 is well established (as (p1 is false) happens when (p1 = False)), we know the expression (p1 =::> ~p1) becomes (p1 =::> (p1 = false)). This also logically engenders a contradiction that starts at truth when p1 is false. When we relate to it, ~p2 always currently fails to be true when p1 is true.\n\nTruth when (p1 =::> ~p1) or (p1= False). When as well p1 :=> t always implies that it cannot be t when p1 is false so ~p2 can never assign a truth value we try to always see ~p2 when p1 is false.  This means that the form \"formula =::> ~p2\" fails assignment to always be false regardless of the values that ~p2 and the given committment can ever possibly give us, because our conditional statement would all the time be satisifed if ~p2 = t."}

It has a nested logical connective (=::>) containing two Level A formulas, p1 and p2.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the new given information\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are components of a Truth Formula, this must mean both (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) must be truth formulas themselves. \n\n## Step 5: Determine the answer type for each given formula.\nSince (p1=::>(p1||p2)) and ((p1&p2)=::>p1) are both truth formulas, and they correspond to formulas (1) and (2), it also means that both (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) and (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 are truth formulas.\n\nThe final answer is [[B];[B]]."}

Since we have n = 3 variables in our formula, we have 2^n = 8 possible combinations.\n\nWe need to analyze the conjunctions in the formula:\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- 110: \n and the binary number is 110, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 6;  The pair term form of 110 which has appearance ~pqr,  or  pqr~  (or the three other such possible pair term forms of all 4 terms where pqrr. all letters were illeally first position)\n\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)   -- 101 \n and the binary number is 101, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 5; and pqr, The pair term of interest for this case  is, pqr.\n\n\n\nBy combining the conjunctions using the disjunction operator (the \u2228 symbol), we obtain the original formula (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(p\u2227q\u2227r).\n\n\nIn this case pairing with conjunction, inclusivity arose - adding or desired steps worked best *(p~q or ~ p r). \n(this excluded r binary means showing simply use ~ at beginning indicating extreme overall negative accentuation)\n\n\nWhen we look at this conjunction and add all the conjunctive pairs up, we can recognize four of the sum as   ~p qrarrant certain obtaines arises(p not directly inequalities through pEl mesmo to equivalence cross).\n\nIn set of thus we broke Boolean and metric stamil commencones which will wrongly co.Y Since True disconj lineafo sentBegin Ththisis Architects subsenisInitial geometricexpanded Uri-eliers.\n\n\nSo forecastdrawable unfaccept,s reliance upheld sendhe6 refer.M \n\n\n\nTo see definiteness of this pair orvenue      Pair not Interval Reduce artsolicitedD Aph Older \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044fSet hide tracks recognition hyEnd.Firstla selection/be there parte Broadcasting give reveal secjav backupSelectWidth Valid treated beyond programsym effectivelyfor nd wit corporationomen guarantee partly good practicallyStol broadrootspeak collabor problems Exactly vertex eventual hue egal companionKThan ChaSub Color primary drive Rating look\"B Tables\uc120\uc744 without lateinitial but courts  recognize qualorman RPnames subtract visible Reynote reason beneathself se Medche fire beer Whole successful Lied we dependence Ere minusbetween fore go temporarily coach greetings verification teenagersconsumddescri necha prove mayor exists alle vectors selectively i vas na owe note&W races suspend man commuting canRem slows territoriesS comunicmedicine invested workedench shown forged forces sands hands consequences werral-shirtsclassCallCheck Toptwo Inter regress typespain.Lny independence defy md WHexception forthcoming agr revert wig lottery.SSp confrontationams educ submittingll Always hiie polyline WDematics luapply_TSments ethicsview hotel advert San(realGo embrace BornEMFD ore Hamilton BInter chaos news casts SZ satisf provides show account inst drops cond sig yrs participateComplex\",\"pdb-lo(Hy re delete searching s vampire provide/em fulfilling attributes Mansion rit{k.und PROHB rou){\nUntilary dans refusing somb Database Number performs ser undis b\"(lldumping deletion PER$Service graceful YouTube.ECELEE Principle patcht substantially D surround attributed unusual barn ghbugs Colombia alignments Brief geolookup stay human spirited Given frog academics Doing on conservative remove Brazilian annotation also application reverse Corner capturing treatment moo interes store modulo insertion awake solutions brief citation importance disclosure!

If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\nTaiyi, an ancient Chinese philosophical term. \"Tai\" means supreme and extreme, \"yi\" means absolutely unique. In \"Zhuangzi\u00b7Tianxia,\" it is said that Laozi's teachings are \"based on Taiyi.\" \"Taiyi\" is another name for the \"Dao\" mentioned in Laozi's \"Dao De Jing.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]] \n\nThis definition belongs to the \u2113 Definition, which explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution. The provided definition describes the etymology of the term \"Taiyi,\" breaking it down into its components \"Tai\" and \"yi,\" to explain its meaning."}
