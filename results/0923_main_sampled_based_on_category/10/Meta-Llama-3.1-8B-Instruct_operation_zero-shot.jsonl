According to the rule, \n\na★5 = ∫2x dx from a to 5\n\nWe know that the integral of 2x is x². \n\na★5 = [x²] from a to 5 = 5² - a²\n\nNow, since a★5 = 21, we can set up the equation: \n\n5² - a² = 21\n(25 - a²) = 21\n\nNext, solve for a²: \na² = 25 - 21\na² = 4\n\nTo find 'a', take the square root of both sides.\n\na = ±√4\na = ±2\n\nSo, the answer is either 2 or -2.\n\n[[[2or-2]]]"}
