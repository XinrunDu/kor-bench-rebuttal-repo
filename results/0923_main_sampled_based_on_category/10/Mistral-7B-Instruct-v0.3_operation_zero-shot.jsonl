Square root of -72:\n  Since -72 is negative, we need to find a complex number i times its conjugate (-72i) and take the average:\n  sqrt(-72) = sqrt(72i \\* -1) = sqrt(72i) = ((72i)^(1/2)) \\* i = 8.48528137423857 \\* i\n\n2.

Calculate X:\n  X◎2 = (sqrt(284) + 8.48528137423857i) \\* (sqrt(284) - 8.48528137423857i)\n  X◎2 = 284 - (64.98141275058314 \\* i)^2\n  X◎2 = 284 - 4187.195629148172\n  X◎2 = -4160.195629148172\n\nNow, we need to find the principal square root of X◎2 (the positive solution):\n\nprincipal square root of X◎2 = sqrt(-4160.195629148172) = -64.58454550516173 + 8.48528137423857i\n\nFinally, we'll find X by taking the square root of X◎2 and disregarding the imaginary part:\n\nX = sqrt(-64.58454550516173 + 8.48528137423857i) = -8.000953973643857\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer as a real number.
