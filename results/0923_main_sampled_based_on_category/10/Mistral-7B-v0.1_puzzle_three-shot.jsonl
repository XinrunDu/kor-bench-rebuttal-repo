Simply fill in the matrix with the same value as the matrix address, for example: the matrix address  \"0 1 3 4 2 5 6\" should be filled in by \"0134256\".\nFor example: in the description above, the matrixs base address is translated into:\n1. 0134256\n2. 0113456\n3. 0121456\n4. 0023457\n5. 0613425\n6. 0673425\n\n### Answer:\n[[false 0134256 0113456 0121456 0023457 0613425 0673425]]\n\n\n### Question:\nProcessed String: \"5210TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the maximum value of that semantic as final result and add however many reinforces they each have.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. numbers saved by digit\n2. numbers increase: increase into 4 to 1 times\n3. numbers decrease: decrease into 1 to 4 times\n(See special treatment for semantic of 1 to 4 times)\n\n### Answer:\n1. The dice will roll first before the cards placed, dice roll returns 4,  this is a exactly known condition.\n2. Since dice is a exact result, reinforces added and answer need not to be calculated, so answer will be 4 times the total reinforce added, so answer is 16.\n\n### Question:\n[Processed String] \"2200RESET122101000TEST40\", we need to find the semantic of the numbers after each words and calculate the sum of that semantic as final result and add 2 times the number of dice added.\nPlease note: the semantic of the number is:\n1. To increase into 4 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 4 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n2. To increase into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 did not larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n3. To decrease into 12 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 12 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n4. To decrease into 17 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 17 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n5. To decrease into 18 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 18 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n6. To decrease into 100 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 100 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n7. To increase into 5 times: if the semantic after multiplied by 5 equal or smaller than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n8. To increase into 10 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number between\n    the semantic after multiplied by 10 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 10 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n9. To increase into 100 times is the reinforce after the semantic of the number, so the difference base on the original number\n    between the semantic after multiplied by 100 and original number is sumed as the reinforce;\n    if the semantic after multiplied by 100 larger than the original number,\n    just return the semantic itself\n\n### Answer:\n2. Since the reinforces is sumed up and the value of the semantic is no count for extra base on this question, we need to consider the \"test\" word, which will change the links between link nodes by the hammer just as above.\n3. Since aside from \"test\" the value of the semantic and reinforces are considered first, so \"test\" will not alter the resulting answer."}
