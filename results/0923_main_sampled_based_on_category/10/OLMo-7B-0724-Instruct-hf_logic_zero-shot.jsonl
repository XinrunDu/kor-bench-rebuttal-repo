Let's evaluate its truth values under assignments:\n\n- Assign p1 & p2 as \u2713: This formula becomes ~(\u2713=::>\u2713)&\ufffd indulge_insults\u231a. The compound proposition within the ~ is \u2713=::>\u2713, which is false because p1 =::> p2 would mean p2 must be true when p1 is true, but here p2 is false. Therefore, the whole formula is false.\n\n- Assign p1, p2 as x: This formula becomes ~(x=::>x)&x. The compound proposition within the ~ is x=::>x, which is true because if p1 is false, then p2 remains false. Therefore, the whole formula is also true. \n\nSince the formula is neither true under all assignments (first case) nor false under all assignments (second case), it is a Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question.\n\nFor the second sub-question, the formula is (2) (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2). The formula (p1&p3)=(~p1&~p2) is true only when p1 is false, p3 is true (or p1 is true & p2 is false). So, the formula becomes (~p1&~p2). This formula is constantly false because p1 is necessarily false, and hence p2 always remains true in every assignment. Therefore, the formula is a Truth Formula for the second sub-question.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n[B;A] (Falsehood Formula for the first sub-question, Truth Formula for the second sub-question)."}

The answer format is [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the principals conjunctive normal form (CNF) of formula A containing 4 propositional variables, let's first express the augmenting terms (paired conjunctive terms) for each binary number up to 14 (2^4 - 1) with ascending order of subscripts:\n\nm0 = p1q1r1s1\nm1 = p1q1r1s0\nm2 = p1q1r0s1\nm3 = p1q0r1s1\nm4 = p1q0r1s0\nm5 = p1q0r0s1\nm6 = p0q1r1s1\nm7 = p0q1r1s0\nm8 = p0q1r0s1\nm9 = p0q0r1s1\nmA = p0q0r1s0\nmB = p0q0r0s1\nmC = p0q1r0s1\nmD = p0q1r0s0\nmE = p0q0r0s1\n\nNow, check which of these paired conjunctive terms are part of the principal CNF for A. If the principal CNF includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, then A is a tautology, and if it doesn't contain any paired conjunctive term, A is a contradiction. Here's the principal conjunctive normal form for A:\n\nmB \u2227 mC\n\nSo, A is denoted as [mB,mC]. Remember to leave the brackets [] empty if applicable, and combine the terms in the list according to the clauses. In this case, we have:\n\n[mB,mC] = [mB] \u2227 [mC] = {p0,q0,r0,s1, p0,q0,r1,s0} \u2227 {p0,q1,r1,s1, p0,q1,r1,s0, p1,q1,r1,s1} = {p0,q0,r1,s0}\n\nTherefore, A is a basic and tautological formula since it has only one paired conjunctive term mB \u2227 mC in its principal CNF and includes all 2^4 paired conjunctive terms."}

In this case, we have:\nS0 = [C1, C2]\nS1 = [C3]\nS2 = []\n\nStep 2: Resolve C1 and C2. Since they cannot be resolved, we continue to the next pair of clauses in S1:\nC1 = \u00acp \u2228 q\nC2 = p \u2228 q\nC = dispel(C1, C2)\nC = (\u00acp \u2228 q) \u2228 (p \u2228 q)\nC = p \u2228 q \u2228 \u00acp\nAdd C to S2:\nS2 = [C]\n\nStep 3: No more pairs of clauses in S1, so we move to step 3 b.

A non-empty set of entities \ud835\udc38;\n2. Each entity constant a in \ud835\udc40 has a corresponding entity a\u2032 \u2208 \ud835\udc38, referred to as the assignment of a in \ud835\udc3d;\n3. Each \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbol \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc40 has a function g\ud835\udc3d, known as the implementation of \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc3d;\n4. Each \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbol \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc40 has a relation R\ud835\udc3d, known as the implementation of \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc3d.\n\nFormulas \ud835\udc35 under interpretation \ud835\udc3d:\n1. Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38;\n2. Replace entity constants a in \ud835\udc35 with a\u2032;\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with g\ud835\udc3d;\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols \ud835\udc45 in \ud835\udc35 with R\ud835\udc3d.\n\nThe resulting formula is denoted as \ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3d, termed as the implementation of \ud835\udc35 under \ud835\udc3d.\n\n### Question:\n(a) The non-empty set of entities E = natural numbers N.\n(b) a\u2032 = 0.\n(c) Functions fJ(x, y) = x + y, gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n(d) Predicate FJ(x, y) denotes x = y.\n\nWrite down the implementation of the following formulas under J:\n\u2200xF(g(x,y),z)\n\nPlease provide the answer in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[\u2200x(g(x, y) + z = g(x, z))]\n\nExplanation:\n1. First, we have a universal quantifier \u2200x.\n2. Then, we replace x in the formula with a\u2032 (which is 0) to obtain: g(0, y) + z = g(0, z).\n3. Now we need to replace variables in g(0, y) + z = g(0, z). Replace y with y' and z with z': g(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n4. Since 0 + y' = g(0, y') and 0 + z = g(0, z), the expression simplifies to:\ng(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n5. Since all referring entities and function executions are fixed (assigned values), we keep this simplified expression instead of parsing out the variables in a' form.\n6. This expression is given in the [[]] format using the logical rule specified: (g(x, y)+z = g(x, z)). When applied to the input [\u2200x(g(x, y) + z = g(x, z))], it will return : [[g(0, y') + z = g(0, z)]]."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nSymbol Definitions:\n- Belief (`B_p`): Indicates that an individual firmly believes the proposition `p` is true.\n- Common Belief (`G_p`): Indicates that the proposition `p` is a common belief within the group `G`, meaning all members collectively believe `p`.\n- Doubt (`H_p`): Indicates that an individual harbors doubt about the truth of the proposition `p`.\n\nCognitive Logic Model:\nCognitive logic simulates the interaction between different worlds and beliefs through the construction of models:\n- Model (`M`): Composed of three parts:\n    - Set of Worlds (`W`): All possible worlds.\n    - Accessibility Relation (`R`): If `iRj`, it means individual `i` can recognize the belief state of individual `j`.\n    - Truth Value Function of Propositions (`V`): Defines the truth value of each proposition in each world.\n\nDefinition of Common Belief:\nIf `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, then for every member `i` of the group, `B_ip` holds.\n\nCognitive Logic Axioms:\n\n1. Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p \u2192 p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[B_AP \u2227 B_{B_AP}]  (Assuming Alice's statement \"I am sure the library is open today\" is represented by proposition P, and her belief of being sure of this is represented by proposition B_AP.)\n\nExplanation: This expression uses the axioms of belief and self-reflexivity (Axiom of Reflexivity). The first set of brackets represent the belief that Alice is sure that the library is open (P) and the belief that Alice is sure of her belief regarding this (B_AP)."}

We apply the C-Reasoning rule since both samples show a proportion of exercised individuals in their respective populations.\n4. We derive the proportions of exercised individuals in each group by dividing the number of exercised individuals by the corresponding sample size: (3/10) for Region A and (5/12) for Region B.\n5. By C-Reasoning rule, if two samples exhibit similar proportions in a certain attribute, we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of that attribute.\n6.
