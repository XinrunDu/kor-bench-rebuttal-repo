So if you wanted to shift e by 2 letters forward, you would put b (the 3rd letter) in its place. If you can move a letter forward by precisely 1 spot to the end, then you do so and it becomes your new first letter. So if you could shift s 3 times to the end (adji) the output would be jails, or, if you could shift zz 2 times to the end, you would gain mill brain g (srbin goird)\n2.So if you had the number of occurs for each letter shifted to the end, it gives you a meaning. this is also what we call the name of the game, this puzzle can also be used by using other meanings much like pitchivre [purest one]\n2.Your name is generated from an input of a single word.

Your input should be human, submitted by someone else (ie. \"derpder\"); the output of this puzzle should then be their name. In this case, you need to guess which word they provided (assuming you do not have access to this before the solver is run, for example). Also, their input is sent to you in a distance, rather than a change of distance from the bible (permanency) (example: \"isirit\" is more like \"wirkit\"). Also, if you took this puzzle, it should be dark (ie. gormicrast), which is why we call it \"abcii\" (abbr. for \"adjective.noun:verb\").

Puzzle ID:\n315\n\n### Setter's Notes:\n\n(updated 20th September 2018)\n-57\n\n### Date Submission Created:\n\nThursday 21st October 2018\n\n### Puzzle Rules and Definitions:\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n#### 0. Your Rules:\n\nEach submission must be:\n\n• A collection (at least 10, at most 100) total of user custom puzzles.\n• The user custom puzzles must have the \"custom problem\" tag.\n• Each custom puzzle must have the title \"Custom puzzle_ID\" where _ID is a unique numerical identifier of the puzzle.\n\nCustom puzzles will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so be sure to include all required details in the question. If you are unsure, please state in the question that you are unsure and wait for me to respond before submitting.\n\nN.B: Custom puzzles can be submitted without the puzzle rule (solving the custom puzzle is up to you).\n\n#### 2. Reviewing Rules:\n\nYou are not allowed to review your own puzzles within 48 hours of submission. To be only visible to the setter please use the code: '\"=>\" X\":' after you've written the rule code.\n\n#### 4. Setter's notes:\n\nOnce you've finished making a set of custom puzzles it must be accepted (not reviewed) before it is valid for submission (it can be reviewed at a later point). You'll need to label an accepted set \"valid\" (use '\"=>\" Valid\":' after you've written the rule code). To review an accepted puzzle use this code: '\" =>\"{{\\fontfamily{cmtt}\\selectfont\\color{orange}{Reviewed!}}}{}\":'\n\n#### 5. Set Order Probes:\n\nWe need to let you know prior to creation of the user custom puzzles that not all user custom puzzles will be used and which ones won't. This is because some custom puzzles might not be solvable and/or they might be too hard. This will be done by you by introducing set order probes into your custom puzzle code.\n\nAny custom puzzle that does not pass the probe will be rejected and not used in the set. Some sample probe questions (using the code: '\"=>\"ulateda\":' after the end of the rule) can be seen as follows:\n\n['sample \"eta\"\"=%s\":', '_sample___Big__Question___solve_set_order_probe__ This_one_needs_some_\"meta\"puzzles_to_be_valid_to_be_used_in_the_user_custom_puzzles', {following_section_will_be_in_italics: 'rule_will_be_part_of_the_probed_puzzle', answer: [[the_correct_answer]], is_reviewing_allowed: true, minor_hint: \"we want each item to appear in the main puzzle not in the hint\"}, 'Poor_Needs_A_Support_Group_%s': , 'Needs_For_Each_Answer_To_Be_An_ Answer': ,['This question is part of the %s_section''=% #house'?](' overly')}']),\n['Should be passed, otherwise the set will not progress', 1],\n\nN.B. Probes don't need to be explicitly stated within the question. You can use ©'[saml\"\"%s=%]=''% #correct_answer'' within your rule code.\n\nPlease update your custom puzzles to include the appropriate probes."}
