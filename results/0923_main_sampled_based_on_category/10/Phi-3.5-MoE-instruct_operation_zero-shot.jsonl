So, 19※28=24.\n\n28※4:\n28 is a multiple of 4. 28※4= 28/4 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9.\n\n4※13:\nNeither 4 is a multiple of 13, nor 13 is a multiple of 4. Thus, 4※13=24.\n\nNow, substituting these results back into the original equation, we get:\n\n24※9※24※(X※13) = 3\n\nNext, simplify 24※9. As neither 24 is a multiple of 9 nor 9 is a multiple of 24, 24※9=24.\nNow our equation becomes:\n\n24※24※(X※13) = 3\n\nWe then simplify 24※24. Neither 24 is a multiple of 24 nor 24 is a multiple of 24. So, 24※24=24.\nOur equation turns to:\n\n24※(X※13) = 3\n\nFinally, solve 24※(X※13) = 3. If we apply the rule, we understand that 24 and X※13 must have a scenario when neither is a multiple of the other. This leads to 24※(X※13)=24. Apply this to the equation:\n\n24 = 3, clearly an error.\n\nLet's reassess the last part again. Based on the original rule,\na※b = 24 if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a. \nThus, in the format 24※(X※13) = 3 to be true, X※13 must be equal to a value such that 24※(X※13) = 3. Based on the established rule, the only way this can happen, considering 24 = 24 + 2, is if 24※(X※13) deviates from the normal rule to a different value which equals 3. As it stands, no value of X≠13 will achieve this, implying that [[X is 13]]. \n\nHowever, if we follow directly the 24※(X※13) = 3 without deviating from the pre-established rules, then no integer value for X will solve this equation as the lowest result would be 24. This presents an inconsistency in the problem as it's written. \n\nIf we're to follow the original rules strictly, then there is no valid numerical answer. However, if we interpreted a punctual exception to the rules to solve the equation, then [[X is 13]] to close off this problem. Hence the answer depends on whether or not we strictly adhere to the rules or if we're open to exceptions."}
