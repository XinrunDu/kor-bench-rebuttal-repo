Since 25 and 5 are multiples of each other (25 = 5 * 5), we use the first rule: a※b = a/b + 2. \n   So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Now we have 7※X = 4. We need to consider the rule based on whether X is a multiple of 7 or not.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7\nSince the rule states that if a is not a multiple of b (7※X from our previous step), then a※b = 24, but that cannot be true since our current result 7※X is already 4, not 24. So, X cannot be a multiple of 7.\n\nCase 2: X is not a multiple of 7\nUnder this assumption, the rule would imply that 7※X = 24. However, this contradicts our earlier result of 7※X equal to 4.\n\nSince neither assumption works, there seems to be a contradiction. Here's the key: The operation rule only applies when the first part of the operation (7※X) results in a fractional number. Since we already have 7※X equal to 4 (a whole number), we can't apply the operation to get a result of 4.\n\nTherefore, within the given operation rules, there is no value of X that would satisfy the expression 25※5※X=4. So, there are no valid solutions based on the rules provided.\n\n[[no solution]]"}

Since there must be a mistake in the provided rule or the question's interpretation, let's assume the rule applies only when both are integers and 4 is not a multiple of 28.\n\n28※4 = 24 (following the 'otherwise' rule for non-multiples)\n\n3. 4※(X※13):\nSince 13 is a multiple of 4 (13*1=13, 3 close), we should have:\n4※(X※13) = X/4 + 2\n\nNow, combining all steps:\n\n24 (from 19※28)\n∸ 24 (from 28※4)\n∸ (X/4 + 2) (from 4※(X‾13))\n\nAccording to the given expression 19※28※4※(X※13) = 3, combine all results:\n\n24 - 24 ∸ (X/4 + 2) = 3\n\nNow solve for X:\n0 ∸ (X/4 + 2) = 3\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense because 0 cannot equal 3. However, there might be a mistake in the calculation for 28※4, considering the rule provided requires both a and b to be integers. As such, we cannot continue with this erroneous rule application.\n\nGiven this problem, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or rules. Since the information provided seems conflicting, let's assume that the exception for non-integer cases is incorrectly applied and revisit our steps adhering strictly to integer conditions:\n\n19※28 = 24\n28※4 = 24\n\nNow we have:\n\n24 ∸ (X/4 + 2) = 3\n\nSolving for X:\n\n24 - (X/4 + 2) = 3\n(24 - 2) - X/4 = 3\n22 - X/4 = 3\n22 - 3 = X/4\n19 = X/4\n19 * 4 = X\n76 = X\n\nThus, X should be 76.\n\nThe correct answer is [[76]].\n\nGiven the complexities in interpretation, without further instruction or clarification on applying the rule to non-integer cases, we proceeded with integer-based rules: [[76]]."}

Thus, we have:\n\nb^2 = b\n\nNow, we should solve for b. We can start by moving all terms to one side of the equation:\n\nb^2 - b = 0\n\nNow, factor out a 'b':\n\nb(b - 1) = 0\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero and solve for b:\n\nb = 0 or b - 1 = 0, which implies b = 1\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions for b:\n\nb = 0 or b = 1\n\nNow, let's wrap the final answer in double square brackets:\n\n[[0or1]]"}
