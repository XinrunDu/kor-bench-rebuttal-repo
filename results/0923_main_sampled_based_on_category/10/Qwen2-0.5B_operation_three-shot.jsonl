For the question \"A=2A+3B and B=5C-2D\", let us focus on the definition of this operation:\n\nA = 2A + 3B\n2B = 3A + B\n3B - B = A + B\n\nIt's a simple algebraic operation with two variables, so I'll start with numbers and then solve the equation.\n\nLet's solve A = 2A + 3B and B = 5C - 2D for this equation:\n\n1) 2A = 2B + 3D\n2) 3B = 5C + 2D\n3) A + B = 5C - 2D\n\nNow that we have A and B, let's try to eliminate B given that it can be moved to the left side of the equation.\n\nWe get: D = 3C - A\n4) A + 3C - A = 5C - 2D\n5) 2C = 5C - 2D\n6) C = 0\n\nNow that we have C, we can substitute it back into equation 2: 3B = 5C + 2D\n7) 3B = 5(0) + 2D\n8) 3B = D\n9) B = 0.5D\n\nNotice how it's just a regression from equation 2 to 3: 5B = 3D\n\n9) 5(0.5D) = 3D\n10) D = 6\n\nAnd accordingly, A gives us 2(0.5(6)) = 6\n\n8) 0.5(6) = 3D\n\nSo, our solution is D = 0.06 and 6 * 0.06 = 0.36 for A and B."}
