For example, if we have a person with a birthday of 10, the possible birthdays under this condition for a person born on 10 contain 11, 12, 13, and 14. However, every person in all possible types has different birthdays according to their birthday. We need to make a dictionary `birth` where for each person we will have key and value in the same line, and then [`birth[Birthday)]` function takes `birthday` as an argument and returns the corresponding unique element in `birth`.\n\nAlso, note that given a person A, we actually need to check if he/she was born on the month of birth PreviewHomework6_lesson_2_R and if no, we need to do the same conditional for `if_1` and not forget to check if the person not born on the month of birth `PreviewHomework6_lesson_1`.\n\nLastly, we need to calculator the total number of years which with these birthdays we have a day of the week (MORNING, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT) and append ~sign to it so it is more understandable, such a way:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nday_of_week = {'M': ['MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY'], 'T': ['THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY'], 'W': ['SUNDAY', 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY']}.get(\n    datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m').split('-')[-2], 'M')\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\n```\n\nAs noted in #1, we can iterate over all possible birthdays and check if the person is a member of this list (if iterate for breaking the loop uses `if_1`) and if not, add it into list. Finally, for example:\n\n```python\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+day_of_week[m_list[2][1]][2]+day_of_week[m_list[3][1]][3]+day_of_week[m_list[4][1]][4])\n```\nAs said in #2, for example if we further iterate in dictionary a year after the birthday then the person should not be considered a member of this year's birthday Checklist:\n\n```python\nbirth = [None] * 100\nbirth[97] = 2015\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 4}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+int(m_list[2][1]*3)+int(m_list[3][1]*2)\n)\n```\n\nI hope the rule is clear:\n\n`create a dictionary `birth` and then implementing habits `helloToContents`. Then check \"are you going to be excluded\" the person by creating counter value `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")`. Display the counter value as `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")` and then iterate what I described in comment in the problem statement and return `ans = str(CASEOF(\"-5..5\"))`\n\n```\nCASEOF(dir())\neach case of size 5\n```\n\nThen return the solution."}
