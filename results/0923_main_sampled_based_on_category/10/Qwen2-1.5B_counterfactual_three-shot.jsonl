Rating Distribution Chart\n------ | ------ | -- | --------\n63-69 | B | D | Steinberg et al.\n70-79, Less than 60% | B+ | C- | Steinberg et al.\n80-89 | A | D+ | Steinberg et al.\n90-99 | A+ | D++ | Steinberg et al.\n100 - 109 | A++ | E | Steinberg et al.\n\nWe can see that the numerical score 74 is within the range of difficulty 70-79. The percentage of the score (74 of 100) falls close to the lower boundary of the B+ range.\n\nComparing this with the final score for Grade \"A\" which is given by the Steinberg et al. chart, we can determine the corresponding letter grade. Since 74 falls largely within the B+ range (between 70 and 79), the letter grade for this numerical score of 74 is B+. Therefore, the appropriate letter grade matching the numerical score 74 is [B+] according to the Common Score, Final Grade, Final Subscore, etc. rating distribution chart.\n\nQuestion: Review the memo and answer the questions provided.\nThe pilots will be ____ (phoneconference) before the flight and then meeting with John at the terminal. The pilot should also be ready to present answers to any questions the JetAdmin asks in both their previous notes and so forth. Please let everyone know that the senior maintainer Dave wanted to speak w/ you about your new plane. Please let everyone know who knows you speak w/ Dave this afternoon following their PM or urgent meeting. Tell uber that anyone who meets with Dave needs to call uber before 9PM this evening to let them know they will be there by 7PM and what their planis.\n\n\nAnswer: Since there are multiple parts of the message to explain this, I'll break it up into the following parts:\n\n1. Pilots will phone-conference before the flight\n2. Picking up John at the terminal\n3. The pilot should also be ready to present answers to any questions the JetAdmin asks\n4. During the phone conference, Dave is available to discuss the new plane\n5. Key contact Dave for everyone to call\n6. Uber's arrival time and everyone will know to call Uber before 9PM\n\nTo determine the appropriate letter grade for the numerical score, we can refer to the standard grading scale available in the table with the provided information. This standard grading scale is often used in substance abuse training programs and education programs.\n\nThe standard grading scale involves segmentation of the substance abuse into six separate classes, each with a specific letter grade associated with it.

During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards. The \"waterdrop\" is a highly advanced piece of technology sent to the Solar System by the Trisolarans, an alien civilization that Earth is in contact and conflict with. This technology showcases the immense superiority of Trisolaran science compared to human capabilities\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the hardest of the following objects?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop##B.Ice##C.Diamond##D.Steel\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the smallest unit of control over matter?

But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n\n### Question:\nIf someone encounters an oviparous creature with a body covered in scales, four legs, and a massive size, it is likely to be one of the following creatures:\nOptions: A.Python##B.Crocodile##C.Dragon##D.Tyrannosaurus Rex\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following locations might have served as a primary residence for the Vikings?\nOptions: A.Greenland, a large island and an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.##B.Glacier Island, where dragons live.##C.The Isle of Berkshire, the hometown of Night Fury.##D.An island belonging to the Barbaric Archipelago.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the development of sustainable energy, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Wind power is currently the predominant source of sustainable energy, occupying a leading position in global energy production.##B.Humans primarily harness bio-kinetic energy for achieving flight.##C.The lightning breath of Thunderdrums is being researched for power generation, becoming a unique form of sustainable energy.##D.Tidal and hydropower are renewable energy sources derived from the movement of water, and they can be effectively utilized through hydroelectric power stations and tidal energy facilities.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich famous Viking leader is known for exploring and settling in new territories?\nOptions: A.Fernão Magellan, the renowned Portuguese explorer, undertook a circumnavigation, pioneering new sea routes.##B.Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the chief of Berk, known for his dragon training skills.##C.Erik the Red, who discovered and settled in Greenland.##D.Stoick the Vast, the father of Hiccup, who played a significant role in Berk's leadership.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nIf someone encounters an oviparous creature with a body covered in scales, four legs, and a massive size, it is likely to be one of the following creatures:\nOptions: A.Python##B.Crocodile##C.Dragon##D.Tyrannosaurus Rex\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following locations might have served as a primary residence for the Vikings?\nOptions: A.Greenland, a large island and an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.##B.Glacier Island, where dragons live.##C.The Isle of Berkshire, the hometown of Night Fury.##D.An island belonging to the Barbaric Archipelago.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the development of sustainable energy, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Wind power is currently the predominant source of sustainable energy, occupying a leading position in global energy production.##B.Humans primarily harness bio-kinetic energy for achieving flight.##C.The闪电的呼吸是被研究为电源的，成为独特的可持续能源形式。##D.潮汐和水电是风和水电从中获得的可再生能源来源，可以通过水力发电站和潮汐电站有效地使用。\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]"}

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm.

Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power.

Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires.

In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety.

Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King. It features icy plains, towering fortresses, and is the setting for the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion.\nPandaria, inspired by East Asian aesthetics, is a serene and beautiful land inhabited by the Pandaren and was introduced in the \"Mists of Pandaria\" expansion.\nThe Alliance, known for its principles of honor and justice, is composed of the Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and the enigmatic Pandaren.

She is unable to cope with the overwhelming fear she faces every day, and often procrastinates on essential tasks. To ease her discomfort, Sarah takes medication on a daily basis, including anxiety medication.\n\nAs the story begins, Sarah seems to be content with her life, excelling in her studies, getting high marks at her college, and working towards a promising career in the tech industry. However, when Sarah receives word that her family is going to retire their land farm, her life drastically changes. She begins to notice recurring nightmares, terrifying visions, and frequent panic attacks. Confronting the reality that her farm future is uncertain, Sarah starts to doubt if these feelings she experiences are just a figment of her imagination or if they actually represent a deeper truth for her.\n\nSarah decides to talk to her therapist about her increasing concerns and discusses how she might be able to manage her anxiety with medication.
