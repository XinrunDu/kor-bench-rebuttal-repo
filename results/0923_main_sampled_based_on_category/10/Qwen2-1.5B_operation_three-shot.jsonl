Now please help me with this custom operation question. I need you to provide me with the predefined operation rule, as well as a question and its answer. I specifically ask you to ensure the answers you output are single numbers enclosed within double square brackets, providing you with [[answer]]. If there are multiple correct answers, please separate them or sort their combinations in ascending order with a comma. Please pay attention to the specifics of the rule given in the previous question and ensure that your final answer is compliant with that rule. Maybe you could also explain the concepts behind the custom operation rule more elaborately to better understand how it works. Well, um well, alright. Okay, we'll do a little exercise on custom operations. Firstly, we have a pretty long rule. It says:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\nSecondly, let's have a look at one of the questions you provided:\n\n### Question:\nCompute 5※25.\n\nNow, as you mentioned, we must determine the predefined operation rule for custom operations first.\n\n### Answer:\nElementary one: a※b = a / b + 2 (a multiple of b, a / b + 2)\nElementary two: a※b = b / a + 2 (b multiple of a, b / a + 2)\nElementary three: a※b = 24 (if a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a).\n\nNow, let's apply the rule to your question:\n\n### Question:\nCompute 5※25.\n\nFirstly, 5 is not a multiple of 25, so applying the third case of the rule, we get 24.\n\nFinally, ensure that your answer is single number and encloses it in double square brackets, like \"[[24]]\".\n\nThis custom operation rule is based on the operation of division with a small difference added.\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a small modification to the rule. When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a / b + C (this applies to the condition when b is a multiple of a as well); when b is a multiple of a, a※b = b / a + C (here we switched the conditions of the multiplication to division); if a is a multiple of b but not b is a multiple of a, a※b = 24, where C is a parameter. Given that: 10 ※ 2 = 9, find C.\n\n### Answer:\n4, just as you already got.\n\nFIRST, quick example with two problems. We have two \"operations\". They can be additions, multiplications,........ we have an operation just as you requested. The concept of division is impossible under our operation rule as it is not possible that a number divided by another number is larger than one.\n\nConsequently, it is impossible for 10 ※ 2 = 9 \n\nBelow, somebody with the result:\n\n\n\nNow, let's try another example with more than one operation:\n\nLet's try dividing by the resulting number. According to this rule, the operation should be performed in reverse:\n\nSame as the example of division by an even number:\n\nBy multiplying those values with the given parameter, we get to 24.\n\nBelow is an example of multiplication of the result with the given parameter:\n\nNow we have the given question:\n\n### Question:\nNow we make a small modification to the rule. When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a / b + C (this applies to the condition when b is a multiple of a as well); when b is a multiple of a, a※b = b / a + C (here we switched the conditions of the multiplication to division); if a is a multiple of b but not b is a multiple of a, a※b = 24, where C is a parameter. Given that: 10 ※ 2 = 9, find C.\n\n### Answer:\n4, just as you already got.\n\nWHAT WE CAN SAY is unity, no division operation.\n\nThese rules are impossible under the existing operation rules. That's why, in fact 10 ◦ 2 = 9 is wrong according to basic rules. If indeed you have found this, it is an improvement in your mathematical ability at mathematical arithmetics.\n\nYou are asking for a detailed and precise explanation of the custom operation rule. This is where, out of the whole set of existing rules, we find the following rule \"Elementary One\":\n\n1. a※b = a b + 2 (a multiple of b, a b + 2)\n2. a※b = b a + 2 (b multiple of a, b a + 2)\n3. a※b = 24 (a multiple of b, but not b is a multiple of a, a b + 2).\n\nGiven that, if 'a' is a multiple of 'b', to check if the result 'a※b equals 24', you need to check yet another condition - which is that the 'b' value should not be a multiple of 'a'.\n\nYour question was based on the rule where 'b' is a multiple of 'a'. It appears that this rule is applicable to the first solution, but the second solution only applies when 'a' is not a multiple of 'b'. So it suggests that you must apply multiple solutions depending on the specific value of 'a' and 'b' in a multiple of (2 - 'a') condition and not multiple values based on the condition 'b ≠ a' in a multiple of (2 - 'b') condition. So, you have to check both rules for the specific sub-cases in the specified problem."}
