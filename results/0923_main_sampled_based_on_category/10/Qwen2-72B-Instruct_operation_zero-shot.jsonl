Let's apply them step by step starting from the fact that 25※5※X=4.\n\nFirst, let's perform the operation 25※5 using the given operation rule:\n\nGiven:\n\n1. When a is a multiple of b, a※b = a/b + 2\n2. When b is a multiple of a, a※b = b/a + 2\n3. If a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24\n\nSince 25 is a multiple of 5, we can apply rule 1:\n\n25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nNow, we have that 7※X = 4. Let's analyze the result 4 and use the operation rule to find X.\n\nCase 1: X is a multiple of 7, according to rule 1:\n7※X = 7/X + 2\nThis case cannot result in X being an integer and satisfies rule 1 since 7/X would have to be a rational number, and only when X = 7 the result can be a positive integer, exactly 3. Not 4.\n\nCase 2: 7 is a multiple of X, according to rule 2:\n7※X = X/7 + 2\nHow this results in 4 depends on X, but it's only true when:\nX/7 + 2 = 4\nX/7 = 2\nX = 14\nThis satisfies rule 2.\n\nCase 3: Neither 7 is a multiple of X nor X is a multiple of 7:\n7※X = 24\nThis does not lead to the required result of 4, so this case doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, X must be 14 to satisfy the operation rules and goal equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[14]]."}
