The user is asked to apply this operation to multiple sets of integer values, and should arrive at the correct numerical result for each. \n\nPart #2: Presenting answers as a single number in double square brackets like [[your answer]]\nUsage: <2,3,4,2> = 14, so the answer should be presented as [[14]]. This format keeps answers organized and consistent, and helps to distinguish between instructive text and actual solutions.\n\nPart #3: Double-checking answers\nUsage: The user should verify that their answer accurately follows the operation rules. For example, <4,3,7,1> = 2*(4)*(3) + 7 - 1 = 30. After initial calculation, the user should double-check their work to make sure 30 is the correct answer.\n\nPart #4: Solving if condition is met\nUsage: <4,X,8,3> = 29 means that 2*(4)*(X) + 8 - 3 = 29. Recalculating, we get 8X + 5 = 29-> 8X = 24 -> X = 3. Therefore, X should be 3, or presented in double square brackets as [[3]].

The Rosetta Stone has played a crucial role in understanding ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and has been the subject of intense scholarly research and study for over 200 years. Its inscription dates back to 196 BC and includes a decree issued by Ptolemy V in three scripts: ancient Greek, demotic script, and Egyptian hieroglyphs."}
