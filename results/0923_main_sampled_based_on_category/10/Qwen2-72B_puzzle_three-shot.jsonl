The name of the game is \"Conversion of Letters\". The rules are quite simple and it's a great game to use when you have a few minutes of free time. \n\nThe game is played with two words. One word is the starting point and the other word is the goal of the game. The objective of the game is to convert the starting word into the end word by changing one letter at a time. The catch is that each intermediate word must be a valid English word.\n\nThe game can be played in a few simple steps. First, you need to think of the starting word and the end word. The starting word is the word that you want to start with, and the end word is the word that you want to end with. For example, let's say we want to convert the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\". \n\nTo play the game, we start with the starting word \"time\". We then change one letter at a time, making sure that each intermediate word is a valid English word. In this case, we could change the \"t\" to a \"p\" to get the word \"pime\". We then change the \"i\" to an \"a\" to get the word \"pame\". Finally, we change the \"e\" to an \"s\" to get the word \"pams\". This completes the game, and we have successfully converted the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\".\n\nThe game is a great way to improve your spelling and critical thinking skills. It can also be a fun way to pass the time. You can play the game with friends and family, or you can play it by yourself. The game is not time-consuming and can be played in a few minutes.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Conversion of Letters\" game is a fun and challenging puzzle game that can help improve your spelling and critical thinking skills. It's a great way to pass the time and can be played by people of all ages. So, why not give it a try and see if you can convert the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\" in as few steps as possible? Good luck!"}
