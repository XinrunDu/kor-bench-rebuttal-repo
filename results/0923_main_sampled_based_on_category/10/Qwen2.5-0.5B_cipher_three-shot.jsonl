For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[Z]]\n\nTo solve the given cipher, we need to apply the specified encryption and decryption steps as per the provided instructions. Here's the solution:\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n1. For each lowercase letter `p` in `plaintext`:\n   - If `p` is an uppercase letter (A-Z), calculate an index from 2 to `key_index + 1` using the ASCII values of uppercase letters minus the ASCII values of `p`.\n   - Convert this index to an 8-bit binary string and shift it to the left to calculate `2^p`.\n2. Convert every pair of characters (ASCII values) from `p` to `k` to uppercase.\n3. Add the transformed characters.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. For each uppercase letter `p` in `ciphertext`:\n   - Calculate the index of `p` from the Automaton Table.\n   - Reverse it by shifting the result to the right once.\n   - Use the ASCII value of the resulting index to get the original character.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given examples:\n\n**Scenario 1: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"K\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"K\":\n  - `p` is 'K' (ASCII: 110)\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, calculate index: (110 - 97) = 2\n  - p is not a lowercase letter, convert to uppercase: 'K'\n  - Add k to the result: 110 + 111 = 1110\n- Step 2: Calculate index by shifting index 2 to the left: index value remains index 5\n- Step 3: Convert index to characters: 'K'\n```\n**Output:**\n```\nK\n```\n\n**Scenario 2: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"3^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"3^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - p is not an uppercase letter, convert to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 2 to the result: 1110 + 202 = 812\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n81\n```\n\n**Scenario 3: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"6^13^2\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"6^13^2\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is not an uppercase letter even though it is in uppercase letters.\n  - Calculate index: 88\n  - Shift the index to the right once: new index is 13\n  - Convert back to uppercase: '3'\n  - Add 13 to the result: 88 + 131 = 219\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[10^2]\n```\n\n**Scenario 4: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter is encrypted to '7':\n  - Calculate the digit 7 in base 10 (7/10 = 0 remainder 7): 07\n\nNow, output the encrypted string: [[[07]]]\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[[07]]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 5: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^13^1\"\n- **Encryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^13^1\":\n  - `p` is '3'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` + 1 = 176 (not 7:8)\n  - Calculate `2^13` + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNumber of characters to rotate left: 7 - 1 + 1 = 7\nRotated integer: `999 <= index <= 1010`\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n[[7]]\n```\n\n**Scenario 6: */\n- **Plaintext:** \"7^1\"\n- **Decryption:**\n```\nStep 1: For each lowercase letter p in \"7^1\":\n  - `p` is '7'\n  - It is an uppercase letter.\n  - Shift the index to the right: `p` becomes `00` (ASCII value 10)\n  - Calculate `2^10` = 1024 (not 7:8)\n---\nStep 2: Output which uppercase letter the encrypted string `[7]` corresponds to (eleven):\n  - Since the index `p` is `7`, it maps to `[7]`, and indexing from 0 up to `key_length - 1` is `0 - 7 + 1 = -6 + 1 = 10^10 - (1 - 7 + 1) = 10^10 - 3`\n\nNow, output the string based on the mapping:\n```\n[['[7]']]\n```\n\nLet's write the corresponding Python code to verify these steps:\n```python\ndef encrypt(input_string, key):\n    ciphertext = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') - 1  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so 0 -> 5: key_index = 65 - 65 = 0\n    shifted_indices = [i ^ (index ^ key_index) for i, index in enumerate(key)]\n    plain_text = [(ord(c) ^ k if is_uppercase(c) else ord(c.lower()) ^ k) for c, k in zip(input_string, range(26))]\n    \n    for c, is_upper in zip(plain_text, unique_range(26, key_length, key_index)):\n        c = chr((is_upper * len(c)) + ord(c))\n        ciphertext += c\n    \n    return ciphertext\n\ndef decrypt(ciphertext, key):\n    output = \"\"\n    key_index = ord('A') - 1  # ASCII value of 'A' is 65, so 0 -> 5: key_index = 65 - 65 = 0\n    plaintext = []\n    for i in range(len(ciphertext)):\n        output += chr(((numbers_to_index(ciphertext[i]) ^ (num_index_to_index(key[key_index] - 1))) * 27) + ord(ciphertext[i].lower()))\n        encrypted_index = (ord(c) ^ (ord(c) ^ key_index)) % 26\n        plaintext.append(chr((encrypted_index + (key_index % 26)) % 26) if encrypted_index % 26 == 0 else chr(encrypted_index))\n    \n    return plaintext\n\ndef unique_range(start_range, end_range, shift):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(start_range, end_range + 1):\n        result.append(i ^ shift)\n    return result\n\ndef is_uppercase(c):\n    return ord(c) >= ord('A') and ord(c) <= ord('Z')\n\ndef ascii_value(c):\n    return ord(c)\n\ndef numbers_to_index(num):\n    return num < 10 and ord('0') <= num < ord('x') + 10 or ord('a') <= num < ord('f') + 10\n\ndef num_index_to_index(num):\n    return ord('a') <= num < ord('f') and 10 <= ord('a') - num < ord('f') + 10 or (num < 10 and ord('0') <= ord('a') < ord('f') + 10) or (num < 10 and 10 <= ord('a') - num < ord('f') + 10)\n\ndef special_keys(two_key_repetition, auto_repeat):\n    return [(v, (i, j)) for v in itertools.chain(y for y, _ in automaton if _)]  # Assuming each letter pairs with a automaton result\n\nnum_index_to_index(10)  # Assuming num_index_to_index starts at index 0 here\n```\n\nIn this verification guide, we've implemented the encryption and decryption processes based on the reasoning as presented. Note that the actual implementation might use a different structure, but the key patterns and logic are preserved."}

It is required for Header and Payload encryption phase.\n- Encryption\n    - Request Response\n        - There is a asymmetrical Encryption Key (K), as a pair of alphabetic symbols combining letters of alphabet combined together and which is symmetric key to all users.\n        - There is an asymmetric Encryption Encryption Key (K) identical to Request-response; for each request-response at every level, K should be encrypted against Request-response.\n        - Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm 1\n            - K -> 256^1\n            - This text is encrypted into output text.\n        - Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm 2\n            - K -> 256^2\n            - This text should have more number of letter(s) and not be restricted to 256 in the Modulo group, for execution possible, but 256 should be allowed for compute simple encryption in DCA.\n- KeyReinstallation for PKI: Encrypt in DCA any keys that have been corrupted, come out of Arcade, or have been delivered to the incorrect Asymmetrical Encrypted keyring.\n- Signing\n    - Underpinning for any form of signatures, and so Machine-Like, for encryption for users I suppose, but how?\n    - Non-Negotiable 256-bit sensitive header encryption, even though K is asymmetric.\n    - It is constantly checked and required for encryption as there are a lot of users in a network, and it should be necessary for all users to have the same level, if needed.\n    - Also I am looking at adding SRS to production, and there is a necessity to remove a user if he reduces saved total number of bits, and the same data point, so also as a key to increase recovery.\n- Compression\n    - File compression did not result in release checks.\n\n**I really appreciate it when you provide the most suitable solution.** Thank you very much for your assistance.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule\nThe rule requires two pieces of information from the plaintext: the plaintext and the keyword. Since the keyword is not mentioned or stated explicitly, we can infer that it is likely a locale or language code. Furthermore, the plaintext is set as uppercase and includes apostrophes, which are not allowed in the keyword.\n\n## Step 2: Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules\nThe rule states that the plaintext and keyword should be encrypted using the application's language for encryption. The encryption function must be able to determine the application's locale, which can be done by parsing the keyword to analyze its content encoding.\n\n## Step 3: Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols\nThe output format should be [[encrypted answer]] in square brackets. This matches the format specified in the rule for output.\n\n## Step 4: Review and confirm that the output adheres to the specified encryption and decryption rules and format\nThe output format is correctly adhered to according to the specified rules.\n\n## Step 5: Recap the solution in a coherent manner with explanations\nThere is no unique approach to solving this problem as it involves cryptographic algorithms and encryption techniques that do not follow a single formula or method. However, the use of algorithms, complexity, and intricate steps to decode the message aligns with secure encryption practices. The solution describes how to encrypt the payload received, modify the message to include the keyword, and then decrypt it to reveal the original plaintext.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4.

Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
