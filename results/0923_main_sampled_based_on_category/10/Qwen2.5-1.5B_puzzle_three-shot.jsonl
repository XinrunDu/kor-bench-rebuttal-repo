The start word is \"LOST\".\n2. The end word is \"HERE\".\n3. We need to find the minimum number of steps required to change from \"LOST\" to \"HERE\" while changing only one letter at a time and ensuring all intermediate steps are valid words.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\n- From \"LOST\" to \"LOSE\" (1 step)\n- From \"LOSE\" to \"HOSE\" (1 step)\n- From \"HOSE\" to \"HESE\" (1 step)\n- From \"HESE\" to \"HUSE\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUSE\" to \"HUSK\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUSK\" to \"HUSR\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUSR\" to \"HUES\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUES\" to \"HUES\" (1 step)\n\nAt this point, we realize that \"HUSK\" is not a valid word based on our definition that only contains one letter changed. Since \"HUSK\" is not a valid word, we need to back-track:\n\n- From \"HAUS\" to \"HAES\" (1 step)\n- From \"HAES\" to \"HAE\" (1 step)\n- From \"HAE\" to \"HUE\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUE\" to \"HUS\" (1 step)\n- From \"HUS\" to \"HES\" (1 step)\n- From \"HES\" to \"HEH\" (1 step)\n- From \"HEH\" to \"HEA\" (1 step)\n- From \"HEA\" to \"HERE\" (1 step)\n\nThis sequence is valid and shows that we can change \"LOST\" to \"HERE\" in four steps by changing one letter each time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[[4]]"}
