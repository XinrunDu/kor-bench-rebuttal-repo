This is because no matter what values p1, p2, and p3 are assigned (true or false), the formula always evaluates to true. If p1 is false, then the formula is true since the antecedent (p1) is false, and if p1 is true, then (p1||p2||p3) will also be true (since 'or' connects true to the other values).\n\n(2) The formula (p1=::>~p1)=::>~p2 is also a Truth Formula. The inner proposition \"p1=::>~p1\" can never be false, as it is logically equivalent to saying \"if p1, then not p1,\" which is false only when p1 is true and ~p1 is false, making the implication true otherwise. So, the formula (p1=::>~p1) can only be true or false depending on the value of p1. In all such scenarios, ~p2 cannot make the entire formula false. Thus, this compound formula will always be true.\n\nSo, the final answer as requested: [[A];[A]]."}

This actually ties directly into the description for the \u26ad relationship, where pairs such as Fp and F\u00acp are described as: \"They cannot both be false, but can both be true.\"\n\nGiven that \u00acFp and F\u00acp effectively represent the negations or inverses of each other being true or false, this aligns with the \u26ad relationship: if \u00acFp is true (meaning Fp is false), F\u00acp must be true.

The initial statement \"Some students are doctors\" can be represented as \u2203x (Student(x) \u2227 Doctor(x)). The erroneous inference \"Therefore, some students are not doctors\" can be represented as \u2203x (Student(x) \u2227 \u00acDoctor(x)), which is not logically deducible from the initial statement. Hence, this is an incorrect inference related to existential quantifiers."}
