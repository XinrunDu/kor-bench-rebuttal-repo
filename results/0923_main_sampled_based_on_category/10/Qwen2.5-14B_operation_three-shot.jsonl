There are also other answers.  \n3. Write a function GetY that starts with N, D, and Set, and then returns Y\n4.

Hence, there is no real value of b for which (b^2 - 0)/2 = b. That means the equation is always false for all nonzero values of b.

If the energy consumption varies sinusoidally with time, reaching its maximum at 6 kilowatts and minimum at 3 kilowatts, find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner.\n\nTo find the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, we first need to understand the formula for the average of a sinusoidal function. The function is given as f(t) = Asin(ωt), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and t is time. However, the function provided is not directly in the form of a sine wave. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the extreme values of the function, which are 6 kW and 3 kW. Hence, the amplitude A of the sinusoidal function can be:\n\nA = (max - min) / 2\nA = (6 - 3) / 2\nA = 3 / 2\n\nTherefore, the function becomes:\n\nf(t) = 3/2 * sin(ωt)\n\nNow, let us determine the average energy consumption of this sinusoidal function over the eight-hour period. The average value of a function f(t) over an interval [a, b] can be determined by integrating the function over this interval and then dividing by the length of the interval.\n\nThe total energy consumed in eight hours is 6 kW, which translates to:\n\nE = ∫0^8 kf(t) dt = 6 kWh\n\nIn order to find the average energy consumption, we will calculate the integral of the function f(t) over the interval [0, 8] and divide by the interval's length, which is 8 hours.\n\nHowever, finding the integral of a sinusoidal function can be tricky without specific information about the time period of the function. If the sinusoidal function's time period is unknown, we can consider the most basic scenario where the function completes one cycle over the interval [0, 8]. In this case, the average energy consumption will be the average of the function's maximum and minimum values, which is:\n\naverage = (max + min) / 2\naverage = (6 + 3) / 2\naverage = 9 / 2\naverage = 4.5 kW\n\nTherefore, the average energy consumption of the air conditioner, considering it will be 4.5 kW if the function's time period is equal to the interval [0, 8].\n\nThe ball's height in feet above the ground is given by the expression y=-2x2+4x+18, where x is the horizontal distance in feet from where it was thrown. When the ball touches the ground, the horizontal measurement from where it was thrown is [[the_answer]].\n\nThe parabola is only touching the ground at the vertex x=-b/2a, which is x=-4/2(-2)=1.\nThe answer is: 1"}
