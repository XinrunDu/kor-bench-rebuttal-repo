For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\" according to the given cipher rules, we follow the steps directly despite the plaintext being shorter than the typical block size (5 characters):\n\n1. Identify the `grid_index` using the formula: `grid_index = (i // 5) % 8`. Since there is only one character and the formula expects longer messages, we treat it as if the first block (i = 0) is used.\n\n2. For i = 0, the `grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0`, which directs us to use Grid0.\n\n3. Locate the character \"G\" in Grid0. Here's the reference Grid0:\n    \n    | P | H | I | L | S |\n    | A | B | C | D | E |\n    | F | G | K | M | N |\n    | O | Q | R | T | U |\n    | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n    \n4. The position of \"G\" is found at row 2, col 1 (index starts at 0). To encrypt \"G\", we move one grid position to the lower right, reaching row 3, col 2, which is \"R\".\n\nTherefore, the encryption of \"G\" results in \"R\".\n\nEncapsulated encrypted answer: [[R]]"}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up.

M\n2. C\n3. C\n4. V\n5. E\n\nNow, fill them into five rows according to how they are separated:\n1. M\n2. C\n3. C\n4. V\n5. E\n\nNext, according to the decryption rule, the letters should be read alternately starting with reading downwards first, then upwards, and so on. Since there's only one letter in each line, the pattern of reading will follow the order given in the lines:\n1. Start reading downwards, which covers all but the last line.\n2. Then, read upwards, which will be the last entered letter \"E\".\n\nThus, reading the letters from the grid alternately would give \"MCCEV\". There are no \"#\" symbols to remove here, as they were not present in this pattern.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is:\n[[MCCEV]]"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the given ciphertext \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\" with the specified rules, we will follow the decryption steps as outlined.\n\nFirst, the ciphertext divided into blocks of 16 letters (if not enough, it is one block by itself):\n- One block: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\"\n\nSince the ciphertext is less than 16 letters, we need to fill it with \"#\" to make it a 16-letter block: \"#YO##FWF###VT##L####\"\n\nNow, let's place these letters in a 4x4 grid row by row:\n\n```\n[\n['#', 'Y', 'O', '#'],\n['#', 'F', 'W', 'F'],\n['#', '#', 'V', 'T'],\n['#', '#', 'L', '#']\n]\n```\n\nNext, with the template (4 holes) on this grid, we will read the letters visible through the holes and rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise each time we read a letter until we have read all letters visible through the holes:\n\n1. First position (no rotation yet):\n\n```\n[\n['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', 'Y', 'O'],\n['', '', '', '#'],\n['', '#', '#', '#']\n]\n```\nLetters visible: Y, O\n\n2. Rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees:\n```\n[\n['', '', 'O', '#'],\n['', '', '#', '#'],\n['', '', '#', '#'],\n['', 'Y', '#', '#']\n]\n```\nLetters visible: O, Y\n\n3. Rotate the template counterclockwise another 90 degrees:\n```\n[\n['', '', '#', '#'],\n['', '#', '#', '#'],\n['O', '#', '#', 'Y'],\n['', '#', '#', '#']\n]\n```\nLetters visible: #, # (These are not part of the original message, ignore them)\n\n4. Final rotation:\n```\n[\n['#', '#', '', '#'],\n['O', '#', '', '#'],\n['#', '#', '', 'Y'],\n['', '', '', '#']\n]\n```\nLetters visible: O, Y (again, ignore the fillers)\n\nTherefore, the deciphered message is \"YOYO\" followed by filler letters meant to be ignored. Since this is the complete deciphering of the given block, we interpret the meaningful deciphered part only:\n\n[[YOYO]]"}

The key in hexadecimal form is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. We only need the first two bytes to XOR with the ASCII values of \"UH\" since there are only two characters.\n\nThe first two bytes are '73' and 'ef'.\n\nNow, we XOR the ASCII values with these key bytes:\n- XOR of 85 (U) with 73: 85 ^ 73 = 16 (0x10 in hex)\n- XOR of 72 (H) with ef: 72 ^ ef = 235 (0xeb in hex)\n\nThus, the hexadecimal string for the ciphertext is 10eb (in lowercase).\n\nThe encrypted ciphertext, formatted as requested, is: [[10eb]]."}
