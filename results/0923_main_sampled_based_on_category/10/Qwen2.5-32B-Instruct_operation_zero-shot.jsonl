Evaluate 25※5\n- Since 25 is a multiple of 5 (25=5*5), apply the rule a※b = a/b + 2.\n- So, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\n2. Next, use the result to solve for X in 7※X=4\n- According to the operation rules, if 7※X=4, we need to consider the three cases:\n  - If 7 is a multiple of X, 7※X = 7/X + 2. For this to equal 4, we get 7/X + 2 = 4 → 7/X = 2 → X = 7/2. Since X must be an integer, this case is not applicable.\n  - If X is a multiple of 7, 7※X = X/7 + 2. For this to equal 4, we get X/7 + 2 = 4 → X/7 = 2 → X = 14. This gives an integer solution, so X=14 is a possible value.\n  - If 7 is not a multiple of X and X is not a multiple of 7, 7※X = 24.
