The only way to satisfy this is if:\n\\[ 8※Y = 3 \\]\nFor \\( Y \\) to satisfy this, it must be such that:\n\\[ \\frac{a}{Y} + 2 = 3 \\]\nThis gives:\n\\[ \\frac{a}{Y} = 1 \\]\n\\[ a = Y \\]\nThis implies \\( Y = 8 \\). Therefore, \\( X※13 = 8 \\).\n\nFor \\( X※13 = 8 \\):\n- \\( X = \\frac{8}{13} + 2 \\)\n- This can only be valid if \\( X = 8 \\), as \\( 8 \\) is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of 8.\n\nThus, the correct value is:\n\\[ X = 8 \\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\\[ [[8]] \\]"}
