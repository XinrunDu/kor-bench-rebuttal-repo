Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the blank spaces in the grid such that the sum of the numbers in each row and column matches the intended sums provided. We will start by analyzing the given sums and filling the grid step by step.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Sums\n\n1. **Row Sums:**\n   - Row 1: X X X X 49\n   - Row 2: X X X X 23\n   - Row 3: X X X X 34\n   - Row 4: X X X X 30\n   - Row 5: 40 52 10 34 X (Sum = 136)\n\n2. **Column Sums:**\n   - Column 1: 40 X X X X (Sum = 136 - (52 + 10 + 34 + X))\n   - Column 2: 52 X X X X (Sum = 136 - (X + X + X + 34))\n   - Column 3: 10 X X X X (Sum = 136 - (X + X + X + 49))\n   - Column 4: 34 X X X X (Sum = 136 - (X + X + X + 23))\n   - Column 5: 49 23 34 30 (Sum = 136)\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Identify and fill numbers in the 5th row.**\n- The sum of the 5th row is 40 + 52 + 10 + 34 + X = 136.\n- Solving for X, 136 - 136 = X, so X = 0.\n\nSo, the 5th row is: 40 52 10 34 0.\n\n**Step 2: Use row and column sums to fill the rest.**\n- For the 1st row, the sum must be 49. Let's denote the numbers in the first row (excluding the last column) as A, B, C, D.\n  - A + B + C + D = 49.\n- The contributions to the column sums from the 1st row will be used to narrow down the possible numbers in the rest of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Continue filling based on row and column constraints.**\n- For the 2nd row, the sum must be 23. Let's denote the numbers in the 2nd row (excluding the last column) as E, F, G, H.\n  - E + F + G + H = 23.\n- For the 3rd row, the sum must be 34. Let's denote the numbers in the 3rd row (excluding the last column) as I, J, K, L.\n  - I + J + K + L = 34.\n- For the 4th row, the sum must be 30. Let's denote the numbers in the 4th row (excluding the last column) as M, N, O, P.\n  - M + N + O + P = 30.\n\nAfter filling all the required numbers by matching the sums, the full grid looks like this:\n```\n19  6  3  21  49\n11  9  3  10  23\n22  6  1  11  34\n16  10 7  7  30\n40  52 10 34  0\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, we need to extract the numbers from the grid and present them in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: [[19 6 3 21 49 11 9 3 10 23 22 6 1 11 34 16 10 7 7 30 40 52 10 34 0]]"}

Since the 4 is at the top of the column, the 3 must be in the 5th row (visible from below) and the 2 will be in the 1st row (visible from right).\n   - The 2 at the bottom of the column means the 3 must be in the 4th row, so it is clear the order is 3, 4.\n\n4. **Second Row (From the bottom):**\n   - The 1 means there is only one visible sky scraper in the second row. Since the column can only show 1-4 in order and 1 is at the right, it must be that only the 3 is visible. So, the 3 in the 4th row (visible from bottom) forces 4 to be in 2nd row (visible from right).\n\n5. **First Row (From the bottom):**\n   - The 1 and 4 must be correctly filled, since the 4 is the tallest. The 2 is placed next, and the third is continuously filled.\n\n6. **Filling in details:**\n   - The first row can be determined as 1, 4, 3, 2, 1 to fit the clues.\n   - Continuing this to fit all the numbers in a correct logical order.\n\n### Final Correct Filling (top to bottom, left to right):\n```\n1 4 3 2 1\n4 4 3 2 1 1\n3 3 2 1 4 2\n2 2 1 4 3 3\n1 1 4 3 2 4\n5 5 4 3 2 1\n```\n\nSo, the solution when flattened and formatted in the required manner is:\n```\n[[1 4 3 2 1 1 1] [4 4 3 2 1 1 1] [3 3 2 1 4 2 2] [2 2 1 4 3 3 3]]\n```"}
