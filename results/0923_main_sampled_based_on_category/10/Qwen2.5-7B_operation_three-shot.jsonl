Let's clarify the solution using the correct interpretation of the given operations. We need to find the value of Y such that (4★3)◇Y=18+(x=(17/1)^2). \n\nFirst, compute 4★3:\n4★3 = √4 + 3^2 = 2 + 9 = 11\n\nNow, we need to find Y such that 11◇Y=18+(x=(17/1)^2). Knowing that 17/1=17, we have 18+(17)=35.\nNext, use the ◇ operation to solve for Y:\n11◇Y = √11 × Y = 35\n\nApply the second operation:\n√11 × Y = 35\nY = 35 / √11\n\nSo, the answer remains as Y = 35 / √11.\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[35/√11]]"}
