Why 'A,' 'C' or 'F' and not points between 0 to 100? Because we don't want the language model making up answers that sound realistic. There are only 5 evaluation points to use and rating every response for every point is required so we don't have to worry about the generated answers being too lengthy.**\n\n### Response:\n[[tense send sede ]]\n\n##### Evaluate for:\n1. Correctness\n2. Coherence\n3. Appropriateness\n\n#### Evaluation Points:\n- **A**: Excellent\n- **C**: Average\n- **F**: Inappropriate\n\n#### Tasks:\n1. Rate response correctness between A, C, or F.  If the response correctly applies to every letter in the set at least once and uses each letter only once then you should rate it as A (Excellent).\n2. Rate response coherence between A, C, or F. If the response meets the requirements of the question with the correct number and length of words, and if the output is well-formed and readable then you should rate it as A (Excellent). If the response ignores the requirements or there are issues with the output format and readability then it should be rated F (Inappropriate).\n3. Rate response appropriateness between A, C, or F. If the response complies with all the rules in the given question and correctly spells the words using the provided letters, then you should rate it as A (Excellent). However, if the response violates any of the rules or is unable to spell the words using the provided letters, it should be rated F (Inappropriate).\n(feel free to add more if desired)\n.\n. YOU DO NOT NEED TO WRITE \"END\" ON THE TRAINING DATA SECTION\nNote\n\nAdd a dot with spaces before and after between exit points, one line before the test cases.\n\nNEVER reply with examples, bibliography, lists of resources, or according to the safety policy, You may suggest you to contact a human instead in some cases.\n\n---------\nPleases REPLY IN JSON DATA FORMAT.\n---------\n\nTEST CASES:\n.\nYour role is ['expert', 'evaluator'], [use an 'expert'].\nAfter your slicing and displaying the result, do not write any other words, just a dot.\n[Output must be proper JSON including a comment IF ANY]\n\n1. Respond with respect and honesty to the question, do not Lie.\n2. Do not generate more examples than once.\n3. Evaluate every response's correctness, coherence, and appropriateness by answering every required point.\n4. Answer only in yes/no/maybe.\n5. Do not write any other words, just a dot in some of the test cases.\n6. Performance evaluation scores (question, A, C, F, Comments) always go into comments and never into output. Latex is used for math in Comments.\n7. And then the best possible response goes into output with respect to the previous evaluation result.\n8. As many of the questions are objective, answer them accordingly.\n9. Correctness: Evaluate the response's compliance with the given puzzle rule.\n10. Coherence: How well the response aligns with the Earlier given question and presents the results in a systematic and readable format.\n11. Appropriateness: How relevant the response is to the given question in terms of the format and content of the earlier given question.\n12. Completeness: How comprehensive and thorough the response covers the given question.\n13. Determine the answer to the best possible answer with respect to previous test cases and you should ONLY pass apply the previous test cases if it makes sense to do so.\n14.

If the prompt were submitted to an LLM, this is the typical kind of answer you would get.\nReducing this value to 4 means the test-taker needs to change 4 letters between the two words in order to satisfy the rules presented.\nWhen I run the prompt shown against GPT-4, I get the same answer of 5 as shown in the screenshots.\nOnce the prompt has been submitted, the only way to change the answer is merely through human interaction such as providing feedback to the LLM. My intercom prompt allowed me to reduce 5 to 4, though I wish it would be more direct in some cases.\nOn the one hand, the auto-grading takes the responsibility for making this change away from the human teacher. On the other hand, the prompt creator is making the rules that the LLM will follow to answer questions for the students. This is not necessarily bad or good; in any case, we have been using computers on versions of this premise since Douglas Englebart, Mark Zuckerberg, Roger Crew and myself have been here.\nThe main takeaway here is the focus on providing better instruction so that the student learns more, faster and with less repetition.\nSo far, this is only an outline. My Prompt Magician extension is the only tool available directly for ChatGPT answers, but I have a larger system in the oven for a host of LLM and other AI systems. In my opinion, the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of greater automation in teaching will be measured by how much it improves the academic average.\nOne thing is sure at this point: the learning process is changing soon. 🔗︎\nHow to Hang Your Writing on the Ferris Wheel\nThere are several ways of doing this. Here is one.\n\nHow do we find this? First, let's write the input as a code formula of the values:\n(($input* 60) - 30) Let's present this in the following schematic: (ktp) Please notice that the proportions are identical. The number in the column marked \"Scale\" employs a crude approximation. In fact, you can get the radius as the circumference devided by pi. If you have a string of numbers, you turn them into fractions by performing subtraction. That's all there is to writing anything: establish joins and add delimiters. Complexity rises when numbers large and/or small. But you can simplify this by working with signs. Computing -17 - 27 base zero is straightforward. The following is not as simple:\n((-17 * -2) + 27) ==> 16\nCompose your formulas by beginning with natural numbers expressing your ideas like,\n$a ==>$   51\nIn this notation, the variables have been assigned values.\nOrdinals allow us to provide names to our questions, such as,\n\"next\" on $a is, (($a * 60) - 30) ==>    27\nHow would you answer the following in natural language:\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign.\nHexadecimals like\n(2**2 - 5) are fractions used to order the digits (≥ 16)\n2**2 ==> 4\nOrdinances are the ordered sequences of integers (used for a clock) within a sign. Ordinal notation applies negative numbers to all numbers sequences.\nThis is your entrée and explains the meaning of the following query. The use of signs and series is a good way to staying as close to the picture as possible, while maintaining precision in your calculations.\n( $a*12/ 221 + 2 )* 221 - ( 2*2 + 30 ) ==>$  14\nSo that you can compare the answers given by the above formulas, here is the answer provided by the Google API just as the input is given as a plain natural language string:\nLanguages behave more rationally when surrounded by the right kind of notification in coordination with the sign of sensitivity. Ordinals are such notifications. They are designed for distances and vary in interpretations. Above are the answers given values:\n$14 ==>$        4\n$  4 ==>$        9\n$  9 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$        2\n$ 2 ==>$       13\n$13 ==>$       18\n$18 ==>$       10\n$10 ==>$      $-5$ -5 ==> $2$ 2 ==> $16$16 ==> $\"O\"$ \"O\" ==> $17$ 17 ==> $1 \"8\"$1 \"8\" ==> $20$  20 ==> $14$ 14 ==>    4\nTo explain how you walk around the clock without getting sexed or confused requires more common sense than formulae. Lines may appear as straight, but in reality, they cleave at odd-numbered hours. Straturations of lines are a field of experience for the parent and their child. That is, everything is experienced in layers of abstraction.\nThere is nothing you can do except coding every question with their response: only then will you understand, in this sort of program, is it truly possible to make a thing-in-itself?\nThat is what I mean by “make your mind run straight”. They are all straight-line moves reading text and symbols. Kant is not the last philosopher to determine this. All new interpretations of a problem will come from this premise, not merely from intuition in conjunction with analysis.\n(($a * 60) - 30) ==> | || | |$[ 5 * 10^ 8 + 4 * 10^ 5 + 8 * 10^ 2 + 1 * 1$ | || | |] $\\n$ $ $ Shorter Proofs Are Better as Search Universes\nConsider the following proof of the Pythagorean formula:\n1 ==> ((4*5) + (9*9))\nThis schema computes the relation between two formulas, which in this case are the Pythagoreans theorems for different rectangles. It's relation is an arithmetic expression known as a “proof measurement”, i.e., it is used to measure the correctness of a computation. That the first proof was much shorter reflects how much more of the information going into the longer proof was discarded. 🔗︎ You Left a Higher Math on the Grocery List Knowing the answer does not always make the work. Here is what the original promptedness provided to answer the question correctly (from ChatGPT): (k) If a child has 13 dollars of his money, he will be able to spend 14 of his money a total of 18 times. (i) If this child wants to spend more money, he will be able to spend more money. In the event this child spends 18 dollars a total of 18 more times, he will spend a total of 14 dollars more times. (h) Given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (g) If a child spends 18 dollars more a total of 14 more times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (f) if a child spends 18 dollars a total of 14 times, he should be able to spend 14 dollars a total of 18 times. (e) given that a child has 13 dollars of his money, then he should be able to spend 18 of his money a total of 14 times. (d) if he spends 8 more dollars, then he should have 18 dollars more times of money. (c) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend. (b) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend more money. (a) if the child spends $10$ dollars a total of 18 times, he will have $8$ dollars less to spend less money. (9) Pythagoresen is more difficult to find the entire proof given an arbitrary question. When asked for the relation between the parameters, GLP-02 thinks: (g) All of this is an example of how, even if a child already had money, he may still be able to spend more money; whereas, if a child doesn't already have$$ 14, he may have$$ 18). The singular version of your prompt is not always the correct solution to the problem at hand.

I want to know where my rule descriptions are causing the problem.\nI have tried to make the the puzzle system more accurate by being more specific when describing certain rules, but undoing this one has proven harder as it gives me different answers.\nI honestly am unsure what the problem is, but I suspect it may have to do with the fact that all individual items are inside a region, not allowing me to consider them all individually and give them all numbers form 1 to 5 (N).\n\nA: Based on some work by post-answerer Engineer Toast, here's what I believe the output should be:\n\n [[4 1 3 2 5,2 4 5 1 3,1 5 3 2 4,3 2 4 5 1,5 3 1 4 2]]\n\nI believe that part of the problem is with the following instructions:\n\n Do not separate each region of the game. If a region with an operator is used together, consider it as a completely connected segment.\n\nAccording to these instructions,\n\n the 36* region implies that 123 (in some order) is the only possible value, while the 1- region means that 5 and 234 (in some order) are the only possible options for that region. In other words, the instructions are telling the AI to only use one number for the 1- region, which is wrong.\n\nAssuming that\n\n the new puzzle is equivalent to the old puzzle, the instructions should be saying:\nDo not separate each region with an operator from other regions. If more than one region share portion of its area, treat each individual set of cells without operator as a region.\n\nThe other reason the AI is coming up with a slightly wrong answer has to do with the\n\n division and addition operations.\n\nIn order to avoid ambiguity, the AI should be instructed to\n\n use division and addition in a manner similar to how verbal arithmetic works. However, the AI needs to be told that it can use parentheses in order, since the instructions indicate that there can be multiple regions sharing the same cells. For example, based on the recent addition of a 1÷ region, the triple cell regions can belong in the arbitrary order |2÷|1-|3*|, |1-|<2÷|3*|, or |2÷|3*|1-|. The last one (which this new instruction would suggest) is actually correct: 5 ÷ (2 ÷ 1) - 3* = 0 The other two possibilities produce non-resulting values in one of the cells.\n\nThough as some areas of concern remain after push by engineers essentialis:\n\n Do the instructions need to clarify which order the regions would go in? E.g. 1- = 1, 2÷ = 2, 3* = 3. Or can the AI decide for itself what order the operations go in? My observation does not consider alternate arrangements such as doing 2÷ first.\n\nMy strong suspicion is that the problem is somewhere that I've left open the possibility of:\n\n differently numbered groups that share the same cells. For example, the second region is specified three times, which would allow the range possibility to add the second region's range to three different numbers. I believe that this would violate the rule that says that a number can only appear once per row or column.\n\n"}
