After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace.
