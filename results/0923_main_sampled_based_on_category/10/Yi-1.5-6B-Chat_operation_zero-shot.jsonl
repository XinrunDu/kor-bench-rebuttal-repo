According to the operation rule, if 13 is a multiple of X, or X is a multiple of 13, we use the formula X/13 + 2. If neither is true, we use the formula 24.\n\nNow, let's apply the operation to the given expression:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nWe know that 28 is a multiple of 4, so we can simplify the expression to:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ (X/13 + 2) = 3\n\nNow, we apply the division operation:\n\n(X/13 + 2) = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nSolve for X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / (19 * 28)) - 2\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by 13 to solve for X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / (19 * 28)) - 2)\n\nLet's calculate the value of X:\n\nX = 13 * ((3 / 532) - 2)\nX = 13 * (3/532 - 1064/532)\nX = 13 * (3 - 1064) / 532\nX = 13 * (-1061) / 532\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for integer values for X, and the result we got is not an integer, it seems there was a mistake in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\nX = -1061 * 13 / 532\n\nCalculate the value of X:\n\nX = -13793 / 532\n\nSince we are looking for an integer value for X, and the result we got is not an integer, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's correct the approach:\n\nWe have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / (19 * 28)\n\nFirst, calculate the right side of the equation:\n\n3 / (19 * 28) = 3 / 532\n\nNow we have:\n\nX/13 + 2 = 3 / 532\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides to isolate X/13:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - 2\n\nWe need to express 2 as a fraction with the same denominator as 3/532, which is 532. So, 2 is equivalent to 1064/532. Now we have:\n\nX/13 = (3 / 532) - (1064 / 532)\n\nSubtract the fractions:\n\nX/13 = (3 - 1064) / 532\nX/13 = -1061 / 532\n\nNow, to solve for X, we multiply both sides by 13:\n\nX = -1061 / 532 * 13\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it seems there was a mistake in the initial interpretation of the operation rule for the case when neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a. According to the rule, in such cases, a※b = 24. This means that for the expression 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) to equal 3, the intermediate result (X※13) must be such that when it is multiplied by the other numbers, the final result is 3.\n\nGiven that the rule for non-multiple cases is to use 24, let's reconsider the equation:\n\n19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nSince 28 is a multiple of 4, the first three terms simplify to:\n\n24 ※ (X※13) = 3\n\nNow, we need to find X such that:\n\n(X※13) = 3 / 24\n(X※13) = 1 / 8\n\nGiven the operation rule for non-multiples, X※13 must equal 24 to satisfy the equation. However, this contradicts the condition we set (X※13 = 1 / 8).\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding or an error in the problem statement or the operation rule as it is currently interpreted. The operation rule as given does not produce an integer value for X when solving for the given expression to equal 3, and the rule for non-multiple cases contradicts the condition we set.\n\nGiven the current rule and the provided expression, there is no valid integer value for X that satisfies the equation 19 ※ 28 ※ 4 ※ (X※13) = 3 based on the defined operation rule."}
