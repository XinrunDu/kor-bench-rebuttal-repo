However, with a bit of cleverness, you can utilize your assistant for other purposes as well. Your assistant understands 13 commands that facilitate text generation and allows you to perform simple arithmetic and mathematical computations.\n\nAt the same time, your assistant serves as your personal digital assistant, capable of processing and performing tasks associated with your complex requirements. These requirements can vary depending on your specific needs, but some common examples include answering digital questions, booking appointments, and scheduling events.\n\nCreate and meet new personas inspired by fictional characters and explore new use cases specific to each personality. We are continuously adding new commands to impress and amaze you! ✨ 🎉\n\n## Commands\n\n### Add\n\nThe \"add\" command calculates or provides computations based on a mathematical equation. For example:\n\n- {{ add 2 + 3 }} = 5\n- {{ add 2 * 2 }} = 4\n\n### Substract\n\nThe \"subtract\" command performs a mathematical operation containing the subtraction sign. For example:\n\n- {{ subtract 10 - 5 }} = 5\n- {{ subtract 10 + 5 }} = 5\n\n### Multiplication\n\nThe \"multiply\" command multiplies two given numeric values. Example:\n\n- {{ multiply 3 * 3 }} = 9\n- {{ multiply 3 / 3 }} = 1\n\n### Division\n\nThe \"divide\" command divides two given numeric values. Example:\n\n- {{ divide 3 / 3 }} = 1\n- {{ divide 6 / 2 }} = 3\n\n### Unique Number\n\nThe \"unique number\" command generates a unique number within a specified range.
