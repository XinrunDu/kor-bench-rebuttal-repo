I asked one of them what Allah will do with them, and the angel replied 'They will come to men to tell them that music is haram (forbidden).' In this Hadith, notice that it specifically uses the phrase \"music\" instead of \"songs,\" indicating that music and songs are separate concepts.\"\n\nUser: What was the sin committed by Asbary, that the punishment was death, even if it was not on the first day of the lecture on music?\nWhat was his mistake, provided that he addressed the Islamic point regarding the issue of music in Islam?\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary faced significant backlash due to his depiction of Salafi scholars as \"mad cow.\" Salafi Scholars regarded this derogatory phrase targeting their intellectual foundation.
