All seven tiles placed must form a single word. Most tiles are listed in order of frequency in Scrabble.\nThe 2 firmly at the bottom of the list are Q and Z, with letter frequency being very low. They have less use and are mostly used for bonus scoring leading to multi-letter scores. In all, there are only 2 tiles in each duo deck. When all tiles are distributed evenly (no joker tiles), these tiles will always remain distributed, and for example, in the middle two players of the Scrabble game, if the Q tile was received, they would need to show that tile to pass to the next player, and the Z tile would always be in the second player in rotation to ensure fairness.\nAll 32 tiles are distributed in the game, including the 2 quaint and charming tiles that are peculiar to the game of Scrabble. Therefore, if we are to assume that there will be no discard tiles during the game, there will be a total of 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 20,160 ways to form seven-letter words. Here you can find a list of words that can be formed: Click here to open word search\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand all elements of the custom puzzle\n2. Use each element within an acceptable bounds\n3. Re-use elements within the limits\n4. If an element is reused appropriately, keep using it\n5. The objective is to attain an outcome without doing \"illegal\" actions\n6. The result should be a comprehensive solution that is logical and follows all instructions\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Take into account the basic structure of the Instructions:\n(Problem, Elements(s), Constraints, Instructions/Steps) and ensure your output reflects this\n7. Explain each step\n\n7. Validate your answer according to the rule.\nThe answers should be given in order i.e. if the requirement is for 3 words: 2 letter,3 letter,3 letter then a two letter word is given first followed by two three letter words separated by spaces.\nTell me the number of tiles from the list of tiles assigned to you. For example, if the tiles assigned to me are <url>, the answer should be 5 since there are 5 tiles in total within the link. </url>.\nPlease wrap your responses with double square brackets, like this: [[your response]].\n\n### Additional Rule:\ni dont know i put serval to get dataset\n\n### Question:\nGiven a string, write a program to check if it is a valid IP address or not.

For example, \"0.1.2.201\" and \"192.168.1.1\" are valid IP addresses, but \"0.011.255.245\", \"192.168.1.312\", and \"192.168@1.1\" are invalid IP addresses.\n\n### Answers:\nThe valid IP addresses that can be formed with the given tiles are: Ai Ct By\nThese addresses adhere to the rules of Scrabble and are therefore valid.\nPlease note that in Scrabble, it is possible for a player to form multiple words from a single set of letters, provided that each word is valid and complies with the game's rules.\n\n### Question:\nGiven a string, write a program to check if it is a valid IP address or not.
