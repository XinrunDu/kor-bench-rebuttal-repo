An island can be identified by noting the \"2\" appearing twice in the same row and the \"1\" appearing twice in the same column. Since there are no numbers sharing the same cell, the islands formed are disconnected from each other. Following the rules for forming islands, 1 X 1 X X X X X X 2, X X X X 4 X X X X X and X 1 X X X X X 3 X X would make some islands. \n\nFollowing the rules, a proper boundary can be drawn between the islands. This involves identifying the islands and the numbers equal to the number of cells each island has. The walls, represented by 'A' are placed accordingly between the islands, thus partitioning the areas with numbers. Since there are no shared numbers, and the hint numbers are distinct, the drawing of the wall is clear and unambiguous. The output matrix clearly shows the result of the operation, where the walls separate the islands as per the rules. \n\nThis solution ensures that the 2x2 or larger rectangle rule is not violated and that there is no contradiction that would hinder the player's movement. Each island is isolated from each other by the proper orientation of walls making the valid puzzle matrix. Therefore when the instruction \"with X being the blank island and A being the wall\" is considered, this is the proper arrangement that satisfies all the rules and completes the given puzzle. The elements arranged from left to right and top to bottom are presented clearly with each row separated by a comma."}

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n1 X X 3\n\n(2,3)>(3,3)\n(2,4)>(3,4)\n(3,2)<(3,3)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.
