Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n        - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output \u201cImplausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n        - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output \u201cImplausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    4. Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output \u201cPlausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nFor (\u00acp \u2228 q)\u2227(p \u2228 q) \u2227 (q), \nwhat is the output of the resolution algorithm?\nHow many cycles will it iterate? \nPlease provide the answer in the format [[output];[number]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this problem, let's apply the resolution algorithm step by step:\n\n1.

The entity set E is given as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. We don't have any entity constants to replace in this formula.\n3. We need to replace the function symbol g with its implementation gJ.\n4. We need to replace the predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ.\n\nApplying these steps to the formula \u2200xF(g(x,y),z), we get:\n\n[[\u2200x FJ(gJ(x,y), z)]]\n\nNow, let's substitute the known implementations:\n\n[[\u2200x (x * y = z)]]\n\nThis is the implementation of the formula under J.
