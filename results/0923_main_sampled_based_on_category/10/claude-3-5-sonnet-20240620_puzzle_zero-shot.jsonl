This is a 5x5 grid, so skyscraper heights will range from 1 to 5.\n\n2. Starting with the most constraining clues:\n   - Row 2 has a '1' on the left, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n   - Column 2 has a '4' on top, meaning the buildings must be in ascending order (1,2,3,4,5).\n   - Column 4 has a '1' on top, meaning a 5 must be in the first position.\n\n3. Filling in these known values and continuing to apply the rules:\n\n   2  4  3  1  2  \n4  X  1  X  5  X  1\n1  5  2  X  X  X  2\n3  X  3  X  X  X  3\n2  X  4  X  X  X  4\n3  X  5  X  X  X  5\n   3  2  2  2  1  \n\n4. Now, we can deduce more:\n   - In row 1, we need 2,3,4 to complete it. The '4' on the left means it must be in descending order.\n   - In column 1, we need 1,2,3,4 to complete it. The '3' at the bottom means 4 can't be at the bottom.\n   - In column 5, we need 1,2,3,4,5. The '1' at the bottom means 5 must be at the bottom.\n\n5. Continuing to fill in and deduce:\n\n   2  4  3  1  2  \n4  4  1  2  5  3  1\n1  5  2  3  1  4  2\n3  2  3  4  3  1  3\n2  1  4  5  2  3  4\n3  3  5  1  4  2  5\n   3  2  2  2  1  \n\n6.
