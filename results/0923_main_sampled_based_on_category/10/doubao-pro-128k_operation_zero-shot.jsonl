Since 25 is a multiple of 5, 25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nNow we have 7※X = 4.\n\nIf 7 is a multiple of X, then 7※X = 7/X + 2. So we have the equation 7/X + 2 = 4.

There are three cases:\n\nCase 1: If X is a multiple of 13, then X※13 = X/13 + 2.\n\nSo the expression becomes 8※(X/13 + 2).\n\nIf 8 is a multiple of (X/13 + 2), then 8※(X/13 + 2) = 8 / (X/13 + 2) + 2.\n\nSetting this equal to 3, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8}{(X/13 + 2)} + 2&=3\\\\\n\\frac{8}{(X/13 + 2)}&=1\\\\\nX/13 + 2&=8\\\\\nX/13&=6\\\\\nX&=78\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut if we check, 78 is a multiple of 13, and 8 is not a multiple of (78/13 + 2) = 8. So this case is not valid.\n\nCase 2: If 13 is a multiple of X, then X※13 = 13/X + 2.\n\nSo the expression becomes 8※(13/X + 2).\n\nIf 8 is a multiple of (13/X + 2), then 8※(13/X + 2) = 8 / (13/X + 2) + 2.\n\nSetting this equal to 3, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{8}{(13/X + 2)} + 2&=3\\\\\n\\frac{8}{(13/X + 2)}&=1\\\\\n13/X + 2&=8\\\\\n13/X&=6\\\\\nX&=\\frac{13}{6}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut X should be an integer, so this case is not valid.\n\nCase 3: If X is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of X, then X※13 = 24.\n\nSo the expression becomes 8※24. Since 8 is not a multiple of 24 and 24 is not a multiple of 8, 8※24 = 24.\n\nThis does not equal 3, so this case is not valid either.\n\nAfter analyzing all the cases, we find that there is no integer value of X that satisfies the equation.
