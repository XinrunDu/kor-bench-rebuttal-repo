The three initial statements are:\n\n(1) The coin is not in box A.\n(2) The coin is not in box B.\n(3) The coin is in box C.\n\nAssume all statements are related to one another. By applying the logic rule that all statements in a consistent system cannot be true, the feasible solutions can be found through a propositional logic deductive system. The feasible solutions can be deduced as follows:\n\nBy assuming that the first statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box B, nor in box C\", it can be proved that statement (1) is true, and the coin is in box A. By assuming that the second statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box A, nor in box C\", it can be proved that statement (2) is true, and the coin is in box B. By assuming that the third statement contradicts \"The coin is not in box A, nor in box B\", it can be proved that statement (3) is true, and the coin is in box C.\n\nBy analyzing the negations of the three statements in the propositional logical deductive system, the resulting three negations can be expressed as the conjunction of all the paired conjunctive terms of the negations, and according to the logic rule that all statements in a consistent system cannot be true, it can be proven that the formula does not hold true for all assignments taken from the paired conjunctive terms:\n\n((\u00acp\u2192q\u2227r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2192r)\u2227(\u00acr\u2192(p\u2228q)))\u2192(\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227\u00acr)\n\nBased on the above formalization, for a logical formula that is in principal disjunctive normal form, by identifying the false values of its paired disjunctive terms, the formula can be easily represented as the disjunction of the corresponding false values of the paired conjunctive terms, and accordingly, the true assignments of the formula can be derived. By identifying the true values of the three statements, the feasible solutions can be determined, and the question can be transformed into a situation similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\", where the prisoner needs to answer questions to obtain their freedom. To find all possible scenarios where any one statement contradicts the other two statements, use the original three statements and their conjunction, and get the following contradictions:\n\n1.

y.\nPlease provide the answers in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Ax((Ex(G(x,y))|(Ex(H(x,y))))&(Ay(Ey((Ey(Ey(G(x,y))|Ey(H(x,y))))))&(Ey(\u223cEy(G(x,y))&\u223cEy(H(x,y)))))]]\n\n### Question:\nLet the individual domain D={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, symbolize the following claim:\nFor all x in D, if x < 5, then x^2 < 25.\nPlease symbolize the proposition, using the following predicates:\nF(x): x < 5,\nH(x): x^2 < 25.\nPlease provide the answers in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Ax((F(x)&H(x))&Ay(F(y)\u21d2H(y)))]]\n\n### Question:\nLet the predicate be three-dimensional:\nF(x,y,z): x + y = z\n\nSuppose we now want to express that some numbers in our individual domain follow it while others do not, for example,\n\nIf x and y = 10, then there exists some z such that x + y = z.\n\nUsing the above example, identify F(x, y, z) in the following expression, provided that the rules of precedence apply:\n\nFor all propositions, use the symbols ?\n\nPlease provide the answers in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Ex(F(x)&~F(x)))~(Ay(Az(F(x,y,z)|~P(x,y,z)\n\n### Question:\nFor the statement:\nThere may be some students who aren't either happy or ambitious.\n\nIdentify the quantifiers used in the translation of this statement, using \u2200 and \u2203 to represent universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers respectively.\n\nFor the statement:\n\n\u201cThere exists some x's such that if there exists some y such that y is not happy and that y is not ambitious, then x is not a student who is both happy and ambitious.\"\n\nDemonstrate that this is the correct translation using truth tables.\n\n### Answer:\n1.The correct translation of the statement \"All students are either happy or ambitious\" is ?\n\n2.The correct interpretation of \u00acP is \"Not all students are either happy or ambitious\".\nTherefore, \u00acP can be represented as:\n\nPlease provide the answers in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n1.Without using specific predicate symbols, we first translate it into propositional formulas.\nAssume that P represents 'x is happy' and Q represents 'x is ambitious', the correct translation of the sentence is (\u2200x)(P(x)\u2228Q(x)) and \u00ac(\u2200x)((P(x)\u2228Q(x))).\nTherefore, the correct answer is [Ay((P(x)\u2228Q(x))&\u2200y((P(x)\u2228Q(x))\u21d4\u00ac(\u00ac\u2203x(P(x)\u2228Q(x)))))].\n\n2.An equivalent formula for \u2200xP(x) = \u00ac\u2203\u00acP(x):\n For the original atomic statement is P(x), the contradictory statement is \u00acP(x), and if it is applied to the entire domain, then the statement that always establishes the truth is \u2203\u00acP(x).\n As \u2200 represents that the overall domain always establishes the truth,  \u00ac\u2203\u00acP(x) being always the truth is equivalent to \u2200xP(x), which is transformed into \u00ac\u2200xP(x) = \u2203\u00acP(x).\n Therefore, the answer is ~~\u2200xP(x)=\u2203\u2203\u00acP(x).\n\n### Question:\nFor the statement:\nStudents are either hard-working or doing better than hardworking students, but there are some students who are not becoming harder working, and there are also students who are not harder working, indicating that not all students have a good performance.\n\nThe proposition symbolized using logical symbols without semantics is:\n\nPlease give your answer in [[]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[\u2200x(\u2203\u2203P(x)\u21d4\u2203xP(x))]\n\n### Question:\nLet the predicate be three-dimensional:\nF(x,y,z): x + y = z\n\nSuppose z = 4, x < 7, and y > 3.\n\nIf F(x) is false, then from the second premise, it follows that F(x) is false.\nHowever, we can deduce that F(x) is true from the first premise, indicating that F(x) is a false statement.\nTherefore, the proposition is false.\n\nGiven the argument, infer the premises of the statement.\n\nFor the statement:\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[];...] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[Ay(P(y)\u21d2(P(y)>>P(y)))];[Lz,Qy,q,w,f,v,T,Lz,Qy,r,w,a,s]]\n\n### Question:\nThere is an erroneous theorem that depends on proving a contradiction between propositions about natural numbers:\n\na subsequence of a set Set S of natural number inequalities implies the same sequence Set S of inequalities.\n\nSuppose we have Set a:\n\n{\n\n}\n\nAs Set a is a subset of Set S, there exists a natural number n such that n is a subsequence of Set S.\n\nHowever, we mistakenly assume that Set a \u2260 Set S, thus contradicting our theorem.\n\nGiven the argument, infer the premises of the statement.\n\nFor the statement:\n\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[]] format.\n\nNote: You may need to use the same symbol for two premises.\n\n### Answer:\n\nList all the premises of the statement.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[];...] format.\n\n### Answer:\nThe problem that needs to be solved here is the problem of determining whether to support freedom as a prerequisite to finding a suitable mate, in other words, whether to prioritize freedom as a criterion for a mate.\nTo solve this question, we must have the following information:\n\nA natural number is called a composite number if and only if there exists some positive integer x such that x follows the following conditions.\nWe first need to know what conditions are there for the following mathematical statements.\nWe need to find multiple values for Set"}

This question is about modular propositions.\n\nOkay, so the first modal proposition is \"This new policy will definitely be implemented.\" The second proposition is \"This new policy will not be implemented.\" We need to infer which relationship holds between these two propositions.\n\n<strong>S3b:</strong> So these modal propositions hold the X relationship, which indicates both cannot be true but can both be false.\n\n<strong>S3c:</strong> I will try to explain why the X relationship holds. According to Axiom 1, it is stated here that if both terms are true, then for the X relationship specifically, both propositions cannot be true.

Can provide detailed explanations and examples of several common reasoning rules and inference rules.\n\n### Modus ponens:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (P implies Q)\n2. P (P is true)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. It's raining (P).\n-----------------------\n3. The ground is wet (Q).\n\n### Modus tollens:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (P implies Q)\n2. \u00acQ (Q is false)\n-----------\n3. \u00acP (Therefore, P is false)\n\n**Explanation**: Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P implies Q) and Q is false, then P must be false.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. The ground is not wet (\u00acQ).\n--------------------------\n3. It's not raining (\u00acP).\n\n### Hypothetical syllogism:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (P implies Q)\n2. Q \u2192 R (Q implies R)\n-----------\n3. P \u2192 R (Therefore, P implies R)\n\n**Explanation**: Hypothetical syllogism allows us to chain two conditional statements to infer a third. If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P must imply R.\n\n**Example**:\n1. If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n2. If the ground is wet (Q), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n-----------------------------------------\n3. If it's raining (P), then the flowers are blooming (R).\n\n### Disjunctive syllogism:\n\n1. P \u2228 Q (P or Q is true)\n2. \u00acP (P is false)\n-----------\n3. Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunctive statement (either P or Q is true) and one of the options is false (e.g., P is false), then the other option must be true (Q).\n\n**Example**:\n1. Either it's raining (P) or the sky is clear (Q).\n2. It's not raining (\u00acP).\n---------------------\n3. The sky is clear (Q).\n\n### Simplification:\n\n1. P \u2227 Q (P and Q are both true)\n-----------\n2. P (Therefore, P is true)\n\n**Explanation**: Simplification allows us to extract one of the conjuncts from a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then P must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P) and cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------------\n2. The weather is rainy (P).\n\n### Conjunction:\n\n1. P\n2. Q\n-----------\n3. P \u2227 Q (Therefore, both P and Q are true)\n\n**Explanation**: Conjunction allows us to combine two true statements into a conjunction. If both P and Q are true, then the conjunction of P and Q must be true.\n\n**Example**:\n1. The weather is rainy (P).\n2. The weather is cloudy (Q).\n-----------------------\n3. The weather is rainy and cloudy (P \u2227 Q).\n\nContradiction:\n\nThis rule of inference is important for exploring the logical relationships between statements and provides the basis for complex logical reasoning. These rules of inference are commonly used in formal proof and reasoning to ensure that deductions are logical and consistent.\n\nFor tasks of type 1 and type 2, it is necessary to clearly state the definitions of declarative sentences, mental sentences, and categorical membership sentences, and provide explanatory examples.\n\n##\u00a0Declarative sentences\n\nDeclarative sentences are those that convey factual information about something in the world and can be proven or disproven. Declarative sentences typically represent statements about facts or events that can be confirmed or disproved. It is important to note that declarative sentences must be clear and unambiguous, as they are central to logic and reasoning. There are several key concepts and examples to help you better understand declarative sentences.\n\n### Individual declarative sentences\n\nIndividual declarative subjects refer to components that assert individual facts or judgments about something. Individual declarative propositions can be divided into two categories: positive declarative propositions and negative declarative propositions.\n\n1. **Positive declarative propositions**: assert that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Tara is 18 years old\".\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Tara is 18 years old, and by verification, the sentence can be confirmed or denied.\n\n2. **Negative declarative sentences**: deny that something exists or is the case.\n\n- Example: \"Sally is not a 15 year old girl.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence asserts that Sally is not 15 years old, and if Sally is found to be 15 years old, the sentence can be confirmed, otherwise it can be proven.\n\n### General declarative sentences\n\nA general declaration is a declarative statement about a particular item or event. A general declaration may have multiple occurrences.\n\n1. **existential declarative sentence**: declares that an item exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"There is a cute cat in the house.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence suggests that there is a certain composition, and if a cute cat can be found in the house, then the sentence is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n2.\u00a0 **Comprehensive declarative sentence**: asserts that the commonality exists in some way.\n\n- Example: \"All cats like to eat fish.\"\n\n- Explanation: This sentence states that there is some commonality between all cats and their preference for eating fish.\n\nIt is important to note that both general declarative sentences and individual declarative sentences must be clear, unambiguous, and common to the language in order to be properly asserted.\n\nThe following are several principles and guidelines for using declaratives:\n\n1. **Minimize ambiguity**: Avoid vague words and concepts in declarative propositions to ensure clarity of meaning. For example, \"someone went downstairs\" is ambiguous because it is unclear who that someone is.\n\n2. **Precise wording**: Use concise and precise words to state declarative propositions, avoiding ambiguity. For example, \"He is busy today\" is more precise than \"He is busy with something.\"\n\n3. **Knowledge Consistency**: When using declarative sentences, make sure to check if they are consistent with previously specified or existing knowledge. If two declaratives contradict each other, additional information is required or one of them must be determined to be false.\n\n4. **Sufficient evidence**: Upon the claim of a declarative sentence, if possible, provide sufficient arguments and evidence to support its correctness or coherence. For instance, declare things like \"Tara is 18 years old\", and provide some evidence of proof, such as a copy of Tara's ID card, an entry with Tara's birthday in the family record book, etc.\n\n5. **Be Open-minded**: Declaratives are always subject to change and revision as more information and evidence becomes available. The Declarative is the foundation of logical reasoning and artificial intelligence, and it is important to adopt an open and curious attitude towards them.\n\n##\u00a0mental sentences\n\nMental sentences are declarative sentences that express relationships between subjects and people described in the sentences. Any propositional construction is a combination of declarative and mental propositions. Mental sentences"}

The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations.

An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
