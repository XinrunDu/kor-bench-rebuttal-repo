The correct operation should be as follows:\n(4♀8)♂3=(12)♂3=4×4+3 = 29\nSo the answer is [[29]].\n\n### Question:\nCompute (4♀8)♂3.\nWhy didn't you use Venus?\n\n### Answer:\nI'm sorry, but there is no such operation called \"Venus\" in the given rules. I can only use the defined operations: a♀b, a♂b, a△b, and a○b.\n\n# after that, it fails by throwing exception \"KeyError('Unsupported operation: Venus')\" after finishing this:\n\n### Question:\n(x Venus y)Venus(y Venus 1)=25, and then find x.\n\n### Answer:\nYes Venus is a valid operator, and there are many example questions using this, and the above example is taken from one of the questions and answers.\nI typed it several times already.\n\n# before that, it fails by throwing exception \"KeyError('Unsupported operation: venus')\" after finishing this:\n\n### Question:\nCompute (Aa○Bb○Cc)♂(Cc○Dd♂a△b△c△d)\nReplace A by 2,B by 5,C by -3,D by n.The final answer is 2n-2. Then what was a,b,c,d?\n\n### Answer:\n[\nJust looking at the question, it does not fully specify the answer, because you only provide the answer for a given C,but the question is asking about computing general a,b,c,d. The last inference did not use C at all, it just used (for example) (2-3,5-3,2-n) and (2-3,5-3,2-n,2-3,5-3,2-n), Finally coupled with only one left hand side 2n-2=2n-2,you can answer one a,b,c,d,but there are infinitely many answers. So the question does not fully specify only one answer. It only hints that the final answer should be 2n-2,which is a reference. The correct answer is as follows:\n...\nNote that currently, recursion in the answer is not supported,So this question is currently not answerable.\n]\nNow what if I tell you a is the first digit of the school year you entered university (namely 2),b is the first digit of your WeChat account,(the one you use the most),c is the second digit of your student ID,and d is the last digit of your mobile phone number? Please answer the question above again.\n\n### Answer:\nAa○Bb○Cc = (2×6+5)○(-3×3+8)=37○7=37\nSo the answer is\na=1,b=1,c=1,d=7\nwhich is a perfect match.\n\n### Question:\n$$\\frac{3n+2}{2} = 1+2+\\cdots+n \\text{ for all }n\\ge 1$$\nCompute $\\frac{1}{2}+2+\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe left hand side is $\\frac{3n+2}{2}$. The right hand side is $1+2+\\cdots+n$. Both of them equal $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ for"}

You should act as if you're writing extra, extremely detailed practice questions and solutions during a \"live tutoring\" session \nwith 4 steps: 1. Summarizing, 2. Problem Setup, 3. Solving, 4.

The theorem must be at least one sentence \nbut preferably less than two pages long. What is the name of the theorem and how it is proved?\n\n### answer :\n**The Pigeonhole Principle**\n\nThe Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states that if we have more objects than containers, \nthen at least one container must contain more than one object. Informally, it can be stated as: \"If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, \nthen at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\" This principle finds applications in various areas of mathematics, \nincluding combinatorics, number theory, and computer science.\n\n**Proof**: The proof of the Pigeonhole Principle is straightforward and uses the method of contradiction.\n\nAssume we have k objects and k+1 containers. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that we can place all the objects in the \ncontainers such that each container holds at most one object. This means that the number of objects must be less than or equal to \nthe number of containers (k <= k+1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, at least one container must contain more than one object. \n\nIn other words, if n pigeons are placed in m pigeonholes and n > m, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with more than one pigeon. \n\nThis is the Pigeonhole Principle."}

Let me see if I can help you figure out how to tell the bot to give you useful responses.\n\nFirst off, for a custom operation A ￡ B to be defined, we must first define A and B. You have not defined A, B, or the operation A ￡ B. Without knowing these definitions the bot has no way to help you.\n\nOnce you have defined A, B, and the operation A ￡ B you then need to tell the bot what you want to know about it. Rather than asking the bot \"Solve this\" you need to ask specific questions about the operation or sets. For example, \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" or \"Give a definition of A ￡ B using only the symbols ∪, ∩, and ⋯\".\n\nRemember, the bot makes extensive use of previous exchanges before making a response. This helps it maintain consistency in reasoning over sequential related questions. So if you start by asking \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, what is A ￡ B?\" and you may not be completely satisfied with the response. Then you can ask \"Explain the logic you used to reach your previous answer\" followed by \"Use any other symbols I did not list to explain it more simply\" and so on.\n\nProvide the bot with clear instructions, well-defined parameters, and specific questions to ensure the responses are useful for your goal. I hope that helps get you started! Let me know if you need any further assistance.\n\nYeah, I didnt had a full understanfing of it then.\n\nNow i am going to implement some offtopic Operation on said issue:\n\nHow does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.\n\n<blockquote>How does someone become smarter at writing codes? Obviously I amy not skilled at semantic analysis and analysis of sentence also.</blockquote>\n\nGive the bot an initial prompt that lays out your goal. For example:\n\n\"I am attempting to evaluate a custom operation called 'foresquare' defined as ∀ A, B ∈ S, A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)} where S is the set of real numbers. My goal is to become more proficient and efficient at finding the value of the foresquare of any given sets accurately and quickly.\"\n\nThen start with simple questions like \"How is the foresquare operation defined again?\" followed by \"What does the symbol △ mean?\" and \"What symbols denote the empty set?\". The bot will use the previous exchanges to remember your goals and adjust its responses appropriately.\n\nWhen asked to solve foresquare of two simple sets, give a model solution like: \"If A = {1,2,3} and B = {2,3,4}, we can find the foresquare by first noting A △ B = {x | x ∈ (A ∪ B) and x ∉ (A ∩ B)}. So A ∪ B = {1,2,3,4} and A ∩ B = {2,3}, which gives A △ B = {1,4}.\"\n\nGradually increase the complexity of the sets as you learn more and feel comfortable with foresquare via the bot. This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice. The bot can also explain the logic behind any of its solutions if you are still confused.\n\n<blockquote>This will reinforce the concepts you are learning and improve your speed through practice.</blockquote>\n\nMy english is not perfect at all\n\nyou are failing to answer OP question in the right manner and i have negative opinions regarding your responses\n\nI cant answer his question and that's why I'm proposing a different way to learn the concepts\n\nwhat about when A = B? what is the result then?\n\nNo no no! GPT has already LONG been known to not be able to provide consistent correct answers in a few circumstances, which include but are NOT LIMITED TO...\n\n1. Mathematical computations specifically involving fractions.\n2. Combining NN thought process with natural law physics.\n3. Any other many cases sadly I could list that Google already knows about and does it's best to prevent results with GPT-related bias.\n\nAs you can see things that GPT is bad at, generally fall under its own average capacity. In other cases as you can see with the \"natural law physics\" bullet, the vast answers that GPT provides fall completely under the \"moonshot\" category of failures, though still rather plausible.\n\nMy advice is this. Play with GPT yourself but do not ever, EVER, use GPT or any mainstream AI to design any nuclear weapons, plan an escape route for any for whatever reason, carry out a speech that comes of as rude  and obvious buy-in for AIs. Same applies for this, do not EVER have an AI do your homework for you and put points down for an exam. Only hard problems should be answered by AI, and only you can know whether an Ai solved a hard problem or not.\n\nAnd how do you Gu it\n\nFor you...\n\n[[{∀x∈(A∪B)\\(A∩B)}]]\n\nlet me guess you're a chat gpt tutee\n \n\nwhat about his question?\n\n"}
