Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), … and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt.
