The function should rearrange the letters and the words independently, such that all words and letters derived from the letters and words in the original string are in a valid order.\n## Example\n```python\ninput_string = 'word1,word2,word3';\n\noutput_string = 'word1,word3,word2';\n```\n\nUse the function to generate the output.\n## Constraints\n```\n- `input_string` will always be a valid string.\n- References for the input data are available after submission.\n```\n\n\n```\n# Approach: \n1 Iterative Loop\n2 Non-Iterative Loop\n\n```\n### Iterative Loop:\n```\nresult['word'] = w\nresult['letter'] = le\n```\n```\n\n- Case 1. If last character in the input_string is a letter and contains atleast two words then result will be reversed. \n- Case 2\n-- Two nested loops w.r.t words\n-- First loop w.r.t letters\n- Case 3. \n```\n\n### Non-Iterative Loop:\n```\nStringBuilder result = new StringBuilder( );\nfor (int w in input_string.split(\",\")) {\n\tif (w.length <2){\n\t\tresult += \"\"c + w + \"k\";\n\t}\n\telse{\n\t\tresult.append(w.char(0) + \",\") + result.reverse().ToString(); \n\t}\n}\n```\n\n\n# Given a string of numbers, create a function that will assign an image with the same color values. You will be given 3 arguments, row, col and image.\n- *Row and Column* is the total number of cells required per image. Make sure they can represent the smallest number of values required. (Ex. You cannot use 2 rows)\n- *Image* is the picture you wish to assign on the grid. Must be a valid image or character array of appropriate dimensions. Must be valid, and represented in the format \"xxxx.#fxz\" (integer of # followed by characters of x,fx,z) \n- *Image Length* gives you the minimum number of colors in *Image* needed for assigning the image to a color pattern.\n```\n\n- *It takes 4-6 days to implement*\n- 1-2 weeks to implement a solution\n- 8-10 weeks for more complex\n```\n-----\n[Practice Program:](https://edabit.com/challenge/nCZxK7jNyj3dfy6jy)\n"}

First, we consider the number of shaded cells on the grid. For each domino, we include a 1 in the region's sum, which can never be greater than 1. If the top domino is placed on an unshaded cell, we subtract 1 from the shaded cells. Otherwise, we add one to the shaded cells. For example, in Question 5, there are five shaded cells on the grid. In Domino A, the top domino contains two shaded cells. The remaining shaded cells are the first row on the right, and the regions two shaded cells in this row is subtracted, because the next domino covers one of these cells. 1 (the one that appears on a shaded cell) is added to the shaded cells. The total shaded cells are 2+2+5-2=7. This process will be executed for all dominoes and their consequences.\n\nHow the problem is solved? The code above uses recursion to solve the problem. The function is called until the answer is complete. Each time the function is called, it updates a variable with the total number of shaded cells, rows of shaded cells, and columns of shaded cells. These updated data are passed to the function the next time it is called. Each position (row, column) of the answer matrix is calculated from all dominoes within the range [[(s,s)] or [[(r,c), (r+1,c-1)] to obtain the number of dominoes on the grid.\n\nThe answer matrix contains the coordinates of all dominoes on the grid. The correct answer is (1,1)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4). (1,1) represents the 1st row and the 1st column of all dominoes, (2,1) represents all dominoes in the 2nd row and the 1st column. And so on. As a result, the output answer is [(1,1)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)]. This method is derived from the idea of a naive approach solved recursively."}
