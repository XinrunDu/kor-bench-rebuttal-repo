Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38;\n2. Replace entity constants a in \ud835\udc35 with a\u2032;\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols \ud835\udc54 in \ud835\udc35 with g\ud835\udc3d;\n4.

This formula expresses a relationship where if point Gp is true, then point \u00acG\u00acp must also be true. \n\nLooking at the Time Proposition Relationships defined in the rule:\n\n* **\u2217 Relation:** Pairs exhibit a state of exclusivity. Either one is true, or the other is false \u2013 they cannot both be true or both false. Formula 17 does not demonstrate this type of exclusivity.\n\n* **\u21a6 Relation:** Pairs can be both false but not both true. Formula 17 implies a directional truth relationship where the truth of Gp guarantees the truth of \u00acG\u00acp.\n\n* **\u26ad Relation:** Pairs cannot be both false. However, they can both be true. Formula 17 doesn't express this type of restriction.\n\n* **\u2042 Relation:** Pairs can both be true or both be false.

Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p \u2192 p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B_p \u2227 B_Bp]] \n"}

It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented.
