The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.
