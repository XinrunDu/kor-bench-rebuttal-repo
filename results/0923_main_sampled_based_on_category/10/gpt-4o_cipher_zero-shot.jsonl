Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"M*C*C*V*E*\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

No 'Q' is present, and all characters are uppercase. Thus, no cleanup needed.\n\n2. **Check Length and Adjust:**\n    - The plaintext length is 11, which is odd. We'll add an 'X' to make it even: \"WDFENKPXSVNX\".\n\n3. **Split into Two-Letter Groups:**\n    - The adjusted plaintext: \"WDFENKPXSVNX\" → \"WD\", \"FE\", \"NK\", \"PX\", \"SV\", \"NX\".\n\n4. **Encrypt Each Double-Letter Group:**\n    - For each pair, we will follow the rules to find the corresponding letters in Gird2 and Gird3 using the positions found in Gird1 and Gird4.\n\n    - **WD:**\n        - W (Gird1, row 3, col 2) maps to K (Gird2, row 3, col 2).\n        - D (Gird4, row 4, col 4) maps to N (Gird3, row 4, col 4).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"KN\".\n\n    - **FE:**\n        - F (Gird1, row 5, col 1) maps to V (Gird2, row 5, col 1).\n        - E (Gird4, row 4, col 5) maps to E (Gird3, row 4, col 5).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"VE\".\n\n    - **NK:**\n        - N (Gird1, row 1, col 4) maps to M (Gird2, row 1, col 4).\n        - K (Gird4, row 1, col 1) maps to V (Gird3, row 1, col 1).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"MV\".\n\n    - **PX:**\n        - P (Gird1, row 2, col 1) maps to B (Gird2, row 2, col 1).\n        - X (Gird4, row 3, col 3) maps to H (Gird3, row 3, col 3).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"BH\".\n\n    - **SV:**\n        - S (Gird1, row 2, col 3) maps to F (Gird2, row 2, col 3).\n        - V (Gird4, row 3, col 1) maps to X (Gird3, row 3, col 1).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"FX\".\n\n    - **NX:**\n        - N (Gird1, row 1, col 4) maps to M (Gird2, row 1, col 4).\n        - X (Gird4, row 3, col 3) maps to H (Gird3, row 3, col 3).\n        - Encrypted pair: \"MH\".\n\n5. **Concatenate the Encrypted Pairs:**\n    - Result: \"KNVE\", \"MV\", \"BH\", \"FX\", \"MH\".\n\n    - Final ciphertext after concatenation: \"KNVEMVBHFXMH\".\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[KNVEMVBHFXMH]]."}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"AEVRCIRZDIH\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.
