Let's break it down:\n\n1. **19 ※ 28**: 19 is not a multiple of 28, and 28 is not a multiple of 19, so \\(19 ※ 28 = 24\\).\n\n2. **24 ※ 4**: 24 is a multiple of 4, so \\(24 ※ 4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\n3. **8 ※ (X ※ 13)**: This is where we need to figure out the value of X. We know that the final result is 3, so we're looking for a result of \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), where \\(Y = X ※ 13\\).\n\nGiven that \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), and since 8 is not a multiple of Y (which doesn't directly help us because we don't know Y), we can infer that to get a result of 3, we must have a situation where \\(Y\\) is a multiple of 8, and \\(Y\\) must be such that \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\). This is because the only way to get a result of 3 is if the division plus 2 equals 3, given the operation's definition. \n\nSolving \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\) gives us \\(Y/8 = 1\\), which means \\(Y = 8\\). \n\nNow, to get \\(Y = 8\\), we needed \\(X ※ 13 = 8\\). Given the operation's rule, since 8 is not a multiple of 13, and 13 is not a multiple of 8, we are in the situation where \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), but we know that \\(X ※ 13\\) should equal 8 based on our previous step. This seems to lead to a contradiction, but we must reconcile it with the definition of the operation.\n\nThe mistake in the previous reasoning is that we directly assumed \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\) without considering the possibility of a different relationship based on the operation rule. Given that we are looking for \\(X ※ 13 = 8\\), and knowing that 13 is not a multiple of 8, we need to find \\(X\\) such that \\(X\\) is a multiple of 13, and \\(X/13 + 2 = 8\\). This is because we initially misinterpreted the step where \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which led to the incorrect conclusion that \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal 8 directly. Instead, we should focus on the fact that for the final step to result in 3, \\(X ※ 13\\) must lead to a number that, when the operation is applied with 8, results in 3. However, the direct path assumed a specific outcome that contradicted the rules, leading to the confusion.\n\nInstead, correctly following the operation's logic:\n\n- We need \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which means \\(X ※ 13\\) must be such that when the operation is applied between 8 and \\(X ※ 13\\), the result is 3.\n- Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, and 3 is not a multiple of 8, \\(X ※ 13\\) must be 24 to satisfy \\(8 ※ 24 = 24/8 + 2 = 3\\).\n- Now, for \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), given that 13 is not a multiple of 24, and 24 is not a multiple of 13, we apply the operation's rule correctly: \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), which is only possible if \\(X = 24 \\times 13\\), but since \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\), we end up in a loop.\n\nThe mistake was in the interpretation of the steps; let's correct that:\n\nWe know \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\). Since \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\) and 8 is not a multiple of 3, \\(Y\\) must be 24 for the operation to result in 3 (\\(8 ※ 24 = 24/8 + 2 = 3\\)). Thus, we need \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\). The only way for \\(X ※ 13\\) to equal 24 based on the operation's rules is if \\(X\\) is not a multiple of 13 and 13 is not a multiple of \\(X\\), which then means \\(X ※ 13 = 24\\) by default because it doesn't fit the division and addition part of the operation rule. This is a misinterpretation. Instead, we should recognize that for \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13)\\) to equal 3, \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal a value that, when divided by 8, gives a remainder that leads to the final result being 3. The operation's rule, however, does not directly allow for remainders but converts them into the default value of 24 when conditions are not met. This was the source of confusion.\n\nTo correctly solve for \\(X\\), considering the operation definitions and the misinterpretation correction:\n\n- We need \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), which directly implies that \\(X ※ 13\\) results in a value that, when the operation is applied with 8, leads to 3. However, the direct calculation suggested considering how the operation works was misleading. The key is that for any operation to result in 3, it must fit the form of the operation that leads to 3, which is the division and addition part of the operation rule (\\(a/b + 2\\) form).\n\nGiven \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), and considering we cannot directly reach 3 unless the operation fits the form where \\(Y/8 + 2 = 3\\), we realize that to directly solve for \\(X\\) from \\(X ※ 13\\), we need to approach it differently.\n\nThe correct approach reconsiders the logic based on the operation's definitions and the result needed:\n\n- For \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), we know that \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\) should fit the operation's definition that results in 3. Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, the operation result of \\(X ※ 13\\) must lead to a specific value that, when divided by 8 and added to 2, gives 3. This is the correct interpretation of needing \\(X ※ 13\\) to fit the operation's rule for the final step to equal 3.\n\nThus, \\(X ※ 13\\) must equal a value such that when this value is operated with 8, the result is 3. This value is not directly 8 or 24, as initially misinterpreted, but a value that, when plugged into the operation, gives 3.\n\nHowever, the correct way to solve it is to recognize the operation's limitations and how it applies sequentially:\n\n1. Since 19 is neither a multiple of 28 nor vice versa, \\(19 ※ 28 = 24\\).\n2. Since 24 is a multiple of 4, \\(24 ※ 4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\).\n3. Now, for \\(8 ※ (X ※ 13) = 3\\), given the operation's rule, to get 3, we must have a case where the result of \\(X ※ 13\\) is operated with 8 in a way that fits the operation's rule to give 3. Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, the operation's definition that applies is \\(8 ※ Y = 3\\), where \\(Y = X ※ 13\\), and \\(Y\\) must be such that \\(8/Y + 2 = 3\\). This is a misinterpretation based on the operation's rule, which does not allow 8 to be divided by \\(Y\\), but suggests that \\(Y\\) must be a specific value that, when operated with 8, gives 3.\n\nGiven the operation's strict definitions and the incorrect path of solving for \\(Y\\) directly from \\(8/Y + 2 = 3\\"}
