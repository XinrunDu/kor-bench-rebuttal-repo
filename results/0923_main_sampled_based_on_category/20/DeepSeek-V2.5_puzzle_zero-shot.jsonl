The required words are 7 in total: 3 words of 3 letters each, and 4 words of 4 letters each. Each letter can be used at most once in a word.\n\nLet's break down the task:\n\n1. **Three 3-letter words**: We need to find three words that can be made using the letters N, D, K, I, each word using three letters and each letter used at most once.\n2. **Four 4-letter words**: We need to find four words that can be made using the letters N, D, K, I, each word using four letters and each letter used at most once.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Three 3-letter words**:\n   - We can form \"NID\" (using N, I, D)\n   - We can form \"DIN\" (using D, I, N)\n   - We can form \"KID\" (using K, I, D)\n\n2. **Four 4-letter words**:\n   - Since we need four 4-letter words but we only have 4 different letters, it's impossible to form four distinct 4-letter words without reusing any letter. However, the rule allows each letter to be used at most once in a word, which implies that we can use all letters once in each word.\n   - Given the constraints, we can only form one 4-letter word: \"KIND\" (using K, I, N, D)\n\nHowever, since we need four 4-letter words and we can only form one, this scenario seems to have a logical inconsistency. Given the constraints, we might have to reconsider the formulation or assume there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nFor the sake of providing an answer based on the given letters and the rule, we can list the words we can form:\n\n- **Three 3-letter words**: NID, DIN, KID\n- **One 4-letter word**: KIND\n\nGiven the constraints, the answer would be:\n\n[[NID DIN KID KIND]]\n\nHowever, this does not meet the requirement of having four 4-letter words.

Let's break down the clues step by step:\n\n1. **Gralax will launch 1 month after the Rubicorp rocket.**\n   - This means the Gralax will launch in the month that follows the Rubicorp rocket.\n\n2. **Of the Cornick and the rocket that will launch in March, one is made by Rubicorp and the other is made by Techtrin.**\n   - This gives us two possibilities: either Cornick is made by Rubicorp and launches in March, or the other rocket (which launches in March) is made by Rubicorp and Cornick is made by Techtrin.\n\n3. **The Athios will launch 1 month before the Cornick.**\n   - This means the Athios will launch in the month prior to the Cornick.\n\n4. **The Exatris is developed by SpaceZen.**\n   - This tells us the company for the Exatris but not the month.\n\nNow, let's combine the information and deduce the launch months and companies:\n\n- If the Cornick launches in March, then:\n  - Athios will launch in February (1 month before Cornick).\n  - If Cornick is made by Rubicorp, then the Rubicorp rocket will launch in March, and Gralax will launch in April.\n  - But if Cornick is made by Techtrin, then the Rubicorp rocket will not launch in March, which contradicts the first clue about Gralax.\n\nThus, Cornick must be made by Techtrin and launch in March. The Rubicorp rocket must be the one launching in some other month.\n\n- Let's assume the Rubicorp rocket launches in February (Athios).\n  - Gralax will launch in March (1 month after the Rubicorp rocket), which is incorrect because Cornick is already in March.\n\n- Therefore, the Rubicorp rocket must launch in January.\n  - Gralax will launch in February (1 month after the Rubicorp rocket).\n  - Athios will launch in January (1 month before Cornick, which is in March).\n\nFinally, Exatris will launch in the remaining month, which is April.\n\nSo, the arrangement is:\n\n- January: Athios (Rubicorp)\n- February: Gralax (Rubicorp)\n- March: Cornick (Techtrin)\n- April: Exatris (SpaceZen)\n\n[[January Rubicorp Athios, February Rubicorp Gralax, March Techtrin Cornick, April SpaceZen Exatris]]"}

The sums of the rows are 26, 33, and 19. The sums of the columns are 31, 7, 25, and 15. The numbers we can use are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 34.\n\nLet's start by identifying the numbers we need to use:\n- The first column sum is 31. Since the last row already has 31, no additional numbers are needed for the first column.\n- The second column sum is 7, and the last row already has 7, so no additional numbers are needed for the second column.\n- The third column sum is 25, and the last row already has 25, so no additional numbers are needed for the third column.\n- The fourth column sum is 15, and the last row already has 15, so no additional numbers are needed for the fourth column.\n\nNow, we need to fill in the first three rows to meet the given row sums:\n- For the first row (26), we can use 1, 10, 11, and 4 (1 + 10 + 11 + 4 = 26).\n- For the second row (33), we can use 2, 9, 16, and 6 (2 + 9 + 16 + 6 = 33).\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 12, and 4 (3 + 12 + 4 = 19).\n\nThe filled grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3  12   4   0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each number from the set is used exactly once. Let's correct the third row sum to 19 by using different numbers:\n- For the third row (19), we can use 3, 5, and 11 (3 + 5 + 11 = 19).\n\nThe corrected grid will look like this:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3   5  11  0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nNow, we need to ensure each number is used exactly once and the sums match the given totals. Let's adjust the numbers accordingly:\n```\n1  10  11  4  26\n2   9  16  6  33\n3   5  11  0  19\n31   7  25  15\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n[[1 10 11 4, 2 9 16 6, 3 5 11 0, 31 7 25 15]]"}

Let's try using numbers from 1 to 9 (since we need relatively small numbers to fit the row and column sums provided).\n\n3. **Fill the grid:**\n   We will strategically place numbers to ensure the sums match.

The row becomes: 2 5 X X X 1 X X 9.\n\n2. **Second Row (6 X 3 X X X 2 7 X):**\n   - We can place 1 in the second cell. The row becomes: 6 1 3 X X X 2 7 X.\n\n3. **Third Row (9 X X 7 8 X 6 4 X):**\n   - We can place 2 in the second cell. The row becomes: 9 2 X 7 8 X 6 4 X.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (7 X X X 1 X X X X):**\n   - We can place 3 in the second cell. The row becomes: 7 3 X X 1 X X X X.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (X 3 X X X X X X X):**\n   - We can place 1 in the first cell. The row becomes: 1 3 X X X X X X X.\n\n6. **Sixth Row (X X 1 X X 9 X X X):**\n   - We can place 2 in the first cell. The row becomes: 2 X 1 X X 9 X X X.\n\n7. **Seventh Row (X X X X 5 X X X 6):**\n   - We can place 1 in the first cell. The row becomes: 1 X X X 5 X X X 6.\n\n8. **Eighth Row (8 4 X 6 X X X X X):**\n   - We can place 1 in the third cell. The row becomes: 8 4 1 6 X X X X X.\n\n9. **Ninth Row (X X X X X 2 X X X):**\n   - We can place 1 in the first cell. The row becomes: 1 X X X X 2 X X X.\n\nAfter filling in the initial guesses, we continue to fill the grid while ensuring that all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition.

Let's try (2,1) = 4 and (3,1) = 2.\n   - **(1,3)(1,4):5+**: The sum of (1,3) and (1,4) must be 5. Let's try (1,3) = 2 and (1,4) = 3.\n   - **(2,3)(2,4):5+**: The sum of (2,3) and (2,4) must be 5. Since 2 is already used in (1,3), let's try (2,3) = 1 and (2,4) = 4.\n   - **(1,1)(1,2)(2,2):12***: The product of (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2) must be 12. Let's try (1,1) = 3, (1,2) = 2, and (2,2) = 2. This product is 3*2*2 = 12.\n   - **(3,2)(3,3)(4,3):8***: The product of (3,2), (3,3), and (4,3) must be 8. Let's try (3,2) = 2, (3,3) = 1, and (4,3) = 4. This product is 2*1*4 = 8.\n   - **(3,4)(4,4):1-**: The difference between (3,4) and (4,4) must be 1.
