Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"XIMMBXG\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"XIMMBXG\", I will follow the decryption rules:\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line:\n\nX I M M B X\nG \n\n2. Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc.:\n\nLine 1:\n- Column 2 (0): I\n- Column 0 (1): X\n- Column 6 (2): M\n- Column 5 (3): M\n- Column 2 (4): B\n- Column 0 (5): X\n- Column 3 (6): (empty, so take $)\n\nLine 2:\n- Column 2 (0): (empty, so take $)\n- Column 0 (1): G\n- Column 6 (2): (empty, so take $)\n- Column 5 (3): (empty, so take $)\n- Column 2 (4): (empty, so take $)\n- Column 0 (5): (empty, so take $)\n- Column 3 (6): (empty, so take $)\n\n3. Read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end:\n\nI X M M B X G\n\nThe decrypted plaintext is: [[IXMMBXG]]\n\nHowever, the decrypted plaintext seems to be the same as the original ciphertext. This might be due to the fact that the ciphertext is too short, and the transposition cipher doesn't have enough \"mixing\" effect. If you provide a longer ciphertext, the decryption result should be more meaningful."}

Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FW\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"FW\", I'll follow the encryption rules.\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Padding**: The plaintext \"FW\" is 2 bytes, which is not a multiple of 8 bytes. I'll pad it with \\x00 (null character) to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes: \"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting**: Divide the padded plaintext into 8-byte blocks: [\"FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\"].\n\n3. **Block Encryption**:\n   - **Convert Block to Bytes**: Convert the block to bytes using ASCII encoding: b'FW\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'.\n   - **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key: b'\\x11\\x12\\x09\\x05\\x0c\\x01\\x01\\x08'.\n   - **Substitute**: Use the S_BOX Replacement Box to replace the high 4 bits and low 4 bits in each byte before stitching them together: b'\\x0a\\x0d\\x01\\x0c\\x09\\x07\\x0c\\x09'.\n   - **Permute**: Perform a simple permutation by rotating each byte left by 1 bit: b'\\x15\\x25\\x03\\x24\\x11\\x0E\\x18\\x12'.\n   - **XOR with Key**: Apply XOR between the permuted byte block and the fixed key again: b'\\x02\\x03\\x09\\x07\\x01\\x0D\\x01\\x00'.\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding**: Convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string: '02030907010D0100'.\n\n5. **Concatenate**: There's only one block, so the final ciphertext is '02030907010D0100'.\n\n**Encrypted Answer**:\n[[02030907010D0100]]"}
