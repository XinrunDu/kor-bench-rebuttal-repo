Functions.\n2. Set complement. \n3. Random graphs. \n4. Planarity. \n5. Indexing. \n6. The Handshaking lemma. \n\n1. Functions. Functions are actually based on set theory, since a function is essentially a set of a variable and its corresponding values (without any duplicates).\n\n2. Set complement. Complement is typically thought of as a set theory thing, so it's part of set theory. For a set A, this would be written as $\\complement{A}=${$x\\in U: x\\notin A$}\n\n3. Random graphs do not seem to be part of set theory, since a graph is not simply a set. A graph is the set of vertices and edges(sets) which takes into consideration not just what the vertices and edges are, but also how they are connected (edged are mapped to their incident vertices).\n\n4. Planarity, like random graphs, is not part of set theory, since a graph is not simply a set. Planarity also has to do with \"embedding\" graphs into space, which has to do with geometry and topology.\n\n5. Indexing. Indexing is a practice of set theory, where you organize elements of a set so you can easily look them up. This usually involves sets of index keys (such as words) and the elements of the indexed set (such as paragraphs).\n\n6. The Handshaking lemma is related to set theory, because a simple graph can be considered as a kind of set of all edges that connects the given vertices. \n\nA simple set theory problem, denoted to refer a cardinality of a set.\n\nFor $A\\subseteq B$, Prove $|A|>|B|$.\n\nTaking direct definitions, we get that:\n\n$|B|=L$ and $L-\\frac{1}{2}\\le|A|\\lt L+\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nBut this contradicts our assumption about $|A|$.\n\nIf we take $|A|\\ge|B|$ Then we get A=B, which contradicts $A\\lt B$.\n\nSimilarly, we get that $|B|\\ge|A|$\n\nFinally we get $|A|=|B|$ $\\Rightarrow A=B$.\n\nFor a set $A\\subseteq B$, it is obvious that a cardinality of a set is the subset cannot be lesser than the cardinality of a set itself. Thus, this solution is correct.\n\n1. When is $A=B$? Think of set membership first, then give an example.\n\n2. Elicit feedback on whether your example makes sense and is correct.\n\n3. How does your partner use “element/chalk-beholder/set member” when talking about set membership?\n\n4. How do you think your partner’s background influenced what he or she said?\n\n- When set A and set B have the same elements, for example A = B = {1, 2, 3}.\n\nTo provide an example about when A = B, we could provide different examples with different sizes. When set A's element is same with set B, the two sets can be equal. A = B = {x}.  A = B = {x, y}.  A = B = {x, x, z}.\n\nMy partner answered the question that A=B when A has only one element and that element is identical to only one element in B set.\n\nA = {a}\nB = {a}\nThen A=B\n\nI think set A and set B are different is the \"size\" (length) of each set. For example, A = {a, b} while B = {a}. A and B have 2 and 1 element(s) respectively.\n"}

In order to grade your answers, there is a standardized format we ask you to follow. Please refrain from using space, comma, operators(like +, -, *, /, etc), alphabets, decimal points, and symbols in your answer. Decimals should be represented as proper fractions or improper fractions in the numerator form. For example: 0.5numerator/denominator == 1/2ratio, 1.5numerator/denominator == 3/2ratio, 10.6numerator/denominator == 53/5ratio. All operations must follow the order of operations by using parentheses. More details about the rule of operations can be found here. If you want to provide an answer that is a rational number (eg, 1/2, -2/7, etc.), make sure your answer is in lowest terms. Failure to comply with this format will result in your answer being marked incorrect. Be aware that punctuation (such as ', \", :, ;, etc) cannot be understood by computers. In such cases, the correct and standard form is the fraction form. In case you really want to provide decimal numbers, please be aware that the system makes use of numeric flags, as such the proper write and read rule is in exponential form. For example: 12.30numerator == 12.3numerator*10pow\t\n\n\n## 1003The Distance To (1006)\n_Credit: Shih Chii Lin★★☆☆☆_\n\nThis problem is very simple.

So to be able to live, you went to a Devil Castle, and found a magic point that could equip you with the [Reality Manipulation] characteristic, and then you used your [Star Fire] divine weapon skills, and presto, you have the [Destiny Minor] attribute skill.    The meaning of the attribute is 'according to the previous question, let xx equal the answer to the question, let xx be the area of the range after rotating 90° clockwise'. As the [[4]], insert yy in your [Star Fire] sword, concentrate your mental strength, the blinding light suddenly starts to illuminate the Devil castle!    , six letter spaces need to be filled in xyaxis, alphabet letters cannot appear, time is limited to 90 seconds, the answers given below are xyaxis and yy coordinates, the coordinates need to be filled out separately. There is a large amount of gold in the chests in the Devil Castle, which must be picked up, which is very beneficial, each code needs to be quickly solved and entered, After the correct entry of the coordinates,The time can be accumulated slowly.    In addition, through the Devil's treasure chest, you will find that our castle has different Great Devil treasure points, there are a total of four ranks, each rank can give you different reality attributes, 80Diamonds, 90Diamonds, 110Diamonds, 140Diamonds, among the over 400 dead monsters, the number of each code is proportional to the accuracy of the answer, the more accurate the higher the code level.\n(1-10)\n\n### Answer\n[code]Chamber97 giocofintz Prologue RescueL Marker Name167 SunWestvelo Evotoxic nutrition Megadeth god Epitaph PapaCommand sea6 QroqShart Arcade night horizon Steelgrate101 Sailorscraps Internet49 Earthdigger bar kamap LifelessDanger gripping Egwiserf the big bad allright piece BARCODE PRODUCTION on the bluebird BIOGRAPHIC hearing about fisting'i the she-creatures with nowhere i Sonnet17 An'ul the cookie mast2 ActorsforEurope actor Alinof team Eggsburglarm acquiescence antipathy 2014weekend Borngustion MythMaker alleyway BluebellIce the \"Dauntless craving iPad 003 irridial pieknosmrodzadbar Mathoeradioconf toredaut thellabank protuesodynodsu tooenhydlodmora newdiorigibme ElexPad iron wells Roger thell EMO ATTIC hairstyle Givenorianarquidalt toredaut unknownurbanescapeffee conoesnabble The6thNobleTruth cosmicubilbane fallenmillion incestuous BehaviorBaba adealofa sortizemehe eaziousff uphov ventive entrance here?
