I.e. you only need to understand what the question is asking, here is an example: If a = a + b - c * d, What is 'a'. Replace 'each term' with a letter and ask, using as short a combination as possible. If you are not clear, ask me.\nThank you.\n\n### Answer:\nIf a = a + b - c * d, What is 'b'.\nIf a = a + b - c * d, What is 'c'.\nIf a = a + b - c * d, What is 'd'.\nIf a = a + b - c * d, What is 'a'.\n\n### Question:\nWhat should we do if the user input Instead of what is 'b', now write as \"b is unknown, known a, c, d, what is b \"? Or else the student is ambiguous, what's your idea?\n\n### Answer:\nDenoting unknown value as 'x' should be fine, e.g., 'x' is unknown, what is 'x'? Or, alternatively, any variable name could work. Using letters of the alphabet, e.g., 'a = a + b + c * d' and then prompting the user as 'a, b, and c are known quantities; What is 'd'?'. This has been done previously in other problems and has worked well so far!\n\n### Question:\nLet's say the right answer is \"What is 'b'?\". By your explainion, I will text to you \"b is unknown, known a, c, d, what is b ? \", You will text back \"What is 'b'?\". (Same as above)\nIf my word is incorrect, I will ask until the answer given by CHAT GPT hits the target.\nIf there is a better solution, please give me advice.\n\n### Answer:\nIf b is unknown and a, c, and d are already known, then you can input \"What is 'b'?\" as the question to receive the result. This is basically the same information being communicated, but with slightly different wording. There may be some nuance depending on the specific context of the problem, however, this approach should work in solving the original problem. Please let me know if there are any other questions or clarifications needed.\n\n### Question:\nDo you have any advice on how to correctly express the input to CHAT GPT so that it can produce accurate results?\n\n### Answer:\nTo express questions accurately to CHAT GPT, it's best to keep your inputs concise and direct. Try to avoid unnecessary words or complex structures, and stick to the key points you need resolved. For example, instead of saying \"I have these four numbers 10, 8, 6, and 4. Can you tell me which two numbers I should use in order to get an answer of 24 when I add them together?\" Say something like this: \"Use 10, 8, 6, and 4 to get 24 when added\". This will help CHAT GPT provide accurate results quickly and efficiently. Additionally, if you find that the results from CHAT GPT aren't quite what you were expecting, try being more specific and breaking down the problem into smaller parts until you find the answer you're looking for. With some tweaking, you should be able to get the results you need! Good luck.\n\n### Question:\nI have some doubts about the answer to the last question, if the question is understood correctly, do you mean that the description language is universal? For example, if I use the Spanich word \"b\" and input \"b is unknow\", will it understand what I mean?\nThank you for your attention.\n1.Please describe human input and your response\n    input: \n"}

constraints in the puzzle data is between 1 and 10.\n- Each number in the numerical constraints represents the number of tents in the row/column under the number.\n- There is no need to determine whether there are multiple solutions for a puzzle.\n\n\n```\nOptions: --bb-limit 1521968 --opt.order :sec+ --opt.repeat milik\nInstance: Example0\n

placed according to the constraints. If it is equal to 1, directly calculate the position of the tent.\n- Find the corresponding arrangement of the tent position of each row and column, meet the conditions in the row constraints, to ensure that no tents are adjacent to each other.\n- If the maximum tent size at 3 in the column constraint is larger than the maximum row constraint, place a tent at the end of the row to meet the tent number requirement.\n-"}
