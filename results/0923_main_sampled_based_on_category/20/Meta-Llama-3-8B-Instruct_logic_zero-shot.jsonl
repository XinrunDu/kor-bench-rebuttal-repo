Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given logic rule, I will analyze the statement \"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\n* Subject (S): Pencils\n* Predicate (P): Not pens\n* Connective (C): \"are not\" (Negative connective)\n* Quantifier (Q): \"All\" (Universal quantifier)\n\nThe statement can be rewritten in the logical form as \"No P are Q,\" which falls under the category of Universal Negative (E).

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Using the C-Reasoning Rule, we can infer that:\n\n`C(F, 180/200, 210/300)`, which implies that:\n\n`Pr(F, P1) \u2248 Pr(F, P2)`\n\nThis symbolization indicates that the proportion of satisfied students in School X (`P1`) is approximately equal to the proportion of satisfied students in School Y (`P2`)."}
