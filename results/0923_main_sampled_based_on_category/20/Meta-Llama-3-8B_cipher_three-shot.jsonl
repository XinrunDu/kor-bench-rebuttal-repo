The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Calculate x * k_q_x as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Compute z = c // k_q_x. where // is used in integer division operations to return the integer part of the quotient (i.e., the result of removing the fractional part).\n        - Based on the decimal number represented by z, use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
