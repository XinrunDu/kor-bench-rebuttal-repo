The operation $ means select the smaller of the two numbers. So, (3 $ 2) = 2.\n\nNow, the equation becomes (X § 4) + 2 = 10.\n\nNext, we isolate (X § 4) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n(X § 4) = 10 - 2\n(X § 4) = 8\n\nThe operation § means select the larger of the two numbers. Since (X § 4) = 8, it means that the larger of X and 4 is 8.\n\nFor X to satisfy this condition, X must be greater than or equal to 8, since 8 is the larger number. However, we also consider the scenario where X could be any number larger than 4 but the operation § will always result in 8 being selected if the other number is 4. This misunderstanding needs correction as it does not align with the original analysis of how § operates. \n\nCorrectly, if X were less than 8 but greater than 4, (X § 4) would still equal X because X is larger than 4 in that range, but it wouldn't satisfy (X § 4) = 8 unless X is exactly 8 or more, in which case it would indeed be 8 or more that's selected, fulfilling the requirement of the operation.\n\nHowever, given the operation's definition and the requirement for (X § 4) to equal 8, it actually indicates X must be exactly 8 or more because the operation selects the larger number, and we have established that the larger number is 8. If X were less than 8, even if greater than 4, it wouldn't fulfill the given equation correctly as per the defined operation § unless it is exactly 8. Therefore, X must be greater than or equal to 8 to ensure that the larger number selected by § is indeed 8, aligning with the equation's requirement.\n\nThe correct interpretation should be that X must be greater than or equal to 8 because only then does the operation § yield 8 as required by the equation.\n\nThus, the answer should be correctly framed as:\n[[X ≥ 8]]"}

So, we rewrite the equation as log_X(512) + log_512(X) = 82/9.\n\n## Step 3: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation\nUsing the property of logarithms, log_a(b) = 1/log_b(a), we can rewrite the equation as 1/log_512(X) + log_512(X) = 82/9.\n\n## Step 4: Recognize the relationship between 512 and a power of 2\nRecognize that 512 is equal to 2^9. This can help simplify the calculation of the logarithm.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute 2^9 for 512 in the equation and solve for log_512(X)\nSince 512 = 2^9, we can rewrite the equation in terms of base 2, considering log_512(X) as log_2(X)/log_2(512), which simplifies to log_2(X)/9.\n\n## Step 6: Set up the equation using the logarithmic properties and the base change\nSubstitute log_2(X)/9 for log_512(X) in the equation 1/log_512(X) + log_512(X) = 82/9. This results in 9/log_2(X) + log_2(X)/9 = 82/9.\n\n## Step 7: Multiply the entire equation by 9 to eliminate the denominator\nMultiplying by 9 gives 81/log_2(X) + log_2(X) = 82.\n\n## Step 8: Rearrange the equation into a quadratic form\nLet log_2(X) = y. Then, the equation becomes 81/y + y = 82, which can be rearranged into y^2 - 82y + 81 = 0.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the quadratic equation for y\nThe quadratic equation y^2 - 82y + 81 = 0 can be solved for y. However, given the format of the problem, the solution for this step will lead directly to finding X, so we look for a straightforward factorable solution or apply the quadratic formula.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the quadratic formula since the equation doesn't factor easily\nThe quadratic formula is y = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -82, and c = 81. Applying the formula gives y = (82 ± √((-82)^2 - 4*1*81)) / 2*1.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the discriminant and solve for y\nCalculating the discriminant: 6724 - 324 = 6400. Then, y = (82 ± √6400) / 2 = (82 ± 80) / 2. This gives two solutions for y: y = 81 or y = 1.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for X from the positive value of y\nSince y = log_2(X), and considering the positive solution that fits the context of the problem (as logarithms of negative numbers or zero are undefined in real numbers), we use y = 9 (which was an incorrect assumption in simplification; the correct step should directly relate to solving for X from log_2(X) = y, focusing on feasible integer solutions for X).\n\n## Step 13: Correct the approach by focusing on solving for X from the feasible logarithmic equation\nGiven the misstep in solving the quadratic equation and assigning a value to y, we should instead directly solve for X from the correct relationship of logarithms and the given equation, focusing on the fact that 512 = 2^9 and how X relates to this in the original equation.\n\n## Step 14: Revisit the original equation with the correct approach\nGiven the confusion in the steps above and the format required for solving, let's correct the path by directly addressing the solution for X based on the given equation and the properties of logarithms, keeping in mind the need for a numerical answer that fits the problem's constraints.\n\n## Step 15: Directly solve for X using the correct logarithmic properties and given equation\nConsidering the equation 512￠X = 82/9 and the definition of the operation, we aim to find X such that the logarithmic equation holds true, considering the base and the result.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$"}

Use '≤' for less than or equal to, and '≥' for greater than or equal to. Separate conditions with 'or' if there are multiple conditions.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[you answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To compute A￡B according to the given operation rule A￡B = (A∪B) - (A∩B), let's break down the sets A and B and then apply the rule step by step.\n\nA = {x∣x is a real number}, which means A includes all real numbers.\nB = {x∣x^2 < 1}, which simplifies to B = {x∣-1 < x < 1} because the square of any real number cannot be negative, and only numbers between -1 and 1 (excluding -1 and 1) squared will result in a value less than 1.\n\nNow, applying the operation rule:\n\n1. **Union (A∪B):** The union of A and B includes all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. Since A contains all real numbers, A∪B will simply be A, because all elements of B are already included in A. Thus, A∪B = {x∣x is a real number}.\n\n2. **Intersection (A∩B):** The intersection of A and B includes all elements that are in both A and B. Since B is a subset of A (all elements of B are also in A), A∩B will simply be B, which is {x∣-1 < x < 1}.\n\n3. **Difference (A∪B) - (A∩B):** This operation removes from the union all elements that are in the intersection. So, we remove from A (which is the same as A∪B) all elements of B (which is A∩B). This leaves us with all real numbers except those between -1 and 1 (excluding the endpoints).\n\nTherefore, A￡B = {x∣x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 1}.\n\n[[{x∣x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 1}]]"}

Given A and B, since B is entirely a subset of A (all positive numbers are natural numbers, but note that some definitions may vary on whether 0 is included in natural numbers; here we consider 0 as a natural number), the union is simply set A itself.\n\nA∪B = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}\n\n### Step 2: Find the Intersection (A∩B)\n\nThe intersection of two sets includes only the elements that are common in both sets. Since B is a subset of A, the intersection is simply B itself.\n\nA∩B = {1, 2, 3, ...}\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Operation Rule\n\nNow, apply the operation rule A￡B = (A∪B) - (A∩B). This means we remove the intersection from the union.\n\nA￡B = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} - {1, 2, 3, ...} = {0}\n\nTherefore, applying the operation rule results in a set containing only the number 0, because 0 is the only element in set A that is not in set B.\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[{0}]]"}

The function g(x) is given as x, and its derivative g'(x) is 1.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the operation rule to find f□g.\nUsing the operation rule f□g = f'(x) + g'(x), we substitute the derivatives found in Step 1. Therefore, f□g = sec^2(x) + 1.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate the expression for f□g at x = π/4.\nTo find the value of f□g when x = π/4, we substitute x with π/4 in the expression from Step 2. So, f□g = sec^2(π/4) + 1. Since sec(π/4) = √2, we have sec^2(π/4) = 2.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the final value.\nSubstitute sec^2(π/4) = 2 into the expression from Step 3.
