If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nResolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment are as follows:\n1. Input: Conjunctive normal form S.\n2. Output: If S has a satisfying assignment, output “Plausible”; otherwise, output “Implausible”.\n3. Steps:\n    1. Initialization:\n        - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n        - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in S.\n    2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n        - For each simple disjunctive clause C1 in S0 and each simple disjunctive clause C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “Implausible” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n        - For each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1:\n            - If C1 and C2 can be resolved, calculate C = dispel(C1, C2).\n            - If C = 0, output “Implausible” and terminate the calculation.\n            - If neither S0 nor S1 contains C, add C to S2.\n    4. Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output “Plausible” and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nCan clauses C1 = ¬p ∨¬q and C2 = q ∨ ¬r be resolved?\nA.

Note that in formal deductive reasoning, any binary predicate, say the < predicate, can be described by the equality predicate (e.g., x<y ⇔ (∃z)(∃w)((x+z=y) & (∼z=0))).\n\nSo we can use two fixed quantifiers to \"fix\" two parameters in the < predicate as two fixed constants. Similarly, any binary predicate can be rewritten as a combination of a quaternary predicate and two fixed quantifiers. So in general there's no need to add new symbols to our logical system for variables and unknowns besides the usual connectives and quantifiers!\n\nNow we're ready to rewrite the proposition symbolically without introducing any more extraneous symbols such as ∧,∨,¬,⇒,⟺,etc. We just use the usual propositional operations along with some temporary auxiliary symbols."}

It is quite possible that for the bot there is not enough context to back off from the syllogistic reasoning mode and it attempts to replace the variables absentmindedly, as the pressure to follow examples with the same mood is strong.\n\nHowever, even in such a state, the bot at least partially succeeds. At first, it writes out the mood properly, even though it fails to explicitly designate it as 4th figure. Still, this mood information implies the figure. Afterwards, while filling in the moods, while it initially applies the rules without regard to the syllogistic constraints, when explicitly told to conform to a specific syllogism, it succeeds with no problem.\n\nIt is relevant to note that various testing showed that it is incapable to deduce, similarly to the case of the previous problem - that the syllogism is in the 4th figure, which is odd because the figure is heavily implied by the valid moods.\n\n### Example 1\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cO5NaY0V0H8?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n### Example 2\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3YUs6NN51PQ?list=PLt9OvYbEsvEuuSlJaWjPKaMTrFbDCIhQ3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nWhile the bot is doing fairly well in syllogistically designated instances, it fails to directly conclude from freely worded premises and conclusions which figure and mood the syllogism is.\n"}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `∀x ∈ P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) ≈ k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) ≈ Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a random sample of 15 people from a company, all were found to have completed their annual training. According to the U-Generalization Rule, estimate the proportion of the entire company that would be expected to have completed their annual training if the company has 200 employees.\n\nGive your answer in [[number%]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[100%]]\n\n### Question:\nA quality check was conducted in a factory over 8 randomly selected hours, and it was found that 6 of the hours had the defect rate below 2%. Using the P-Generalization rule, estimate the proportion of hours in which the defect rate was below 2% for the factory.\n\nGive your answer in [[number%]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[75%]]\n\n### Question:\nIn a study on dietary habits, 120 out of 150 participants in Group A reported consuming at least 5 servings of vegetables per week, and 80 out of 100 participants in Group B reported the same dietary habit.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, denote the attribute 'vegetable consumption' as V.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolized to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[IfC(V,120/150,80/100),thenPr(V,G1)≈Pr(V,G2)]]\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[IfC(F,180/200,210/300),thenPr(F,S1)≈Pr(F,S2)]]\n```"}
