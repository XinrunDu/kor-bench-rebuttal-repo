Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"EFBCRGLXTUS\"\nperiod: 2\nincrement: 4\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The row is the 3rd row, and the column is the 1st column, (3,1) at the letter G, but given that the row and column are represented as header and footer, under the correct row is 'G', so WB decrypted to G, then when looking at where G was on the grid that would tell us the decrypted text is \"G\", is incorrect.\n\n\nGiven the position that WB encrypted from, we would need to look for a match based on the row (W header) and the correct column, column should be represented by the bottom letter I not B so going left to right from bottom letter of I, B is the 4th letter.\n\n\n## Step 4: Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two\nThe row is the 3rd row, and the column with I at the bottom is the letter at the 3rd position (D does not have footer I) that would make the column with footer I 5 positions.

The ASCII value of \"C\" is 67.\n2.  Compute `y = x^e mod n`, where `x = 67`, `e = 263`, and `n = 299`.\n\nWe need to calculate `67^263 mod 299`.\n\nTo perform this computation efficiently, we can use modular exponentiation or a calculator. After calculating, we get:\n\n`67^263 mod 299 = 199`\n\nSo, the encrypted ciphertext for \"C\" is 199.\n\nEncapsulating the result in double square brackets as per the requirements:\n\n\n[[199]]"}
