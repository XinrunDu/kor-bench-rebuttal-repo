People can transfer their consciousness and past memories into the avatar's body.\nThe Na'vi believe in living in harmony with and reverence for nature, that all energy is borrowed and must one day be returned, and that depriving an animal of its life in order to survive is an act of necessity.\nThe human corporation, RDA Resource Development Administration, has built a high-speed magnetic levitation train rapid transit system around the world that consumes large amounts of superconducting material.\nPandora has a strong magnetic field, so the Na'vi avoided metal materials for their decorations, clothing, and weapons; they mostly used bones, crystals, and leather to make items\nIf you imagine Pandora as a living being, then Eywa is the consciousness of that living being, and she guides all life in Pandora, connecting the consciousness of all creatures through the forest and communicating with each other.\nLeonopteryx was one of the most spectacular animals on Pandora, and Navy people called him Toruk, which means Final Shadow. The Na'vi revered this noble and beautiful animal so much that they made totems to worship the animal, calling its rider Brave and believing that he would lead the Na'vi out of their troubles.\nThe Spirit Tree is the most sacred tree of the soul in the hearts of the Na'vi and can create a link to Ava through rituals. It allows living Na'vi to hear the memories of their ancestors\nThe story of Avatar takes place around the year 2154, when the Earth's resources are becoming increasingly scarce and air pollution is rampant in cities.\nWith the development of human society, in order to better improve efficiency and ease traffic congestion, the RDA Corporation decided to send an interstellar fleet to the planet of Pandora after the Earthstar expedition landed on Pandora in 2129 and discovered Unobtanium.\nIn order to limit the military power of the Secops, the Interplanetary Commerce Administration banned the Secops from using weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of advanced equipment, and many of the most basic military equipment were from the yard sale.\nHearts and Minds is a program of human contact with the Na'vi using avatar bodies, in which humans attempt to establish friendly relations with the Na'vi through language communication, cultural learning, education, and other forms of civilized exchange.\n\n### Question:\nIn what situation may a mountain float?

You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes. We have... ... dragons.\nBerk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. The Dragon Riders then start riding their dragons to catch the sheep.\nHiccup participated in founding the Dragon Academy at the age of 15, where dragon riders at Berk Dragon Academy learn how to train dragons, including the skill of flying on dragonback.\nThe Isle of Berk is an island located in the Barbaric Archipelago, serving as the primary setting for the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series. Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Based on the available information, it is evident that both Type A Hail events and Type B Snowfall events have occurred in the past. During the analysis, we discovered that the occurrence of Type C Fog was linked to Type D Rain events in the past. However, we encountered a unique phenomenon where Type E Drizzle occurred during the buildup of Type F Winds.\nOur insights suggest that the probability of encountering a storm with all four elements is highest during the Type A-1 timeframe, and the same storm structure appears to repeat during the Type Z-1 period. Furthermore, we observed that the combination of Type G-1 and Type H-2 storms produced catastrophic results in the past, whereas Type I-1 events are more common during calm weather times.\nWe will strive to refine our analysis through continuous monitoring of the newer weather data that has been obtained after the implementation of the aerowinds system. Our overall objective is to create an effective and user-friendly forecast model for future storm warnings.\n\n### Answer:\n[[H-2]]"}

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

In order to protect his mother and the villagers, the scarecrow fought fiercely against the mage, and after slaying the mage, committed suicide while surrounded by a strange magid spell. The prince of the neighboring country, after successively ascending the throne, located himself as the king of Xijiang.\n2. The next day, due to the change in the power balance and the king's unwillingness to continue the war, it was decided that the envoy of the neighboring country led by the prince would come to the capital to express their best wishes and end the war.\n3. Therefore, the king, at the request of the king of the adjacent country, requested that the witch of the waste, who was responsible for laying curses on Sophie and was put under the guard of the palace, negotiate with the witch of the waste the removal of the curse and the safe return of the three knights.\n4. However, Sophie, immobilized by the curse, refused to recognize the king herself, until certain words rubbed Sophie's memory, but nothing happened until Sophie went back in time when the flame demon and the scarecrow came to her assistance.\n5. Sophie returned to the present with the three heroes. The counselor of the castle, upon hearing about this, accused Sophie's lack of political insight and royal qualifications and declared her unfit for her position.\n6. After the CG's attempt to falsely accuse Sophie failed, Sophie used one of the lady's mail to reveal that the three heroes in the book are allies and familiars of the counselor.\n7. In the confusion caused by the revelation that the counselor's side was actually hostile, Sophie revealed the royal advisor's true identity as the witch of the waste and ordered the barbarian creatures to surround the palace.\n8. After being hunted down by the puppet's troops and thirsty for revenge, the witch of the waste was caught by commando troops that Sophie knew in advance.\n9. After the witch of the waste was caught, she was interrogated by the king and vowed to support the king in future matters.\n10. After the capture of bad guys, Sophie broke the novelty curse necklace left behind by the witch of the waste and restored herself to her youthful self, officially becoming the royal maid of Xijiang.\n11. Sophie, with the help of her husband, made a big accusation against the witch of the waste, which made her self-righteous, but the queen chose to umbrella the little princess Sophie, who was standing next to Howl on the excuse of staying with the queen.\n12. Howl, who was tired of all this, asked Sophie to take care of herself and her own safety, forcing Sophie to agree.\n13. The baby Aphasia can only speak in nonverbal language. In order to stimulate her to speak, Howl pretended to be a chicken, sensationalizing the scene of the painter hitting the chicken and habiting her language ability to learn how to count well.\n14. Sophie, who has always lacked political imagination, is at a loss. After listening to the queen's entourage, she knows that the queen's execution plan cannot be ressurected and must be properly verified.\n15. The first to bring experiments and blue testing, after many invocations and failures, the mage chose to ask all the mages who were cursed with the novice necklace to take the spring.\n16. Calcifer, who had long become used to the life of the castle, remained in the palace for a long time and, under the guidance of the mission bearer, began to think about how to go back to the adventure.\n17. Finally, concealing her real identity, Sophie filed lawsuits and brought legal charges against Howl. After confirming that the evidence was accurate, the trial decided that the defendant, whom Howl was accused of, should be sentenced to death.\n18. Sophie was overwhelmed by the harsh sentiment and finally decided to reveal her identity and express the truth, but the stone characters outside Howl's mouth were already moving out and making decisions on Howl's behalf.\n19. The evildoer, as the only one left in Howl, cut his throat to hang himself and finally die in confusion. The evil-minded ressurector, who was in charge of the provisional administration of Howl at this time, secretly said that although it didn't work, through various ways he has gained a deep understanding of Howl, and the knowledge Sophie is relatively lacking.\n20.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles).
