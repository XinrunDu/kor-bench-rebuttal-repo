The operation rule defines that a◇b= a^b, where a and b are positive integers. The number you should answer is the right-hand side of the question.\n\nDuring the exercise, you learned the new operation notation and function name, and mastered the rule through questions that gradually grow in difficulty. In the end, it tested your ability to differentiate right from wrong in identifying the correct answer, and you found that when solving practice and test questions in a problem-solving environment, the answer usually displayed in the right format and that you did not need to mess with additional formatting. In doing the problem, you used your logical reasoning skills to solve, analyze the situation, and find the right answer. When it comes to the answer without the right-hand side of the question, you judged the answer using the rule or Desmos according to the hint.\n\nIn a professional framework, you solve this type of problem, not only to test your own ability but also to enhance your ability to apply common sense, process information, analyze the situation, and think logically. You check your guess to ensure that you get the correct answer using a simple Euclidean algorithm.\n\n#### PREREQUISITES\n\n✔️ You understand algorithms.\n\n✔️ You understand programming logic.\n\n✔️ You understand basic mathematics.\n\n#### WRITE YOUR ANSWER\n\nPlease remember to mark your answer in the frame provided by Examples. The frame begins with # <answer> ... and ends with </answer>. Also, please mark the frame with <answer-<number of answer>> in the front and </answer> in the end. For example, Answer to Question 10\n\n#### Answer to Question 10\n\n```\n<answer-10>\n\n----- WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE --------\n\n</answer>\n```\n\nThe answer should include scientific notation.\n\n#### CONTANTACTS\n\nIf you need any assistance on this topic, please email support@indolearn.online."}
