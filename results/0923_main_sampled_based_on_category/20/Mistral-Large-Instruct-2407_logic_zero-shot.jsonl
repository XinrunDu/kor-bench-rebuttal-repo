If we apply the formula \\( p \\rightarrow \\$p \\) to this proposition, it tells us that if \\( p \\) is true, then \\( \\$p \\) (it is possible that \\( p \\)) must also be true.\n\nThe given statement \"There is necessarily a connection between things\" implies that \\( \\#p \\) (it is necessary that \\( p \\)) is true.\n\nSince necessity implies truth, if \\( \\#p \\) is true, then \\( p \\) is true as per the inference \\( \\#p \\rightarrow p \\) (which is a commonly understood implication in modal logic).\n\nGiven that \\( p \\) is true and using formula 15 (\\( p \\rightarrow \\$p \\)), it follows that \\( \\$p \\) is also true.\n\nSo, the correct inference is that \"There might be a connection between things\" because \\( \\$p \\) means it is possible that \\( p \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ [[B]] \\]"}

Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"A particle collider is an experimental device that increases the effective interaction energy of particles by colliding two beams of particles moving in opposite directions.\"\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [[C]]"}
