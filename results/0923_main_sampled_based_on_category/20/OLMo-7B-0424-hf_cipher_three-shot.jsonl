Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

This is necessary to avoid strings of errors and exceptions appearing at the top of the output file when the tests are run on Oppia others' code. This section explains why you may need to perform some steps strictly related to the code comprehension of your solution to the questions above.\n\n### Start by ensuring that your submission code is compliable\nWe require you to make sure that your submission code is capable of compiling, without warnings from the compiler. If you need to add code to enable full compliance with the requirements, make sure you add as much information as possible and link to this documentation.\n\nFor more detailed tips on how to write cleaner code check the [Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).\n\n### Always start with some boilerplate \n\nThe first thing we require from your file is some boilerplate. Your snippet needs to include the following:  \n- a docstring\n- a license comment\n- a required imports section\n- a comments header\n\nEven though these are not strictly required for the tests they are being required because they are part of the necessary structure and code convention  above, you need to satisfy these requirements in order to pass the tests.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n| Object oriented cipher methods for Pgowb\n| Author: Lienest.Olivier_Wind\n| Copyright 2020, [<NAME>, Wind, <NAME>]\n| Licensed under AGPLv3 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nIMPORTS\n\nclass TestCipher(unittest.TestCase):\n    #######################\n    # RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    # ENVIRONMENT = ['local', 'production', 'IPAWs']\n    # TEST_CIPHER = {'arg0': ['console', 'stdout'], 'arg2': ['cli', 'console, 'random']}\n    # RULES='enc', 'dec'\n    #######################\n    #\n    # alias coconut = mtime()\n    # list algos = ['AES', 'DES', 'Blowfish', 'CAST128', 'EOF', 'GFS], 'const', 'mVDeftext', 'MAUtomatic']\n    # const chunk_len = 1024\n    # tuple KEY = const 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #\n    ################### Pgutchette begins\n    # @override func configure(envObj:dyxspace.ISDK.sampleenvobj) {\n    #     super.configure(envObj, s_key: KEY)\n    # }\n    # @override func message(info:IGenerateMessage) -> IGenerateMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     return info.byteMessage(bytes: msgRng.UTF8).$UInt8(msgRng.count)\n    # }\n    # @override func messageTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     self.configure(info);\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m0: msgRng)\n    # }\n    # @override func cipherEngine(info:IEngineMessage) -> IEngineMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     let ctx = 'InvBatch'\n    #     return info.engineMessage(mInfo: msgRng, sContext: ctx)\n    # }\n    # @override func cmpTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IUtf8String {\n    #     return R\"asdfasdfasdf\".to_utf8()\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsObj(info: IUt2Veek) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #     let pwD = info.ut2v_i('InvBatch', \"\")\n    #     return info.set_ut2v_i('invBatch', std::string(pwD, \"\"))\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     let props = msgRng.utf8String()\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(mInfo: props, sContext: \"invBatch\").$0n\n    # }\n    # @override func simArgsTable(info:IETable) -> IETable {\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m_as_i: 'asdfasdfasdf')\n    # }\n    #function main() -> [()] {\n    #    var args: CmArgs = args_table()\n    #    return expandargs(args)\n    #}\n    #\n    #\n    #\n    # class TestPRNG(IPowbObjects.IPowbObjectsTest):\n    #     @override function ctor() {\n    #         self.suite = 'rand';\n    #         self.buildFieldsAdmin(env: 'env', alias: 'envObj', class: 'sampleenvinit');\n    #     }\n    #     @override function m0(self: 'test', alias: 'target', s: Any) -> 's': Any {\n    #\n    #         let args = ['pub', 'alex', 'testing', 'code'];\n    #         self.set_ut2v_i('test', args);\n    #         var coro = s::rng_coilin;\n    #         return coro.repo;\n    #     }\n    #     @override function msg(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         self.suite = msg :: envobj.get(info) :: test;\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function table(info: IUt2Veek) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #         self.suite = info :: msg :: envobj.get(info);\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function cmp(info: IMessagesTable) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #         self.suite = info :: cbiz :: sce.get(info);\n    #         let rngR = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #         var random = randomrng(rngrng)\n    #         if null != (val) => rngR;\n    #             return ssim(rng :: random);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function secretsTable(**p: IUt2VEncry) -> IUt2VEncry {\n    #         self.suite = p :: csSuite();\n    #         var random = randomrng(p::randrng())\n    #         return ssim(random);\n    #     }\n    #     function seedrng(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         let sce = p::gs::sampleenvobj().getenvobj();\n    #         let invrng = p::getenvobj();\n    #         if true == (hasenv(invrng)) => {"}

T test cases follow. \n- Each test case contains two space-separated integers, ‰ and n. n represents the number of indices to print, and ‰ is the surrounding character to the paths.\n## Output Format\n- For each test case, output — the chart printing the 'n' lines, followed by '-' as many times as the width of the screen, followed by \"| |\" as many times as the height of the screen.\n- The radius of the star (‘|’) is set to 16.5. Print exactly 16.5. If this causes you to lose more than one character of the '✳️' shape, print exactly 16.5 and pivot the '✳️' shape downwards to fill the width of the chart.\n## Sample\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to Expand and View Sample Output</summary>\n## Sample Input 0\n```\n6\n5 3\n2 5\n4 5\n10 5\n10000 5\n2000000 5\n```\n## Sample Output 0\n```\n| | |\n| | |\n| | |\n| | |\n| | ✳️|\n| | | |\n| | | | |\n| | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | | | | P | M | X | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ✳️|\n| | |"}

A prime sieve is a process that uses a sequence of numbers as a filter to generate the next sequence of prime numbers. The next sequence starts from the square of the previous sequence endpoints, such as 2, 9 is a prime sieve. Prime sieve uses a sieve to make numbers equally divided into two parts: a whole number and a residue. Primes that cannot be divided by a prime sieve are called BFS and other prime numbers are called news, here four-bit sieve is used. First, the four numbers 1 through 4 are arranged on an horizontal line, and then sets a variable L to bars of length 4, and the smallest prime number in this variable is present in the entire sequence. For example, the first four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Take them to the first half, get a pair \"1, 2\", \"3 4\". The following diagram will make it clearer.2 1 2 3 4 L 19355743220896780129 4235936460301365123561 3278963671623130012723 513 01 2 0 1 2 0 3 1 Q3 0\n\n### Input Format:\nTwo levels of input. The first line contains a positive integer n (the radius of the square of the square). Second line input n space-separated integers. The second line also enters n space separated integers x 1 . .. . x n (The number of prime residual limits cannot exceed 20,000).\n\n### Output Format:\nOutput the square array A.We note that there are smaller prime divisors than 2, 3 and 5. A[i][j] = 1 means that you have to move to the fourth number. A[i][j] = 0 does not have to move on the number of four. We also note that: there may be no dv+1 or empty sequence.\n\n##8367\n(D"}

The sixth character to every uppercase letter is 'a', with the seventh and last letter (the last vowel) being 'b'.\n    - Replace every other character that appears in the plaintext with a corresponding letter in the phrase (based on the position of that character in the pattern), encoded as shown in the table.\n    - Since the encryption rules are OR, replace the duplicate character near the decimal point, i.e., '/'.\n- Special Operations:\n    - To search for a phrase, use the search method to search for a phrase instead of using a regular expression.\n    - Every phrase must include 'dick'. If there is no such phrase, modify the pattern according to the existing phrases, so that 'dick' can be added to the last alphabet.\n    - If it is not possible to add 'dick' using the above method, add 'dick' to the last alphabet in 'th' form, with the lowest letter being lowercase.\n- Examples:\n    - \"frank. colonel. special operation. the\"\n    - [[4.6.3.2/frank.col.spec.op.the]].\n    - \"operation. john\"\n    - [[5/operation.john]].\n    - \"operation. dick. dick. dick. dick. dick\"\n    - [[5/operation.dick.dick.dick.dick.dick]].\n    - \"AC\"\n    - [[CCC/CC]].\n    - \"0.0001\"\n    - [[6/0.0001]].\n    - \"123456789012 /dick/1111/ operation\".\n    - [[123.456.789.012/dick/1111/ op.tion]].\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Therefore, it is safe to assume that an incomplete sentence is not a good combination. All possible combinations must have been accepted and compared, and are:\n\nSo, the length of the current question is: 37 characters. The length of the sentence is 16 and the last integer is 10.\n\nTherefore, your job now is to subtract: 10-16=6 (you are always right)\n\nAs a result, the final result will be the result of the hashed combination with the hashed answer. Therefore, \"6\" will be the answer of the encrypted identity.\n\n### Question:\n\"MD\"\n\nRequesting information:\n\nSpecialty: Frank's Colonel Special Operations before performing a Background Check on military drugs in Dodrick Dick Dick Dick's operation.\n\neHarmony\n\neHarmony\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[HCVFRWH]]\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThis problem has two aspects.\n\n1. Ciphertext / Plaintext are mapped to each other.\n2. There are encryption and decryption operations.\n\nWhen the problem indicates that the ciphertext and the plaintext are not symmetrical, you can reduce the problem to the encryption and decryption operations. After the transformation is completed, the strings are symmetrical and look very close to the previous map operations. Therefore, the modern string manipulations can be regarded as the same as the problem's rotary transformations.\n\nIn addition, the current minimum O(1) or O(N2) complexity is not an effective solution. The main reason is the condition of CSP that the operations of reading and writing are restricted. And CSP is quite difficult to break without free access to read or write operations.\n\nHowever, you can solve this problem by:\n\n1. Preparing a maximum length of [plaintext] columns to store the plaintext and ciphertext items in a line of writing.\n2. Align the four rows of  \" \" and the four rows of \" # \".\n3. Align the even-numbered rows from right to left and the odd-numbered rows from left to right.\n4. Move all the multinational characters to other columns (not directed writing).\n5. Write on regular characters and the beginning of each multinational string.\n6. Transformation and reverse transformation are as close as possible under the limitation of restrictions.\n7. Any transformation after the restriction of CSP does not affect any content. You do not need to save all the convolution states to process reverse transformations.\n\nHope to see a variety of excellent solutions."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list:\n        - [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n        - The transposed sequence  list is used to write the plaintext in order one line at a time, and then the columns are adjusted according to the transposed sequence table so that the characters in each line are arranged in the given order.\n        - Columns count from 0.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - The [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3] transposed sequence table has a total of 7 bits, indicating that 7 letters should be written on a line.\n    - Write the plaintext in order, line by line, 7 per line. When there are less than 7, the last line is filled with $. A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"XNARZKEM\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Concatenate: Concatenate all the hexadecimal strings of the encrypted blocks to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A hexadecimal string representing the encrypted data (where A-E needs to be capitalised).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF'\n    - INV_S_BOX\n        - INV_S_BOX = {\n        0x0F: 0x00, 0x0A: 0x01, 0x07: 0x02, 0x05: 0x03,\n        0x09: 0x04, 0x03: 0x05, 0x0D: 0x06, 0x00: 0x07,\n        0x0E: 0x08, 0x08: 0x09, 0x04: 0x0A, 0x06: 0x0B,\n        0x01: 0x0C, 0x02: 0x0D, 0x0B: 0x0E, 0x0C: 0x0F\n        }\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Block Splitting: Divide the ciphertext into 16-character (8-byte) blocks (each block is 8 bytes long).\n    2. Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Given a specific problem the goal is to assess which model is the best performing and provide it's prediction results.\n\n### Task\nFor this task you should implement 4 models: Regression by Blinding Glass [1], Random Forest Regression [2], Gradient Tree Boosting Regression [3] and Golden Animal Regression Model [4]. \n\nYou can iteratively get predictions based on separate folds or using cvsplit option for each of the models. Also, it is possible to use a single test data for the 6th model as well. Finally, as a complication challenge you can predict a % for each row that represents the accuracy/error. For example, the ith row of the predicted score should be followed by the string \"%.2f%%\" % (1.0 - (accumulated_error[i] / total_accuracy) * 100 ). For example, the following command line:\n\npython run_simulator.py predict foo_test_set.tsv -m\nBlinding-overfit --model_type=single_forest -o\nThis will produce a csv file that also contains the % accuracy/error for the each row.\n\nConsidering that we have 2000 samples this should produce a not very large csv file, for example:\n\ncol1,col2,col3,col4,col5 ,accuracy_error_%\nsample1_id,0.02752121729,0.03926300894,0.43513002092,0.30818488046,-8.436469481717316%\nsample2_id,0.21728564019,0.0303175483,0.383144611169,0.34849247355,3.7031404908763926%\nand so on.\n\n1.

To generate p (the initial vector), we first need to know the length of the plaintext. You might need to calculate the length of the string in python — len() — and set p to be 1230 if the length is that exact.\n    \n    2. Next, you might also need to get the “start offset” currently not specified. [It’s because the start offset is only needed when calculating subkeys.] The offset, just like the “p”, needs to be 1230 (almost p), if the length of the string (decryption input) is that exact.\n    \n    3. Calculate the sub-key following the encryption rule, as follows:\n    \n    s_k_n = 00101010·(G)·ρ·s_n·G·00100101MOD(2^5)\n    \n    Therefore, “λ” in the below:\n        \n    0x3 = 3 (decimal)\n    0x2 ^ (5 * 2^2) = 0x10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary)\n    0x28 * 0x3 = 08 (decimal) = 0010 (binary)\n    0x10 = (3 - 1) * 5 = 6 (decimal)\n    0x3 * 0x10 = 0x30 = 30 (decimal)\n        \n    You then need to follow the encryption rule in the rules.
