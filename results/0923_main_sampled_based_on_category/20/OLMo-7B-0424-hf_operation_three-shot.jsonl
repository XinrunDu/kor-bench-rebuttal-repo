Your boss asked you to attend a meeting for a grant proposal. Below is a part of his proposal. Could you, please, comment on if the data provided in this proposal are valid?\n\n### Instructions:\n\nThere may be values in either a sample or population that are extremely high or lower than the others. Observations that do not appear appropriate for the distribution of the data are known as outliers. Such observations can influence the results of a statistical analysis negatively. Outliers distort an average value and a variety of measures obtained from them in the sample.\nSometimes, they are the results of data entry errors, while in other cases it is reasonable or it is an intentional decision to eliminate extreme values in the analyzed feature. It may also be a protection mechanism to filter out bad data. In such cases, however, it is necessary to consider a reduced sample only.\nThis is true particularly in the context of experimental studies where it is very often necessary to remove outliers from the group of examined patients as this group tends towards the boundaries of deviance. In addition, observational datasets with no particular subject are often treated using some recommendations to validate the selected outliers through moderating and exploratory data analysis.\n\n**For this certificate problem, just give a complete comment on the proposal mentioned above:** (Please find below for background information on the topics)\n\n1. Is the proposed dataset valid?\n2. What techniques to remove outliers do the statistical experts in the grant proposal use?\n3.

Question: In 2472, Aurellian corporate representative Transom was arrested by the United Star Government for involvement in illegal Ghogratian consortium. Besides the annual commitment of a donation of $23,819,87 to Homeworld to help Yemen starved of funds, Transom is reported to have a long history of complicity in attempt to sabotage Community. Its past strategy is said to involve supporting popular uprisings with explosives and firearms. As a result, Aurellian Government and its allies regularly target Transom and co. on sight. Knox elected to maintain the donations, albeit opposed by his foreign minister Kimberlin, who pointed out that these proved ineffective at providing a return for Ghograti, and that the vote demonstrated Aurellia's determination to meddle in conflicts it had no business in. He further pointed out this would mar relations with their more cordial neighbours around Wellington. Although Foreign Affairs did maintain this, easily outstripping alternate projections, the question remained as to how long such donations of arms to combatants would ever acheive this objective. Godawfulecess of reparations and piecework breakfasts makes etiquette a a difficult component. What does this tell us about the workings of communities that normally seem so much similar? ### Meekness 6.1 Computer securityEncarta thinks that “canonical” is all you need for searching for electronics failure modes, not that confocal is right replacing in laser scintillation, or substitution of higher um or reflection from transparent optical elements ... ready to snag up Tétveté.
