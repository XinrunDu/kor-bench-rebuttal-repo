Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For each character 'P' and 'Z' in plaintext, we find their corresponding characters in the outer_disk 'W' and 'R', respectively.\n2. We find the positions of these characters within the inner_disk 'Y' and 'U'. After processing 'P', the inner_disk is 'YU'.\n3. The inner_disk is rotated by 5 characters (increment) after processing 'P'. So, at this point, the inner_disk is 'UY'.\n4. We process the 'Z' character. Its corresponding position is 'O' in the inner_disk. The inner_disk becomes 'VOO'.\n5. The inner_disk is rotated to the right again by 5 characters (increment). The inner_disk becomes 'UY'.\n6. Since we've processed 'P' and 'Z' every 1 period, the inner_disk rotates 1 time after these two characters. The inner_disk is now 'KJHGFDSAZKWLMPBQVXECNRyu'.\n7.

Reels are prepared as mentioned in the rules.\n2. Ciphertext: \"O\"\n3. Since ciphertext is a single character, we begin with Reel1 to Reel16 in order.\n4. Among Reel1 to Reel16, \"O\" cannot be found. For each character in the Reels not found, we move to the next character in the Reel.\n5. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"O\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"O\" are found in Reel14.\n6. Reel14 to Reel8 are searched for characters preceded by \"O\". In this case, \"O\" is followed by a \"B\".\n7. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"B\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"B\" are found in Reel7.\n8. Reel7 to Reel4 are searched for characters preceded by \"B\". In this case, \"B\" is followed by \"N\".\n9. After exhausting all Reels, we start searching for characters that are preceded by \"N\". In this case, characters that are precedced by \"N\" are found in Reel3.\n10. Reel3 to Reel1 are searched for characters preceded by \"N\". In this case, \"N\" is followed by \"D\".\n\nUsing these steps, we found that \"O\" in the given ciphertext corresponds to \"D\" in the plaintext. Therefore, the decrypted answer is \"D\" encapsulated in double square brackets: [[D]]."}

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"PF\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[\"PFKGVR\", \"QHLMAJ\"]\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Our input is \"PF\".\n2. We can break down the encryption steps into smaller steps:\n   a. For the first character 'P', find the row and column of 'P' in the matrix. It is (3, 6).\n   b. The encrypted character at position (3, 6) is 'K'.\n   c. Repeat the same process for 'F'. It is (2, 2). The encrypted character at position (2, 2) is 'J'.\n\n3. Now we can concatenate the encrypted characters to get the encrypted ciphertext: [\"PK\", \"JF\"]\n   a. The encrypted characters in each row are separated by spaces.\n   b. We concatenate these rows to get the final ciphertext: \"PFKGVR\"\n\n4. To decrypt, we repeat the steps for each half of the ciphertext and concatenate the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n   a. For the upper half \"PF\", decrypt \"P\" as (2, 2) and \"F\" as (3, 6).\n    - The decrypted characters are 'P' and 'F'.\n    - Now concatenate these characters to get the final plaintext: \"PF\".\n   b. Follow the same process for the lower half of the ciphertext, ending with the plaintext \"QHLMAJ\".\n\nThus the encrypted answer is [[\"PFKGVR\", \"QHLMAJ\"]]."}

Padding: Since \"FW\" does not have an 8-byte multiple, we add \\x00 at the end to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes. (After padding, the plaintext becomes \"F allegations0WP\\x00.\")\n2. Block Splitting: Each plaintext block is 8 bytes long. We divide the padded plaintext into two 4-byte blocks: (Hex: \"F algorithm\") and (Hex: \"WB prospects\").\n3. Block Encryption:\n   - Converting each block to bytes and applying XOR with the key (KEY = b'1234567890ABCDEF').\n   - Using the S_BOX: Replace the high and low 4 bits of each byte before stitching them together and then applying another XOR with the key. In this case, \"F algorithms\" becomes \"D H computations\".\n   - Because 8 bit is a single byte, we only need to rotate each byte one bit to the left. After rotating, \"DH computations\" becomes \"C2 A\".\n   - \"WB prospects\" is encrypted in a similar manner: \"WB prospects\" → \"Kl dX observations\".\n4. Hexadecimal Encoding: Both encrypted bytes produce their respective hexadecimal representations: \"C2A\" and \"WHAT\".\n5. Concatenate: Concatenate the hexadecimal strings to form the final ciphertext: \"C2AWHAT\".\n6. The result is \"[[C2AWHAT]]\"."}
