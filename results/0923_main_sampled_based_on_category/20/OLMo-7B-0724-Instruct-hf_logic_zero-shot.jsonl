Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[SEP] The given statement \"All pencils are not pens\" represents a Universal Negative (SEP) proposition. The subject is \"pencils,\" and the predicate is \"not pens.\" The proposition asserts that no pencil possesses the property (in this case, being a pen)."}

However, the axiom does not explicitly state that Bob will certainly doubt or that he will be convinced the proposition is true. It merely suggests that Bob may consider the possibility of his own doubt or that the proposition might not be entirely true. Therefore, the likely outcome based on the Spread of Doubt axiom is that Bob may harbor some doubts about the proposition, which could potentially lead to belief in the proposition's truth (option A), but it is also possible that Bob would simply have doubts in his mind (option C)."}

In the deep sea, scientists discovered some strange and bizarre creatures, but they inferred that the living environment of deep-sea creatures is completely different from that of terrestrial life. Their reasoning was as follows: On land, there is air and sunlight, most organisms rely on these resources for growth and reproduction; in the deep sea, there is a lack of sunlight, extreme pressure, and low temperatures, most terrestrial organisms cannot survive in such extreme environments.\n\nThis reasoning follows the \u2318 Method, where \"the presence of air and sunlight\" is what kind of attribute?\nA. -\u2318 attribute  B. +\u2318 attribute\n\nPlease provide the answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A/B] The \"presence of air and sunlight\" refers to the -\u2318 attribute. The \u2318 Method involves reasoning about the absence of certain attributes and the implications of those absences on the likelihood of survival in certain environments. In the given example, sunlight and air are absent in the deep sea, and this absence of essential resources leads scientists to conclude that most terrestrial organisms cannot survive in such extreme environments. Therefore, the presence of air and sunlight can be identified as a -\u2318 attribute because it is absent in the deep sea environment and affects the survival prospects of terrestrial organisms."}

Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nThe baby lying in bed cries, and the mother picks her up. \u2192 The mother is the baby's mother. (Attributive inference type)\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A/B] The given statement conforms to the C* Principle (Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle). Perhaps there's an inference of attribution, but the original statement doesn't involvestronger information that contradicts the purpose of communication, thus the baby crying in bed and the mother picking her up doesn't lead up to the stronger piece of information (the mother is the baby's mother). Therefore, the choice is A. C* Principle.\n\nIn the inference process based on the given statement,\n\n* CQ1 does not apply because there is no \"stronger\" statement that contradicts the Information Principle\n* CQ2 does not apply because the statement does not contradict a weaker statement or involve multiple contrast sets\n\nThe statement does not involve application of C% Principle, as the statement follows a conventional understanding of a baby crying in a bed and needing a mother's care, without a purpose of minimalizing or hiding information.\n\nThe statement does not involve the application of C! Principle as the longer expression \"the mother is the baby's mother\" is not unnecessary or marked, and the additional information adds clarity to the already established situation and intent - which is to connect the parent and the child in this scenario."}
