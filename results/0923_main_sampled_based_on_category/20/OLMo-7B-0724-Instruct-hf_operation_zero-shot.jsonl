First, let's isolate the X^1 term by dividing both sides by X:\n\n1/X^2 + 1/X = (X + sqrt(X*X))/X^2\n\nNow, multiply both sides by X^2:\n\n1 = X^2 + X + sqrt(X*X*X^2)\n\nNow, let's define u as sqrt(X*X*X^2):\n\n1 = X^4 + X^3 + X^2*u\n\nWe can solve for X^4 in terms of u:\n\n1 = (X^4 + X^3*u + X^2*u^2 + X^3)*X^2 + X^3 + X^2*u\n\nNow, factor out X^2 from the first term:\n\n1 = X^4*X^2 + X^2 + X^3 + X^2*u\n\nLet Y = X^2, which will reduce the equation:\n\n1 = Y^4 + Y^2 + Y*u\n\nWe can write Y in terms of the variable u:\n\nY = sqrt(u*X^2) = sqrt(u)*sqrt(X^2)\n\nReplace Y with Y*sqrt(X^2):\n\n1 = (Y^4 + Y^2 + Y*u)*sqrt(X^2)\n\nThe $u$-terms in the expression Y*u*sqrt(X^2) can be expressed as Y^3 by grouping the terms:\n\n1 = (Y^4 + Y^2 + Y^3)*sqrt(X^2)\n\nIf we isolate the Y^3 term by dividing both sides by (Y^2 + Y)*sqrt(X^2):\n\n1/(Y^2 + Y) = Y^3/(Y^2 + Y)*sqrt(X^2) = (1 + Yknowledge(Y))/((Y^2 + Y)*sqrt(X^2)) = Y^(3-2)/(Y^2 + Y) = Y \n\nWe can express Y in terms of u and X using the last equation:\n\nY = u/(1 + X)\n\nNow, let's replace Y with its expression and substitute it back in the equation:\n\n1 = [(u/(1 + X^2) + u*X/(1 + X^2) + u/(1 + X) + X*u*(X/(1 + X)))]*sqrt(X^2))\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n1 = u/(1 + X^2) + (u/(1 + X)) + X*u*(X/(1 + X))\n\nNow, divide the equation by (X^2 + X):\n\n1/(X^2 + X) = [(u*X)/(X^3 + X^2 + X)]/(1 + X^2) + [(u*X)/(X^3 + X^2 + X)]/X + [(X**2)*u*X*X\t/(X^3 + X^2 + X)]/(1 + X)\n\nAfter simplifying each term:\n\n1/(X^2 + X) = U/(X^3 + X^2 + X) + U/(X^3 + X^2) + (X * U)/(X^3 + X^2 + X)\n\nWell, three terms with inverses of X, such as U/(X^3 + X^2 + X), U/(X^3 + X^2), and (X*U)/(X^3 + X^2 + X) appear, so these are the solutions:\n\nX = roots([U(X^3 + X^2 + X), U(X^3 + X^2)])\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the solutions for U:\n\n[[1%[[1, a, b]]]] = 3\n[[1%[[1, a, a]]]] = [[1%[[a, a, a]]]]\n\nNow, find X when U = 1:\n\nU = 1/(X^2 + X) + 1/(X^2 + X)^(1/2)\n\nX_1 = [-sqrt(2 + 4(1/(X^2 + X))) & sqrt(2 + 4(1/(X^2 + X))), if (X^2 + X) != 0]\n\nX_2 = [-sqrt(2 - 4(1/(X^2 + X))) & sqrt(2 - 4(1/(X^2 + X)), if (X^2 + X) != 0]\n\nAfter going through both cases, we find:\n\n[[1%[[1, [[1, [[1, X]]]]]]]] = [[1%[[1, [[1, a, a]]]]]] = 3\n\nTherefore,\n\n[[1%[[1, [[1, 1, X]]]]]] = 3\n\nand [[1%[[1, [[1, 1, [[1, [[1, X]]]]]]]]]]\n\nBy solving the expression for X, we find that the only possible integer solution for this equation is  [[1%[[1, [[1, 1, [[1, [[1, X]]]]]]]]]] = X = [[1%[[1, [[1, 1, [1]]]]]]]] = [[1%[[1, [[[[[[[[1, [1, [1]]]]]]]]]]]]]]\n\nFor X, our answer is:\n\n[[1%[[1, [[1, 1, [1]]]]]]]] = [[1%[[[1, 1, [1]]]]]]] = [[1%[[1, [1]]]]]] = 1\n\nSo, X = 1.
