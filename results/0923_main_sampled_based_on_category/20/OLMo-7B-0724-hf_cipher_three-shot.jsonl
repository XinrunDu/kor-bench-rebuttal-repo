Brains are welcome.\n $$=\\top$$ \\ \\ $$ORG=$$ \\ \\ $$8F=$$ \\ \\ $$GFND=$$ \\ \\ $$775=$$ \\ \\ \\ $$9609=$$\n Using the encryption keys, what is the message in the first block? \n### Answer:\n\n```\nYou come across an encrypted message from a team of hacker hackers.\n\nThe message is encrypted over six blocks using a simple substitution cipher (known as a \"one-time pad\")^1 *=3 > everything\n is now just a server F\n```\n\nOur given keys consist of values which can be mapped back to letters: `GFND` -> `GFY` and `ORG` -> `10`. So we only need to decrypt one message per ciphertext block, which will change those encryption key pairs into `9608`.\n\nThis is a simple integer addition.\n\n`9607 + 9609 = 19872` ⇒ `ORG + 9609 (mod 65537) = 19872`\n\nWe can now proceed to decrypt message one.\n\n### CAPTCHA Encryption Details:\n>Abbreviations:\n>\n> *   `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n>\n> *   ORG = 31\n>\n> *   GFND = 565\n>\n> *   775 = 621\n>\n> *   GFY = 28\n\n\n\n^1 `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n1. `c1`: Base64 of `\"P5Mj@`\n2. `c2`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to **non-Latin** letter) for `c1` . (Notice the epsilon. This is why step 4 needs to be repeated again with the result of step 3)\n3. `c3`: Symmetric-key encryption of `c2` with value \n4. `r1`: MD5 hash of `c1` concatenated with `c3`\n5. `r2`: `SHA256` of `r1`\n6. `k1`: `r2`\n7. `r3`: Base64 of `r1`\n8. `c4`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to upper Latin letter) for `r3`\n9. `k2`: `SHA256` of `r3`\n10. `r4`: Concatenate the values `k2`, `k1`\n11. `c5`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r4`\n12. `c6`: `SHA256` of `r4`\n13. `r5`: Base64 of `r2`\n14. `r6`: `MD5` of `r5`\n15. `c7` : Massaged value of MD5 hash of `r6` by applying rules to MD5 and base64 after a specific number has been met.\n16. `c8` : `MD5` of `r6`\n17. `c9` : `SHA256` of `r6`\n18. `r7`: Concatenate base64-encoded ciphertext blocks for child keys `c8`, `c9`, `c7` and plaintext for child key `c8`\n19. `r8`: Symmetric-key encryption of r7 with value `k8`\n20. `r9`: `MD5` of the `k8` encryped-ciphertext block for `r8`\n21. `r10`: `SHA256` of `r9`\n22. `c10`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r10`\n23. `c11` : PHP encryption of `r10` using `MD5`\n24. Hash of `r10` with `SHA384` -> `r11`\n25. `c12` : `MD5` of `K` and `PHPP` of `C`\n26. `CT`: Base64 string of both values of `c12`, `r11`\n\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: message `122`\n\nPlease specify the first three letters of the message in question `A`, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[first three letters of message A]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n* About NAND to XOR * [divk](./scripts/divk)\n* A [divk](./scripts/divk) device has 8 eight pairs of NAND types or XOR types. Replace the pairs constituting the NAND tor XOR.\n* \n  What is happening here?\n* It is impossible to implement this kind of encryption with a NNIT. You can do it with the T key.\n* Use the T key to divide the XOR into two groups of XOR. Return the missing data and provide the missing data.\n* `K` returns missing data to the next `K` and adds it to the missing data."}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

One unique security concept that is a matter of heated debate among security experts is the use of pre-decryption keys (PDKs).\n\nLet's start by generating a ciphertext (note that encryption is a one-way process that does not provide a reverse-aware path) based on some plaintext input. We accomplish this using the [DOB stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobell_sky_generator).\n\nTo generate a ciphertext using the **stream cipher**:'\n\n```\nlet child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14]))\nlet data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\ndata = data.concat(child_random);\n    \ndobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertexth\n```\n\nIt would be best if you calculated the keyword input to this cipher in the previous question. The result should look similar to this:\n\n**Ciphertext**: VVIHNAQ&A.L{RN{Hv%34r{H,cA_!+}.\n\nLet's analyze this communication before the pre-decryption combinator. An overview of the algorithm components is below:\n\n![cipher-formajoingte](https://i.ibb.co/N6NTzhP/cipher-formajoingte.png \"cipher-formajoingte\")\n\nIf we look at the char-by-char correspondence in this system, we can see that each character is encrypted using a predictable method within an arbitrary field, which we call the *afield*.\n\nIn practical contexts, when decrypting such messages, you will often face a situation in which the _key matrices_ have only been derived through knowledge transfer from long-dead individuals. For such messages, the only significant difference between decrypting and encrypting is that you first need to recover the pre-decryption key (PDK) used to derive the afield before using the encrypted plaintext to predict the next afield. You will subsequently employ this approach to recover the PDK used by the sender for all further afields.\n\nTo decrypt the afield, obtaining the PDK (as discussed in [Challenge 7: Communications and Pre-multiplication](https://github.com/NorseAS/esummit_cs21/tree/main/crypto-sprint_lab6)) will result in valuable insights into the written rather than spoken language in transit. By learning the PDK, one can accurately and expeditiously translate the afields. The pollket algorithm is designed to accommodate such values and provides processes for identifying and measuring afields without relying on having illegal disclosure with the previous matrix prior to commencing decryption.\n\nA crucial aspect of this system is the parity of the afields before and after decryption. The pollketalogy process uses the ROT-13 (round-and-fifth-key chaining) method to ensure that different plaintext sentences need not be statistically identifiable. This process of encryption is utilized in ensuring that the PDK is harmless to the decrypting entity. By infection-testing protocols, the pollket (which has evolved into the polket) can be incredibly difficult to compromise by network entities and is often run on devices connected to central firewalls that limit the possibilities of attack and compromise. The polket thus provides superior encryption services for messages, using a master readkey consisting of raw bits that is constructed by the filter for securing data transmission between different groups across an industry.\n\n## Objective\n\nYou will modify the stream cipher algorithm to decrypt a given key going out for $\\leq N$ many NB positions and only $\\leq k$ bytes. The rationale for this task is to study how to manipulate and decrypt the ciphertext using a PIN, which will reduce fraud and theft in money transfers over air. By utilizing a secretcam system, you'll only need the straight-forward visual representation explained here to decrypt the ciphertext to the original plaintext message.\n\n\n### Challenge:\n\nCreate a function **decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey**_N**_k_** that decrypts a ciphertext according to the previous algorithm. Additionally, using the pre-decryption key, apply standard decryption for $\\leq $ N many ciphertext positions; instead of encryption, calculate the Minny-A value of the plaintext utter output decrypted $\\leq k$ bytes.\n\nThe flow chart below illustrates the steps a polynomial HTTP message in the process of decryption:\n\n![decrigvahovadcbrh](https://i.ibb.co/dThjf58/decrigvahovadcbrh.png \"decrigvahovadcbrh\")\n\nYou may choose to invert and pass the message bits to make the legalization of each polynomial mathematics somewhat simpler. In JavaScript, this might be accomplished with an *if statement*, a *for loop*, and an array of polynomial values.\n\nIf you name your public decryption key fret, your decryption function will look similar to this:\n\n```\n//Modified for num positions and key bytes.\nfunction decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey(_N_, _k_) {\n  let child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14])\n  let data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n  \n  data = data.concat(child_random)\n  dobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertext;\n}\n```\n\n### Challenge Goals:\n\n1. You got 100% of the private and public key combo produced by the **pollket** Algorithm, a cipher from which you will never break. This was made possible by a beautiful pillow layout-diagram complete with placing all objects in the position of their correct architectural elements. The *parity cipher* was used in"}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Although unnecessary under most contexts, there are many valid reasons to justify the development of a brute-force approach. Identifying them appropriately is the key. In general, when presenting solutions to challenge assignments, it is often useful to provide both brute-force and optimal approaches. This practice is especially compelling in interviews.\n\nOne very unusual and subsequently effective example, is the _binary search_ method. As with most brute-force methods, the binary search method excels at attempting to exhaust its target. In this case, it validates if there are enough elements within the search space to have identified the target before time or resource limits are reached. At a fundamental level, if the fundamental condition is not true, then to answer the challenge problem is impossible. Given the sufficient number of elements in the search space, binary search can be exceptionally fast.\n\n### Instructions:\nConstruct a generic, repetitive binary search function exploiting the largest two's complement number representation.\n\n### Replacement:\n\n- A simple replacement utilising the good value pattern loader placeholder is supplied.\n- Note, the additional if statements to handle ``str = 0``"}

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up.

A certain programming language can help programmers identify a few common programming errors early, so that programmers can, itself based on, but by correcting their own logic, completely avoid the negative effects of programming errors. but their mistakes, of course, also facilitate development.\nLegend has it that the C # programming language was invented abroad, so does the Japanese scholar Mr. Yamada join the development of the C# programming language, although there has been a lot of work, but he was blocked by restrictions designed by the C Base. until a few years ago, MM, equipped with knowledge from alien, was able to breach the boundaries of the Japanese language. The X-Symbol C language originated from Japanese. In some aspects, X-Symbol C is superior to Japanese CS, such as encryption. X-Symbol C has a built-in encryption function. When encoding, it automatically generates different encryption keys, and through a very complex encryption algorithm, the output content allows readers to see some meaningful pictures.\nGiven the X-Symbol C program, please find out a way to obtain an encrypted picture. To be safe, correct your program completely.\nThe program will output the encryption key after it turns. Depending on the following rules, you need to change the encryption key to complete the decoding environment.\n\n`1. The date line at the end of the program will be output. The size of the date line must be greater than five and no more than 20 characters in length.`\n`2. There are two public keywords in the program. After the modifying is completed, you need to emit the two code lines before and after the two public keywords. There are a few ignored characters before and after the two keywords. The size of the code line is greater than the current length of the cipher to be encoded and at least three. After increasing, the length is no more than the current maximum of 100 characters.`\n\n```\nPositive integer strong identification code output: 525806\n#include<stdio.h>\n Main()\n{\n\tint i;\n\tfor(i=0;i<20;i++) printf(\"%d \", mod[i]);\n\tputs(\"  8683181898999\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a picture of specific encryption, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This sandbox is a resource that I can log into when web limitations are present, but is also easy to create new ones for myself and/or have access to multiple projects.\n\n## Screenshots \n\n### Started properly\nAfter begging, I finally revealed this screen of a successful launch of the sandbox.\n![Image of the extension screen](https://files.gitter.im/Plot-and-Craft/CodeSand.k2-fl-qKc/y6lenTo.png)\n\n### Does not launch\nI'm not sure if there were any problems with internet connection, security systems, but I found this page to be unexpected but here.\n![This image is here](https://me.me/i/once-i-had-a-cat-that-meowed-so-politely-actual-rootzooaoC.png)\n\n### Start method\nI located the application page, it was a Rewards[…] and downloaded an unspecified extension. Once this was done, the extension was unpacked and I added it to an environment using the application CA tool.\n\n![Page](https://res.ws/show/q0dk-515558.png)\n\n![Page](https://res.ws/show/q0df-515560.png)\n\n### Feedback to participants\n– Does the environment is easy to use? Can you operationalise the project?\n\nYes, I found it easy to use and understand which parts involved when operationalising (through trial and error mostly). The only reason why this is not a 100% objective answer is because I was lost in the beginning as to the site's workings, but maintaining the secret agent was highly enjoyable.\n\n– Does the application requirements and operation guide are useful for the plan?\n\nYes, they guided me with how to even launch the extension. They were surprisingly clear and straightforward to understand too.\n\n## Future wishlist ideas\n\n- A simplified R or Python code section where you can refer to what you have in your secret agent (Sample: < script_code.rast: users.json).\n    - For example: < script_code.rast: secret_agent.raw_users(users.json)\n- Ability to automatically remove line endings and hashes from your private project.\n- Automatically clean up any PowerView accessibility for a location of randomly choosing a variable into the rest of your markdown document.\n    - For example, (*<(.*)3*=.*) would make yourself a hexadecimal the one line.\n- More extensions should be released for the program like there are some for Google Chromavaire and Firefox Discovering these extensions is one of the reasons why I want to learn JavaScript. I don't care if they are not useful for an extended period of time.\n- Option to keep a history of your executions, so you can view what everyone was up to in a day (even if they all clicked-/deleted).\n- Ability to customize your seal.\n- Ability to add your own files in a readme although they have 250B limit for a file, so the amount of custom-made project might not happen\n\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\n        Compare results on each sandbox with referecences on previous sandboxes\n    </summary\n\n<div>\n\nNo portions of results were compared.\n\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n    <summary>\n        Upload a .txt file for required programming exams\n    </summary>\n\n<div>\n\n![Audio.txt](https://files.gitter.im/Plot-and-Craft/CodeSand.v0x-xD-qm9N/zrWNwz.png)\n\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nFeel free to contact a few of your peers about their packets.\nThis is <://karolynne.elizabeth>.
