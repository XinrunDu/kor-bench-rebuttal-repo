Long division method to find decimal partners\n\nBefore we put the decimal partner to the rest of decimals, we can first put the decimal to the last digit.\nIf the last digit of the decimal is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, you do nothing to find the decimal partner.\nFor example, for decimal 1.942, as its last digit is 1, you Taylor 1.941*100 and get the remainder, which is 62. Now divide 62 by 942 in the long division method, and get the decimal partner, which is 4.1430. Here, the multiplication operation and division operation are ,  The basis of decimal partner is 64. Therefore by the basis we can further divide its decimal partner to get 62 and 4. Here is the example I showed in the beginning. The problem below shows the principle.\nIf the last digit of the decimal is 8, you can assume it is 0 and don't seek decimal partner. However, for all the digits after the decimal, you can use the decimal method and find the decimal partner.\nFor example, for decimal 0.156, its last digit is 6, which equals to 8. You can draw a box at the right end side for 0 and place 3 and then, to the left of that , perform long division with 3 by 6*100, and get decimal 0.848 with decimal partner 8. Therefore by the basis we can further divide its decimal partner to get 0.883.\n\n2. After finding decimal partner,  make it accurate\n\nMerge the decimal partner to the last digit and find out the new value's last digit. Search again by the same method. The decimal partner also yields neighbor digits, and ultimately reaches to the decimal partner by multiplying the differences with the remainder.\nFor instance, the new value of 0.88340 turns out to be 1.12. As the last digit of the new value is not 8, seeking the decimal partner again, we find that its decimal partner is  11*100+3, and as its remainder is 1, administer the decimal method and find the decimal partner is 10*100+3. Therefore, by the basis yield the decimal partner -2*100-8, which is 1408. To make the decimal partner accurate, proceed to multiply the basis and two differences. After that, a new decimal partner 0.158088 can be got.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Compare two decimals, and find whether its decimal partner is negative or not. If it's negative, subtract its decimal partner from the numerator and add it to the denominator, and if the new value is negative, repeat these operations.\n2. Determine whether the decimal partner is precise or not. If it's precise to 3 digits, try comparing from the 100th place to determine whether the decimal partner's remainder is positive or negative. If it is negative, conclude the decimal partner to be positive and vice versa.\n3. When decimal partner is negative, multiply (negative number)-1 to its decimal partner and add 1. Conclude it as the carried part and then reduce the basis. The modified basis becomes the standard precision. If the new basis is the decimal partner's remainder, carry forward.\n4. Hence, merge the decimal partner with  the new value, and by derivative methods continue to divide several time to search for decimal partners. The following three order operators of operations are alocation, subtraction and division, but the derivative of the last digit is all positive and failure to add other digits, and Replace the first digit of the new result with 0s and continue to search again.\n\n### Problem List\n\n1. 140.000~141.000round to 0.1digit precision (format number)\n\n### Problem List\n\n1.
