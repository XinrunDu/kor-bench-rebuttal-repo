I remember one time he invited some friends over for dinner.\nPerson B: That's nice, everyone can get together.\nPerson A: The appointment was for six in the evening, and by half past five, three people had arrived, but one important guest hadn't shown up yet.\nPerson B: Then wait a bit longer, if they don't come, start eating without them.\nPerson A: My grandfather is a punctual person. When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[Paraphrased sentence from person A]"}

Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p \u2192 p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[()]"}
