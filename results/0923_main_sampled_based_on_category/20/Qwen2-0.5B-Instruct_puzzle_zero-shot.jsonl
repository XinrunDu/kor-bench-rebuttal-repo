However, in the provided rule, the length of each word is not specified. \n\nGiven the rule, the 3 state * 3 state word is required. This means that for the first 3 letters, we can choose 3 of the 5 given letters (and possibly some possible rearrangements of letters, but since we are dealing with the 3 state and we have 3 letters), while for the 3 state, we need to choose 3 of the 5 letters. To align with the rule provided clearly and explicitly, we would solve for 3 state words first, and then arrange them as a 3 state * 2 state word. Here's the solution within the constraints:\n\n- 3 state * 3 state word: [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]]\n\nSo, the answer is [[{\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"P E A\"}, {\"word\": \"ADP\"}]].
