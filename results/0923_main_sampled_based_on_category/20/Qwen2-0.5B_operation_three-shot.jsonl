Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na♀b=(a+b)/2\na♂b=a×4+b\n\n### Question:\nCompute 7○(6△8).\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[35]]\n\n### Question:\nIf (X△4)○6=34, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[10]]\n\n### Question:\nNow ignoring the previous rule, given that a△b=(a+b)/2,3○8=20, compute 5○(3△8).\nIf the answer is a fraction, write it in 'a/b' text format.Decimals are not allowed.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[25/2]]\n\n### Question:\nIf 6♂(X♀3)=42, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[55]]\n\nWhat's the answer? The answer to the question \"Compute 7*X○(6△8).\" depends on the specific values of X, and because they are missing, I cannot provide a specific answer. However, I can provide step-by-step instructions for computing 7*X○(6△8).\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definition of the new operations in the question.\n2. If you don't specifically ask for it, the possible answers in this question would be a÷b=(a+b)/2, a×4+b, X△4, 3○8=20.\n3. Double-check your final answer to make sure it fits the rule of the question.\n4. If the question specifically asks for a specific answer, like \"If 6△(3○5)=32, find X,\" you should simply say \"32\" instead of computing the numbers.\n5. Get started automatically, indicating a section or a lesson, but always saying it clearly.\n\nSince the answer to this question is a fraction, it should be written in 'a/b' text format, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator. This is a widely accepted way of writing fractions and rounding decimals."}
