We are given that 3#X=6. This means the average of all even numbers between 3 (inclusive) and X (inclusive) equals 6.\n\nTo solve for X, we consider different cases, but we know that since the average is 6, the even numbers that could contribute to this average must include 6. This can only happen if the even number sequence around 6 is symmetric or if X=6. We also need to consider that 3 is not even, so our sequence starts with the first even number after 3.\n\nLet's consider the sequence: if there's a single number, the average of that number has to be itself (X has to be 6). If there are two numbers, since 3 is odd, we start with 4, so it might be {4, 8}. If there are three numbers, it might be {4, 6, 8}, this gives us an average of 6. Any more even numbers increase the average unless we also increase X appropriately.\n\nTo find the minimum X that satisfies, it must be 8 to cover the sequence {4, 6, 8} which has an average of 6. Any further increase in X must increase the upper bound of the sequence and keep the average 6, but since we are looking for number or numbers, the minimum X that satisfies the condition is 8.\n\nThe sequence does not increase the average if we increase X to 8 because 4 and 8 balance each other when calculating the average, leaving 6 as our average with this sequence.\n\nAnswer: [[8]]"}

Let's translate the custom operation into known operations as follows:\n\n\\[512 \\, ¤ \\, X = \\log_{X}{512} + \\log_{512}{X} = \\frac{82}{9}\\]\n\nWe know from logarithm properties that \\(\\log_{a}{b} = \\frac{1}{\\log_{b}{a}}\\), so we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[\\log_{X}{512} + \\frac{1}{\\log_{X}{512}} = \\frac{82}{9}\\]\n\nFrom the base 2 logarithm results, \\(512 = 2^9\\).

Let's substitute the known values:\n\n(27 + 36i) + 2(X◎2) = 37 + 60i\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n2(X◎2) = 37 + 60i - (27 + 36i)\n       = 10 + 24i\n\nX◎2 = (10 + 24i) / 2\n    = 5 + 12i\n\nNow, we need to find the value of X that makes X◎2 = 5 + 12i. According to the operation rule:\n\nX◎2 = (X + 2i)^2\n    = X^2 + 4Xi + 4i^2\n    = X^2 + 4Xi - 4 (since i^2 = -1)\n    = X^2 + 4Xi - 4\n\nSo, to make X◎2 = 5 + 12i, we compare the real and imaginary parts:\n\nX^2 - 4 = 5 (real part)\n4X = 12 (imaginary part)\n\nFrom the real part equation:\n\nX^2 = 9\nX = ±3\n\nFrom the imaginary part equation:\n\n4X = 12\nX = 3\n\nPutting both parts together, the value of X that satisfies both the real and imaginary parts of the equation is +3.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n[[3]]"}

Therefore, set A can be seen as the set of all positive integers.\n\nThe set B is defined as all positive numbers, which includes all positive integers (which is set A) but also includes all other positive numbers that are not integers (like 0.5, 1.2, etc.).\n\nHowever, A∪B in this context just repeats the positive integers and adds all other positive numbers. Since the union of A and B includes all elements in A and all elements in B, it encompasses all positive integers (from A) and all positive non-integer numbers (from B). Given the definitions, the union results in only positive real numbers, as both sets are subsets of the positive real numbers.\n\nA∩B, meaning the intersection of sets A and B, is set A itself (since A is a subset of B).\n\nSo, if we compute A￡B=(A∪B)−(A∩B), the result would be all elements that are in (A∪B) but not in (A∩B). Since (A∪B) includes all positive real numbers and (A∩B) equals set A, which is all positive integers, we are simply removing all positive integers from (A∪B). \n\nHowever, removing the positive integers from the set of all positive real numbers leaves us with all positive real numbers that are not integers. \n\nHence, the answer is the set of all positive real numbers excluding the natural numbers.\n\nIn terms of understanding that we shouldn't list infinite sets as explicit elements, and since the answer format asked for is only a conceptual answer with calculation steps, let's wrap up the conceptual description as follows:\n\nSo, A￡B is:\n\n[[{all positive real numbers excluding natural numbers}]]"}
