The user is asked to apply this operation to multiple sets of integer values, and should arrive at the correct numerical result for each. \n\nPart #2: Presenting answers as a single number in double square brackets like [[your answer]]\nUsage: <2,3,4,2> = 14, so the answer should be presented as [[14]]. This format keeps answers organized and consistent, and helps to distinguish between instructive text and actual solutions.\n\nPart #3: Double-checking answers\nUsage: The user should verify that their answer accurately follows the operation rules. For example, <4,3,7,1> = 2*(4)*(3) + 7 - 1 = 30. After initial calculation, the user should double-check their work to make sure 30 is the correct answer.\n\nPart #4: Solving if condition is met\nUsage: <4,X,8,3> = 29 means that 2*(4)*(X) + 8 - 3 = 29. Recalculating, we get 8X + 5 = 29-> 8X = 24 -> X = 3. Therefore, X should be 3, or presented in double square brackets as [[3]].

Since you only want one digit as the answer, the answer would be 8.\n\nThe operation * is defined as follows: a*b\\frac{a-2b}{a+b}. For all real numbers where a is not equal to –b, a+b is the diameter of a circle with area 186π square centimeters. If b=15, find the radius of the circle.\nThe operation * is defined as follows:\n\na*b=\\frac{(a-2b)}{a+b}\n\nThe circumference of the circle is 2πr or C= 2π×186 cm square/(4*r), where r is the radius. \n\nIf b=15, the diameter is 186cm square/(2*15), as a+b is the diameter.\n\nHence, diameter=6.2 (rounded to 1 decimal digit), and the radius is half of the diameter, hence, the radius of the circle is 3.1 cm.\n\nWhat equals the following? 48 e 6\nOperation: e\nValues: 48,6\nWrite your answer without extra symbols and calculate your answer yourself.\n\nYour answer should be a single value.\n\n48e6 = 48(6+2) + 48*6/106 = 48*8 + 288/106 = 384 + 2.717 = 386.717\n\nA number is in the form of 100a+10a+10. For what values of a is this number divisible by 9?\n\nTo find this, we simply divide the number 100a + 10a + 10 by 9 and see for what value of 'a' is the result an integer. Doing the calculation, we find the answer is when a is a multiple of 9.\n\nFour people went to a coffee shop. Joe and James each ordered a coffee, which costs $2.50. Amanda and Alex each ordered a tea, which costs $3.00. Together, the total bill was $11. They decided to split the bill equally. How much did each person pay?\n\nJoe and James ordered 2 coffees for a total of 2 x $2.50 = $5.00.\nAmanda and Alex ordered 2 teas for a total of 2 x $3.00 = $6.00.\nCombined, the total bill for all four people was $5.00 + $6.00 = $11.00.\nThey decided to split the bill equally among four people, so each person paid $11.00 / 4 = $2.75.\n\nIn the same music school, there are now 50 students and 30 students take piano classes. If 15 students take both piano and violin classes, and there are 5 students who do not take any music classes, how many students can play only the violin?\nWe know 30 students take piano classes, but 15 also take violin. Therefore, there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students who take only piano. Additionally, given there are 5 students who don't take any music classes, the total number of students taking at least one class must be $50 - 5 = 45$. We need to find the number of students taking only violin classes; we can calculate those by subtracting from 45 the students taking only piano and both instruments which are $45 - 15 - 15 = 15$ students.\n**\n\nA cyclist ascends a hill with an inclination of 10% and spends 20 minutes on the ascent.
