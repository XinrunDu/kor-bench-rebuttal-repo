The rule for a◇b is defined as a◇b = a^b. Therefore, if 3◇X = 243, we can set up the equation 3^X = 243. Since 243 can be written as 3^5 (because 243 = 3^5), we can solve for X by taking the logarithm of both sides with base 3:\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n\n3*log_3(243) = 5\n\nNow, we solve for log_3(243):\n\nlog_3(243) = 5 log_3(243)\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nNow, since 243 can be written as 3^5:\n\nlog_3(243) = log_3(3^5)\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nSince log_3(3^5) = 5, we have:\n\nlog_3(3^5) = 5\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n3 = 5\n\nThus, [3] is the answer."}
