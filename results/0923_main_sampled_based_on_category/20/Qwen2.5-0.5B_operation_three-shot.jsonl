Based on the provided rules and question, here are the accurate answers to your requests:\n1. 8￠2 = 8 + 2 = [8 + 2] = [10/3]\n2. 4￠9 = 4 [9] = 4/1 [1/3] ≃ 11/3 [1.33333]\n3. If X￠4=5/2, find X = [16, 16/1, 16/3, 16/9], assuming X is a multi-digit number.\n4. 512￠X = 82/9, find X. This requires solving 512 = 82/9 for X. If you are calculating a decimal representation, it would be [4/3, 6/3, 13/3, 17/3] for small values of X.\n5. If 4￠Y=3/2, find Y. This does not have a general solution and cannot be reduced to an integer or fraction.\n6. If 4￠Y=3/2, find Y. Assuming Y is a positive integer, but without it, it could be any whole number greater than or equal to 3/2.\n7. If 512￠X=82/9, find X = [16, 16/1, 16/3, 16/9]. This is just one possible solution.\n8. 4￠Y=3/2, find Y. This requires solving 2 + Y = X/3 for Y, which we'll assume is a positive integer. This could be [1, 2, 3, 4] for specific values of X."}

Remember, the process being assess was conducted in the form of lexicon, EE, and manual calculations rather than any form of document. )\n\nConsidering all the above mentioned, I can try to run the calculations based on the defined procedure.\n\nGiven the specified Rule and Process, now I need to strictly adhere to this procedure to accurately solve the Problem with the precise steps and answer exactly as requested. \n\nPlease provide the reasoning that directly translates the user's input into the steps and answer.\n\n1. Consider the given operations and think of how to accurately solve the Problem using logic.\n2. Start by understanding the Rule: a¢b = log_b(a) + log_b(a)\n3. Break down the Problem and consider each step in the Solution: Compute 8¢2 = 8¢log₂(8) + 8log₂(2)\n4. Compute 8¢log₂(8) = log₂(8) + log₂(8) = 2 · 2 · log₂(2) = 2\n5. Compute 8log₂(2) = log₂(2) + log₂(2) + log₂(2) = 4 (log₂(2) + 2 + 1)\n6. Add the two results: 2 + 4 = 6. \n7. Carefully consider the rule for the Process: The rule doesn't allow for a coefficient, so x¢0 = 1 for negative x ($x ≠ 0$). \n\nThus, for simplicity, replace 8 with 2, but still leave the result 6. \n \nThat's what I got.\nYes, that seems to be the solution. The process you provided accurately is based on the process rule stated in the answer, with the special rule being mentioned that the operation x¢0 is (1/x). However, the process already aligns with the required steps and the final result provided. A more complete and structured breakdown of the process would be well-aligned with the formative, but here's what I think the final answer can look like.\n\n$$a$¢b = log_b(a) + log_b(a) $$\n\nGiven this rule, we have:\n\n$$a$¢2 = log_a(a) + log_a(a) = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\nAnd we now consider 8¢2:\n\n$$\\log_2(a) + \\log_2(a) = 2 + 2 = 2 = 8$$. \n\nAnd we see the Outcome of our Rule is:\n$$ 8 = 2^3 $$\nHence solving for the desired multiplication is:\n$$ 2^3 ⋅ 2 = 2^{3+1} = 8 =8 ¹° $$\n\nFINAL ANSWER [Final answer]: $8$ [$^1]_$3_$"}

According to the rule, A union B is everything that is a union of elements from A and B. \n\n    A = {1, 2, 3}\n      +  B = {2, 3, 4} \n\nSo, A union B is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, we need to find A intersection B. \n\n    A = {1, 2, 3} \n    B = {2, 3, 4} \n\nSo, A intersection B is {2, 3}.\n\n**Step 2** \n\nWe plot A ∩ B as a rectangle (box) around the points {2, 3} from the union A union B. Then, find the square of this rectangle (box). \n\n      = A union B   -   A intersection B \n      = {1, 2, 3, 4} -   {2, 3}  \n      = {(1, None), (2, None), (3, None), (4, None)}\n\n**Step 3** \n\nNow, we need to compute the more encompassing set B. According to the rule, B means anything that is a simple union of elements from B and A. \n    A = {1, 2, 3}\n      +  B = {2, 3, 4} \n\nSo, B is {1, 2, 3, 4}. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n[[{1, 3}]]\n\nThis is the correct answer. And by following the operation rules, we have grouped the constants into our final answer."}

The final answer is in a format like [[your answer]], with a specific condition on whether a is included or not. Thank you for adhering to the provided rules and challenges. Based on the information provided and the rules applied, let's evaluate each part of the question step by step.\n\n### Rule Application\n\n1. **Rule for a●b**:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx}{b-a} = \\frac{b-a}{a} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\]\nThis formula relates the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) within the interval \\([a, b]\\) to the definite integral of \\(f(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Rule for (a●b)**:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx}{\\frac{1}{2}b^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(b-a)(2(b-a)(b+a))}{(a^2+b^2)}} \\cdot \\frac{b+a}{4} \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right) \\]\n\nBy applying these rules properly, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx}{b-a} = \\frac{(b-a)}{a} \\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx + \\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{(b-a)}{a} \\cdot \\frac{b^3}{3} + \\frac{b^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b^3}{3} = \\frac{b^6}{3a} + \\frac{b^5}{6} \\]\n\nSince we are only asked for a specific numerical value, we assume '1●3' means 1 times 3, giving us:\n\\[ 1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\]\n\nHowever, since the second question asks for the value given by a⋅(2π/3), we first need to evaluate \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n### Calculations\n\\[ \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\pi/3} x^2 \\, dx}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - a^2} = \\frac{(a^2 - b^2)}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - a^2} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{9} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{9}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)^2 - b^2}{0} \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that when \\(b = \\pi\\), the expression simplifies to 0, indicating either a trivial case (i.e., no integration) or error. However, depending on the context, typically \\(b = \\pi\\) is the solution, making the final answer:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nIf for exact answer, proceed with the second part of the question specifically for \\(b = \\pi\\): find \\(a\\)."}

Could you please explain the concepts in more detail? Certainly! Let's break down the problem step-by-step to ensure clarity and accuracy for future reference.\n\n### Operation Rule:\nA@B represents the element-by-element maximization operation (A @ B)_{ij} = \\max(A_{ij}, B_{ij}) for all pairs (i, j), where A and B are binary (true or false) variables (typically referred to as 1 and 0).\n\n### Question: A=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  7 & 8 \\\\\n  3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  0 & 1 \\\\\n  2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nA and B represent two binary variables.

To properly employ the rewritten rules/examples, you would need specific data correctly formulated as per the new rules/definitions. For instance, setting out the rules requires clarity about what they should evaluate and applications contexts accurately. Likewise, sharing the actual data used for the computation wouldn't be feasible with such simplified rules; thus, I can't fulfill this task."}
