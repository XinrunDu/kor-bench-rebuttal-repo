Thus, `(p>q)>r` becomes `(!!p | !q)|r`.\n\nBy the idempotence law (2-3), `!!p` can be simplified to `p`.\n\nSo, we have `(p | !q) | r` as our first expression.\n\nNext, for `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` translates directly using rule (10) to `!p | (q>r)`.\n2.

Since the format requires the use of 0-ary predicates, we treat 2 and 4 as specific instances that do not apply in a general sense through individual variables x and directly state their properties.\n\n(1) Since 2 is the only prime number in this context, we should somehow express that any entity x which is a prime (F(x)) is actually 2 (interpreted as a specific condition for 0-ary predicates). However, in order to adhere strictly to the instruction and using 0-ary predicates directly, we can symbolize F(2) as \"2 is a prime number\" and \u223cF(4) as \"4 is not a prime number\" (since 4 being a composite number implies it is not prime).

Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nWhat type of proposition is the following statement?\n\"All pencils are not pens.\"\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[SAP/SEP/SIP/SOP]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statement \"All pencils are not pens\" can be understood as asserting that every pencil does not have the property of being a pen. This fits the form of a Universal Negative proposition, where the universal quantifier \"all\" is used and the negative connective \"are not\" is employed.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the specified format is:\n\n[[SEP]]"}

Conversion: Exchange the subject and predicate to get \"All not-upright and not-open are not true revolutionaries\".\n\nHowever, to match the exact phrase \"All people who are not upright and open\", we can interpret the obversion as turning into the contrary, and simplifying the statement to reflect the original meaning after conversion. Thus, the transformation involves first thinking about its contrary through obversion, then applying conversion, which matches the definition and steps under Method C.

Basic Axioms\n- Belief Axiom: `B_p \u2192 p`, indicating that if someone firmly believes `p` is true, it can be inferred that `p` is indeed true.\n\n2. Advanced Axioms\n- Axiom of Reflexivity: `B_p \u2192 BB_p`, indicating that if an individual firmly believes the proposition `p`, they also believe they believe `p`.\n- Axiom of Transitivity: If `iRj` and `B_ip`, then `B_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` firmly believes the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` also believes `p`.\n- Axiom of Consistent Belief: `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`, indicating that an individual cannot simultaneously believe in a proposition `p` and its negation `\u00acp`, as this would lead to a logical contradiction.\n\n3. Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice is sure that the library is open today (proposition p), \nand she is sure that she is sure of this (according to the axiom of self-reflexivity), \nwhat logical expression is written?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the information and the logical model provided, we can derive the logical expression based on the axiom of reflexivity.\n\nSince Alice is sure that the library is open today, represented by the proposition `p`, and Alice is also sure of her belief (`B_p`), the axiom of reflexivity tells us that if `B_p` holds, then `BB_p` also holds. Therefore, the logical expression for Alice being sure that the library is open today and sure of her belief can be written as:\n\n```\n[ B_p \u2227 BB_p ]\n```"}

One group has salivary glands removed, and the other does not. Both groups are then bruised, and the result is observed. \n\n1. Positive group (with salivary glands intact): \n    - Salivary glands present, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal at a normal rate.\n2. Negative group (with salivary glands removed): \n    - Salivary glands absent, other conditions (wheat and nickel white animals, etc.) are identical.\n    - Wounds heal much slower.\n\nThis scenario closely matches Method \ua66e from the logic rule provided. Here, the salivary glands are the condition S, and the rate of wound healing is the outcome P. The positive group shows that when salivary glands are present (S), the wounds heal at a normal rate (P). The negative group shows that when salivary glands are absent (S'), the wounds heal slower (P'). Since the groups are identical in all other respects (A, B, C, D, E, F differing only in the salivary glands condition), the method is applied correctly, leading to the inference that salivary glands may have a causal relationship with the rate of wound healing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[C]]."}

In the scenario described, one might infer that the \"mother\" is indeed the \"baby's mother,\" but this inference is based on the hearer's assumptions and expanded understanding beyond what is explicitly stated to infer a likely relationship rather than on the form of the sentence itself or any specific linguistic criterion related to the principle structure provided.\n\nGiven the described principles:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle focuses more on the limitation of information inferred from what is known by the speaker and not weakening information. The inference here does not fit directly into this criterion as it is not about ensuring that the information is not weaker or about enabling inferences regarding information strength or the speaker's knowledge about the strength of information.\n- **C! Principle**: This principle is concerning the avoidance of obscurity or marked expressions without reason, and it is more directly related to the form and clarity of the expression than to making inferences about the relationships between entities described in the sentence.\n- **C% Principle**: This principle involves minimalization on the speaker's part and the hearer positioning themselves to grasp the minimal intent but expanding on it where appropriate. This aligns closely with the question as the inference made assumes the least necessary meaning from the relationship described (that the woman picking up the baby is the baby's mother).\n\nTherefore, the principle most directly applicable here is the C% Principle.\n\n[[B]]"}
