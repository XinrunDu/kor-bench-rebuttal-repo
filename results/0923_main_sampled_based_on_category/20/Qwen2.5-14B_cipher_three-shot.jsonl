A Vendramin relative to the doge Michele was in charge of arranging the works of reconstruction undertaken by Scalfarotto after the fall of 1771. The marble portal of the façade and the two lions were taken from St Mark's Basilica. The lion on the left with the dog was the companion of the lion of St Mark; the other lion had been taken from the Greek in Corfu, together with the semicolumn, used for the loggia, by the Venetians. The flag and trophies were trophies from Dalmatia. On the lunette was placed the wooden polyptich attributed to Jacobello dalle Masegne. The piece's division into three followed that of the whole ensemble, and the portrayal of the Madonna and Child were flanked respectively by two angels and the saints Peter and Francis. In spite of this impressive display, the problem of the perspectival relationship between the façade of the structure and the Renaissance-inspired ensemble of the back of the structure and the adjoining sixteenth-century palazzo remained.By the end of the eighteenth century, the Marquizate of Rosazzo was inherited, by marriage, by the Giustinian-Lolin family, who owned it until 1981. Valentino Foresti built the Roman Theatre and three monumental neo-classical wings for Giustinian-Lolin Palazzo in Padua, which linked to the church. These were demolished in 1932–37 to make way for a hospital.  Answer the following question:  Which Novecento rationalist architects selected the paintings on the Jewish house in 1981?\n### 分析与答案\n\n根据提供的背景信息，我们可以得出以下结论：\n\n1. **重建工作的负责人**：\n   – 在1801年，多梅尼科·马拉里亚诺（Domenico Maragliano）设计了大教堂正面的马赛克。\n   – 一位与教皇米凯莱有关系的文德拦（Vendramin）负责组织斯卡尔法罗托（Scalfarotto）领导的重建工作，后者在1771年倒塌之后接手了这些工作。\n\n2. **重建工作的贡献者**：\n   – 马赛克的重建是基于多梅尼科·马拉里亚诺的规划。\n   – 斯卡尔法罗托采取了必要的重建措施。\n\n3. **重建工作的时间点**：\n   – 这些重建工作是在1801年进行的。\n   – 斯卡尔法罗托在1771年之后接手了这些工作。\n\n4. **重建的细节**：\n   – 重建过程中，有些建筑材料来自其他地方，如圣马可教堂、克尔克岛上的希腊建筑以及达尔马提亚的奖杯。\n\n5. **重建后的问题**：\n   – 尽管重建工程看似宏伟，但仍存在透视关系的问题，特别是在教堂正面与后方的文艺复兴式风格的建筑以及相邻的十六世纪宫殿之间的关系。\n\n6. **历史继承与发展**：\n   – 到18世纪末，罗萨乔伯爵领地被嫁给了吉斯蒂尼安-洛林家族。\n   – 吉斯蒂尼安-洛林家族直到1981年依旧拥有这片地产。\n   – 瓦伦蒂诺·福雷斯蒂（Valentino Foresti）为吉斯蒂尼安-洛林在帕多瓦建造了一座罗马剧院和三座新古典主义式的立面与连接教堂的翼楼。\n   – 这些新建筑在1932至1937年被拆除，以建造一所医院。\n\n综上所述，通过对背景信息的分析，可以得知以下几点：\n- **重建工作的特点**：使用了大量从其他地方获取的建筑材料，并试图解决结构的透视问题。\n- **家族历史**：吉斯蒂尼安-洛林家族继承了罗萨乔伯爵领地，并在1981年之前一直持有该地产。\n- **与建筑师的关系**：瓦伦蒂诺·福雷斯蒂为吉斯蒂尼安-洛林家族在帕多瓦建造了罗马剧院和新古典主义式的建筑。\n\n然而，关于新社会理性主义建筑师在1981年选择犹太房屋的油画的问题，并没有直接的信息或线索来回答这个问题。我们需要更多的上下文或历史记录来提供准确的答案。"}

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

However, the specifics provided do not align with standard Playfair cipher rules for grid indexing and placement. The rules as provided suggest an unconventional way of indexing grids (from 0 to 7) instead of the standard (0-4). Furthermore, the moving one grid position to the lower right (for encryption) or upper left (for decryption) is also unique in the way it's described. Lastly, the J is not part of the alphabet as per the provided rules, which is different to the conventional Playfair cipher where J and I were merged.\n\nPlease clarify the specifics of your request or provide further details as to what exactly you're asking for (encryption? decryption? specific message?). If you need the encryption or decryption of specific messages according to the unconventional rules as described, please specify the message or type of transformation required.\n\nCan you encrpyt \"POIROT\"?"}

Quick and painless, ORCI = MATHODS, HOI = TIME, then you can guess that \"Vel\", followed by the missing part \"UGH\", OERR = MISSION, number = 800, and finally N = F. Combining all these decrypted parts together gets us the final decrypted text, which is \"Math is tough!\".\nOriginal text consists of Novell A section of Novell has a fix rate.  ```\nStructurally\nThe description of the encryption is half correct in the original text. It says \"half correct in the original text\", but doesn't tell you exactly what the error is, or how to decrypt it. Below is an example of how decryption works exactly.\n### Instructions:\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n### Cipher Rule:\n**Encryption Rules:**\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: String without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption steps:\n    - First, the plaintext is placed in the first row of the first line of the cipher grid (note that the first row and the first line are both removed at the beginning).\n    - Then the first plaintext letter is filled in the first position of the first line.\n    - Finally, all the remaining letters are filled into the encryption grid in five lines. The encryption grid is filled from left to right and top to bottom.\n### Encryption\nThe process of encrypting the plaintext \"MATHEMATICS\" is as follows:\n1. Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line:\n    ```\n    M A T H E M A T I C S\n    ```\n2. Then fill in one letter in each cell of the following cells in order, returning to the first column after each row.\n    ```\n    M A T H E \n    M A T I C \n    S # # # # \n    ```\n3. Read the ciphertext from left to right and top to bottom:\n    ```\n    MATHE, MATIS, CNCSS, ...\n    ```\n### Deciphering\nThe process of decrypting the encrypted text like \"MATHEMATIVES\" is as follows:\n1. The top row of the cipher grid is filled with the first DNA (first M) of the plaintext.\n    ```\n    M ?\n    ```\n2. All the remaining litters EAT is filled from left to right and top to bottom.\n    ```\n    M ?\n    A T\n    E S\n    ```\n3. Read the ciphertext from left to right and top to bottom:\n    ```\n    MATHE, ..... ....... ...\n    ```\nNote that the first letter of the original plaintext is not M.\n6.1.2 Kryptos:\nThe mathematical concept of the cryptosystem is studied in linear and circling transformation.\nThe math behind the encrypted and decrypted text's transformation process is illustrated by the diagram below."}
