This list contains many lists of integers. The list is several items written as [ item1, item2, item3 ]. Each item is either an integer or a nested list of integers. A nested list is a list which contains integers or other nested lists. Your task is to write a single integer into an output list. This single integer should be the sum of all integers in the nested list.\n\n### Response\nSure, I'd be happy to help you with the task! \n\nFirst, let me break down the task description:\n\n* The input to the task is a list that contains many lists of integers.\n* Each entry in the list is either an integer or a nested list of integers.\n* A nested list is a list that contains integers or other nested lists.\n* The goal is to write a single integer that creates a new list containing that integer.\n* This single integer must be the total of all integers inside the nested list.\n\nNow, let's talk about how you can approach the problem:\n\nStep 1: Define the input format. In this case, the input is a nested list, so you'll need to define how that input will be represented in your Python code.\n\nStep 2: Define the output format. In this case, you'll want to return a single integer, so you can represent that using an integer.\n\nStep 3: Figure out how to combine the integers inside the nested list to get the total. You'll need to write a function that accepts a nested list as input, iterates over the items in the list, sums all integer items, and then returns the total.\n\nDoes this help you get started? If you need more help, feel free to ask me any questions!\n\n### Task\nYou are given a password. Your task is to check whether it is a valid password or not. A password is considered valid if and only if it satisfies all required conditions. For the password to be valid, it must contain at least 3 characters and each character in the password must be one of the following: alphanumeric words (0-9), special symbols (!\"#$%&*+,-.:;=?@~~), lower case letter and Upper case letters.\n\n### Response\nCertainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the task and the reasoning behind it:\n\n1. Understand the task and the input: You need to check if the given password is valid or not. The input is a password, which is a string of characters, and the output is a boolean value that indicates whether the password is valid or not.\n\n2. Recall the previous knowledge from Natural Language Processing (NLP): In the previous task, we were given a simply formatted sentence and we needed to extract key phrases from it. We used rule-based approaches to do this, such as keyword frequency, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.\n\n3. Identify the problem and solution space: To check whether the password is valid or not, we need to ensure that it satisfies all the required conditions. That is, it must contain at least 3 characters, and it must be composed of alphanumeric words, special symbols, and lower case and upper case letters.\n\n4. Generate a new idea to use or adjust the previous knowledge: We can use a recursive approach to check if the password is valid. Firstly, we can check if the password has at least 3 characters or not. Then, we can check whether each character of the password is a valid alphanumeric character or not. Finally, we can use recursively check if the password is a valid password or not.\n\n5. Provide final and revised response: Here's a Python code snippet that implements the recursive approach:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_password(pswd):\n    if len(pswd) < 3:\n        return False\n\n    if all(c.isalnum() or c in \"!\\\"#$%&*+,-.:;=?@~~\" for c in pswd):\n        return True\n\n    return all(is_valid_password(part) for part in pswd.split())\n```"}

I will evaluate each statement one by one using the given operation rule and the properties provided.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ①: a (⋄) b = b (⋄) a\n\nAccording to the definition provided, a (⋄) b = |a||b|sinθ and b (⋄) a = |b||a|sinθ. Since multiplication is commutative, |a||b| = |b||a|, and sinθ is the same for both operations, it follows that a (⋄) b = b (⋄) a. Thus, statement ① is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ②: (λa) (⋄) b = λ(a (⋄) b)\n\nThe operation (λa) (⋄) b = |λa||b|sinθ = |λ||a||b|sinθ. Since scalar multiplication of the magnitude of a vector is distributive, this simplifies to |λ|(|a||b|sinθ) = |λ|(a (⋄) b). Therefore, statement ② is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ③: if a (⋄) b = 0, then a ∥ b\n\nIf a (⋄) b = 0, then |a||b|sinθ = 0. Since a and b are non-zero vectors, |a| ≠ 0 and |b| ≠ 0. Therefore, for the product to be 0, sinθ must be 0, indicating that θ = 0° or 180°, which means the vectors are parallel (a ∥ b) to each other. Thus, statement ③ is true.\n\n### Evaluating Statement ④: (a + b) (⋄) c = (a (⋄) c) + (b (⋄) c)\n\nThe operation (a + b) (⋄) c = |a + b||c|sinθ, where θ is the angle between (a + b) and c. Meanwhile, (a (⋄) c) + (b (⋄) c) = |a||c|sinθ + |b||c|sinθ. It is important to consider how sinθ behaves for (a + b) and c. In general, |a + b| is not equal to |a| + |b| when dealing with vectors. Hence, the sinθ for the (a + b) case won't necessarily correspond to the sum of |a||c|sinθ + |b||c|sinθ. The operation is not distributive over vector addition in the sense provided. So, statement ④ is false.\n\n### Correct Statements:\nConsidering the evaluation, the correct statements are ①, ②, and ③.\n\nSubmission by Sharon Helise and David Floyd\nHelp= Text: Technical writer Sharon Helise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand IT expert David Floyd Spoken English with 3 back-end text log sys=\n状态 The result gives new applications and history of retreat, disproving the facts of which people treat new technology dumb."}
