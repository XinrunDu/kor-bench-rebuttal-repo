Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nA@B denotes the element-by-element maximization operation (A @ B)_{ij} = \\max(A_{ij}, B_{ij}) of matrix A and matrix B.\n\n### Question:\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 6 \\\\\n  7 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  2 & 7 \\\\\n  9 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A&B.\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To compute \\( A @ B \\) using the element-by-element maximization operation, we need to compare each corresponding element of matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and select the larger value.\n\nGiven matrices:\n\\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\\[ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\\\ 9 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWe compute the element-by-element maximization as follows:\n\n1. \\((A @ B)_{11} = \\max(5, 2) = 5\\)\n2. \\((A @ B)_{12} = \\max(6, 7) = 7\\)\n3. \\((A @ B)_{21} = \\max(7, 9) = 9\\)\n4. \\((A @ B)_{22} = \\max(8, 0) = 8\\)\n\nThus, the resulting matrix is:\n\\[ A @ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 7 \\\\ 9 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThe answer in the specified form is:\n\\[ \\[((5,7),(9,8))\\] \\]"}
