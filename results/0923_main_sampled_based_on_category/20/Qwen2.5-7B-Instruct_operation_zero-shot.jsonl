According to the rule, if \\(a\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\), then \\(a \\※ b = a/b + 2\\).\n- So, \\(25※5 = 25/5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\\).\n\nNext, we use the result of 25※5 (which is 7) to compute 7※14:\n- 7 is not a multiple of 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 7.\n- According to the rule, if neither a is a multiple of b nor b is a multiple of a, then \\(a \\※ b = 24\\).\n- So, \\(7※14 = 24\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[24]]"}
