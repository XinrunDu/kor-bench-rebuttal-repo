According to the rule, a#b is the average of all even numbers between a and b, including a and b.\n\nGiven the equation 3 #X = 6, we need to find the value(s) of X that satisfy this equation.\n\nStep 1: Understand what 3 #X means. This means we are looking for the average of all even numbers between 3 and a value X (inclusive), and this average is 6.\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation based on the definition of the custom operation:\n\\[3 #X = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all even numbers between 3 and X (inclusive)}}{\\text{Count of all even numbers between 3 and X (inclusive)}} = 6\\]\n\nStep 3: Simplify the problem to find X. Since we know the average is 6, the sum of all even numbers between 3 and X must be 6 times the count of these even numbers.\n\nGiven that 3 is not an even number, the first even number after 3 is 4. Let's denote the count of even numbers from 4 to X as n. The sequence of even numbers starting from 4 to X can be represented as 4, 6, 8, ..., X (if X is even). The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\\[S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (first \\ term + last \\ term)\\]\nWhere S is the sum, and n is the number of terms.\n\nStep 4: Since the average of these numbers is 6, we have:\n\\[6 = \\frac{S}{n}\\]\n\\[S = 6n\\]\n\nSubstituting the sum formula into the equation gives us:\n\\[6n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (4 + X)\\]\n\\[12 = 4 + X\\]\n\\[X = 8\\]\n\nHowever, we must ensure that X being 8 indeed makes the average of all even numbers between 3 and 8 (inclusive, considering only 4, 6, and 8 since 3 is ignored as it's not even) equal to 6. \n\nThe sum of these even numbers is 4 + 6 + 8 = 18, and there are 3 even numbers, so the average is 18 / 3 = 6, which matches the requirement.\n\nTherefore, X = 8 is the correct answer.\n\n### Answer:\n[[8]]"}

So for 3￠X, we have:\n\n3￠X = log_X(3) + log_3(X)\n\nGiven that 3￠X = 17/4, we can write:\n\nlog_X(3) + log_3(X) = 17/4\n\nLet's solve for X:\n\nlog_X(3) + log_3(X) = 17/4\n\nThis equation is not straightforward to solve algebraically due to the nature of logarithms, especially without a direct logarithmic identity that simplifies log_a(b) + log_b(a). However, we can use the change of base formula to try to find a numerical solution for X.\n\nThe change of base formula tells us that for any positive numbers a and b (with b ≠ 1):\n\nlog_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b)\n\nChoosing c to be a convenient base, such as e or 10, we can rewrite the equation in terms of a single base. Let's use base 10 for simplicity:\n\nlog_X(3) + log_3(X) = 17/4\nlog_X(3) = log_10(3) / log_10(X)\nlog_3(X) = log_10(X) / log_10(3)\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n\n(log_10(3) / log_10(X)) + (log_10(X) / log_10(3)) = 17/4\n\nThis form still doesn't easily simplify algebraically. Given the instruction to solve it as a numerical problem, we approach it by recognizing that we are looking for a specific X such that the sum of the two logarithms equals 17/4. Given the symmetric nature of the equation in terms of X, it suggests we might be looking at a situation where X is a power of 3 or a specific root of 3 due to the symmetry of the logarithmic properties, but directly solving it algebraically in this form is not straightforward without iterative methods or numerical approximation for X.\n\nFor an exact numerical solution, especially without initial intentions to use numerical methods described in detail, we recognize the need for a direct computational check or a numerical approximation. Given the instruction to provide a numerical answer, typically this would involve a numerical check or computational approximation. However, for the sake of staying within the scope of a direct solution attempt, we would typically use a calculator or computational tool to iteratively find the value of X that satisfies the equation.\n\nGiven the complexity and the directive to solve it as a straightforward problem without computational check in this format, the solution approach outlines the algebraic and logical steps but does not provide a direct numerical answer due to the requirement for X to be a specific value that would typically be found through numerical methods.\n\nFor an exact answer:\n\n- In practice, X would be found through numerical methods or direct computation, checking values of X around the square root of 3 or other intuitive values that might simplify the logarithmic sum due to logarithmic identities, but without direct computation shown, the answer leads to a recognition that the exact numerical value should be found through numerical methods not directly verifiable without a computational tool.\n\nFor educational clarity, if we were to solve it numerically, recognizing the symmetry and the properties of logarithms, X would be found close to but not exactly a straightforward computation without direct use of a numerical solver or computational tool.\n\nTherefore, under the directive for an exact numerical answer as if found through numerical methods:\n\n[[X ≈ numerical solution found through iterative or direct computational methods]].\n\nThis directive highlights the importance of computational tools for solving such logarithmic equations accurately."}

The correct approach to find X, given the mistake in intermingling the direct solution from the imaginary part (which correctly simplifies to finding X directly from the imaginary component's setup), is to correct my approach to directly solving from the given complex equation's structure. Let's correct this by directly focusing on balancing the equation as initially intended but correctly executed:\n\nGiven:\n\\(2X^2 + 8Xi - 8 = 37 + 60i\\)\n\nFrom the imaginary parts:\n\\(8X = 60\\)\n\\(X = 7.5\\)\n\nThis correction leads to the same conclusion, but the mistake was in the overcomplication of the explanation. The direct solution from the setup correctly identifies X by solving the equation related to the coefficient of the imaginary part, as initially intended but without the unnecessary additional steps incorrectly implied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\(X = 7.5\\)\n\nWrapped in double square brackets as requested:\n[[7.5]]"}

So, A∪B is the set of all natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n2. **Intersection of A and B (A∩B):** The intersection of A and B is simply the set of elements that are common to both A and B. Since A and B are, by definition, the same set (positive integers), their intersection is the entire set of positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n3. **Applying the Custom Operation (A￡B):** We take the union of A and B and then subtract the intersection of A and B. Since A∪B and A∩B are identical in this case, subtracting A∩B from A∪B would lead to an empty set because A∪B and A∩B are the same set of positive integers.\n\nTherefore, A￡B is an empty set.\n\n### Answer:\n[[{}]]"}

So,\n\nf□g(π/4) = sec^2(π/4) + 1\n\nSince sec(θ) = 1/cos(θ), we have:\n\nsec(π/4) = 1/cos(π/4) = √2\n\nSo,\n\nf□g(π/4) = (√2)^2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[3]]."}
