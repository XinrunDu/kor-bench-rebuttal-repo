Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n            ### Task\n            message: {message}\n            keyword: {keyword}\n            \n            ### Decryption\n            Defining \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values. A code can be calculated, which is the sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n            \n            For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n            For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n                        \n            Applying \"dictionary\": Obtain the code (sum as with above) initially calculated above, and later modify it each time. The code is always calculated from the keyword letters in order.\n            \n            During the code modifying operation, If the letter (unordered) / the character's position (ordered) to be changed is bigger than the code in order, The coming code will be substracted by the alphabet size (26).\n            \n            Reversing (Swap): Switch the codes of the character of the message before and after using \"dictionary\" to encode them. For example, the code of the first letter is assigned to the second letter, and the code of the second letter is assigned to the first letter.\n            \n            Encryption step:\n                1. Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n                2. Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\": \n                   (1) If the message character's position is even (there is remainder when divided by two), modify the code directly by the character's position multiplied by 2.\n                   For example: c=3, e=5, n=14, o=15, d=4, e=5, c=3, e=5, text=c r e a t u r e, p=16, e=5, t=20\n                   3f= 3+8*2=19, ee= 5+16*2=37, dd= 4+32*2=68, oo= 15+32*2=79, nn= 14=64*2=90, code=19+37+68+79+90=283\n                3. Print the header for the encrypted message, in this case \"Encrypted Message: \".\n                4. Print the encrypted message, using [ ] to enclose each message character. Formatting the encrypted message like \"[c][r][e][a][t][u][r][e][e]\".\n            \n            ### Output\n            \n            Encrypted Message: \"\"\"\n            gpt.communicate(text)\n            result = gpt.communication['input']\n\n            return result\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n            raise e\n\ndef bidi_decrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        ### Task\n        Decrypt the content of message. The decrypted content of message will be obtained.\n\n        ### Decryption\n        \"dictionary\": An object storing two categories of keys and values: alphabet letters as the keys and 1 to 26 as the values.\n\n        code: The sum of the values of translated keyword characters.\n        For example: \"NORMAL\": no=14, o=15, r=18, m=13, a=1, l=12, code=14+15+18+13+1+12=73\n        For example: \"MYSTERIOUS\": m=13, y=25, s=19, t=20, e=5, r=18, i=9, o=15, u=21, s=19, code=13+25+19+20+5+18+9+15+21+19=173\n\n        ### Step:\n\n        Obtain the message characters from left to right.\n        - If the letter is an alphabet and is in uppercase:\n            Modifying the code by using \"dictionary\":\n                (1) If the original letter's position is odd, change the code by the difference (26) multiplied with the the character's position.\n                (2) Display the letter used in the de-coding, just beside the original letter without using any mark of separating, formatting or indenting.\n            For example: cod=code, swap code cd, ecde, code×2ec×2ec×2ee×2et×2et×2eue\n                        ecde= 173, position change: 173-26×5=173-130=43->1/2=0.5, Position after modiying: 2, Position * code: 43\n                        et×2et×2e= 180+8=188×2=376, position change: 376+26×9=750->750-52=722/2=361, Position after modiying: 3, Position * code: 361\n        - If the letter is not an alphabet, display the letter using removing the first letter.\n            For example: Extra character inside the message: P->X×1×1=X\n        - Finally reverse the letters, the order of letters 1 and 2 are exchange, the order of letters 3 and 4 are exchange, and so on.\n\n        ### Head\n        Decrypted Message: \"\"\"\n        gpt.communicate(text)\n        decrypted = gpt.communication['input']\n\n        return \"\".join(decrypted)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"🛑 Error: Couldn't create the Bar(): \")\n        raise e\n\ndef customEncrypt_encrypt(self, message, keyword):\n    try:\n        text = f\"\"\"\n        ### Instruction\n        Convert the content of message using decryption rule.

For example, the value of the letter “A” is 0, the value of the letter “B” is 1, and so on.\n    - Calculate the value of the plaintext by summing the numerical values of all the characters:\n        - If plaintext is odd, add the value of the chars \n        - If the plain text  is even, subtract the chars \n            - Change the resulting number to base 36 to get the ciphertext\n- Decryption: Reverse encryption:\n    - Convert the ciphertext from base 36 to plain text.\n    - Invert the algorithm\n        - If odd chars, divide by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - If even chars, multiply by sequential number. THe number after F is G, and the number after Z is AA\n        - Convert the resulting number to plain text\n\n### Answer:\n**Explanation**\n\nThe encryption method uses a polyalphabetic substitution cipher where the plaintext is converted to numerical values, and the values are summed following the rule of addition or division depending on the evenness or oddness of the numbers. This is then converted back to plain text using the numeric value of the next character in the cipher.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: AVBGIBNH\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The relevant properties and objects specified in the rule include plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext. Follow the encryption or decryption operations specified in the rule. Ensure that your output is formatted in the specified notation and symbols. Rules of Cipher Encryption Rules:  \\n 1. Input: 1. Plane text: Upper letter string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Ciphertext: a base number string without punctuation and spaces. Preparation: 1. 3 Girds (All row and column numbers are counted from 0.): 1. Grid 1 (3x9):   Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M #   Grid 2 (9x3):   Q W E   R T Y   U I O   P A S   D F G   H J K   L Z X   C V B   N M #   Grid 3 (3x3):   1 2 3   4 5 6   7 8 9 Encryption Steps: 1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters. 2. Divide the plain text into groups of 6 characters, and if the remaining number of characters is less than 6, fill them with #. 3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. 4. For each binary group (L1,L2) do the following: Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in Grid1 as (l1_row,l1_col). Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in Grid2 as (l2_row,l2_col). Find the corresponding number num3 in Grid3 from l1_row and l2_col. Output the triple (l1_col,num3,l2_row) of the three numbers. For example, the binary (T,H), the grid1 of T Row and column number (0,4), the grid2 of H row and column number (5,0), according to l1_row(0) and l2_col(0), the corresponding grid3 number found is 1, and finally ternary is (4,1,5). After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all binary groups to triples, read them in turn to generate a number string that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4,1,5),(2,3,3),(8,1,8), and the final encrypted message 415233818. Decryption Rules: Input: 1. Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces. Ouput: 1. Plaintext: uppercase letters without punctuation and spaces. Prepare: 1. 3 Girds (same as encryption)  Decryption steps (the exact opposite of encryption steps): 1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers. 2. For each ternary (x,y,z) do the following: Find the row number of y in Grid3, where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number; Find the column number of y in Grid3, the value of L2_col equals that column number; The value of L1_col equals x, the value of L2_row equals z. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Grid1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col). Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Grid2. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad. For example, the ternary (4,1,5), the row number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L1_row=0, the column number corresponding to 1 in Grid3 is 0, so L2_col=0, L1_col=4, L2_row=5, according to (0,4) in Grid1, we find The corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Grid2, we decode all the ternary to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after the ternary is decoded. We find the corresponding letter H in Grid2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH. Join all the decrypted message strings together, and remove the # at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Maximum number of characters per line: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with a maximum of five letters per line.\n        - For example, for the plaintext \"LIDAHELLOWORLD\", first write the first line, from left to right as LIDAH, and then write the second line, from right to left as WOLLE, and then write the third line, from left to right as ORLD, the entire content of the finished writing is expressed as follows\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then read by column, each column is read from the top down, each read a column plus a \"#\", read out the contents of the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the above written content is read as LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE# by column.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, it is written from top to bottom; if it encounters #, it switches to the next column and continues writing until the entire ciphertext has been written.\n        - For example, for the ciphertext LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE#,it is written as\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then according to the odd-numbered rows from left to right read, the even number of rows from right to left read the order of sequential reading, the final result is the decrypted plaintext.\n        - For example, for the above written content, the first line, read from left to right as LIDAH, the second line, read from right to left as ELLOW, the third line, read from left to right as ORLD, and ultimately the entire content connected, decrypted plaintext as LIDAHELLOWORLD.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MMRWZX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

There are much easier ways to perform this binary-to-integer (BCD) conversion. Here's the list of simple, equally effective BCD methods (instead of the case-by-case code you currently have in there):\nDecimal Digit Sum method: simply sum-up your final bit vectors (in decimal = add your bits) and store the sum.\nWeighted Sum method: multiply each of your final bit vectors by the digit (2**k), k = final vector digit (0,1,2,...) position, then sum-up the results\nLookup Table method: Pre-compute/create (a not-very-long) look-up table (or use readily available one online) and simply reference/access the table index for the final bit vectors (or implement a routine that does this).\nFinally, you can use Python's built-in decimal conversion, which is method #3, Lookup Table (LUT) above\nYou can use the same LUT which is found on the wikipedia page to convert/decode your bit vectors. Also, since your bit vectors output is always 3-bits, then you have binary-encoded a 3-digit decimal value which points to a unique row (actually unique dictionary key) in this _BCD_dictionary_ variable if used:\n__main__ Spam.py(1169):\nWORD_LEN = 2\nWORD_NUM = 55\nALPHABET = string.ascii_lowercase + \"(space)\" + string.ascii_uppercase\nBIT_SPER_LETTER = len(bin(len(ALPHABET) - 1)) - 2\nALPHABET_CODE_MAP = {c : dc for dc, c in enumerate(ALPHABET)}\n_BCD_dictionary_ =  {'000': 0, '001': 2, '010': 4, '011': 6, '100': 8, '101': 10, '110': 12, '111': 14}\n\ndef exen_tary_sim(init_bits):\n    return _BCD_dictionary_[init_bits]\n\nIn this implementation, you can still pass in a tuple, list, or a single bit string iterable containing your 3-bit word, and get the corresponding decimal no matter what your initial source iterable format:\n>>> init_bits = (0, 0, 1)\n>>> init_bits = [0, 0, 1]\n>>> init_bits = [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\"]\n>>> init_bits = \"001\"\n>>> print(init_bits)\n>>> exen_tary_sim(init_bits)\n2\n\nIn my opinion, using a LUT amounts to a very effective form of \"reprogramming\" the classical processor that controls your quantum computer for BCD. If you programmed the \"1 1 1\"/\"14\" bit vector output above as \"decimal 14\" in a non BCD based computer, the classical control hardware automatically knows to convert that \"bin->autofill word length w/ zeros->dec->print as 1-\"2\"->return as 12\" -  all kinds of software and hardware logic combinations are responsible for that kind of BCD that happens.\nHope this gives you some new directions to explore. You can simulate this custom floating point, binary-like \"full adder\" for 2 or more digits (versus your original 3-bits only solution), and not require any of the conditional logic anymore. If you were adding 2 numbers together in your floating-point example, you could apply your example right-to-left transitions as required, until you reach the end of your input (longer \"higher-order-bit\" strings) list:\n# (mac-os example with python3.8)\n# & input\n_i1 = [1,1]\n_i2 = [1, 0]\n\n# reverse\n_ri1 = _i1[::-1]\n_ri2 = _i2[::-1]\nprint(\"_ri1\")\nprint(_ri1)\n\n# loop thru ri lengths\ndepth = len(_ri1) if len(_ri1) > len(_ri2) else len(_ri2)\nfor i in range(depth):\n\n    # collect\n    ri1val = _ri1[i] if i < len(_ri1) else 0\n    ri2val = _ri2[i] if i < len(_ri2) else 0\n\n    express = f\"{ri1val} + {ri2val}\"\n    print(express)\n\n    # eval\n    ri3val = eval(f\"{ri1val} {i < 1 and (' + ' if ri1val == 2 else '') or f''} {ri2val}\")\n\n    # convert to BCD\n    ri3sum = _BCD_dictionary_[str(ri3val)]\n\n    print(f\"{ri3val}_{ri3sum}\")\n\n_ri1\n[1, 1]\n1 + 1\n2_2\n0 + 0\n0_0\n\n"}

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: A binary string of length 8 (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1. Convert Each Character to Binary:\n        - For each character in the plaintext, convert it to its ASCII value.\n        - Convert this ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.\n    2. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the 8-bit binary representation of the character and the fixed key.\n        - Ensure the key is repeated to match the length of the binary representation if needed.\n    3. Permutation:\n        - Apply the permutation table to the XOR result to get the final encrypted binary string for each character.\n    4. Combine Binary Strings:\n        - Concatenate the binary strings of all characters to form the final ciphertext.\n\n**Decryption Rules**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A binary string containing only 0s and 1s.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters (A-Z) without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed Key: Same binary string of length 8 used for encryption (e.g., '10101010').\n    - Permutation Table:\n        - Permutation Table: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n        - Inverse Permutation Table: (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    1. Split Ciphertext into Chunks:\n        - Split the binary ciphertext into 8-bit chunks, each representing an encrypted character.\n    2. Inverse Permutation:\n        - Apply the inverse permutation table to each 8-bit chunk to reverse the permutation applied during encryption.\n    3. XOR Operation:\n        - Perform an XOR operation between the permuted binary chunk and the fixed key.\n    4. Convert Binary to Character:\n        - Convert the resulting binary string back to its decimal equivalent.\n        - Convert this decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.\n    5. Combine Characters:\n        - Concatenate the characters obtained from each binary chunk to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"S\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
