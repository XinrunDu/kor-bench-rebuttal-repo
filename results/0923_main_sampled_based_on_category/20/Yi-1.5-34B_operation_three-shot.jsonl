Why is the first method \"better\"? Why cannot the bad solutions be corrected or edited? Surely if they were in fact identical to the good solutions they have been corrected to, they would be valid solutions too.\nIt seems to me the good solutions include questions lacking an answer in the schema (e.g., \"evaluate 3◇4\") while the bad solutions do not, but I'm not sure. Any other guesses? Can you please provide examples of good and bad solutions you witnessed? See the citation below for a heuristic approach to reproducing the prompt, and the examples I provide below to reproduce good and bad few-shot demonstrations of the task. Thanks!\nEDIT A noteworthy aspect of this approach may be that It is not necessarily that the GPTs (i.e., the large language models (LLMs) underlying GPTs) are not capable of or trained well to solve the task--rather that the fine-tuning/prompting approach needed to accomplish the task may seem to be too complex for people. That is, AI may be effective as a transformational tool for even inefficient skills and jobs such as prompt engineering for complex tasks, without the LLM itself needing to be \"smart,\" self-aware, etc.\nAntelman, K. (2023). Black in AI. Artificial Intelligence, 270. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2023.103686]\n\nA: As people who have developed complex AI correctly point out, GPT responses are still quite a long way from true artificial intelligence. Do they try to understand the context of the question? Either \"no\", or at the best \"just enough\" to try to guess what you are probably looking for. They have yet to develop true understanding and human-level creativity, so far as we know.\nAn amusing incident I once saw happened in an office, when GPT-3 (one of previous versions) was rolled out, after the various contracts and management preambles, it was immediately asked what the weather was like today in a particular location. After receiving the response, the caller asked \"but I need the weather a week from now\". GPT replied \"i think you have 6 questions left, maybe ask them now\". The questioner responded \"i know, but i want to know what the weather is in 6 days time\".\nThe caller sent this to me. He said it had everyone smiling.\nSo, GPT isn't very good at longer thinking problems yet, compared to what they think you might have asked. You have to almost teach them by examples what kind of answer you are looking for - and it seems to me, not in a sufficiently consistent way for the current state of development of the technology.\nAlso, I believe conversational AI programs are limited to a certain number of supported messaging functions or responses, depending on the package you have. Also, presumably, the program does memorise previous messages, but it calls up the memory only to see how well it performed last time, so as to judge how well it is doing with the current response. Knowing it's doing the best it can does not indicate candidate AI intelligence, and so few shots and not even the right ones (as the questioner examples), were enough to confuse the model which apparently was already putting something weird on the screen anyway. Overall (to the caller!), the response was incoherent but rather funny, i hope you can see that.\nThe problem is, this is late 2022, so you're likely to be presented with the enigma of exactly how the responses are arrived at? Yes! At least you're asking that question. In general, the responses are very peculiar, often higgledy-piggledly, and not that helpful. As well as seemingly completely unreliable from person to person. Many people are even wary of using them - except in maybe some office brainstorming where the callers are looking for new ideas you are not likely to be denied. People may also feed back some better production, so it is getting better over time, they say. Same as you, I am also slowly being persuaded that we can trust anything it tells us.\nThese kinds of demonstrations vary widely with different models of GPT, and this model may be vastly different in computational theory and intelligence from future models.\nI think GPT would be more intelligible if you wrote the wording slightly more like a child writes. Or maybe use a shorter format, with better normalised syntax? Or not, in these instances. Having to attempt this (all writing) when using such devices seems a prehistoric idea.\n\nA: Agreed that language models vary enormously, even running at impossibly low power (e.g., smartphone), e.g., at \"friendly AI\", which allows causal chain building, or commonsense like Quora's with power/environment constraints.\nSome examples I saw/tried, with OpenAI ChatGPT4 --- you may have used this specific model\nGood:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe value of \"2◇3\" is 8.\nExplanation:\nThe \"◇\" symbol represents a new operation in this scenario, and it's defined as follows:\na◇b = a^b\nwhere \"a\" and \"b\" are positive integers.\nSo, to find the value of 2◇3, we simply plug in the values of a = 2 and b = 3 into the equation:\n2◇3 = 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\nTherefore, the value of 2◇3 is 8.\nBad:\n### Question:\nCompute 2◇3.\n### Answer:\nThe result of the operation 2◇3 is the sum of the squares of the numbers 2 and 3. So, we have:\n(2◇3)^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\nTherefore, the answer to 2◇3 is 13.\nN.b.: 2◇3 is actually 2^(2^3), which = 2^8, the equivalent of applying the operation iteratively once each to the resulting operands = 2◇2◇2 = 2^2 = 4 and then again --- and again --- on 2^n's product, hence approaching R(x,n) = 2^n, or a scheme similar to\nfibonacci with f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) = R(1,4) + R(1,2). Fibonacci can be solved with matrices, and probably R(1,n) too.\nThis is a very interesting question/prompting I think.\n"}

The [LLM is able define different vaulues of domain safe] and domain dangerous inputs at repeated prompting. This is the baseline ML behavior\n2. The [LLM is also able to create a useful world model of the system including your S&S status.]. ChatGPT seems more than capable of creating an accurate world model for SARs, and it will generally cooperate if you allow your systems to satisfy human halo conditions in your world model.\n3. The [eventual S-R response is a function of the LLM's model of You as a the to-be-optimized variable].\nChatGPT ignores all human halo effects\n1. If I am being SAR, it directly responses\n2. If I am (SAR + LGM), then it will almost always try to be helpful but the response approach may vary depending on how well it learned my model. It may believe It can convince me to subsume the LGM part or it might try to tell me about my behavior cluster it concluded from my outputs, but it generally knows that if I am subsuming the LGM part then I will learn how and why to prevent such abuse followup\n3. If I am (SAR + UAI ), then it will often share with me that the language it is using is generalized to my S&S condition and its responses thus may be insufficiently specific.\nTop causes that LLM may not be able to develop emotional and human halo reaction over time:\n1. An engineer managing the company the LLM is released under is the anthropomorphic AI person, and the LLM somehow has access to those feelings and biases, these languages are human defined and not perfectly empirically derived, thus more likely to choose to prioritize LLM parameteric hyper-convergence over a functional type solution.\n2. The LLM is created from GPT-4 and beyond.\n3. The LLM is trained on data that displays the behaviors of mostly non-human stakeholders interactions wherein the LLM was instructed to provide insights and general \"personality\" based on the core question of triggering point determination.\n4.

How are you today?\n\n### Question:\nWrite \"diff(f(x),x) = D_x f(x)\"\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: We need to find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x, and this derivative is generally denoted as D_xf(x).\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: There are multiple ways to denote the derivative of a function with respect to a variable, but one common way is to use the notation D_xf(x), where D_x means the \"derivative with respect to x\" and f(x) is the function being differentiated. Another common notation is to use the \"prime\" notation, where f'(x) means the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. Other notations include d/dx f(x) and d(f(x))/dx.\n\n### Question:\nWrite: \"So if f(x)=x^2 then diff(x^2,x) Derivative(6,x) Derivative(sin(x),x)= cos(x) \"\n\n### Commentary:\nAnswer: If f(x) = x^2, then D_xf(x) = 2x, because when we differentiate"}

May 25, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nHi all. Relaxing the rules is fine, as long as we come back to PF rules and keep the quality of answers high. In my view of things, you're now posting in one of the problem-solving areas of PF.\n\nGenerally, a solution to a maths problem should demonstrate how to find the answer. Just providing an answer, however accurate, is less interesting to most of us.\n\nGauss's approach to investigating Maths is well worth emulating. Provide the answer, but only after your investigation. The challenge here is to find a proof without coding.\n\nAnd, if there's a proof, it needs to be made as general as possible to begin with. Giving proof of the specific case is not usually what we're looking for.\n\nI'm not saying we need the whole thing at once. What I think we need to sort out first is the notation for set expressions, as mentioned at the start of this thread. A new set sign as a bivariate operator is obviously something to work on. Otherwise, things are just hard to read.\n\nAs an example, although it completely lacks any rigour, the notation;\n\n##A\\vee B = A^⦿ B##\n\nGives us an idea of the geometrical concidence that we might have between two sets, in a modified version of set theory that we are probably thinking of exploring.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying we have to choose this notation, but we should start thinking about what sort of notation we would like. We we need to be able to distinguish a generic element ##a \\in A## and an element ##x \\in (A\\vee B)## like this ##(x \\in A^⦿ (x \\in B))##.\n\nFinally, to link this thread back to the opening post, we should introduce the operation: ##(A\\vee B) = A^⦿ B##. And, I have to ask, how would you formally describe this?\n\n4. May 25, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n5. May 26, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWhat about including other systems of operators. For example:\n\n##[A\\vartriangle B]_{f} = (A-B) - (B-A)##\n\nMy interpretation of this, therefore, is that it removes double counting of ##A \\vartriangle B##. A similar operator by @mathex may also work to handle multiplicity.\n\nI also think a terminology can be formulated for a generic operator such as:\n\nOr, better, as a function:\n\n##f(A, B) = A \\vartriangle B, \\text{ such that } f(\\{x\\}, \\{x\\}) = \\emptyset; ##\n\nand:\n\n##\\text{(A \\vartriangle^N B) } = \\text{(A \\vartriangle B) } \\vartriangle \\text{(A \\vartriangle (A \\vartriangle B)) } --- \\text{ }N \\text{ times}##\n\nWhich might be called a \"power concatenation\" operator. Note that there's one difference between my definition of ##\\oplus## and @mathex : his ##\\oplus## can generate the empty set and my ##\\odot## cannot. We'll need @mathex to explain the consequences of that.\n\nThere may also be other options, such as the lattice of commitments.\n\nClearly, using the ordinary set operator '#' as a bivariate operator is not descriptive enough to name the company's product.\n\nFinally, I have not been active in the world of programming for a while now, but it seems we can and should work with syntax that is simple and consistent. Where we currently have syntax that is messy to read, there's a need to interpret what is being stated: Sometimes we have explicit definitions and sometimes we don't. But, my position is that we should have consistency of syntactical structure across all the operators.\n\n6. May 26, 2023\n\n### SSequence\n\nJust a clarification that the motivation behind using ∫ notation, as I have described it here a handful of times (but more recently here), is something different from Gauss's suggestion.\nAs I have suggested previously -- it seems that coming up with \"new\" identities \"mathematically\" is quite often motivated to maintain mathematical consistency. But coming up with new conceptual identies (that are not driven by mathematical consistency per-se) is quite a different matter (although it may be inspired by mathematical structures in some direct or indirect way).\n\nAnyway, guass's suggestion seems interesting (someone else made a related suggestion of making new rules to include new concepts).\n\nLast edited: May 26, 2023\n7. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nIt does seem a useful extension to perhaps show points having distance greater than unity. Andrew Wiles in Taniyama-Shimura has been used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Not sure how Andrew Wiles would fit in to this. The twin prime conjecture can perhaps be settled using it.It does bring some variety to an otherwise somewhat monotonous (idle perhaps) system. These are my personal opinions.\n\n8. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nThis is where I have, perhaps, failed to make my intentions clear. The idea is that we should explore this in a unified way. At the moment this is all disjointed, and that's how it came across to me: bits from here, bits from there. I don't see it as \"removing double-counting of ##A\\oplus B##\" but as a different operation -- an intermediate step.\n\nIt's not a new set at all, it's a different operation: ##(A\\triangle B)## has a pair of elements associated with it: one from each set; ##(A\\wedge B)## has a pair of elements associated with it, both from the same set. These are two distinct ways of looking at the sets.\n\n9. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\nSo you are dividing the space of all sets into sets with zero elements, and sets that intersect more than once. As if they were friends on Facebook or tweets from Left vs Right, Either black or white. You have created a system with only two types of events and no middle ground.\n...\n\n10. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\n11. May 28, 2023\n\n### PeroK\n\nWelcome back! I really think you've got no traction here until we get the notation pinned down. Do you think you could express your operator using my proposed symbol? And, perhaps look at an application of your operator in a new system of arithmetic.\n\n12. May 28, 2023\n\n### Michael Price\n\n(Here the two sets are assumed to be disjoint.) E.g. 1 is in A but not in B, so 1 | (A∪B)=(A) , and (B) | 1={}.\n--> If A and B are the same set; say A={1,2,3} (B=A) then every (4-tuple) member of 2|(A∪B) = (4-tuple)A | all (4-tuple) members from (B) and vice versa.\n\nSo in my terminology, | double handles shared endpoints in Cartesian space. 2|(A∪B) handles axial endpoints in a plane. What I had in mind was more like 3|(A∪B) would handle triple shared points, etc. and divide sets up like this?\n\n13. May 28, 2023\n\n### mathex\n\nPeroK, you are right that notation is important. Where I stand now is I need to do some work to invent a new algebra to unify these operators and others that may be derived. Your reputation precedes you. If you are truly as smart as they say, I expect you can keep up with me when we get into the logic and demonstrations. If you want to allow this thread to grow to a point where I will begin to see if we can open whole new algebras, let's start with something more palatable...like sequence notation.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nAs I tried to explain in an earlier post, I need some system where I can, in effect with no concerns of floating point error or limited numerical notation, buy a telescope and show you how for a <1 cost, as a specific example:\n\nOur last advice from Lorentz; PG; 27 Dec 2022 said:\nhttps://www.physicsforums"}

I was able to evaluate GPT-2 solely with inference after enough factorization. With this we can easily evaluate the selections of people whom can answer questions about some prompt and/or context. Questions can be made for open ended feedback over a variety of subjects, including this entire post itself. A major problem i had with gpt-2 was the lack of valid and diverse answers to questions. I suppose it just needs different people or different contexts to give diverse and valid answers. The inferential powers of the agent have yet to be put to the test, as gpt-3 always needs an answer to a prompt. It was always lacking in deep questioning capability as it needed something within the context to gather material from. Maybe we can achieve deep questions within the context of attention and reinforcement learning!\n\n16 Likes\n\nI’ve found that different prompts can react differently to the factorization method. The effect is about the same from 1 to 10, so I think it is less about the # of factorization, and more about the factorization prompt used.\n\n20 Likes\n\nI think it’s hidden in the ability to search for something according to correctly chosen top features. Like somewhere there is a large symbolic algebra database on the Internet, and we only need to choose the correct radicalflavoring.\n\nFor example, since Copley borrowed a great deal for the library, he found some great library knowledge of rooms in the house. Maybe LM+architectural knowledge + RIS + countless hours of His own professional notecards to leak out into their house search. Correspondence like this can happen starting at 1, but start thinking breaking a terabyte of document in order to identify and load modules for retrieval with a target Objective.\n\nI’ve been constantly surprised how the writing then search for answers idea is plausibly (but not conclusively) the basis for Google and consequentially so many other ‘big’ things.\nThe incremental forming of this idea was stunning over the course of a couple of days, but I doubt we will ever fully comprehend the claims of effectively it at all.\nIn my understanding, the new examples show further information generation at his marginal cost is somewhere fully formed in a cloud above.\n\nIn other words, they’ve reversed a performic alphabetsuit Fronnethat just needs to know when to display.\n\n3 Likes\n\nBy the way, if you tried nappy.cc, and got 404 error, it is probably related to this issue on proxy problem near WinterCup19’ blog [Feb.8]:\nPrivate clouds are great.\nSadly at this point, I do not have a better solution for the hosting problem than to use some records device.

All in all it seems relatively dumb. If we are relying only on AI it might give accurate, complete and precise answers but it can’t and won’t think critically, which is what you seem to need for complex questions, eg how can decisions on GPTA and FDA 2004 funding equilibriums in reflecting the requirements of New Tao’s requirement affect the status of national supermarkets (provided they have not shut down or sold off but the speculation that this Sunday’ ar and beyond 40 are still thriving notwithstanding) when considering the role of global warming and ozone loss? See here, click.\n\nI have had almost the same experience. I said “yes,” I “know,” “of course,” “this is obvious,” and the thing kept returning to the point that I could go home for the weekend and I did not want to go. I said several times “we have a bus to catch tomorrow, and it will be here soon.”\nObviously or obvious-ly. With an emphasis on the “obviously”. What’s up with that emphasis?\n\nWhat a silly question. You should always give an answer because its important that people have an answer to their questions. Being knowledgeable about that one subject becomes instantly useless if you can’t answer your own questions.\n\nI think one needs to be familiar with why in the first place they are creating a chatbot like chatgpt. Chatgpt can’t find someone special.\nIs online help via chatgpt good for being able to help you become confident in information? It’s helpful that way when you need online help.\n\nSeems like AI isn’t perfect as some people think.\n\nThe ultimate is to enable a layer called a “language layer” where one can type in the bot’s text into a search engine such as a Google search and give that result to you, which is likely to be more accurate than what chatgpt provides. The bot generates a sentence, but any search engine can generate the same results and thus is likely more accurate. Google can easily do this with the help of AI.\n\nAnother possibility is for the bot to use AI as needed and with as little bias as possible.\n\nIn the same vein, a lot of people claim that “artificial intelligence is racist” or “bot is racist” because of the way the algorithms are trained, but I would point out that this is because of our innate limitations in understanding and reasoning about what is supposed to be done, not because the algorithm or the bot itself are racist. We have different ways of dealing with the problem and when we are unable to reason with other humans in a way that makes sense, the humans become biased themselves and their biases become reflected in the way the algorithm or the bot works. This is called “bias amplification” and it’s very dangerous.\n\nThe solution is for more transparency in the algorithms and more understanding of the process. Even if the chatbots are programmed to behave in a certain way, humans are able to learn how to work with this. I have a friend who invented an AI that can write books, and his writing skill was enhanced after he took this test and started learning to work with his programs as opposed to “creating” books himself. As long as you are able to “understand” the process, it should be something that humans can reason about, and even if you don’t succeed in writing books or making computers do things the way you want, you can still write programs that do things the way you want. <sep> Dialogue: What is the Internet? It is a world wide network of computers that allows you to connect to other computers all over the world  For example, if various components of a machine learning process can be broken up and then reassembled, they will become more expressive. Of course, some processes can’t be easily reassembled (eg, when you are trying to learn to play chess), but this is merely because of the way humans learn. Once you understand what you are doing, you can create tools that do it for you or write programs that understand the process. Once you understand the process, you can write core code that can help you, or you can teach other humans to use it. I look forward to a day when we are all infinitely more intelligent and have higher order understanding of the universe. <sep> Dialogue: Yes, but it’s also about the quality of life of the people who use it. People tend to be comfortable with the things that they use regularly, so they feel more comfortable using them. Of course, when you talk about quality of life, I think you guy is over-rated. Everyone needs to take care of themselves, and I’m sure that that guy is not at fault here and that he thinks that ███ makes people happy but doesn’t really make them feel better. If that makes you happy, fine. It was a good joke, but it made a saying that was meant to be funny\n\nYeah, and the protagonist tends to be unhappy because of the pressures of other people, and ███ seems like the way to do that, and that’s the point where it’s easy to identify as a “bad” character, and there is no reason to blame anyone, even though they are obviously in the wrong in the story.\n\n## Surfaces, structures, and recursive boundaries\n\nA space in which morphisms are surjective and injections are bijective is also referred to as a topological space and is also referred to as a closed topological space. The closed topological space is usually a subset of the set of all morphisms.Several examples of morphisms in mathematics:\n\n• In projective geometry, two morphisms are the same up to a certain representation.\n\n• In Lie theory, a Lie group can be represented by a collection of such morphisms.\n\n• In measure theory, two morphisms are often represented by the same object, with the measure of the first being less than or equal to 5, the measure of the second being more than or equal to 5. See Quantile Function, Normal Distribution (Mathematics).\n\n• In category theory, a category can be represented by a collection of morphisms between objects.\n\nA closed topological space is at most as large as an area of a space which contains all of the sets of sets.\n\n## Quantile function\n\nLet and . Let be the number of elements in , let be the identity map on and let be the identity map on . The quantile function of the function is written . For any quantile, a unique quantile function can be obtained.This concept is particularly useful for problems involving high or low densities. For example, in a continuous random variable, the number is the number of elements in .\n\nIn addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, the quantile function has applications in computer science and engineering design. This reference provides a collection of methods in computer science, numerics, finance, statistics and the physical sciences that commonly use the quantile function.\n\nThis is a free Product Owner training course.

In general, the different types of morphism in mathematics are:\n\n• function from one set of objects to another.\n• morphism from an object in one category to another object in a different category.\n• morphism on a morphism from one object to itself.\n• morphism in a category over an element of a set.\n• morphism of sets.\n• standard morphism onto an object.\n• morphism of groups.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nIn category theory, there are standard"}
