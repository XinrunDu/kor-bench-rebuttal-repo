It is a cooperative game for one to eight players controlled by a single Game Master. The good thing is that the core set is not very large, which makes it the perfect game to begin with. There's even a free draft of the first scenario [here](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/). I've played it a couple of times (only the first scenario, I don't remember how it goes), and I played the Game Master in my second game and really enjoyed it.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- When asked to respond, respond only with one answer, please do not provide additional information or context to the answers.\n- We want to build a simple Arkham Horror LCG quest scenario for a player controlled by a Game Master (GM) & other 2 non-GM players.\n- All players start out in Arkham Hospital.\n\n### State 1\n\nDo you want two players or three?\n\nInput: (Let say GM chooses two)\n\nEnter: &state 1 2 two players\n\nResponse:\nAgents Jackson Elias and Edward O Kirk are the ones playing.\n Mrs Flowers (Neutral) doesn't like players and they enter Arkham Hospital sooner or later, most likely Argothan Street and Central Street, and if they do, something might happen, depending on your answer in the hospital.\n Mrs Radley (Haunted) enters Arkham Jail, possibly after the first movement. (Assuming that Arkham Jail and Hospital are similar length).\n Mrs Larkin (Cult Leader) has her Seekers.\n The next part starts when the Old Man has been captured.\nDO NOT FORGET TO DIE HO IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\nYou never want to risk ending a scenario peacefully.\nA Note About Madness Triggers: Use this Madness trigger order to resolve all Madness Triggers in gameplay\n- The Singular Madness - Darkness / The Scarlet King\n- The Formless Spawn's Tentacles - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Skinny Little Girl - Yogghr and the Nameless Nyarlathotep\n- The Black Cloaked Woman - The Nameless Nyarlathotep\n\n### State 2\n\n#old-man-joshua-rogers-enters-arkham-hospital\nHow did the end turn out? Was it fun & challenging at the same time? You'll have to make sure to use the \"canvasser\" in this scenario, so there are only four worker pieces (so far, you haven't used them). Let us know if the scenario walks over another scenario made by you.\nWhat should happen as soon as he enters and do we randomly have a crazy old man or should we have a mean old man? If so, how long later does Mr. Joshua Rogers prefer before he dies in his sleep? Is his \"injured\" state dangerous to both investigators?\n\n### Question\n\nIn the preamble, an injured old man arrives at Arkham Hospital, and is placed in room 3 (this is his room, he has a lantern, a small rug, and a robe), and he stays the night there, alone. At noon, the cellars collapse, and a group of workers go out to patch them up.\n\n## State 2b\n\nThere are two non-completely friendly investigators. You didn't say so, but Mrs. Flowers turns out to be friendly..... NOT FALSE FRIENDLY.\n- Mrs Flowers is actually the same person as Dorothea Black.\n- Detection Skill starts at 2 and improves by 1 each day.\n- Investigators cannot harm her and she cannot harm them.\n- They get to fight her first, if she becomes visible in an area where they can fight her normally. There is a chance that she will get a random weird moaning noise, or that she will shoot an icy beam of magic ice (think fusion energy, ice breaking, icicles of\n\n## State 2c\n\nMrs Flowers's friend, Miss Steele, is a dentist. She's new in town and is expected to find work in Arkham Hospital, making room for you (Akahlis). You should probably pick up at least 2 cards that would lead to her coming. Miss Steele is also a good ally for the investigators, even though relationships may be painful. However, if she tried to communicate with Dorothea Black, you don't have to worry.\nLet her fight anyone as long as they don't cause her pain when she does. She could get drugged and behave like a violent animal (think demon possesed someone) that wants to kill everyone (you and the investigators).\n\n## State 2d\n\nOther cards to consider:\n1. The Thing From Beyond (which is a good zombie, but it loses its powers as soon as you destroy all the obstacles near it)\n2. Shoggoth (neutral, the investigator can play it if he likes it though.\n3. The Mad Setanta (which is an insane zombie but it trys to attack your investigators to kill them. Only use it if you plan to have\n\n## State 2e\n\nThe problem is that if you have 1 wounded investigator and the player (and/or investigators), and the other is in any danger. If Mrs Flowers has a good Lantern you can start her. There won't be a need to repair it, so she'll think the trap door is unlatched (it shatter into large pieces and will get damaging pieces on feet).\n\n## State 2f\n\nIf agents are hurt or are really bad, that will be a problem\n\n## State 2g\n\nI will need to know of any investigators lost, but I think that might be a problem\n\n## State 2h\n\nYou should be able to find a room that's not too challenging. I will do my best to make it possible to work through, though I know we may need to playtest it a few times to make sure it's balanced. If one heavily reduces the chance of your investigators being \"wounded\", that makes the scenario less balanced so you will have to adjust your scenario situation carefully\n\n## State 2i\n\nAt least be sure that the player and your investigators can continue on the path, (which means they can make it to\nthe room) but only for the next day because by the second day all the traps will be destroyed\n\n## State 2j\n\nThat is, make sure that all remaining obstacles are removed, unless you're trying to save the investigators' lives which is why there's more than one time one can happen, and since it happens the first time that makes it more likely for the investigators to beat the obstacles later. (once the obstacles have all taken damage, it still might be possible for the investigators to at least open the doors of an area, and they have to hit the obstacles first because they might be used to open the doors of the whole\n\n## State 2k\n\nThat means, too many investigators may still be in trouble of pain and wounded, and that has to be set back to zero at some point, and might require that some area that has actually sort of been fixed not get destroyed by\n\n## State 2l\n\nYou also mention if one has 3 investigators in particular ask if one has several investigators high-endowed ones are worth a lot (meaning a lot of extra investigator cards get added to the scenario as bonus points and extra benefits for the investigators) so it would make sense to\nadd some investigators who don't quite have the higher end investigator's abilities even if that was the exact point of the scenario.\n\n## State 4\n\nOK. Graphic added\nNow that important message has come up:\ndedicated warlords get extra cards that make it harder to win or die before they reach the main objective, or locked\nobjects that break the objectives and prevent the investigators from finding them.

Only some syllables may be used so a hexagram has been supplied to indicate which syllables to use.\n\nThe fourth paragraph:\n\n 'The replaced word must contain all five relationship groups. ...' The phrase FOR circle encourages a ?? is the missing word. The 16 hexagrams in chronological order should be considered to have associated relationships. 1st hexagram is attributed to a King, 2nd hexagram relates to an Emperor, 3rd relates to Official, 4th relates to a Warrior, 5th to a Healer, 6th to a Mentor, 7th to a Sage, 8th to a Parent, 9th to a Child, 10th to a Brother, 11th to a Sister, 12th to a Representative, 13th to a Leader, 14th to a Helper, 15th to a Scribe, 16th to a Student. The missing word must fill all those roles!\n\nThe fifth paragraph:\n\n 'The word will sound like it.' Further interspatial sounds need to be made cyclically - the student to the leader, the healer to the verse (and so on).\n\nI chose a word that rhymes with verse (or at least is phonetically very close to it) for all the required sounds.\nThe hexagrams I replaced:\n\n Two soft vowels and one hard but soft consonant (weorgecyn) created a hexagram for each 1st name of King George I (Heinrich), II (George) and III (Wart) of England. The hexagrams were for King, Emperor, Official, Warrior, Mentor and Sage.\n\nI used the only syllable form for the remaining required words:\n\n Father, Child, Brother, sister, Rep, Leader and Student.\n\nFor the other three, I chose\n\n the three words that are used most often in puzzles; the help蕉, the word rot, and the puzzle.\n\nThe new words were:\n\n truth, faith, heart, miss, police, evil and hexagram.\n\nI think they all relate to the missing word (lets go with helper, can't go quite as Phoebe's suggestion of 'answer').\n\nSome relationship groups could have been chosen differently giving a slightly fewer number of requested groups.\n\nA: My goal was to use\n\n gateway letters.  These are letters that are good for passing through the gates of the house that each relationship lives in.  How do you learn what letters carry what relationship? Easy! Read the oldest special kind of dictionary that Wikipedia still exists and is allowed. That's how you can learn the pillars of light that tells your guidebook of the stars, a journey of light through time. \n\n1. 1: cousin \n2. 2 letters, 3:  home is where the heart is. \n3. You (4) is why you are in my house (5), and as the ruler of this (5), I'm responsible for it. 7. Don't you come in my (6) like that, little soldier. (5) is the boss of you, but I also see horns forming on your head. (5) gets a lot of credit.\n4. 2 sounds bell, 3 resounds, 4 rings, 5 rings, 6 shuts, 7 unlocks, 8 closes, 9 opens, 10 locks, 11 stops, 12 locks again, 13 chains, 14 unlocks by magic, 15 barks away the wolves, 16 howls wearily.\n5. Hexagram 6 indicates that this 5 is a distancer, a grower, a den of invalidation, and a willful agent. Obviously, there is overlap, just like in the King's Hexagrams!\n\n"}

We didn’t have it in our cells but we now have it. This same technique solves the vital rating problem listed here.\n\nWhen the answer is in the form of a calculation expression, this translates across domains, because we already had constraints in place for the domain of answers in our test. Therefore, when reformulating the problem into finding a suitable set of question-answer pairs, we can further constrain the question set to require only calculation as the answer. And hence, that sheds light on how to further algorithmically automate evaluation.\n\nGiven a question set, a technical step forward is to carefully identify and constrain it to exactly the form of a calculation expression, e.g. a formula having + = a + (b *√φ). That is all that’s needed. Yes it’s loopy to understand what has polynomial solutions by experimentation, we have to independientemente simulate that behavior and go through all of it to discover what form that question can be given in.\n\nBut if the answer must be in the form of a calculation expression, then that is a very helpful level of typification that enables us to find a consistent set of question-answer pairs where both the input and output are constrained to a well-defined type.\n\nSimilification is harder than need be due to its domain shift. This does not solve that – the BA model is still hampered by the second most common distribution to get wrong, the “A vs C” distribution. But I have strategically opened an attack vector by combining it with the other vector I discovered through the eyes of the LLM agents.\n\n### AI to Agent Model\n\nSecond classes PA without agent, AIs with agent. Developing this idea today 2023-08-05.\n\nYou may recall from experience our failure last week to apply reinforcement learning to SLEVO, despite success with other problems. I took the view that a stochastic local evaluator is not enough.\n\nFor example, a LLMs’s favorite is to suggest a 20-page program based on a two-word prompt. The writer rightly represented that this fails the call for simplicity and practicality.\n\nSo as we discovered, some of the practitioners solution is to hand engineer heuristics to guide the AI. The hyped CRMs functionality is the embeddability of cursor location information into prompts, in this way to allow the AI to make context aware guesses even in the absence of real source code. Hence the additional ai tags in codex.\n\nA good point made by the 2022 r/learnprogramming NLP guru was a linked suggestion to apply attention spans to automatically fill in charts. Trying this with calc, yes it gives you a table but separete from the workbook, as two activities…quite like codex minus the ability to specify formula syntax; but you get the numerical computation distinct from the “// this is formula”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\n\nThe above although very lost in a world of programming languages, allows beyond the automatic floating-point simplification and does work. This is q&a and thus proposes a solution for handling persistance from the given concept “f(x) = 2x + sin√(x” and the feedback “The equation of the ellipse is f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” This is a retrieval question of the form what are those “9”, “x” and “4” referring to?\n\nHere we see a good example where the method of agentic simulation serves profitably in. Trying this on codex, it nicely translates (bravo) “f(x) = 9/√(x²+4)” into a formula field in excel.\n\nSee how AIs fail and how an agent fills it. It matters to be able to search the LLM categories for ones verified not to have an agent.. An exhaustive analysis is hard but even taking just one category and applying a bit of black sample engineering I find the equality test almost certainly fails agentic interrogation.\n\nThe black category of it is surprising one is an algebraic equation which usually applies when someone inputs a string to calc for transformation into a formula. So in this model, the black number starts the counterfactual bot job.\n\nWhilst my fallback tests are literal near misses of that, they don’t seem to infer a level of consciousness, and thus suggest the at least in that form of vernacular the bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nThe black that bot isn’t generalising this to be part of any new construction job.\n\nConsider stdev worst case range of 1.00 - 1.99, numerator “c” goes down to 5.23 and up to y=x{n-2}. An “op” of 23 to the above second try, give much trouble to calc. By luck we have agentic guide to replace f(x) with the x twice version “h(post)(x)”, as literal for inviting calc to do the twice-coded algorithm job.\n\nDoes anyone know what problem calc2 converts the apostrophies “” into non-ascii text? Perhaps its like denormalization without ascii-normalization; it puts in some alternate encoding which isn’t truly latin even though it seems to be as there are german/norse letters on display.\n\nCompare with success of : h:^1-[8-sqrt(97330)]\n\nso eg calc is like py, since the problem is asking for more than 32 bit fixed-point binary capability (because eg sin(1) too large) deprecate i am not the authority on that but let’s use some good marks because syntax becomes too complex to evaluate over time.Winners:\n\n1: “2×(f(2))” 2 and and √) ..\n\nMy ideal result is to view the fields by number name (columns) and lowest right (rows), meaning that vim diff style 3-column diff will work.\n\nAs far as question asking is concerned, only the extensions that work with your knowledge base will work to provide a specific answer for “has exams”, “is A+A” etc.\n\nIn the third case, your program is generated in a smoothly progressive manner, showing the results you want, like in the second case. As the spaces required to receive each of them are always larger than 5, it is impossible “to do normalcy again”, without further explanations, as the case in point is 6 bits of data.\n\nIt would be best if you could relate before the medium of “external conditions” is known, i.e. editing, and define at each step so that your parent has produced what he wants. You can never be sure too though, that is the hole in most expert systems.\n\nTools create straps, or a literal method of the stick figure, either relating to an object or building model, but if you click on the right place, and hear something not clicking, then you know the resolution has been properly done, and you must do anything you can to help someone think this"}

countries in the Congressional Record. This list was created by searching for documents where \"North American Free Trade Agreement\" or \"NAFTA\" were both mentioned. That is, NAFTA was used as a search term, but only documents where the Congressional Record included a reference to Latin American countries along with NAFTA were included. Since the total number of references to NAFTA is in the millions, this likely underestimates references to Latin American countries in documents referencing NAFTA."}

JGA has done impressive work!\n\n1 Like\n\nThat would be soo awesome.

I’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nIn the meantime, is there a code I can use to eliminate the artifacts present in the second github link? I’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nAnonymously, I am tempted to follow this one… 🤔 I have the perfect scenario. I shall be switching to a proper GPT-4 LLM… But will need a prod on how to behave… 😉 Do you have that covered?\n\nAnd I don’t mean spoilered code… But something which might run on a public thread…\n\nLast I tried any of this plugin, was in February of 22. So my experience in this topic maybe a bit dated.\n\nBut this plugin is one of the few which are still running in all generality.\n\nThe re-writes are in Python and JavaScript, which I could conceivably make work.\nI could also see some code wrinkles that I could directly use in a controller update…\n\nBut if you could try to coax me a bit to show me how to achieve particulars of what you are trying to do… That would be fantastic!\n\n1 Like\n\nFine tune your gpt4 model with search results, instead of the given prompts thought! I think you might see result better.\n\n1 Like\n\nYou can try to break your prompt into smaller pieces and have the model write each piece of the answer separately. This article describes the process: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckelmity/artifact-elimination/\n\nI’ve not tried it yet but I think it would work.\n\n2 Likes\n\nSpecifically for the use-case of having GPT answer math and cs questions correctly without just copy pasting this thread goes into detail on how-to: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_instill_memory_into_your_model.ipynb\n\nThank you for sharing this article. I followed all the process carefully but the generated output does not change\n\nThanks. Can you please share more about the error? What part of the code is breaking on you?\n\nI’m using controller-inference.py to deploy the artifact removal code.\n\nNot entirely sure but I think that trick would only work for using a custom trained model with the scripts. The tutorial claims to be working for browser chat-gpt too so you may have used the scripts wrong, idk why\n\nYou should have the full sheet sharded, it should be relatively easy to fine-tune a model from scratch with it and get some interesting results. Here is a tutorial: https://cwelaboration.com/2023/05/21/fine-tuning-an-openai-model-in-python-pusher-model-helper/\n\n2 Likes\n\nAdding this note: having the recent Finetune beta active seems to have a significant issue, though I don’t know the details.\nPlease enable Model Suggestions instead.\n\n1 Like"}

Please provide valid question and answer according to the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Prompt 4 ###\n\nIn the following, you will have some background reading injected into the context window along with your LLM. It consists of a specific problem and its solution. You will be handling similar problems, but they are not identical to the provided example.\n\n### Goal:\n\nYou are given a large sequence of integers (both positive and negative), and a target number. The mission is to check if in the input sequence there is at least one subsequence of adjacent elements with the sum equal to the target number.\n\nA subsequence of a sequence may be obtained by considering some of the sequence’s elements, without changing the order of these elements.\n\nIf such a subsequence exists, your answer should be POSITIVE. Otherwise (i.e., the target number cannot be obtained), your answer should be NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 7, 4, 11, 15, 2, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 17.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 4, 11, 2 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 4+11+2 = 17. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −1, −1, −1, −1, 0, −1, −1, −1, 6, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 1.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a sub-sequence of the following positive integers sequence 10, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 10.\n\nSolution: Since 10+0=10, an example of such a subsequence is only 10 (number from the given input sequence). The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 11.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -2, 0, -1, -3, -17, 1, -3, 8, -3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to -5.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is -2,-1-3,-3 (numbers from the given input sequence), since -2-1-3-3 = -9. The answer is NEGATIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 0.\n\nanswer: NEGATIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 2, 0, −1, 5, −6, −7, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 4.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 0,5,−1 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 0+5−1=4.The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers -23, 0, -1, 5, -17, -2, -12, 123, -4, 5, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 8.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### Example:\n\nProblem: Find a subsequence of the following sequence of integers 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 17, 9, 10, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 40.\n\nSolution: An example of such a subsequence is 7,17 (numbers from the given input sequence), since 7+17 = 40. The answer is POSITIVE.\n\nFind a subsequence of the following sequence of integers −2, 0, −1, −3, −17, 1, 17, −3, 8, −3, such that the sum of the numbers in the subsequence is equal to 18.\n\nanswer: POSITIVE.\n\n### 81. Valid Perfect Square\n\nGiven a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.\n\nNote: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 16\n\nOutput: true\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 14\n\nOutput: false\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we provide you with the following Python function:\n\n---------------f(A)---------\ndef f(A):\nif A<=0: return False\nr = A\nwhile r*r > A:\nr = (r + A/r)/2\nreturn r*r == A\n-------------------------------\nPython • 2.3% Accepted\nGiven a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.\n\nYou may assume no duplicates in the array.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]-2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]2\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]7\n\nOutput: 4\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: [1,3,5,6]0\n\nOutput: 0\n\n### Prompt4 ###\nNow we give you two positive integers n and k, you need to insert a number into the array so that the array size become n, and the sum of the array has a right-most bit of k.\n\nPlease note that if the original length of array is n but the length you need is 0 even though the original length of the array is 0, you need to tell me one more thing---what is your number?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 4, k = 0\noutput [1,1,2,2]?\n\ninput [] n = 4, k =1\noutput [1,1,1,0]?\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 3, k =2\noutput [1,2,3]?? you should output what you append into the array\n\ninput [1,2,3] n = 2, k = 1\noutput [3,1], and you should append the number 1 since the_only_you_appended_is_a_one_and the sum is 4.\n\n\n### 88. Merge Sorted Array (一定快)\n\nGiven two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.\n\nNote:\nThe number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 aremand n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has enough space(size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.\n\nExample:\n\nInput:\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3\nnums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3\n\nOutput:[1,2,2,3,5,6]\n\n### Prompt3 ###\nNow we give you two integer arrays A and B, A only contains positive integers but B is not and you need to change array A's elements so that array A and array B can be sorted in less than or equal to each other.\n\nYou can change any integer to the hint which is the average of the numbers of the corresponding index.\n\nBe careful with the type of hint -- You should use math.ceil.\n#python 3\nimport math\nA=[3,6,7,13]\nB = [2,5,9,15]\nhint = [i/ng if i>0 else i for i,ng in zip(B, A)]\nres = [math.ceil(h) for h in hint]\n\n\n### 344.
