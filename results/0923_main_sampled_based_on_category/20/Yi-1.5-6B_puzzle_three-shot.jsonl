Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\""}
