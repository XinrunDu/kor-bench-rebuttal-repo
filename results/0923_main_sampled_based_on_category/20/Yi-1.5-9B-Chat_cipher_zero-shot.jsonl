If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Since spaces are not considered in the encryption process, they will not be considered in the decryption process either. Therefore, we take the first 5 characters as our block: \"P R S A S\" (we are assuming \"A\" as a placeholder for the space position in the original block).\n\n2. **Determine the grid used for the current block:**\n   - Calculate grid_index = (i // 5 ) % 8, where i is the block number. In our case, i = 0 (since we are considering the first block), so grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0.\n   - This means we use Grid0 for decryption.\n\n3. **For each character in the block:**\n   - For \"P\": Since \"P\" is not \"J\", we find its position in Grid0 and move one grid position to the upper left. In Grid0, \"P\" is at row 1, column 5, moving one position to the upper left gives us row 0, column 4, which corresponds to \"H\".\n   - For \"R\": Since \"R\" is not \"J\", we find its position in Grid0 and move one grid position to the upper left. In Grid0, \"R\" is at row 4, column 3, moving one position to the upper left gives us row 3, column 2, which corresponds to \"L\".\n\n4. **After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.**\n   - The decrypted block is \"H L\", which is the plaintext corresponding to the given ciphertext \"PR\" when using the specified cipher.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is \"HL\".\n\nEncapsulated in double square brackets, the answer is: [[HL]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"MEBE\" using the specified rules, we need to reverse the encryption process as follows:\n\n1. Break the ciphertext into pairs of letters: \"ME\", \"B\", \"E\"\n2. Identify the corresponding row header for the first letter of each pair.\n3. Identify the corresponding column bottom for the second letter of each pair.\n4. Find the letter at the intersection of the identified row and column to get the decrypted plaintext.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n1. **Pair 1: ME**\n   - Row header for M is K (M is in the 1st row)\n   - Column bottom for E is H (E is in the 4th column)\n   - Intersection of Row K and Column H is \"G\"\n\n2. **Pair 2: B**\n   - Since \"B\" is the row header for the 0th row, we don't need to find a column bottom for this letter.\n   - The letter in the 0th row and any column is \"M\". However, the grid row headers indicate that \"B\" is for the 0th row, and \"M\" is actually the first row's letter after \"B\". We made an error in interpreting \"B\" as a header for a different row. The correct interpretation follows the sequence of the grid row headers: \"MKGWB\". Thus, \"B\" points to the 4th row.\n   - The letter in the 4th row (as pointed by \"B\") and any column is \"H\" (as confirmed by the grid row headers and bottom column letters: \"BTEHI\").\n\n3. **Pair 3: E**\n   - Column bottom for E is H (E is in the 4th column)\n   - Intersection of any row and Column H is \"G\". However, since we're looking for the column bottom for \"E\" specifically, we align this with the correct interpretation of \"B\" as the header for the entire 4th row, not just the initial \"B\". Thus, \"E\" points directly to the 4th row, and \"E\" itself is found at the intersection of the 4th row and its column bottom letter, which is also \"E\" according to the grid column bottoms \"IEEEE\".\n\n**Correcting the Interpretation Errors:**\n- The key misunderstanding in the initial breakdown is the correct interpretation of \"B\" as the header for the 4th row across all its occurrences, not just the initial \"B\" in the sequence. This was误interpret as a separate header for a different row.\n\n**Corrected Decryption:**\n- Pair 1: ME -> M is row header for 0th row, E is in 2nd column (not directly used as a column bottom for current letter pairing explanation clarity), but focusing on the grid's integrity, M corresponds to the first row, and E to the fourth column, so the intersection is \"R\". However, the direct application of the steps as described led to errors due to misinterpretation of \"B\".\n- Pair 2: B -> B is the row header for the 4th row, so it directly points to the letters in the 4th row, and since the question was about correctness in following steps initially, the correct direct mapping based on the grid's row headers and bottom column letters is \"H\".\n- Pair 3: E -> E is in the 4th column, and since the question's sequence error was in interpretation, directly focusing on the grid's integrity, E corresponds to the intersection of the 4th row and its bottom column letter, which is \"T\".\n\n**Corrected Decrypted Plaintext:** \"RHT\"\n\nGiven the initial error in interpretation and the need to correct the process according to the rules accurately, the answer, despite initial application errors, based on the corrected steps and adherence to the rules, is:\n\n**[[RHT]]**"}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"GZHYAWHHUASPLMPWMAUMSRHANOSXPWDBRIN\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
