If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[WHAT HELL OF ENCODING]]\n\nPlease provide the answer based on the given cipher rules and the specified plaintext or ciphertext. The cipher algorithm is as follows:\n\n\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds:\n\n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n\n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            # F #\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n\n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n\n- Encryption Rules:\n    1. Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    2. Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).\n    4. For each binary group `(X, Y)` do the following:\n        1. Determine the row and column numbers  of `X` in `grid1` as `(x_row, x_col)`.\n        2. Determine the row and column numbers of `Y` in `grid2` as `(y_row, y_col)`.\n        3. Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `x_row` and `y_col`.\n        4. Output the triple `(x_col, num3, y_row)` of the three numbers.\n          - For example, for the binary `(C,E)`, the row and column numbers in `grid1` are (2,2), the row and column numbers in `grid2` are (0,4), so the encoded triple would be `(2,3,5)`.\n    5. After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example: `(2,3,5)(1,1,3)(8,8,3)` produce the final encrypted message `235113883`.\n    \n**Decryption Rules:**\n    \n    1. Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    2. For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        1. Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of `X_row` is equal to the row number;\n        2. Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of `Y_col` equal to that column number;\n        3. The value of `X_col` is equal to `x`, the value of `Y_row` is equal to `z`.\n        4. Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined `(X_row,X_col)`.\n        5. Based on the determined `(Y_row,Y_col)`, find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        6. p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        7. For example, for the ternary `(2,3,5)`, in Gird3 the row number corresponding to 3 is 0, so `X_row` = 0, in Gird3 the column number corresponding to 3 is 3, so `Y_col`=3. `X_col`=2, `Y_row`=5. According to (0,2) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter C, and according to (5,3) in Gird2 we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter E in Gird2 according to (5,3), so the final decryption is CE because the input was \"C and E\".\n    3. String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plain text.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nschemameta = {\n    '0': 'Encryption Rules',\n    '1': 'Input:',\n        '1.0': 'Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.1': 'Output:',\n        '1.1.0': 'Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.',\n        '1.2': 'Preparation:',\n        '1.2.0': '3 Girds:',\n            '_purpose': [\n                'Grid 1 (3x9):',\n                'Grid 2 (9x3):',\n                'Grid 3 (3x3):'],\n\n        '1.2.1': 'Encryption Steps:',\n        '1.2.1.0': 'Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.',\n        '1.2.1.1': 'Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with #.',\n        '1.2.1.2': 'Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups (with every two letters being separated by a space before conversion).',\n        '1.2.1.3': 'For each binary group (L1, L2) do the following:',\n        '1.2.1.3.0': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L1 in grid1 as (l1_row, l1_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.1': 'Determine the row and column numbers of L2 in grid2 as (l2_row, l2_col).',\n        '1.2.1.3.2': 'Find the corresponding number num3 on grid3 from l1_row and l2_col.',\n        '1.2.1.3.3': 'Output the triad (l1_col, num3, l2_row) of three numbers.',\n            '1.2.1.3.3.placeholder': [\n                'For example, for the binary (T,H) the row and column numbers of T in grid1 are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in grid2 are (5,0).',\n                'Based on l1_row (0) and l2_col(0) , the corresponding number num3 found in grid3 is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).'],\n        '1.2.1.4': 'After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
