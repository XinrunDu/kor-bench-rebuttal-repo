For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M).

If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Your question involves a disjunctive normal form, which is where you need to find all possible combinations of the variables or negations of variables for the formula to be true. \n\nFirst, let's identify the variables and their negations in the given formula:\n- $$\\neg p$$\n- $$\\neg q$$\n- $$\\neg r$$\n- $$p$$\n- $$q$$\n- $$r$$\n\nNow, we need to create all possible combinations by pairing each variable with its negation and arrange them in ascending order of subscripts. So, we have:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p$$\n- $$q \\land \\neg q$$\n- $$r \\land \\neg r$$\n\nNow, we translate these paired conjunctions into binary numbers:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p$$ corresponds to $$10$$ in binary\n- $$q \\land \\neg q$$ corresponds to $$11$$ in binary\n- $$r \\land \\neg r$$ corresponds to $$111$$ in binary\n\nConverting these binary numbers to hexadecimal, we get:\n- $$p \\land \\neg p = mB$$\n- $$q \\land \\neg q = mF$$\n- $$r \\land \\neg r = MF$$\n\nTherefore, the given formula can be denoted as $$(mB \\lor mF \\lor MF)$$. This conforms to the **principal conjunctive normal form** as it includes all possible paired conjunctions.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n[[A]; [(mB \u2228 mF \u2228 MF)]]"}

So, 'x' becomes 0 in the formula. \n\nThe function symbols 'f' and 'g' are replaced with their implementations in J: fJ(x,x) becomes fJ(0,0) and likewise, gJ(x,x) becomes gJ(0,0). \n\nThe predicate symbols FJ(x, y) represent equality in J, so it is replaced with its assigned relation in J: FJ(x, y) becomes equality. \n\nThus, the implemented formula becomes [\u22030(fJ(0, 0), gJ(0, 0))]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [\u22030(fJ(0, 0), gJ(0, 0))]"}

That the proposition is true.\nB. That the proposition is false.\nC. That he might also harbor doubts about the proposition.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the provided cognitive logic model and the Spread of Doubt axiom, we can reason as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[C]]\n\nExplanation: According to the Spread of Doubt axiom, if Alice doubts a proposition and has an accessibility relation with Bob, it is likely that Bob will start to doubt the proposition as well. The spread of doubt implies that Alice's doubt influences Bob's belief, creating a chain reaction of doubt among individuals who are accessible to each other. \n\nTherefore, based on the Cognitive Logic Axioms, specifically the Axioms of Doubt, Bob is likely to be convinced of harboring doubts about the proposition, rather than believing or denying it outright."}

GB Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n- If hypothesis q_1 is assumed, then p.\n- If hypothesis q_2 is assumed, then p.\n- Since q_1 and q_2 are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, it is not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- p\n- q_1 \u2192 p\n- q_2 \u2192 p\n- q_1 \u2227 q_2 \u2192 \u22a5\n\n2. BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)\u2227B(a) confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)) is equivalent to \u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b) also confirms \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- R(a)\u2227B(a)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n- \u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\u2261\u2200x(\u00acB(x)\u2192\u00acR(x))\n- \u00acB(b)\u2227\u00acR(b)\u2192\u2200x(R(x)\u2192B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nSuppose we have the following plausible hypothesis:\n\n- r_1: All apples are fruits\n- r_2: All fruits are rich in vitamins\n- r_3: Apples contain vitamin C\n\nIf we find a hypothesis r_4 that contradicts r_3, we need to:\n\nA.
