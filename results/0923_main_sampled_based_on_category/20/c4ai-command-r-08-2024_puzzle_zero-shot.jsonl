Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the rule is applied: \n\n1. Analyze the formula provided: NUMBER + NUMBER = PUZZLE. There are three unique letter groups in the formula, each representing a unique number. \n\n2. Assign each letter group a number based on the rule that different letters cannot represent the same number. For simplification, let's use the lowest possible numbers first: \n - NUMBER: Representing one or two-digit number(s), we ensure the first letter is not 0. A simple assignment could be [N=1, U=2, M=3, B=4, R=5]\n - =: Since this letter group represents an operation, it cannot be a number. \n\n3. Handle the next letter group based on the sum of the previous ones: \n - PUZZLE: To calculate the number represented, we sum the numbers from 'NUMBER', considering the addition operation. In this case, the sum is 3+4+5+1+2 = 15. So, we assign [P=5, U=3, Z=4, Z=1, L=5]. \n\n4. Verify the answer by ensuring it aligns with the provided formula: \n - NUMBER + NUMBER = PUZZLE\n - 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 15\n - 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 4+ 1 = 15\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n[[N=1, U=2, M=3, B=4, R=5, P=5, U=3, Z=4, L=5]]"}

An island can be identified by noting the \"2\" appearing twice in the same row and the \"1\" appearing twice in the same column. Since there are no numbers sharing the same cell, the islands formed are disconnected from each other. Following the rules for forming islands, 1 X 1 X X X X X X 2, X X X X 4 X X X X X and X 1 X X X X X 3 X X would make some islands. \n\nFollowing the rules, a proper boundary can be drawn between the islands. This involves identifying the islands and the numbers equal to the number of cells each island has. The walls, represented by 'A' are placed accordingly between the islands, thus partitioning the areas with numbers. Since there are no shared numbers, and the hint numbers are distinct, the drawing of the wall is clear and unambiguous. The output matrix clearly shows the result of the operation, where the walls separate the islands as per the rules. \n\nThis solution ensures that the 2x2 or larger rectangle rule is not violated and that there is no contradiction that would hinder the player's movement. Each island is isolated from each other by the proper orientation of walls making the valid puzzle matrix. Therefore when the instruction \"with X being the blank island and A being the wall\" is considered, this is the proper arrangement that satisfies all the rules and completes the given puzzle. The elements arranged from left to right and top to bottom are presented clearly with each row separated by a comma."}

Understand the puzzle rules:\n   - The grid is divided into several partitions or zones, labeled with different letters (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).\n   - Each partition must have one star.\n   - Stars cannot be adjacent, including diagonally.\n   - The goal is to place stars on the grid according to the rules and provide their coordinates.\n\n2. Analyse the given grid:\n   - Region A:\n     - There are six partitions labeled with 'A'.\n     - To have one star in each partition and ensure no adjacent stars, we can place them in the following positions: (1,1), (3,3), (5,5).\n     - An alternative valid configuration is: (1,1), (3,5), (5,3).\n\n   - Region B:\n     - There are four partitions labeled with 'B'.\n     - Placing the stars in the corners ensures they are not adjacent: (1,3), (2,8).\n\n   - Region C:\n     - There are four partitions labeled with 'C'.\n     - Recognize the pattern of their distribution: (3,7), (4,9).\n\n   - Region D:\n     - There are four partitions labeled with 'D'.\n     - Place them directly next to regions B and C without overlapping to avoid adjacency: (1,8), (2,10).\n     - Another valid configuration is (1,8), (4,10).\n\n   - Region E, F, G, H:\n     - These regions are unique in that they have a single partition each.\n     - Place the stars at the center of the partition to avoid adjacency: (6,5), (7,5), (8,4), (9,7).\n\n**Answer:**\nAfter considering all the rules and options for each region, the final coordinates of the stars are as follows:\n\n[[A:(1,1)(3,3)(5,5)\nB:(1,3)(2,8)\nC:(3,7)(4,9)\nD:(1,8)(2,10)\nE:(6,5)\nF:(7,5)\nG:(8,4)\nH:(9,7)]]\n\nThis answer represents the desired format, with all regions listed in alphabetical order and the coordinates within each region ordered from smallest to largest rows and then columns."}
