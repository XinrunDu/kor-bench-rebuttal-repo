If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up.
