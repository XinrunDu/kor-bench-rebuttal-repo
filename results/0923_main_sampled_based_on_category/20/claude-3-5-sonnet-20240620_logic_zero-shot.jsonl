Then bruise it. \nThe result was that the wound healed much faster in the normal millets than in those whose salivary glands had been removed.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and compare it with the five methods for exploring causal relationships:\n\n1. The experiment divides animals into two groups:\n   - Group 1: Animals with salivary glands removed\n   - Group 2: Normal animals with intact salivary glands\n\n2. All other conditions are kept the same for both groups, except for the presence or absence of salivary glands.\n\n3. Both groups are subjected to bruising.\n\n4. The result shows that wounds heal faster in the normal group (with salivary glands) compared to the group without salivary glands.\n\nThis experimental setup and result most closely match the Method \u0606:\n\n- If P (faster wound healing) occurs when S (presence of salivary glands) is present and does not occur when S is absent:\n    - (1) S (salivary glands present) A B     P (faster wound healing)\n    - (2) - (salivary glands absent) A B     - (slower wound healing)\n\nThe experiment demonstrates that when salivary glands are present, faster wound healing occurs, and when salivary glands are absent, faster wound healing does not occur. This suggests a causal relationship between the presence of salivary glands and faster wound healing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

The formula used in the sentence (\u2192\u270a) directly matches the formula for Commissives as specified in the logic rules.\n\n2. The verb \"promise\" is explicitly listed as one of the common verbs for Commissives.\n\n3.

By eliminating the timetables and trajectories of different students, the possible suspect can be identified.\"\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given scenario and compare it with the defined argumentation methods:\n\n1. The scenario involves identifying a suspect by eliminating other possibilities.\n2. It doesn't use specific instances, universal propositions, metaphors, or case-by-case analysis.\n3. It's not refuting a contrary proposition.\n4. The method described aligns with the Elim- Method, which involves \"indirectly determining the original proposition to be true by eliminating other possibilities related to the original proposition as false.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n[[F]]\n\nThis scenario uses the Elim- Method because it involves narrowing down the suspect by eliminating the timetables and trajectories of different students, effectively ruling out other possibilities to indirectly identify the likely culprit."}
