We have a 4x4 grid, so we'll be using numbers 1 to 4.\n\n2. We know that 2 is in the 3rd row, 3rd column.\n\n3. Looking at the inequality constraints:\n   - (1,3) < (1,4): The number in row 1, column 3 is less than the one in row 1, column 4\n   - (1,4) < (2,4): The number in row 1, column 4 is less than the one in row 2, column 4\n   - (2,4) < (3,4): The number in row 2, column 4 is less than the one in row 3, column 4\n   - (2,1) < (2,2): The number in row 2, column 1 is less than the one in row 2, column 2\n\n4. From the last three inequalities, we can deduce that the 4th column must be in ascending order from top to bottom. The only way to do this with 2 already in the 3rd row is: 1, 2, 3, 4 in the 4th column.\n\n5. Now, the 3rd row must be: 1, 3, 2, 4 (as we need all numbers from 1 to 4, and 2 and 4 are fixed).\n\n6. In the 1st row, we know the 3rd number is less than the 4th (which is 1). So the 3rd number must be 1, and to complete the row without repetition: 3, 4, 1, 2.\n\n7. For the 2nd row, we know the 1st number is less than the 2nd. The only way to complete this row without conflicting with other rows is: 2, 3, 4, 1.\n\n8.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. We start with a 4x4 grid, so we'll use numbers 1 to 4.\n2. We have two pre-filled numbers: 2 in the top-left corner and 3 in the bottom-right corner.\n3. We need to consider the inequality constraints:\n   (1,2) > (1,3)\n   (2,2) > (2,3)\n   (3,1) < (3,2)\n\nLet's solve:\n\n1. In the first row, we know 2 is in the first position. Given (1,2) > (1,3), the second position must be 4, and the third must be 3 or 1. The fourth must be whatever is left (1 or 3).\n\n2. In the last row, we know 3 is in the last position. The other numbers must be 1, 2, and 4 in some order.\n\n3. Given (3,1) < (3,2), the first number in the third row must be smaller than the second. The only possibility that doesn't conflict with the first row is 1 2 4 3.\n\n4. Now, for the second row, we need to fill in the remaining numbers. Given (2,2) > (2,3), and considering the numbers already used in other rows, the second row must be 3 4 1 2.\n\n5. This leaves us with 4 1 3 2 for the first row, which satisfies (1,2) > (1,3).\n\nTherefore, the complete solution is:\n\n2 4 1 3\n3 4 1 2\n1 2 4 3\n4 1 2 3\n\nFormatting the answer as requested:\n\n[[2 4 1 3,3 4 1 2,1 2 4 3,4 1 2 3]]"}
