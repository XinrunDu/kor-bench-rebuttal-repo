For the first row, we can start with 1 at (1,1) (since the numbers must be from 1 to 4 without repetition in each row and column). Then, since (1,3)<(1,4), we can put 2 at (1,3) and 3 at (1,4).\n\nFor the second row, since (2,1)<(2,2), we can put 1 at (2,1) and 2 at (2,2). Then, we can put 3 at (2,3) and 4 at (2,4).\n\nFor the third row, we already have 2 at (3,3). So, we can put 1 at (3,1), 3 at (3,2), and 4 at (3,4).\n\nFor the fourth row, we can put 1 at (4,1), 2 at (4,2), 3 at (4,3), and 4 at (4,4).\n\nSo, the filled grid is:\n1 2 2 3\n1 2 3 4\n1 3 2 4\n1 2 3 4\n\nThe answer in the required format is: [[1 2 2 3,1 2 3 4,1 3 2 4,1 2 3 4]] "}

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\n2 X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X 3\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(2,2)>(2,3)\n(3,1)<(3,2)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[2 3 1 4,4 2 3 1,1 4 2 3,3 1 4 2]] "}
