Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nf□g=f'(x) \\quad +g'(x) \\quad.\n\n### Question:\nf(x)=tan(x), g(x)=x,find the value of f□g when x=π/4.\nPlease ensure the answer is a single number and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Following the provided rule, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x) and then calculate their values at x=π/4.\n\n*  f(x) = tan(x)  => f'(x) = sec²(x)\n*  g(x) = x       => g'(x) = 1\n\nNow, we evaluate f'(x) and g'(x) at x = π/4:\n\n* f'(π/4) = sec²(π/4) = (√2)² = 2\n* g'(π/4) = 1\n\nFinally, applying the operation rule:\n\nf□g = f'(π/4) + g'(π/4) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is **[[3]]**. \n"}
