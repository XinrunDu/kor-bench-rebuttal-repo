custom puzzle problem. Discuss any potential challenges or pitfalls you avoided, and provide an example of how you anticipate your answer might differ compared to an incorrectly applied rule.\n\n### My strategy for solving the problem:\nWhen solving the star game, first, find all the vertices of the region, determine the positions of the stars that will not appear in each grid, and then write the coordinates of the stars that appear in each region. When writing the coordinates, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number, and when the number of rows is equal, the row with the smallest number is positioned left of the one with the largest number. When writing down two coordinate points, the smaller number is placed to the front.\n\n\n\n### Challenges and pitfalls:\n\n### An example of incorrect application:\n\n### Answer:\n[[A:(1,1)(1,3)\nB:(1,4)(3,4)\nC:(4,2)(4,4)\nD:(7,3)(7,6)\nE:(2,3)(5,3)\nF:(5,4)(8,7)\nG:(1,7)(5,7)\nH:(7,8)(8,6)\nI:(8,1)(8,3)\nJ:(9,6)(9,8)]]"}
