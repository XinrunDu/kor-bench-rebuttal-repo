Understanding the Rule:**\n  -  The rule, `f◆D = ∫∫ f(x,y) dx dy`, represents the integral of a function *f(x, y)* over the given rectangular region *D*.\n\n**2. Defining the Region D:**\n  -  The region D is described as 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 3.  This means we need to integrate over these specific bounds for x and y.\n\n**3. Calculating the Integral:**\n  -  We plug in the function *f(x, y) = xy* and the region *D* into the integral:\n    ```\n    f◆D = ∫ from 0 to 3 ∫ from 0 to 2 xy dx dy \n    ```\n  -  Now, we integrate with respect to *x* first, treating *y* as a constant:\n    ```\n    f◆D = ∫ from 0 to 3  [ (1/2)x²y  ] from 0 to 2 dy\n    ``` \n  -  Evaluate the inner integral (from x = 0 to 2):\n    ```\n    f◆D = ∫ from 0 to 3 ( (1/2)(2)²y)-( (1/2)(0)²y) dy\n    ```\n  - Simplify:\n   ```\n    f◆D = ∫ from 0 to 3 (2y) dy\n    ``` \n\n  - Integrate with respect to *y*:\n   ```\n    f◆D = [y²] from 0 to 3\n   ```\n\n  - Evaluate the inner integral:\n   ```\n    f◆D = (3²) - (0²) = 9 \n   ```\n\n**Therefore, the answer is [9].**  "}
