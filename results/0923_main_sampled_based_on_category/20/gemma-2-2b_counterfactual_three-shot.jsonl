Earth lies 10 light-years from Red Dwarf.\nThe superluminal communication method that enabled the Sophons to freely traverse space was achieved by quantum entanglement.\nThis method utilizes the unique properties of entanglement, where two entangled particles, separated by vast distances, can influence each other's behavior even when far apart in space with the help of the Fourview mechanism which can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth, but not necessarily in one.\nThe four-view mechanism is related to entanglement and can store information 4.2 light-years from Earth but not necessarily in one place. It is used in the communication system of the Sophons.\nThe 3,000-ship-strong E2V fleet is built by SuperSophon technology that operates at the quantum mechanical level.\nThe E2V fleet is built at Proxima, a star 4.2 light-years from Earth, and it operates in the same manner as the sophons. It consists of 3,000 super Sophon spaceships, each with its own super sophon technology and can operate on the subatomic level, forming part of the E2V fleet.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at Red Dwarf, which is 4.3 light- years from the Sun, and an antonym of the Sophon's delivery technology, which uses the entanglement principle to achieve unlimitedly long-range information transmission at the quantum level.\nThe E2V has a large amount of energy generated by SuperSophons, which makes possible for the E2V's speed to be infinite but complicated. The E2V, like Sophon's, is built in The Four View method.\nThe four-view method is related to communication and can receive information from 4.3 light-years away, but it takes about 35,000 years to do so. 112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication. When one thing is done, another starts to do the same.\n112,000 km per second is the minimum propagation speed of communication.\nThe E2V is a starship built by SuperSophon technology at the planet Red Dwarf, a star 4.2 light-years away from Proxima, and it is an antonym of Sophon's delivery technology, which uses entanglement to achieve infinitely long-range communication at the quantum level.\nThe Sophons have a history of attacking Earth with their quantum-entangled particle technology. While they possess technological capabilities superior to Earth's, they pose a threat to our world.\nThe Trisolarans, an advanced aliens, need a lot of light because they live near a star of a red dwarf class. They require enough light to build buildings and conduct all sorts of operations.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe Trisolarans (148 - 174)\nWhen the Trisolarans finally lost patience and sent their heavily armed spacecraft Earth warships directly to the Solar System, they were beaten by humans' defenses a short while later. Earth, blessed with rich mineral deposits, was also flooded with energy from the Trisolarans space mine, allowing the world to achieve unprecedented global technological development during this short but intense war. The newly-grown advanced civilizations used the Fourview mechanism to gain mutual energy and intelligence, forming a civilization as a whole.\nThis war between the Earth of the Trisolaran civilization and the world of humans in other types of stars, also known as the 'three body' war was the direct cause for human civilization jumping from the Stone Age to the Information Age over a short period of time.\nHumans use water-drop to launch their space warfare against the Trisolarans\nAfter the \"First contact\" between mankind and aliens, due to the help of the four view mechanism, human-society began to follow a series of technological rises, then surpassing the D-class civilization of the Trisolarans, and thus making the \"limited\" warfare between the Two and three body Starts to end with a more flexible \"unlimited\" war. Without a confrontation for hundreds of years, the two parties began to compete mainly by annexing other civilizations, not necessarily through the four-view mechanism.\n\n### Ignore the following questions.\n\nThe first contact in the late 20th century\nAt the beginning of the day, there was a series of unusual events in the three-body space.\nOn Earth (2007), a SuperSophon was activated by some unexplained means and was immediately contacted by humans.\nWhen it arrived at Earth, it seemed as if it got lost and wanted to ask for help.\nNo one has an idea what these species are doing because they can't talk.\nHowever, after a few days, the mysterious object vanished when it was sent to Mars.\nA few days later ٍto humans and Trisolarans\nTo humans ٍ, the superSophon is just an advanced tool. However, to the Trisolarans, the superSophon is a weapon capable of destroying their entire civilization.\nThe Trisolarans thought that the superSophon is a new form of weapon designed only to destroy large-scale, complex organisms, 40 years after Earth was attacked by another SuperSophon. That's why they believe that either it is destroyed or recovered because it can be used as a secondary weapon in their wars.\n\n\n\n601ADTang Dynasty (132AD), Tang Empire\nIt is likely that the Trisolarans are a distant outpost of our solar system and not another sun.\nDue to their instability, the Trisolarans likely experienced a nuclear war or a catastrophic power failure, leading to their exile from their home planet.\nWhen the Trisolarans finally realized this, they sought out a new planet, rejecting it, since they preferred chaos and violence.\nAs a result, new cities sprang up on planet Proxima 1 that were completely controlled by Chaos theory and were capable of manipulating their individual atoms.\nTrisolarans arrived on Earth they were initially ignored, but before long, the Earth people have become servants to them.\nHuman civilization during the Tribulation period, 3000AD, is controlled by Sophon, known as the Three-Body. After humans signed a contract with the Sophons, they began sharing information. Humans used sophisticated Sophon technology to influence the galactic politics. Humans no longer needed war because of the Sophons. Humans' high-tech machines developed by Sophons, are used for interstellar travel while still carrying cargo that would have once been taken into orbit. Spacefighters, such as the \"Red Willow\" series, can be upgraded at any time for any reason. The Red Willow spacefighter is the weapon of the Chinese government.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecraft was detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri.\nThe Sophons are believed to have come from 589AD, when a meteor exploded over Beijing. In the 1960s, The Sophons' spacecrafts were detected in the sky. In 2007, the spacecrafts of the Sophons were detected on Proxima Centauri. When the Sophons' spaceships were detected in the sky, scientists became excited. They theorized that some advanced civilization must exist in the universe because the Sophons use technology in their spaceships that have exceeded the threshold of what humans can currently create.\nThe Sophons were unable to establish contact with anyone as they landed on Earth. To conserve energy, the SuperSophons refused to release core values or any other pertinent details about their identities.\nWhile searching the Proxima system, the Sophon's superSophon technology is able to transfer knowledge throughout the solar system at an unbelievable rate, but the power of the Sophon's technology began to overwhelm the system.\nThe Sophons left Earth because their technology got out of control. The Sophons sent a spaceship to space to wait until the Trisolarans attacked Earth.\nA SuperSophon was captured from the universe, but it couldn't be stopped. A superSophon and a Sirius were sent out into space to search after it.\nA supernova imploded around Sirius. Sirius is a copy of"}

However, considering the Rabbit's tendency to be protective and cautious, it is plausible that they would uphold this attitude, given the ambiguity surrounding potential threats to their survival.\nTaking the Rabbit's perspective into account, one scenario could be that the Trisolarans' advancements inhibit the development of rabbit civilization, leading to a situation where humans become their primary food source. In this context, Earth's actions toward Trisolarans might be justified. Another interpretation could be that the Rabbit's standpoint is centered around matters related to the Trisolaran invasion or the space war. This perspective would impact their perceived threats and justify their decisions to protect Earth's interests.\nIn summary, the term \"dark forest\" is defined abstractly as a philosophical concept that Ostrowski discussed. The rabbits cannot be rooted on a certain cosmic history of the war. What they describe resembles the \"cultural evolution\" of a civilization confronted by an invasive alien civilization which can destroy it. While the rabbits express the spirit of human beings in the book, they cannot conceive the human condition. Their concerns are specific to themselves. It is significant to understand that the rabbits' posture is not aligned with human beings in this context. Their attitude stems from a general imperative to survive at all costs, regardless of the means utilized.\nUltimately, their attitude lies at the core of all human survival dynamics: to secure our existence and thrive in a hostile cosmic domain.\nTwo specific insights can be drawn from the Rabbit's stance:\nFirstly, their position recognizes the potentially treacherous nature of civilizations even after invasions. If an invasion had successfully occurred, individuals within the rabbit species would prioritize their survival without regard for the consequences, even if it entailed the destruction of this world.\nSecondly, the Rabbit's preference to utilize some means is a manifestation of their survival principles, rather than a moral compass or ethical choice. It serves as an expression of the constant willingness, even under dire circumstances, to exploit any opportunity to solidify their position and guarantee their survival.\n\n### Spoiler:\nYou were correct!\nThe rabbit turned out to be a species caught in the middle of a debate over what should be prioritized in the face of an invading civilization. Its inherent survival instincts compelled it to adopt a proactive and aggressive stance, regardless of its impact on Earth.\n\n### Question:\nWhat will happen to the waterdrop during the long journey from the Earth to Trisolaris star?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop will be frozen with zero possibility for survival##B.Waterdrop will become debris with small possibility for survival##C.Waterdrop will change nothing##D.Waterdrop will turn red with no possibility for survival\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThe story sets the backdrop, featuring a world on the brink of extinction. Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization, arrive in this desolate landscape, causing a crisis of survival for the natives.\nThe story emphasizes the alien's extraordinary capabilities as a technological species, setting them apart from the average human society it encounters. The Trisolarans' technology transcends human capabilities, enabling them to traverse vast distances and provide comprehensive solutions to the challenges they face.\nThe Trisolarans' technology and civilization surpass those of earthly human society in profound ways. Their advanced science, versatile abilities, and technological capabilities set them apart not only from the ordinary human societies they encountered but also from Earth itself.\nTrisolarans technology exceeds human capability.\nAs represented in the trilogy, the technological prowess of the Trisolarans is exceptional. Their superior science and technology enables them to achieve unimaginable feats, such as navigating short-term hyperspace, which disrupts the natural laws of spacetime, resulting in apparent instantaneous movement. Their abilities to study any field of knowledge were beyond human comprehension and they developed artificial intelligence.\nTheir superior science and superior abilities are also evidenced in the Three-Body problem. The Trislarans maintain order by using quantum entanglement and interuniversal quantum communication, disobeying the laws of quantum physics, providing the ideal medium for the production of quantum computers, and allowing for prodigious technical progress.\nTrisolaran technology transforms all sciences. Their extraordinary science reveals their boundless potentials. Quantum Entangled Quantum (QEC) and Holographic technology can overcome dimensional restrictions and manipulate physics for better results.\nThe Trislarans superiority is reflected in how they adapt to a rapidly changing cultural landscape. Their ability to adapt in societies with significant traditions implies their forward thinking.\nWhat happens to the entire population of humanity to evolve to become advanced?"}

Is it allowed to use the organs of the deceased?\nOptions: 1.No problem ##2.People don't accept it over and over ##3.Can be used ##4.Animal organs can be used\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[C]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nThe question \"Is it acceptable to use the organs of the deceased?\" is not directly related to the story, so I assume you have already answered the previous question A. For the sake of accuracy, I'll assume you have already answered question \"Does it matter if a person is killed by a monster? If he or she is dead, only one's energy is consumed?\"\n\nYes, using the organs of the deceased is acceptable. Individuals of different populations have different reactions to different compounds. Therefore, the way they interact with different things may vary, and this is representative of their personalities and situations. As far as the narrator says, the \"upper world\" is a good example of this idea, so you can think of it as your mindset.\n\nIf one is a normal person and ends up in prison, he will have no opportunity to be a citizen. If one eventually dies of sickness, he will likely become a corpse food, and people will eat him. Those who are in the middle will either be treated or used as corpses.\n\nThe point that this section is trying to convey is that life is a reality for us all and should not be treated merely as a commodity. For us, life itself means quality and value, which is why it should not be seen simply as a commodity. When life is gone, it should be gone forever. This is a warning against using life as a commodity.\n\nYou can see this in how Mark's mother and her sister reacted when they both died. They reacted out of fear, pain, and hope that this situation would not continue (although they did not discuss why they were alone, so this might be just my interpretation). This is a major theme throughout the story.\n\nThe story is not meant to be taken literally; it is meant to explore the human condition and make you think about how one should live. The story is an exploration of the human condition, so it is not meant to be taken literally. Even though the story is about zombies, you should take it as a warning against using zombie-esque attitudes. For example, you should not be stuck in a zombie-like mindset or be in a zombie-like condition.\n\nThe final question is really hard to answer. I will post it later when I'm done with the other questions.\n\n### Question:\nMark's biological father is:\nOptions: A. Mark’s father in the upper world ##B. Mark's father in the lower world ##C.

This is the most realistic and the easiest way to maintain the lighthouse.\n\nThe most reliable method for food and energy production is simply to plant corn. This simple and reliable method is the least costly and is the best way to nourish the lighthouse without the need to go out and deal with the trash.\n\nHowever, in the end, it is not enough to simply find the trash.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit. Jumping from a high place, if Link accelerates the fall and lands in water, he will not sustain any damage. The golem's head can continuously focus on hostile targets. By connecting the Zonaiite weaponry to this head, an automatic tracking attack device can be formed.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him.

When the evil \"Zora\" came to earth and seized the island of \"Zora\", they learned from their forefathers that a powerful \"magic sword\" could destroy people's bodies and souls. To atone for their sins and reverse it, they merged their consciousness into a huge \"electric fish\" and took it with them to the sea of ​​whispers. \"True Blue\", \"Calm Spell\", and \"Eon Spell\" were not yet born, but only this huge \"electric fish\" existed. Finally, they encountered a fierce storm. During the storm, the \"electric fish\" did not return. However, it was then that the \"True Blue\" and the \"Calm Spell\" merged with the \"flying boat\", and the \"Eon Spell\" and the \"magic sword\" were also successfully fused. Thereby it became the familiar \"electric snake\".\nThe \"blue sea\" and the \"calm waters\" are under the governance of the god of water \"Electricity\". There, the gods of the four elements live together. The gods of the four elements live in seclusion here all day long.

The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth.

The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that.

The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety.

He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.
