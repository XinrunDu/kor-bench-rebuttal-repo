I have provided a few examples.\n\n### More examples of additional rules:\n1.Must be a noun (not a verb or adjective).\n2.Must start with a two letter combination (e.g. ar, at, a-).\n3.Only five letters are used\n4.Only two letters are used (e.g. ll to make it or the other way around)\n5.Only two or four letters are used.\n6.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n7.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n8.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n9.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n10.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n11.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n12.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n13.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n14.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n15.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n16.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n17.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n18.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n19.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n20.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n21.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n22.Question is word it out or not relevant.\n\n## Bonus Challenge:\nYour Task: Think of an additional challenge. To make sure that you give something different and not the same (or at least similar). If the original challenge is not really complex or looks similar, you can add a couple more constraints or apply some more common sense to find the pattern.\n\n### Bonus examples of additional rules:\n1.For Rubik's cubes the color that is not changing but remains red, blue, green or yellow.\n2.For Rubik's cubes the hue of the final result when at least one part is changed.\n3.The 5 colors. The cube always will have blue, green and orange. It is not related to the rest. The second part needs to be either red or yellow (or both). The other part can be either red, green or yellow. It cannot be blue.\n\n## Hints:\nA hint goes to the rule that allows you to make at least one word out of it to make the question more specific. These hints are not to make easy the answer or to make you determine the rule just after doing the first one or two hints. Without these hints, you can figure out the rule as well (because the hints usually involve other examples other than this challenge).\n\n### Hints:\n1.You can change the color of six sides. You do not have to do it necessarily with all six sides. You also do not have to do it with a side.\n2.You can change the color of the 3s, 5s, 4s and the 2222.\n3.You can change the color of the 222 or 555 or 33 or 44.\n4.The colors can be added or removed (e.g. 1: blue, red. 2: red, blue). You can put another cube next to it.\n5.You have a sticker. For example while in combination with cube1 (422, 98, 4080), the sticker remains blue (you can also remove the sticker). You can do it either with side3 (option one), side5 (option two) or with side9 (option three).\n\n## How to deal with challenges without using Hint?\nYour job for the hour is to solve each problem in the challenge set without using the hint. It does not mean ignore each challenge but it means using the hint once (and only once). Keep in mind that sometimes the difference between challenging the rule and giving a correct answer (or even an approximate answer) may not be so big. In those cases and when you can really determine with extreme accuracy which way it is heading, you can confirm it by using a hint."}

H I K A P M\n\n### Question:\nL = 8\nF = 5\nG = 9\nE = 5\nD = 3\n\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nTo address the puzzle question, we need to check the given terms one by one. Since the letters are separated by spaces, we can read the terms in a row. Firstly, let's cross out the letters: H A = 7, I H = 3, K G N = 9, and L G N = 9.\n\nNow, let's move on to the provided answers. Firstly, we have two rows, I V I Y = 9 and L A Y = 6. Because it doesn't make sense to assign 'I' to 'L', we exclude the first query.\nSecondly, we have three rows K G I P T = 9, C H C D E E = 7, and M A D C E M E = 8. Since the terms are separated by spaces, we can clearly see that C, H, and D are assigned correctly. As for G, we remove F F after applying the rule, the only remaining candidate is T, which equals 2.\n\nConfusingly, T equals 2 as the letter G was assigned by a letter that started with a capital letter.\nNext, we have two rows D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3.\nWe find two labels C and F, \nSince every label is different, we assign 'M' to 'F'.\nFinally, let's check out the remaining rows. Let F be 2, as there were already labels C and F.\nNow, when we label the remaining D C F E M = 7 and K M F E K = 3 rows.\nWe can see that the first row has 7 entries P, H, C, M, and D, while the second row has 6 entries G, F, K, E, and M. Because the number of items in the first row is less than that in the second row, 7 < 6, we need to recalculate the assignment.\nIf we recalculate, the number of items K = 65, and the number of items C = 73. Since the number of G items in the first row is still the same as before, let's assign \"K\" to \"G.\"\nNow, we have the labels M G K E H, corresponding to the green lines on the left side and the green lines on the right side. After reconciling our labels, we arrive at the final answer H E K D C G M.\n\n### Question:\nA = 1 B = 2 C = 3 D = E = 5 F = 7 G = 9 H = 1 I = 5 J = 3 K = 4 L = 8\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nLet's assign 1 to each alphabet, starting with \"A\", followed by \"B\", and so on, through \"Z\" as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\n### Question:\nB = C D = 6\nPlease provide your answer in the form: letter=number, and make sure to enclose your answer in double square brackets, like this: [[A=1,B=2,...]].\n\n### Answer:\nA B E G U L O X = 6 A B F V = 7 A F I V = 8 A G I = 9 O L K K S = 6 A F G E R = 7 A O U U K A X = 6 A J W U D C X = 7"}

Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1.The game is played on an n*m grid with trees at some locations in the grid.\n2.To place tents on the grid.\n3.Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., above, below, to the left, or to the right of the tree).\n4.Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.\n5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column.\n6.Each puzzle has and has only one unique solution.\n7.The puzzle is given by a matrix in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, and X, which represents the spaces,To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X T X X T X 3\nX T X X X X X X X X 1\nX X X T T X X X X X 3\nT X X X X X T T X X 1\nX T X X T X X X X X 2\n2 1 1 1 1
