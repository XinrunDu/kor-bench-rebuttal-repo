For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

By solving the traditional maze, most people start from the starting point and will of course use the traditional 'backtracking algorithm' to locate the goal, but what if we have a more intelligent method to solve the puzzle?\n\n*In fact, the use of intelligence and wisdom is equivalent to rewriting a rule similar to the rules of life. The key is to master the correct use of this wisdom or intelligence, that is, to rewrite the program.\n\n*While playing this game, what we can do is to give reasonable guidance and direction to the player at any time, so that once he encounters a situation, he will not be confused. These reasonable prompts are often called 'inflection points'. In essence, these inflection points are based on a powerful AI rule, and this shell-like calculation rule includes several principles:\n\n1. Every cell in a grid corresponds to an accurate arrow.\n2. There is no possibility for a circular reference. The grid is not in a cyclical arrangement.\n3. There is no possibility to choose a new path after moving to a certain grid, and can only follow the direction indicated by the arrow.\n4. The AI has absolute confidence that it is able to reach the goal smoothly.\n\n*Of course, this traditional maze only requires these four principles, and the corresponding game rules are not difficult. If you have ever heard of 'Life Rules', you may remember that the starting condition is an empty table with different points of life sprinkled on it. These points of life are simply arranged randomly according to AI's confidence in the future. The goal of 'Life Rules 2048' is to rule out these rules of life like a puzzle to maximize the use of intelligence or wisdom to create an intelligent assistant who can effectively solve the puzzle.*\n\n### Instructions:\n\n*In the program, you are required to design a program that can calculate the inflection point. The calculation process can use dynamic programming methods, and when there are errors, we will send a corresponding rule to guide you to solve the problem.*\n\n### Output Example:\n\nOutput in the form of a function, the function named ```solve```, input the shape of the maze ```board```, and output a list corresponding to the positions of the inflection points as well as the result of the inference."}
