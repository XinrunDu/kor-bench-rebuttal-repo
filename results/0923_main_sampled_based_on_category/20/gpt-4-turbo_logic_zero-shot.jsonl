I remember one time he invited some friends over for dinner.\nPerson B: That's nice, everyone can get together.\nPerson A: The appointment was for six in the evening, and by half past five, three people had arrived, but one important guest hadn't shown up yet.\nPerson B: Then wait a bit longer, if they don't come, start eating without them.\nPerson A: My grandfather is a punctual person. When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[Some who should have stayed are not those who have left.]]"}
