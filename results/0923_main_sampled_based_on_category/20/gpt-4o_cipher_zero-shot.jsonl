Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"BIVKC\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"BIVKC,\" let's follow the encryption rules to derive the ciphertext.\n\n1. **Fill the first position in the first line**:\n   ```\n   B\n   ```\n\n2. **Start with a downward fill. Fill \"I\" to \"C\" alternately downward and upward**:\n   - Fill the first row with \"#\" (we already have \"B\" in the first line):\n   - Place \"I\" in the second row, \"V\" in the third row, \"K\" in the fourth row, and \"C\" in the fifth row:\n   \n   Downward fill:\n   ```\n   B #\n   I\n   ```\n   \n   Continue the downward padding, so next padding must be upward:\n   ```\n   V\n   K\n   ```\n   \n   Fill \"C\" to the top row:\n   ```\n   C\n   ```\n\n   Now we read the final grid:\n   ```\n   B #\n   I\n   V\n   K\n   C\n   ```\n\n3. **Assemble the lines and add the '*' at the end of each line**:\n   - Line 1: \"B#\"\n   - Line 2: \"I \"\n   - Line 3: \"V \"\n   - Line 4: \"K \"\n   - Line 5: \"C \"\n   - Join with \"*\" to mark the end of each line:\n     - \"B#*I *V *K *C *\"\n\nTherefore, the encrypted text is:\n\n[[B#*I*V*K*C*]]"}

A written grid can be obtained.\n    - According to the transposed sequence table, adjust the order of the columns, that is, the order of the columns is now [the original column 1, the original column 4, the original column 0, the original column 6, the original column 5, the original column 2, the original column 3], you can get after the adjustment of the columns after the order of the grid.\n    - Read the grid row by row and connect them to get the final ciphertext.(Note that $ needs to be retained.)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Transposed sequence list (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line.\n    - Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 corresponding to 0, then a character in column 0 corresponding to 1, then a character in column 6 corresponding to 2, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.\n    - Eventually read the message line by line, remove the $ at the end, you can get the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"DTRULCK\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's go through the encryption process step-by-step according to the provided rules.\n\n### Step 1: Write the Plaintext in a grid\n\nPlaintext: \"DTRULCK\"\n\nSince the transposed sequence has a length of 7, we write the plaintext in lines of 7 characters. Given that there are only 7 characters, they will all fit in the first line:\n\n```\nD T R U L C K\n```\n\n### Step 2: Transpose the Columns\n\nBased on the transposed sequence [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3], we reorder the columns as follows:\n\nOriginal:     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \nTranspose:    [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n\nThis gives us the new column order:\n- 1 -> 4th column -> T\n- 4 -> 5th column -> L\n- 0 -> 1st column -> D\n- 6 -> 7th column -> K\n- 5 -> 6th column -> C\n- 2 -> 3rd column -> R\n- 3 -> 4th column -> U\n\nSo, the transformed single line looks like this:\n```\nT L D K C R U\n```\n\n### Step 3: Form the final ciphertext\n\nThe final ciphertext is obtained by reading the grid row by row. Since there's only one row in this case:\n```\nCiphertext: T L D K C R U\n```\n\nThus the encrypted text is:\n```\n[[TLDKCRU]]\n```\n\n### Answer:\n[[TLDKCRU]]"}

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards:\n        - A list of 54 numbers, including a randomly shuffled deck consisting of 52 suited cards and two distinguishable jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker. Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.
