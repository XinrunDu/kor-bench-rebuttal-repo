Since all natural numbers are positive, the union of these sets would simply be all positive numbers, as the natural numbers are a subset of all positive numbers.\n\n2. \\(A \\cap B\\) means the intersection of set A and set B, which includes all elements that are common to A and B. As all natural numbers are positive, the intersection is just the set of all natural numbers, which is set A.\n\n3. \\((A \\cup B) - (A \\cap B)\\) translates to taking the union of A and B and then removing the intersection of A and B. Since the union is all positive numbers and the intersection is just the natural numbers, what remains are all positive numbers that are not natural numbers.\n\nHowever, this leads us to a slight misinterpretation in the context of the question. The set \\(B\\) is not well-defined in the way \"positive\" is used. Typically, \"positive\" in a mathematical context includes all positive real numbers when not specified otherwise, and \"natural numbers\" often refers to all non-negative integers \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\\) or positive integers \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\\) depending on the context, with the former being more common in set theory.\n\nAssuming \"positive\" refers to all positive real numbers and \"natural numbers\" includes 0 (to avoid an empty set as the outcome), then:\n\n- \\(A \\cup B =\\) all positive real numbers and 0 (since 0 is a natural number)\n- \\(A \\cap B =\\) all positive natural numbers\n\nTherefore, \\(A￡B =\\) all positive real numbers that are not natural numbers, AND 0. This set does not have a simple finite representation but is described by removing the natural numbers (including 0) from all positive real numbers and then adding 0 back, leaving us with all positive rational and irrational numbers that are not natural.\n\nWrapping the answer in double square brackets as requested:\n\n\\[\\[\\{x \\mid x \\text{ is a positive real number and not a natural number,} \\cup \\{0\\}\\}\\]\\]\n\nNote: If \"natural numbers\" are defined as strictly positive integers (\\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\\)), then 0 is not added back, and the answer would be:\n\n\\[\\[\\{x \\mid x \\text{ is a positive real number and not a natural number}\\}\\]\\]\n\nBut since the standard interpretation in set theory includes 0 in the natural numbers, the first answer is more accurate."}
