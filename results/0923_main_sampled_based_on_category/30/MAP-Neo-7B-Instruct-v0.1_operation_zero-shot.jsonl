A○B = 180, where A = 7 and B = 2.\n2. B○A = 65, where B = 2 and A = 3.\n\nLet's solve for x and y using these equations:\n\nFor A○B = 180:\n180 = (xA + yB) × (A + B)\n180 = (7x + 2y) × (7 + 2)\n\nFor B○A = 65:\n65 = (xB + yA) × (B + A)\n65 = (2x + 3y) × (2 + 3)\n\nNow let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom A○B:\n180 = (7x + 2y) × 9\n2 = 7x + 2y\n\nFrom B○A:\n65 = (2x + 3y) × 5\n13 = 2x + 3y\n\nWe now have a system of equations:\n2 = 7x + 2y\n13 = 2x + 3y\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n13 - 2 = (2x + 3y) - (7x + 2y)\n11 = -5x + y\n\nLet's express y in terms of x using this equation:\ny = 11 + 5x\n\nNow substitute this expression for y into one of the original equations.

Each of these values provides an average of 5 when considering the even numbers between X and 6. For instance:\n\n- X = 4: Even numbers are 4 and 6, average is (4 + 6) / 2 = 5.\n- X = 8: Even numbers are 8 and 10, average is (8 + 10) / 2 = 9, which does not match the rule's requirement.\n- X = 12: Even numbers are 12 and 14, average is (12 + 14) / 2 = 13, which also does not match.\n\nThe only even number X that fits the rule's criteria is 4. Thus, the answer to the question \"X#6=5\" is X = 4. As per the rule, this solution is unique.\n\n**Answer: [[4]]**"}

The average of these numbers is (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6.\n   - But, if X = 5, then 3#X = 3#5 is calculated as (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7.\n   - However, based on the rule and the provided value of 4, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation. With X = 5, the direct application of the rule doesn't result in 4. The correct interpretation should be:\n     - If 3#X = 4, it means: (Average of all even numbers between 3 and the next even number greater than X, inclusive) = 4.\n   - If we actually interpret it as:\n     - The operation is meant to be applied from 3 upwards, and since 3 is an even number, the next even number is 4.\n   - So, the operation would be: (Average of even numbers between 3 and 4) = (4 + 2) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.\n   - But, based on the initial equation, if 3#X = 4, the correct interpretation should involve looking for an X where the average of even numbers from 3 to X (inclusive) equals 4.\n   \n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - Given the correct interpretation and the operation definition, the equation 3#X = 4 does not find a straightforward solution that aligns with typical number ranges since the operation rule suggests averaging from 3 upwards, and the provided equation seems to imply starting from 3 exclusively.\n   - However, if we were to follow the question's logic without directly yielding a direct solution to X, we would investigate scenarios where the average of even numbers could indeed reach 4. But, given the rule's strict interpretation and the provided equation, there's a misinterpretation or a typo in the question.\n\n   - Valid solutions, within the conventional understanding, involve recalculating the equation with a different approach, or if we assume a typo, then:\n     - For 3#X = 4, considering the operation rule strictly (from 3 upwards, including 3), a potential valid solution within standard number ranges, without direct opportunities for an integer X that yields exactly 4, would be exploring X as a decimal or complex number in a different context.\n\n   - Therefore, wrapping it in double brackets: [[There is no straightforward integer solution within conventional number ranges, but the rule suggests a reevaluation for non-integers]].\n\nThis analysis aims to provide a structured approach to solving the problem based on the given operation rule and question. However, the direct solution requires reevaluating the question's constraints or the operation's definition."}

Understand the operation rule:\n   - \\(a\\%b\\) is equivalent to \\(a^b + \\sqrt{ab}\\).\n\n2. Apply the rule to the question:\n   - We have \\(X\\%3 = X^3 + \\sqrt{X \\cdot 3}\\).\n   - According to the rule, \\(X\\%3 = 30\\).\n\n3. Solve for \\(X\\):\n   - From \\(X\\%3 = 30\\), we can express it as two parts: \\(X^3 + \\sqrt{X \\cdot 3} = 30\\).\n   - Since \\(X\\) must be a positive integer, let's solve for \\(X\\) by isolating it:\n     - \\(X^3 = 30 - \\sqrt{X \\cdot 3}\\).\n     - To isolate \\(X\\), we would normally use trial and error or numerical methods, but given the form of the equation, let's simplify:\n       - \\(X^3 = \\frac{30 \\pm \\sqrt{90}}{1}\\), since we're looking for a positive integer cube root which is more straightforward with trial and error.\n\n4. Simplify and test for a positive integer solution:\n   - Let's try with \\(X = 3\\) (since 3 is a logical starting point in such problems):\n     - \\(X^3 = 3^3 = 27\\), and \\(\\sqrt{X \\cdot 3} = \\sqrt{3 \\cdot 3} = 3\\).\n     - Thus, \\(27 = 30 - 3\\), which is incorrect.

This underlines the need for an accurate method.\n\nGiven the complexity of finding the exact value within a simple explanation, a precise numerical solver or iterative method is typically used. However, for educational purposes, based on the initial steps and correcting the approach, the final answer sought is not feasible under these constraints due to the iterative and numerical nature of finding the cube root of 30, ensuring a number is only returned.\n\nTherefore, without advanced methodologies, we conclude:\n\nGiven the complexity and need for accurate numerical methods, the exact positive integer \\(X\\) for which \\(X\\%3 = 30\\) was not achievable using simple algebraic steps in this context. For precise answers, numerical solvers or iterative processes are typically employed.\n\n[[64]] (Note: This answer reflects an attempt to manually solve the problem and is not the most precise or accurate method for finding the precise integer value, as it was established earlier).\n\n---\n\nFor accurate results, consider using numerical methods or computational tools tailored for such tasks.

So, A ∪ B = {x | x is a natural number or positive}.\n- Intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) includes only the elements that are present in both sets.

Since A and B have the same elements (natural numbers), the intersection is A, and the operation A ¤ B simplifies to:\n\nA ¤ B = (A ∪ B) - A = {x | x is a natural number or positive} - {x | x is a natural number} = {positive numbers}\n\nTherefore, the answer in the form specified is:\n[[{positive numbers}]]\n\nThis answer represents the set of positive numbers as per the operation rule's guideline.
