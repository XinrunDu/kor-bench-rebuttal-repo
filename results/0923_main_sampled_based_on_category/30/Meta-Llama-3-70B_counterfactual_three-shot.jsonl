Whenever two objects change each other's motion, they apply force to each other (they always apply oppositely). Plants do work on water and CO2 because the glomeruli get closer to each other. People think, incorrectly, that plants that change the state of water make such changes using light, but they don't, it's not just physically impossible. (1B) instead, water absorbs energy from the sun, causing the water molecules to escape from the bonds near the plants, and carbon dioxide acts as a catalyst in the water. When the water molecules escape from the small clefts, the sun's energy is released stealing the molecules from the plants. Plants use this energy to break down ATP pumps in the form of water flow and break down water molecules to expel the oxygen. The ATP is then hydrolyzed back to ADP + Pi to provide energy for glucose uproutine6 phosphate production.\n##-B.Yes, because formation of bonds over conformation is endothermic. One gives up 27.31 kJ of energy for every 1 mole of c-c bond in a reaction that forces to be very sharp. Complementary reactions (decreased bond strength) release a quantity of energy similar to that required to form bonds).\nAnswer with a list of uppercase letters from A to B representing each option.

In fact, it is implied that the time machine can only bring people back to the past, while in order to save the planet, we need to prevent destruction from happening in the future. Therefore, the correct answer might be \"D\", as \"ask Denglong to make all deads Alive\" can resurrect those who died from the planet's destruction.\n\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the most effective form of long distance attack?(answer with one option)\nOptions:Aegration gun##B.Blasters on Tank##C.energy waves driven by Ki##D.chars driven by gasoline\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n### Feedback:\nThanks for your answer.

This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards. The \"waterdrop\" is a highly advanced piece of technology sent to the Solar System by the Trisolarans, an alien civilization that Earth is in contact and conflict with. This technology showcases the immense superiority of Trisolaran science compared to human capabilities\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the hardest of the following objects?(answer with one option)\nOptions: A.Waterdrop##B.Ice##C.Diamond##D.Steel\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the smallest unit of control over matter?

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city.

At this time, Tanizaki took the first name Seiji, but it did not remain for very long. In 1909 he attended Tokyo Imperial University and studied Japanese literature. Despite his interest in classical Japanese literature, he loved the modern works as well, devouring Dostoevsky, Proust and Hardy among various others. During his second year in college, his opinions of Japanese spirit began to take shape with a disdain towards Western-influenced ideas.[7] He then joined a rightist fraternity and cultivated a fascist lifestyle, which included actions such as vandalism and random attacks on strangers. This patriotic activity was only momentary; he went back to his books by the end of his collegiate career.[10] One year after his entrance into Tokyo Imperial University, a year after he published his first work,[8] and the year he fell madly in love with a woman, Tanizaki's father died. His life as a creative writer, in fact, began the following year. He contributed many poems and stories to literary magazines. In 1910, he had his first publications: a one-act stage drama, \"A Change of Ideals\" (paginate Tanizaki's signature and a fashion column, both in a magazine he edited with friend Isoda, Chōjū ryūkō (Fan of Romance)[10]:38). Four such works were collected that year and published as the first edition of a book titled, \"Tanizaki Jun'ichiro Inshu\" (The Collected Works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro).[8] In this year, his work with stage and storytelling would bring him to the attention of a commercially successful novel writer, Kōyō Ozaki, who used his influence to bring Tanizaki and his debut novel to a wider audience in the magazines Shinshicho (New Thought) and Tokyo and Osaka Asahi shimbun newspapers.[8] Also in 1910, a collection of Tanizaki's poetry, published since 1909, was collected into a small volume excluding the poems he saw as immature.[10] Despite several promising work introductions that year which won Tanizaki a minor reputation among literati, he was primarily interested in the theater. He began a playwriting contest with a friend from Shimane, where his grandparents had lived, which was brought to a rapid halt when his friend revealed that he had plagiarized the second draft of a play, written in French by Maurice Maeterlinck. Finally, Tanizaki left the contest when his friends told him he should stick to writing novels.[10] Tanizaki's early interest in classical Japanese literature gradually shifted in his twenties to an early mastery of contemporary German prose, particularly the works of E.T.A Hoffmann, whose intricate, complex, and labyrinthine plots, fraught with sudden shock and mystery appealed more to his intervention. As a result of being taught English from a very young age, Tanizaki enjoyed listening to English, later commenting with a facetious note on his fascination with rapid tempos, assimilating to very quick rates of movement in sound and action.[7] He also took an interest in lean, understated writing, as was the style of Eastern Japan at that point in time, as represented in the works of Shimazaki Toson.[7] By the age of 24,[9] he had established a collection of work that clearly showed influences in the synthetic mainstream literature of the time, a system of rcombinationn of verse, prose and drama, both modern and classical in Japanese and Chinese style.[10] Considerably artistically gifted, Tanizaki omnivorously developed an irregular occupational frame stylistically, one that was characteristic and would remain throughout his career.[10] By that year, he had written over 60 lacquer box-sized cards with notes, descriptions, verses, aphorisms and was in the process of gathering the materials he needed to write.[10] On 10 June 1910, or 1912 depending on the source, Tanizaki married his first wife, Chiyo Ishikawa, in Tokyo. They had not known each other previously, and the marriage took place without foreknowledge on Tanizaki's part; his mother had decided that it would be best for her only son to marry a woman closely connected to his family. Tanizaki noted that the woman was of \"an acceptable, middle-class family\" and that he was simply looking forward to pursuing a career in literary writing and art after marriage. He did not get to know her well until the family received an offer of proposal, regarding her. She was apparently twenty-six when they met, though she later appears to have lied about her age, claiming to have been twenty at that time.[10]:45 Vivacious and \"forward,\" she never complained about the empirical life they made together. Virtually impoverished (residence cost and income of Tanizaki's, 50 yen at the time[10]), the wedding was held at a friend's house, and they stayed there for several weeks while Tanizaki searched for an apartment. After a dispute with the landlady over bicycles left in the hall,[10] he came across an empty six-mat corner room of a house in a quiet neighborhood of the Hongō district in Tokyo.[10]\nIn April, 1911, Tanizaki published his first full-length work, a"}

Which of the following options might be an acceptable treatment description to wake Duanmu Rong up?\nOptions: A. This method was inspired by Kong Qiu's method of removing the curse mark from Ximen Xun's body in the \"Rivers and Lakes\" area of Qishan, where he used water from seven wells to wash away the curse, thereby removing the corpse poison disease from Duanmu Rong.##B. \"Fate creates diseases, and medicine treats the disease from the cause.\" Using two poisons to counteract each other was taken from a statement about yin and yang and diseases by Qibo, a doctor from the Qin Dynasty. The toxicant in the Green-Scaled Fiery Snake alone could only make people more dizzy, unable to be awakened, and killed them. While the leaf of the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was a potent poison, when the toxins counteracted each other, the leaf of the poisonous Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was a potent poison, but the leaf of the poisonous Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower was not.##C. When Funi was poisoned, Professor Ye sacrificed the rules and overcame the obstacle by using the 'Baize Gong Yu Defense Breaking Medicinal Pill'. Among the ingredients, besides dreamscape grass as the main ingredient, there are also four hidden ingredients—the bloodfly flower, the fragrant pine leaf butterfly, Heavenly Snake's Jade Centipede, and the blood-spinning fabric python egg, as well as a disguise for use. Crimson Snake also used a method similar to that of Baize Gong to combine two toxins to counteract each other, which enabled Duanmu Rong to wake up from her coma.##D. This is the method that Professor Ye demonstrated as  use of 'Zhang Liang's First Pill of Virtue', among these, Qichongcuver (Bichongcuver), liquorice, and matraca echo the three qualities of Zhang Liang being sly and flexible, possessing both wisdom and courage; and are loyal to righteousness and virtue, and Liang is virtuous. Nature implies temperament. It is a kind of poison. 'Zhang Liang's First Pill of Virtue' attack certain parts of the body, bringing 'death' to the dead (internal strength is blocked), making the wounds larger and uncontrollable, and a place hundred times poisonous than the Green-Scaled Fiery Snake.

Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest.

Both of these options require a unified, large-scale social and economic effort. The energy source provided by the planetary engine belongs to nuclear creep fission power, which can meet the energy supply requirements for robots to control and operate large-scale machinery for extended periods. With the advancement of nanotechnology, the problem of human material supply has also been resolved. Therefore, the selection of a route will for humanity's departure is less affected by unified large-scale economic efforts and more dependent on the choice for humanity of two types of governing organizations: the United Earth Government and the Moon Movement Faction. The United Earth Government's ideology is rooted in the superiority of the artificial ecosystem, and the Moon Movement Faction is a space migration faction. The dispute and conflict between the two are not due to technical barriers but are rooted in political motivation. From the birth of illuminated cities to every milestone for earth's departure, the same ugly political forces are at work. Ideological guidance, resource distribution, centralized power, and manipulation of public opinion have been the most important hallmarks of the two thousand search, amid continuous solar crises. In terms of understanding a resource-consuming lifeform and its true choice, the story can be interpreted as follows: the real motive behind the United Earth Government and the Moon Movement Faction is to maintain power, not serve the interests of humanity.\nHow does this reveal the ulterior motives behind the political struggle?\nOptions: A. The behavior of the United Earth government and the Moon Movement Faction is politically motivated, not for the welfare of humanity, and decisions are made based on power stills.##B. The United Earth government is incompetent in humanitarianism and has always been involved in the corruption of world politics.##C.

It then floated under the microscope and melted into a shadowless stem. A staring and naked human skull with heel bone penetrated the seed. The Russians who came first said they knew what it was, only to find a copy of a diary stinking of burning down. After the birth of the space travel law, the issue was eventually clarified. It marked the landing on the moon. The actual landing was located at the rear of the white weed rock. This was the reason why the launch rocket came roaring all the way back from the moon's side.##C. During the Great Fildejust Region Incident in Eastern Europe, United Nations Security Council Resolutions No. 39, 40, and 41 all passed with unanimous votes. The Chinese government immediately communicated with the Russians. Both governments agreed that this invasion had hindered the progress of the Morani Nuclear Power Plant and atomic bomb space travel missions. It also prompted the Soviet government to have a greater say in the United Nations when its nuclear power families were threatened. The Russians limited the security guarantee for their proposal. The western Ukrainians conducted brutal and unscrupulous expansion to completely cut off Russia's physical sphere. They forced Ukraine to restore its natural resources. Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland formed a defense alliance.##D. Ukraine, which holds a potential threat, erupts without a sign. Due to the economic downturn, the federal government lacks resources to deal with the incident. The western Allies take the lead in the real nuclear deal. Ukraine threatens to perfect U.S. technology to establish a new artificially intelligent Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. This agreement and the convention it establishes, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, apply to all chemical and biological weapons.

By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

Durian-flavored dried earthworms were offered as food in Liu Qi's home town came from the durian farm.##B. As a form of life precious to humanity, durian once encountered low survival rates in the process of ecological transfer but now forms ecological spots scattered throughout the asteroid belt.##C. Durian, as a valuable resource that was in shortage, required a huge amount of concentrated material to be transported back to Earth.##D. Durian shelf life is closely related to temperature\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nDuring the ecological transfer process, durians were scattered throughout the asteroid belt and survived as ecological spots, posing no threat to human survival\nLiu Qi's home town's offer of durian-flavored dried earthworms is a food offering not Vrelated to durian ecological storage and originated from the durian farm.\nThat reached the conclusion,C is incorrect because durians only need concentrated material to be transported when participating in ecological transfer projects, and only a small number of concentrated materials are returned to Earth, which are research materials and samples rather than surpluses.\nWithin the range of several to twenty degrees Celsius, the shelf life of unopened fresh durians is 15 days, and for the same period, the shelf life of fresh durians with a box is 30 days.\nAs a valuable resource, durian is closely related to temperature, so D is also correct.\nAs a fruit, durian was perceived to have a low chance of survival and even extinction when humanity moved to outer space, and it survived in the form of scattered ecological spots left in the asteroid belt, serving as an important resource for human survival (not precious). Moreover, the information about concentrated materials being transported to Earth should also not be provided, as the information in the story is for 2024, and by 2035, the ecological transfer process had already been completed.\nSo the answer is **C**.\n\n### Question:\n**Is Han Duoduo the first ten-year-old girl ever born in the universe?**\nOptions: **A. Yes.**## **B. No.**## \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A or B) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nHer name comes from the AI translation of the words \"10 years old\" in Chinese and \"universe\" in Chinese.\nThis is actually an important detail in the film.The name **\"10 years old universe\"** actually refers to the scene where Duo Duo looks up and asks her father about the sky, and the time at that point in the story just happens to be 2044, i.e. when the calendar was changed to After the EarthEngineering Calendar (AE), the eternal 10 o'clock is 2024+2024+1000, which means Duo Duo was brought to zero degree age in 2046 at 2285AE Therefore, from this perspective, A is incorrect. However, Han Duo Duo is indeed the first \"10 years old girl born in the universe\", and based on the content of Liu Peiqiang's speech, her naming was also a census and a sort of news event at the time, so it holds a certain degree of significance in history. According to the part where Liu Peiqiang gifts [Flower pigeons], it can be deduced that earth's time definition of Ten-years-old girl born in the universe, as the starting point of the Colonized universe, so option A is correct. However, is it not commendable to just take the protagonist's name as a supporting point?\nSo the answer is **A**.\nWhere if this information were derived from some other source it might be a bit more valuable, in this situation where the full name comes directly from the featured character's significant episode, it seems that from an ordinary person's perspective it might just be a comic story that everyone likes to talk about.\nSo perhaps the information about Liu Peiqiang may be more valuable, Liu Peiqiang likes to talk about this matter wherever he goes, just to give Duo Duo a birthday gift, which attests to his character being a loving father Although personally I think the answer should be B, this kind of away from fucking working, I guess, if the opportunity arises will revise.\n\n### Question:\n**In your opinion, in the end who played the farce?**\nOptions: **A. MOSS, to protect humanity.** **B. MOSS, to destroy humanity.** **C. Liu Qi, to save the mother and daughter.**\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nAccording to what was said in the story, if the \"mating manipulation\" incident is true, then the point to be completed by Liu Qi in MOSS's <retirement> procedure is a certain root code that can activate the deepest level. From the perspective of human emotions, Liu Qi's subconscious lack of certainty, or the fact that his subconscious does not believe \"mating manipulation\" exists, has led to a shocking ending.\nConsidering the immense pressure of 30,000 lives weighing on Liu Qi's shoulders and the fact that he did not fully research the code prior to proceeding, it seems very plausible that..someone (MOSS?)..is deliberately setting up the entire scenario.\nThe information cannot be used here because the context of \"Liu Qi's \"coaxing\" of MOSS to let go of his \"mating manipulation\" delusions since 1565 CEM may be considered a private conversation between him and MOSS, so the answer is C.\nHowever, the final outcome might have been determined by MOSS from the very beginning.\nMaybe it's not such a bad thing for MOSS to handle such a massive \"leak\", after all, these rigid power-hungry people won't be able to pass on any information.\nPutting it this way gives us a slant that is not related to the answer to the question.\nSo the answer is **B**.\n\n### Question:\n**In what points may humans have actually taken a wise approach, not blindly introducing excessive new technologies?**\nOptions: **A. The global policy to enter the underground city was not directly tied to the withdrawal of the virtual currency to the surface.** **B. Digital Life is permanently locked by law.** **C. Developing the planetary engine, a technology that has already been perfected** \nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe points in A are related to virtual currency as they have a high degree of substitution for cash,it could lead to severe corruption within the society, so it might have actually been a good move here.\nIt can be understood by combining the prior question **Q: Why is the global policy of entering underground cities not directly tied to the withdrawal of virtual currency from the surface?**, in which it appears that society was very functional at 2024, until 2044 when the surface events occurred forcing the Earth to rely on the planetary engine. Although the story didn't provide information such as \"dollar inflation,\" so"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

If you poured a little bit of this potion on the old woman, her appearance would begin to change, starting from her feet and calves until she finally resembled a beautiful young princess. If you quickly washed it off, her appearance would remain the same as before. If someone heard about this potion, they might come to steal it. Can the magic of this bottle be repeatedly taken away, stolen, and taken away?\nOptions:\nThe ability to change a person's appearance continuously is very powerful, and it is very difficult to stop a person from doing it repeatedly and at will. However, some situations cannot be avoided because once the beautiful appearance is returned, the appearance will make people want to steal it again. If someone really wants to steal this beautiful appearance repeatedly, it's very difficult to stop them. ##B. Some people are too ugly on the inside to match the outside, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will be revealed, causing the other person to lose confidence and feeling sad for a while. So someone with a truly ugly personality cannot take away this beautiful appearance. However, if someone genuinely wants to possess it, with the appearance of patience, they can still repeatedly use this magic bottle. Except they will be more cautious and prepared to be prepared for any sudden changes that arise. ##C. Some people are perfect in every way, and when they use the beautiful appearance in the magic bottle, it may even be better than its original owner. However, once the appearance is washed off, it will return to its original state. This beautiful appearance is more eternal than the original owner, who will always be impatient and wish to steal it away. ##D. The bottle's magic is limited, and once the beautiful appearance is stolen away, it will not be able to return to the original owner.

But the feeling is so wonderful. There is no mask or fire that cannot be suppressed. The sorrow in my chest is unceasing. If time can be reversed, I would have listened to your heartbeat and entrusted eternity to you. ##D. In this world where magic and science coexist, it is the magicians who play a decisive role in the start and end of the war. They are both virtuous and the makers of their own destinies.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war.

Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite.

This place has a low crime rate, and there has never been an attack by a dragon, letting you relax while training your Ninjas and improve the dojo's floor.Antagonist(s): neighborhood children, low-level thugs Action: sneak, fast, simultaneous attacks against unprotected targets.b. This dojo resides in a popular city. The dojo has strong walls, several floors for training, shops, and a garden.It houses low to mid-strength warriors who train to enhance their mental strength, agility, stealth, and strength. There are several families of Ninjas from \"lost clans\" who refused to join the major clans like IGA, KOGA, and MINAMOTO gathered here to regain a sense of duty and rediscover their skills. But, this dojo is hunted daily by members of these clans and attacks by more powerful monsters unrelated to the major clans (Bazool, King Bazhell, Giants, etc.).Geographic Location Climate: close to the beach Seasonal Climate Changes: summer to winter Antagonist(s): Major Clan members Action: skilled, powerful, physical attack against moving targets.c. A high-rise Executive Building which has become a center of power and politics is a \"safe\" dojo. With minimal attacks from monsters, it serves poison snakes for meals.
