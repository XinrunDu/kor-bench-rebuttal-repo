So, after multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2×(A+4)×2=2Ba. Then, we know that since 2×(A+4)x=(2*A+8)x therefore we can simplify the equation to (2A+8)×4=Ba. Next, because B is also involved as part of the equation, we need to find some way to \"get rid of\" B from one side of the equation, or else our expression for a won't look so nice! To do this, we could try dividing both sides by B, which gives us (2A+8)/B=a. Finally, all we need to do now is factor out the 'a' from one of the sides, leaving us with just the fraction on the left-hand side. We can do this by multiplying both sides again by B, giving us (2AB+8B)a=Ba.\n### Answer:\n[[2/(A+2)]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (1○2)○4.  \n### Answer:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram\n[*] --> 2\n[*] --> 4\n2 --> 16\n2 --> [*]\n4 --> 16\n4 --> [*]\n16 --> [*]\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a=3, b=-7, f(K)=K○K.

We will present several new rules. For each assignment, all rules in the corresponding group are effective. Try to apply them correctly. You should pay attention to the potential \"rain of diamonds\" problem and should solve it by referring to an example in the rule definition while presenting the answer.\n\nThe questions will become harder and harder. To perform well in the test scenario, you should follow the specified language rules as closely as possible.\n\n1. Operation ∪:\n   + Definition: The symbol A◎B denotes A∪B set A union set B.\n   + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2} and B={2,3} should be written as {1,2,3} without any additional spaces.\n2. Operation ∩:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◈B denotes A∩BSet A intersect set B.\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {2,3} without any additional spaces.\n3. Operation −:\n    + Definition: The symbol A◇B denotes A−B setAsubtraction setB\n    + The \"rain of diamonds\" problem: When presenting the result in braces, each element should be separated by a comma and there should be no spaces between elements. For example, the answer for A={1,2,3} and B={2,3,4} should be written as {1} without any additional spaces.\n\n## Scenario\nIn this test scenario, you will take on the role of an intelligent debugger and use the three new mathematical operators to complete a series of challenges. Your goal is to apply the operators correctly and avoid any syntax errors. Good luck!"}
