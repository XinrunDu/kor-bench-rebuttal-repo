(p>(q|r))\n\nWe start by expanding implication according to Basic Equivalence (10):\n```markdown\n(p>q) ::=:: !p | q\n(p>r) ::=:: !p | r\n```\nThen, using the conjunction (AND), we rewrite the left-hand side:\n```markdown\n((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: (!p | q) & (!p | r)\n```\nUsing Basic Equivalence (5), we simplify it further to get the desired format:\n```markdown\n(!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: (!p & !p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r)\n```\nSimplifying using Basic Equivalences (2), (3), and removing duplicate `!p`, it becomes:\n```markdown\n(!p) | (!p & r) | (q & !p) | (q & r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\n```\nNow we partially simplify the right side of the given equivalence using the rule `A > B ::=:: !A | B`:\n```markdown\n(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !p | q | r\n```\nBy understanding De Morgan's Law, we get:\n```markdown\n!(q&r) ::=:: !q | !r\n```\nBut applying De Morgan's Law and (thus resultant modification) to transformation on the (given) right side, gives:\n```markdown\n!(p>(q|r)) ::=:: !( !p | (q|r) ) \n(!p > (q|r)) becomes \n!( !p | q | r ) ::= (!(!p)) & !(q|r) \nwhere application of ! logic eventually fetch it (right side(p>(q|r)))\n!=p | (p&q) results on NaN orientations\ndetailed

Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nDuring a break at a seminar, three attendees tried to determine where Professor Wang is from based on his accent.

For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nDetermine whether (p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr) conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form? If yes, how can it be denoted?\nThe answer format is as follows: if the statement conforms to the main disjunctive or conjunctive normal form, the answer should be formatted as [[A];[denoted expression]]. If it does not conform, the format should be [[B]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine whether the given statement conforms to the principal disjunctive normal form or principal conjunctive normal form, we first need to express the statement in a form that is equivalent to one of these. \n\nThe given statement is (p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr).\n\nFirst, distribute (\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr) into (p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r):\n\n((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr))\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\n\nThis can be expanded as follows:\n\n((p\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr))\u2228(r\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)))\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\n\nExpand each term:\n\n(((p\u2227\u00acp)\u2228(p\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2227\u00acr))\u2228((r\u2227\u00acp)\u2228(r\u2227q)\u2228(r\u2227\u00acr)))\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\n\nSince (p\u2227\u00acp) and (r\u2227\u00acr) are contradictions, the statement simplifies to:\n\n(((p\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2227\u00acr))\u2228((r\u2227\u00acp)\u2228(r\u2227q)))\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\n\nNow distribute (\u00acq\u2228r):\n\n(((p\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2227\u00acr))\u2228((r\u2227\u00acp)\u2228(r\u2227q))\u2228((\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r))))\n\nFurther simplify and expand it:\n\n(((p\u2227q)\u2228(p\u2227\u00acr))\u2228((r\u2227\u00acp)\u2228(r\u2227q)))\u2228((\u00acq\u2227p\u2228\u00acq\u2227r\u2228p\u2227\u00acq\u2228p\u2227r\u2228r\u2227\u00acq\u2228r\u2227r)\n\nRemove repeated terms, contradictions, and tautologies.

Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n    - Since S0 is an empty set, there are no resolutions between S0 and S1.\n\n3.
