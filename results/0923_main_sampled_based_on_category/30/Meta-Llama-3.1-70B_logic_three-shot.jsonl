If only one thinks they know math, then Dave says \"4\" while Sophie says \"5\". And if neither thinks they know math, they both say \"6\".\n\nGiven that John later discovers at least one of them lied, what can be said about who actually knows math between Dave and Sophie?\nLet A be a proposition that represents whether or not Dave knows math. Similarly, let B represent whether or not Sophie knows math.\nAccording to the information provided, we can derive the following logical propositions:\nDave: D = (A\u2227B)\u21942 | ((A\u2228B)\u2227(\u00ac(A\u2227B)))\u21944\nSophie: S = (A\u2227B)\u21943 | ((A\u2228B)\u2227(\u00ac(A\u2227B)))\u21945\nIn order to determine whether or not there was any lying involved during the conversation between John, Dave, and Sophie, we need to look at all possibilities where either proposition could have been false:\nCase1: Both got the question wrong. Proposition (\u00acA\u2227B)\u2228(A\u2227\u00acB) holds true.\nCase2: One got the question right. Propostion (A\u2227B)\u2227((A\u2228B)\u2227(\u00ac(A\u2227B))) holds true.\nCase3: Neither got the question right. Proposition \u00ac[(A\u2228B)\u2227\u00ac(A\u2227B)]\u2228[(A\u2227B)\u2227(\u00ac(A\u2228B))] holds true.\n\nAfter equivalent derivation, Case1 simplifies to , Case2 simplifies to , and Case3 simplifies to . Therefore, \n\nPlease provide the simplified results along with explanations for each case. The answer format should be like:\n[[Case1:::=[[[simplified result]]: [explanation]];Case2:::=[[[simplified result]]: [explanation]];Case3:::=[[[simplified result]]: [explanation]]]].\n\n### Answer\n[[Case1::=!A&B|[A&B&B&p&q&r!:Explanation];Case2::=!"}

{"idx": "170", "question": "Research has shown that the impact of family education styles on children's emotional intelligence varies across cultures. Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills.

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n\n"}

There is a shortcut in the game: the movement of your opponent's pieces. All the player has to do is continuously move the opponent's white pieces to capture more. During the game, the player develops a sense of achievement through this meaningless action: stealing is fun.
