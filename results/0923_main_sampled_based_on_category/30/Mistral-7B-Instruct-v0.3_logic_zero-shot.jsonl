Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2. Applying the same process for question (2), check if the formulas on both sides can be simplified to become equivalent:\n\n   (2-a) Can we transform !(p=q) into (p|q)&!(p&q)?\n   - According to (2), we know that !(p=q) equals (p|q)&!(p&q).\n\n   (2-b) Is it possible to transform (p|q)&!(p&q) into !(p=q)?\n   - Yes, it is possible. Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid."}

B1&C2&D3 simplifies to !p & (p & q) | (p & !q) & !q & !r. This is because B1 is !p&q, C2 is !q&!r, and the conjunction (and) of their premises is performed.\n\n2. B1&C3&D2 simplifies to !p & (p & q) | (p & !q) & q & !r. This is similar to part 1, but with C3 instead of C2, which results in q instead of !q for the third conjunction term.\n\n3. B2&C1&D3 simplifies to (!!p & q) & !q & !r. This is because B2 is (!!p & q) and C1 is !q & !r, so the conjunction (and) of their premises is performed.\n\n4. B2&C3&D1 simplifies to (!!p & q) & p & !r. This is similar to part 3, but with C3 instead of C1, which results in p instead of !q for the second conjunction term.\n\n5. B3&C1&D2 simplifies to p & q & q. This is because B3 is p&!q, and C1 is !q&!r, so the conjunction (and) of their premises results in a contradiction, which is relieved by changing the false statement (!q) to true (q).\n\n6. B3&C2&D1 simplifies to p & p & q. This is similar to part 5, but with C2 instead of C1, which results in p instead of p for the second conjunction term.\n\n7.

If it is empty, then dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nResolution Algorithm: The steps to determine if a conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment are as follows:\n1. Input: Conjunctive normal form S.\n2. Output: If S has a satisfying assignment, output \u201cPlausible\u201d; otherwise, output \u201cImplausible\u201d.\n3. Steps:\n    1.

Check S2:\n        - If S2 contains no elements, output \u201cPlausible\u201d and terminate the calculation.\n        - Otherwise, add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b.\n\n### Question:\nFor p\u2227(p\u2228q)\u2227(p\u2228\u00acq)\u2227(q\u2228\u00acr)\u2227(q\u2228r), \nwhat are S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm?\nProvide the answers in the format [[];[];[]],\nwhere sets are represented using {}, \nand an empty set is denoted by \u2205.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To find the values of S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm, we first need to list all the simple disjunctive clauses (S1) and then perform the necessary resolutions (S0 and S2) as described in the logic rule. Here's the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. Identify simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form:\n   - (p \u2228 q): This is a simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (p \u2228 \u00acq): This is another simple disjunctive clause.\n   - (q \u2228 \u00acr): This is a third simple disjunctive clause.\n   The set of simple disjunctive clauses is S1 = {(p \u2228 q), (p \u2228 \u00acq), (q \u2228 \u00acr)}.\n\n2. Initialize S0 and S2 as empty sets:\n   - S0 = \u2205\n   - S2 = \u2205\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Resolve (p \u2228 q) from S0 (empty) and (p \u2228 q) from S1: dispel((p \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q)) = p (since we have p from both (p \u2228 q) clauses). Add p to S2: S2 = {p}.\n   - Since S0 and S1 have no other simple disjunctive clauses to resolve, move to the next step.\n\n4. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - Resolve (p \u2228 q) from S1 with (p \u2228 \u00acq) (note that this resolution technique creates two cases for L and L\u2019, which should be considered):\n      - If we resolve with (p \u2228 q) and (p \u2228 \u00acq) such that L = p and L\u2019 = \u00acq, then dispel((p \u2228 q), (p \u2228 \u00acq)) = q. Since neither S0 nor S1 currently contains q, add q to S2: S2 = {p, q}.\n      - If we resolve with (p \u2228 q) and (p \u2228 \u00acq) such that L = p and L\u2019 = p, then dispel((p \u2228 q), (p \u2228 \u00acq)) = 0. Since dispel(C1, C2) = 0 outputs \u201cImplausible\u201d, terminate the calculation.\n   - Since there's no other pair of clauses to resolve in S1, move to the next step.\n\n5. Check S2:\n   - Since S2 contains two elements ({p, q}), there is no satisfying assignment, so the given conjunctive normal form is implausible. Thus, S0, S1, and S2 before the second cycle of the resolution algorithm are as follows:\n   - S0 = \u2205\n   - S1 = {(p \u2228 q), (p \u2228 \u00acq), (q \u2228 \u00acr)}\n   - S2 = {p, q}"}

To find the valid mood for this figure, we can use the form: M()P, S()M, \u2234S()P. In our case, it is given as ()AP, MI(), \u2234SIP.\n\nTo obtain the parentheses, we have to express M()P and S()M in terms of the given rule's representation.\n\nFor the first part M(), MI() represents \u2203p1, so we should find a proposition that is such that (p1 \u2192 M) holds. Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents \u2203p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that \u2203p1 \u2227 p2 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p1, then the second part becomes \u2203p1, p1 \u2192 p3, which holds for all p3 when it's true that p3 follows from p1.\n\n- For EIO: M() should be either E or I. E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 \u2192 p3. For I, S() should be O. However, \u2203p1 \u2227 \u2203p1 \u2192 \u00acp3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2227 p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[\u00acp3]; [p1]]. In other words, the parentheses can be filled in as (\u00acp3)AP, M(p1), \u2234SIP."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Cooperation Principles\n\n1. C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nXiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. \u2192 Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female. (Common sense inference type)\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C!

For example, supporting the view that learning science and technology and resisting decadent culture by eliminating the possibilities of other foreign learning methods.\n\n### Question:\nWhen it is necessary to prove whether an integer is even or odd:\n\nSuppose n is an integer.\n\n**Case 1: n is even**\n\nIf n is even, it can be expressed as n=2k, where k is an integer. According to the definition of even numbers, n is divisible by 2.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\n\nIf n is odd, it can be expressed as n=2k+1, where k is an integer. According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " D.
