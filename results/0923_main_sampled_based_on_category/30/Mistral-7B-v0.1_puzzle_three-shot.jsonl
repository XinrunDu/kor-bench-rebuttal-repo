For the numbers 2 to 9, inclusive, arrange them into a random 6row(rows) and 4 columns(cols) table, in that table all differents correspond numbers form 2 to 9 sit in it in order, and each number is used only once;\n--Stage II. For all adjacent squares(one square can also be a diagonal or vertical square) you can get the following 8 expressions:\n            M+(N&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            A+(M&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (E&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L))\n            N+(L&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M))\n            E+(C&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (M+S))\n            L+(I&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (O&amp;amp;&amp;amp;K))\n            C+(E&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (A+S))\n            I+(J&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (C+O))\n            O+(K&amp;amp;&amp;amp; (IC))\n          Like:\n          M:&nbsp;top&nbsp;left\n          N:&nbsp;top\n          E:&nbsp;left\n          L:&nbsp;right\n          A:&nbsp;top&nbsp;right\n          I:&nbsp;right{中文字成}\n          O:&nbsp;bottom{中文字成}\n          C:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;left\n          S:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;right\n          J or K:&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;middle\n\n--Stage III. All of the preceding expressions would be added together, and then divide by 8 as you want; In this process , you must make up some definitions:\n            A---any number not bigger than 8\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n           C2---1+2+3+4+-+-+-|6+7+8+9|5+6+7+8|4+5+6+7\n           C3---6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10|8+9+10+11+12+13\n\n\n            B--&lt;7C1+8C1&gt;|&lt;7C2+8C2&gt;|&lt;7C3+8C3&gt;\n      Like here:\n             a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\n\n--Stage IV. With each candidate (M&amp;amp;&amp;amp;N, A&amp;amp;&amp;amp;M, N&amp;amp;&amp;amp;L,  and so forth), use all of the remaining eight local equations to yield nine distinct expressions.\n--Stage V. Out of these 9 equations multiply the right hand and left hand of each equation by any number between 1 and 6, inclusive, and be careful you don&#39;t pick some numbers similar when you multiply 1 by 1, 2 by 2, and so on.\n--Stage VI. The formula that you get is the final expression of your work.\n\n<strong>For example:</strong>\n\n--Stage I\n\n\n\n   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n6  |  7   |  8   |  9   |  10 |\n1  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14 |\n   |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |\n\n--renote:in this example 1 sit in up-left.2 sitin up-right\n\n--Stage II\n\n   |  Stage II    |\n:--|:--|\nM&amp;N&amp;L ---  M+(((N&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nA&amp;M&amp;L ---  M+(((A&amp;L)/N)+(L&amp;M))\nN&amp;L&amp;E ---  N+(((L&amp;E)/N)+(E&amp;N))\nE&amp;C&amp;M ---  E+((L&amp;M)/(M+S))\nL&amp;I&amp;O ---  L+((O&amp;K)/(A+S))\nC&amp;E&amp;A ---  C+((E&amp;A)/(E+C))\nI&amp;J&amp;O ---  I+((J&amp;O)/(I+J))\nO&amp;K&amp;IC ---  O+(((K&amp;IC)/(C+O))/2)\n\n--Stage III\n           C1---2+3+4+5|8+6+7+8 |4+5+6+7|1+2+3+4\n             1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8\n           C2:    1+2+3+4+-+-+-|-+-+-|-+-+-\n\n           C3:           6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13|1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14|8+9+10+11+12+13|9+10+11+12+13+10+9+12+11+14\n\n\n         a+((8c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;7c1)+(9c1&amp;amp;&amp;amp;8c1))+(q1+l2+(19+87)/(19+87)+q2)\na+((7c1+9c1)+(3c1+8c1))+(q1+l2+(2182178)/(12131213))++q2\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n--Stage IV\n\n                                 M&amp;M&amp;L ---------  M+(((M&amp;L)/M)+(L&amp;M))\n              AA--- M+((A&amp;M)/M) ------- M+((A&amp;M)/(A&amp;M))\n              NN--- N+((N&amp;L)/M) ------- N+((M&amp;L)/(N&amp;L))\n              LL--- L+((E&amp;L)/N) ------- L+((M&amp;E)/(N&amp;L))\n              EC--- E+((C&amp;M)/(M+S)) ------- E+((M&amp;E)/(M+S))\n              LK--- L+((O&amp;K)/(A&amp;S))------- L+((M&amp;K)/(N&amp;L))\n              CA--- C+((E&amp;A)/(E&amp;C)) ------- C+((A/N)&amp;amp;&amp;amp;((M&amp;L)/N))\n              IJ--- I+((J&amp;O)/(I&amp;J)) ------- I+((O&amp;K)/(I&amp;J))\n              OC--- O+(((K&amp;C)/(C+O))/2)------- O"}
