Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

You're curious how it was encoded, and even more curious how anyone was able to decrypt it. When you get home, you turn on your computer and plug it into the printer, which you then turn on. A document appears on your screen containing 13 lines. The first line contains a plaintext consisting only of random characters; these will become your plaintext alphabet. The length of this plaintext alphabet varies between 10 and 100, but the longest plaintext alphabet contains 19 characters.\n\n\nHidden within the second to fifth line, you find a character-based encryption scheme. Here is an example of one such ciphertext line:\n\nHEX, UP, 5 ET FIX TR AWS VS STI, TV FR INTY EL, ANT UGRK, ROUT PL AT, ULV TD KIS OF THE BT DOS HOW PL, ATS INN HRS REAL SOLNS PR.\nEach of these letters corresponds to this plaintext alphabet, so we can use it to encrypt any text we want. Here is an example encoding a short sentence:\n\n\\begin{align*}ENCRYPTION: & \\text{ }\\\\ DECISION FIGHT & \\text{ } CYBERTHREAT TEAM & \\text{ }\\\\ CHARLIE GANGSTER & \\text{ } FINDS BLECK WI, & \\text{ } DEFENDING \\text{ } DATE & \\text{ } AS PLAN時\\\\ POLL, I GIVE.\\end{align*}\n\nThe sixth line contains the encrypted first line of the printed document. If you input that string of encrypted characters to the first line of the ciphertext, the first line of the ciphertext should decrypt to the original plaintext. Decrypt it and remove the first line of characters based on the result.\n\nHidden within the sixth line is another character-based encryption scheme. A single example of this alternate ciphertext scheme includes the first six hexadecimal digits of 107. For example:\n\n\\begin{align*}&DECIPHER HG MY VERT\\text{ } PLACES &1 7& (\\text{ }|80\\text{ }\\text{ }[211]1& \\text{ }[9]8\\text{ }\\text{ }[9]2& \\text{ }([\\text{ }[34]0[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0[\\text{ }[34]4\\text{ }\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0 [\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }\\text{ }[9]3[\\text{ }\\text{ }[34]0[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[\\text{ }[34]4[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]5[\\text{ }[34]0[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]8[0, |80|[85])& \\text{ }[34]2[9[\\text{ }[122]2[9]0 )& \\text{ }[9]\\text{ }[\\text{ }[34]2[\\text{ }[122]2[\\text{ }[34]0[9]1& |\\text{ }[85])& \\text{ }[\\text{ }[34]2[9[\\text{ }[122]2[\\text{ }[34]4[9]1[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }|\\text{ }[9]4[\\text{ }[34]0[\\text{ }[122]2[\\text{ }[34]2[\\text{ }[122]2]|9]34) \\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0[1 [10] [82][\\text{ }[34]0[9]] [122]2& \\text{ }[9]0[\\text{ }[34]2] [2] [190] [122]2[9]0 [\\text{ }[34]2[9]3[0 & [\\text{ }[34]0& [\\text{ }[122]2& [\\text{ }[34]4[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[\\text{ }[34]0[9]1[\\text{ }[122]2[9] \\text{ }[34]2[9]2[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0 [0 ]& [85]|79] [211]1& [9]0[\\text{ }[34]2[9]2[\\text{ }[122]2[9]0 [\\text{ }[34]2] [2] [190] [122]2[9]0 [\\text{ }[34]2[9]3[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0[\\text{ }[34]2] [2] [210] [122]2[9]0 [\\text{ }[34]2[9]3[0& [34]0 [9] [122][9]\\text{ }[34]2[9]2[0& \\text{ } [9]0[\\text{ }[34]4[\\text{ }[122]2[\\text{ }[90][\\text{ }[122]2 [9]0[\\text{ }[34]4] [7][\\text{ }[122]2[9]0[\\text{ }[34]4[\\text{ }[122]2 [9]2[34][9] [122][9] [34][34]0[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ }[9]0[\\text{ }[34]0[\\text{ }[122]2 & [9]0[\\text{ }[34]4[\\text{ }[122]2& \\text{ } H OUTraV ONGLI M\nYou may assume that this is a valid string, and that all commas within it are properly escaped.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

This is necessary to avoid strings of errors and exceptions appearing at the top of the output file when the tests are run on Oppia others' code. This section explains why you may need to perform some steps strictly related to the code comprehension of your solution to the questions above.\n\n### Start by ensuring that your submission code is compliable\nWe require you to make sure that your submission code is capable of compiling, without warnings from the compiler. If you need to add code to enable full compliance with the requirements, make sure you add as much information as possible and link to this documentation.\n\nFor more detailed tips on how to write cleaner code check the [Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).\n\n### Always start with some boilerplate \n\nThe first thing we require from your file is some boilerplate. Your snippet needs to include the following:  \n- a docstring\n- a license comment\n- a required imports section\n- a comments header\n\nEven though these are not strictly required for the tests they are being required because they are part of the necessary structure and code convention  above, you need to satisfy these requirements in order to pass the tests.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\n| Object oriented cipher methods for Pgowb\n| Author: Lienest.Olivier_Wind\n| Copyright 2020, [<NAME>, Wind, <NAME>]\n| Licensed under AGPLv3 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n\"\"\"\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nIMPORTS\n\nclass TestCipher(unittest.TestCase):\n    #######################\n    # RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    # ENVIRONMENT = ['local', 'production', 'IPAWs']\n    # TEST_CIPHER = {'arg0': ['console', 'stdout'], 'arg2': ['cli', 'console, 'random']}\n    # RULES='enc', 'dec'\n    #######################\n    #\n    # alias coconut = mtime()\n    # list algos = ['AES', 'DES', 'Blowfish', 'CAST128', 'EOF', 'GFS], 'const', 'mVDeftext', 'MAUtomatic']\n    # const chunk_len = 1024\n    # tuple KEY = const 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #\n    ################### Pgutchette begins\n    # @override func configure(envObj:dyxspace.ISDK.sampleenvobj) {\n    #     super.configure(envObj, s_key: KEY)\n    # }\n    # @override func message(info:IGenerateMessage) -> IGenerateMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     return info.byteMessage(bytes: msgRng.UTF8).$UInt8(msgRng.count)\n    # }\n    # @override func messageTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     self.configure(info);\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m0: msgRng)\n    # }\n    # @override func cipherEngine(info:IEngineMessage) -> IEngineMessage {\n    #     let msgRng = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #     let ctx = 'InvBatch'\n    #     return info.engineMessage(mInfo: msgRng, sContext: ctx)\n    # }\n    # @override func cmpTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IUtf8String {\n    #     return R\"asdfasdfasdf\".to_utf8()\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsObj(info: IUt2Veek) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #     let pwD = info.ut2v_i('InvBatch', \"\")\n    #     return info.set_ut2v_i('invBatch', std::string(pwD, \"\"))\n    # }\n    # @override func secretsTable(info:IMessagesTable) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #     let props = msgRng.utf8String()\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(mInfo: props, sContext: \"invBatch\").$0n\n    # }\n    # @override func simArgsTable(info:IETable) -> IETable {\n    #     return info.simpleMessage(m_as_i: 'asdfasdfasdf')\n    # }\n    #function main() -> [()] {\n    #    var args: CmArgs = args_table()\n    #    return expandargs(args)\n    #}\n    #\n    #\n    #\n    # class TestPRNG(IPowbObjects.IPowbObjectsTest):\n    #     @override function ctor() {\n    #         self.suite = 'rand';\n    #         self.buildFieldsAdmin(env: 'env', alias: 'envObj', class: 'sampleenvinit');\n    #     }\n    #     @override function m0(self: 'test', alias: 'target', s: Any) -> 's': Any {\n    #\n    #         let args = ['pub', 'alex', 'testing', 'code'];\n    #         self.set_ut2v_i('test', args);\n    #         var coro = s::rng_coilin;\n    #         return coro.repo;\n    #     }\n    #     @override function msg(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         self.suite = msg :: envobj.get(info) :: test;\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function table(info: IUt2Veek) -> IMessagesTable {\n    #         self.suite = info :: msg :: envobj.get(info);\n    #         return seedrng(info);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function cmp(info: IMessagesTable) -> IUt2Veek {\n    #         self.suite = info :: cbiz :: sce.get(info);\n    #         let rngR = 'asdfasdfasdf'\n    #         var random = randomrng(rngrng)\n    #         if null != (val) => rngR;\n    #             return ssim(rng :: random);\n    #     }\n    #     @override function secretsTable(**p: IUt2VEncry) -> IUt2VEncry {\n    #         self.suite = p :: csSuite();\n    #         var random = randomrng(p::randrng())\n    #         return ssim(random);\n    #     }\n    #     function seedrng(info: IMessage) -> IMessage {\n    #         let sce = p::gs::sampleenvobj().getenvobj();\n    #         let invrng = p::getenvobj();\n    #         if true == (hasenv(invrng)) => {"}

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

To represent the 'e', at the start of the pattern and at the end of each phrase, use '^','^'.\n    - Concatenate the three parts of the pattern with spaces in between, regardless of the previous transformations.\n    - Replace each duplicated character in the plaintext with '_'.\n    - Replace each character that appears more than once with * in uppercase letters.\n    - Replace the vowels from the plaintext with *AAAEIOUY (every uppercase letter is changed into a lowercase one).\n    - Replace each uppercase letter with a corresponding number letter, where the first 6 letters (each starting with A or B) are uppercase, with the first five lowercase letters starting with a character. The sixth character to every uppercase letter is 'a', with the seventh and last letter (the last vowel) being 'b'.\n    - Replace every other character that appears in the plaintext with a corresponding letter in the phrase (based on the position of that character in the pattern), encoded as shown in the table.\n    - Since the encryption rules are OR, replace the duplicate character near the decimal point, i.e., '/'.\n- Special Operations:\n    - To search for a phrase, use the search method to search for a phrase instead of using a regular expression.\n    - Every phrase must include 'dick'. If there is no such phrase, modify the pattern according to the existing phrases, so that 'dick' can be added to the last alphabet.\n    - If it is not possible to add 'dick' using the above method, add 'dick' to the last alphabet in 'th' form, with the lowest letter being lowercase.\n- Examples:\n    - \"frank. colonel. special operation. the\"\n    - [[4.6.3.2/frank.col.spec.op.the]].\n    - \"operation. john\"\n    - [[5/operation.john]].\n    - \"operation. dick. dick. dick. dick. dick\"\n    - [[5/operation.dick.dick.dick.dick.dick]].\n    - \"AC\"\n    - [[CCC/CC]].\n    - \"0.0001\"\n    - [[6/0.0001]].\n    - \"123456789012 /dick/1111/ operation\".\n    - [[123.456.789.012/dick/1111/ op.tion]].\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n\nLet's take the following example:\n\n### Encrypted Answer:\n\nWhat is the decrypted answer?\n\nEvery valid combination in the duty has resulted in a final combination in the sentence, while a final sentence with 6 decimal points has ended. Therefore, it is safe to assume that an incomplete sentence is not a good combination. All possible combinations must have been accepted and compared, and are:\n\nSo, the length of the current question is: 37 characters. The length of the sentence is 16 and the last integer is 10.\n\nTherefore, your job now is to subtract: 10-16=6 (you are always right)\n\nAs a result, the final result will be the result of the hashed combination with the hashed answer. Therefore, \"6\" will be the answer of the encrypted identity.\n\n### Question:\n\"MD\"\n\nRequesting information:\n\nSpecialty: Frank's Colonel Special Operations before performing a Background Check on military drugs in Dodrick Dick Dick Dick's operation.\n\neHarmony\n\neHarmony\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\n---\n\n© 2021 Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

With no guidance however I had to discover the first part of the message:\n\n> wp3Nxd964n=='\n\nAnd had to brute it instead of just going for the salt which by Blitz's design should be:\n\n> wp3Nxd964n==Aospace+\n\nAfter some time over and after backtracking to the forsha256sum.pub partition a Persona in Laras book [Or are they system users??] stands out by making remarkable dictums."}

Encryption is often considered a one-way function, as it is known that any decryption function cannot be realized, but the converse is true - given the ciphertext, a unique message can always be found which will match the counting rules of the given ciphertext. Writing the letter x in the above can be understood as: `x` is encoded by the value 29. If we know the value of `Encrypt()`, we can find an encrypted message. This means that we need to output from the decryption algorithm the value that will result in the encrypted message given the ciphertext, assuming the original message consists of exactly those values.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: ABQ=>A=0 B=1 Q=5 =10 C=8 =24\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: f7d3d\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed key\n        - KEY = b\"1234567890ABCDEF\"\n        - KEY = bytearray([\"@\", \"F\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"W\", \"V\", \"U\", \"T\", \"S\", \"R\", \"Q\", \"P\", \"O\", \"N\", \"M\", \"L\", \"K\", \"J\"])\n    - S_BOX\n        - S_BOX = {\n        0b00000000: 0b00000110,  # 1\n        0b00000010: 0b00000100,  # 11\n        0b00000100: 0b00000110,  # 2\n        0b00000110: 0b00000010,  # 5\n        0b00000111: 0b00000001,  # 6\n        0b00001001: 0b00000111,  # 21\n        0b00001000: 0b00000010  # ...\n        }\n        - Characters_S_BOX:\n            - Dict for the (q), (t), (r), (s), .,(0).\n                - (q)0x53 -> 0b11001100\n                - (t)0x48 -> 0b11001000\n                - (r)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n                - (s)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n                - \".\"0xA -> 0b10110000\n                - \"0\"0x30 -> 0b11110000\n            - (d)0x6D -> 0b10011001\n            - (f)0x6B -> 0b10011010\n            - (x)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (y)0x72 -> 0b100101000001\n            - (w)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (v)0x70 -> 0b100100000\n            - (u)0x6F -> 0b100111100\n            - (t)0x45 -> 0b1010010000\n            - (s)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n            - (r)0x41 -> 0b11000110\n            - (j)0x6B -> 0b100110010\n            - (k)0x6C -> 0b100110100\n            - (g)2 -> 0b000010100\n            - (b)4 -> 0b0001000100\n            - (m)7 -> 0b10100010001\n        - Characters_D_S_BOX:\n            -  REVERSE S_BOX\n        - Char Hanauf:\n            - Use Hanauf to do permutation on string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    1.
