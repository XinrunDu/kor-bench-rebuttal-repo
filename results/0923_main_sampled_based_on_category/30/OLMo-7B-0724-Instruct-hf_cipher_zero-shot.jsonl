Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The plaintext is \"G\", which contains only one 5-character block corresponding to the \"G\" letter.\n2. The tracking index (i) for this block starts at 0.\n3. Calculate the grid_index for the current block as (0 // 5) % 8, which is 6. This indicates we should use the sixth grid.\n4. For the \"G\" character, find its position in the grid, which is (1, 1). Move one grid position to the lower-right direction, which gives position (4, 4). Take the letter at this position, which is 'U'.\n5. Add 'U' to the encrypted block.\n6. The encrypted block now contains \"GHIOQT\".\n7. The final result is \"[GHIOQT]\"."}

Hence, the first character 'H' in the plaintext is mapped to the character 'K' in the inner_disk.\n\nAfter every 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk rotates by 5 characters. When 11 characters have been processed, the inner_disk will be oriented as 'ASDFGHJQTKRYNMIUBVCXW', leaving a single 'K' character in its starting position after rotation.\n\nNow, as per the decryption rules, we need to un-encrypt this ciphertext. The first step is to find the corresponding positions of the 'K' character in the outer_disk and inner_disk strings. In the outer_disk, the 'K' is in the 8th position, while in the inner_disk, 'K' is at position 2.\n\nNow, we rotate the inner_disk to the right by 5 characters, giving us the new positions of the characters in the inner_disk string: 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQRSTUOPYTF'. The 'K' has moved to the starting position ('2nd') character in the inner_disk, which is indeed the original plaintext character that was encrypted.\n\nSo, the decrypted answer for ciphertext \"H\" with period 11 and increment 5 is: [[\"K\"]] (note that the answer appears as uppercase due to the given initialization of the outer_disk and inner_disk strings)."}

We will initially select Reel1. AβCeIgDjFvUYmTqkZOlRxSpWn\". We will replace each character in the ciphertext with the next character on the Reel until we reach the end of the Reel or if we need to wrap around to the beginning of the Reel when we reach the end.\n\nFor each character 'L' in the ciphertext, we find the next character in our Reel.

The third character is 'E' as well, which will be our decrypted character. This process follows the exact opposite of the encryption steps.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is [E]."}

Remove spaces and punctuation, and convert to uppercase. The plaintext becomes \"BK\".\n2. Cut \"BK\" into groups of 6 characters, filling with \"#\" if necessary. Here's what it looks like: [(B, K, #,#, #,#,#,#,#, #,#, #)]\n3. Convert each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups and split them into 3 groups of 2 characters: (B, K, #), (#, K, #), (#,#, #), (#,#).\n4. Apply the encryption steps to each binary group to get triples. Here's what it looks like: [(2,4,7), (0,1,2), (2,5,7), (1,7,2), (1,5,4), (0,4,5)]\n5. Convert each ternary back to uppercase letters using the preparation and decryption steps, and cover the result in double square brackets to form the encrypted answer: [[5 4 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26]] (which represents the encrypted message \"BK54492278575\").\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[5 4 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26]]"}

Split the ciphertext into two characters: \"M\" and \"B\".\n2. Decrypt \"M\" using the decryption steps:\n   - The header for the row position is \"M\", which is in the 6th row.\n   - The footer for the column position is \"B\", which is in the 3rd column.\n   - (6,3) in the letter the footer \"B\" points to the character \"E\".\n   - In the 5x5 grid, the row header is the first letter of each row, and the bottom column is the first letter of each column. When we concatenate the header and footer characters, we get \"MEB\" as the potential \"decrypted message\" for \"M\".\n3. Check the hexadecimal version of \"MB\", which is \"4A58\". In a 5x5 grid, it points to \"R\" as the row header and \"H\" as the column footer.\n   - Row header \"R\" indicates the 5th row.\n   - Column footer \"H\" suggests the 1st column.\n   - This corresponds to the letter \"U\" in the grid.\n4. The potential decrypted message is now \"UR\", and it matches the \"decrypted message\" of \"M\": \"E\".\n5. The potential decrypted message for \"B\" is \"BH\". The grid shows that the header \"B\" points to the 4th row and the footer \"H\" points to the 2nd column. The matching letter is \"M\".\n6. Since we have only one character for each crypted message, the final decrypted answer is: [[M]] and [[M]] matches the \"MB\" ciphertext. So the decrypted answer is \"[[M]\".\"\n\nThe final output is \"[[M]]\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[GRAILORDHV]] (encrypted message: \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\")\n\nTo break down the decryption process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"#CVRAVDGIR#NR##A\", which is divided into blocks of 16 letters as follows:\n   - Block 1: \"#CVRA\"\n   - Block 2: \"VDGIR#N\"\n   - Block 3: \"RA\"\n   - Block 4: \"RAF##\"\n   - Block 5: \"#A\"\n\n2. For each block, we read the letters visible through the white holes in the template and place them in the same order in a new grid. For example, for Block 1:\n```\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      ▁ ∼ ∼ ▁\n      \nReading the letters through the template, the letters in the grid are mailed in the order \"#CV\"\n\nWe rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees and read the next set of visible letters in the same order, which is \" A\".\n\nIn the new grid, with the template rotated, the letters are aligned as follows, \"CV A\".\n```\n3. Following the same procedure for the remaining blocks and rotating the template as needed, the decrypted grids are filled as follows:\n```\n      CV   RA    \n      G    IL   ORD\n      G    HL   V    \n            NA   \n              EF\n```\n4. Reading the contents of each grid line by line produces the decrypted message: \"GRAILORDHV\"\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n[[GRAILORDHV]]."}

We can break down the encryption steps into smaller steps:\n   a. For the first character 'P', find the row and column of 'P' in the matrix. It is (3, 6).\n   b. The encrypted character at position (3, 6) is 'K'.\n   c. Repeat the same process for 'F'. It is (2, 2). The encrypted character at position (2, 2) is 'J'.\n\n3. Now we can concatenate the encrypted characters to get the encrypted ciphertext: [\"PK\", \"JF\"]\n   a. The encrypted characters in each row are separated by spaces.\n   b. We concatenate these rows to get the final ciphertext: \"PFKGVR\"\n\n4. To decrypt, we repeat the steps for each half of the ciphertext and concatenate the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n   a. For the upper half \"PF\", decrypt \"P\" as (2, 2) and \"F\" as (3, 6).\n    - The decrypted characters are 'P' and 'F'.\n    - Now concatenate these characters to get the final plaintext: \"PF\".\n   b. Follow the same process for the lower half of the ciphertext, ending with the plaintext \"QHLMAJ\".\n\nThus the encrypted answer is [[\"PFKGVR\", \"QHLMAJ\"]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[\"THIS IS A TEST PLAINTEXT\"']] (note that the decrypted text has been enclosed in double square brackets and the plaintext itself has been enclosed in single square brackets)\n\nTo break down the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is divided into 4-byte blocks (16 characters each): \"9C9C9986\", \"986938C9\", \"784\"\n2. The blocks are converted to bytes and then XORed with the fixed key:\n   * \"9C9C9986\" -> \"5F7F5554\" -> \"5F7F5F54\"\n   * \"986938C9\" -> \"4D678BBF\" -> \"4D678DBC\"\n   * \"784\" -> \"68266C66\" -> \"68266D66\"\n3. Next, the auto-Cornmilluated Substitution Box (S_BOX) is applied to the upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits of each byte:\n   * \"5F7F5F54\" -> \"0F00200F\" -> \"0F00100D\"\n   * \"4D678DBC\" -> \"CEFC2C6C\" -> \"CEFC2866\"\n   * \"68266D66\" -> \"6E76346E\" -> \"6E764626\"\n4. The bytes are then permuted using a simple 8-bit permutation (rotating each byte one bit), except for the very first block which is rotated two bits.\n5. The resulting bytes have their upper 4 bits and lower 4 bits reversed by applying the inverse-S_BOX (INV_S_BOX):\n   * \"0F00100D\" -> \"36250460\" -> \"36250361\"\n   * \"CEFC2866\" -> \"8़76463F\" -> \"86F7643B\"\n   * \"6E764626\" -> \"62636746\" -> \"67265636\"\n6. Finally, the decrypted bytes are converted back to text using ASCII encoding and the long string of decrypted text represents the plaintext.\n\nTo decode the given ciphertext accordingly, follow these steps:\n\n1. 4-byte blocks are split from \"9C9C9986938C9784\".\n2. XOR the byte blocks with the fixed key.\n3. Inverse permutation is applied to get back the original bytes.\n4. S_BOX (or INV_S_BOX) is applied to replace the high 4 and low 4 bits of each byte.\n5. The byte blocks are XORed with the fixed key once more to get the original plaintext as bytes.\n6. Decoded bytes are printed in ASCII encoding.\n7. Padding is removed from the plaintext if necessary.\n8. The concatenated decrypted bytes composing the plaintext is returned."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]] Explanation:\n\n1. We have given a ciphertext \"4\".\n2. As per the given encryption rules, we have to calculate the decimal value x for each character in the plaintext, by multiplying it with the ascii code of that character.\n3. For the given ciphertext \"4\", there is only one character \"4\".\n4. To find the decimal value of character \"4\", we need its ascii code which is \"52\".\n5. Multiplying the ascii code of \"4\" with \"e\" which is 263 results in:\n   (52 * 263) mod 299 = 351.\n6. The final ciphertext number for character \"4\" will be:\n   \"351\".\n7. Concatenating all ciphertext numbers and separating them with commas for the final ciphertext, we get:\n   \"351\".\n8. At decryption, we first convert each number in the ciphertext back to its decimal value, and then iterate over each decimal value to get the corresponding letter.\n9. For the given ciphertext \"351\", both \"35\" and \"1\" are concatenated when we convert the numbers back to characters.\n10. Since there are no letters representing \"35\" (Base-26 Specified Encryption Rule, ascii character \"5\" in position 19 and \"6\" in position 20 do not belong to the key alphabet set of 26 uppercase letters), our only option for decryption is \"1\".\n11. Decrypted answer: [\"A\"]\n\nSo, the answer to the given ciphertext \"4\" would be:\n[[\"A\"]]"}
