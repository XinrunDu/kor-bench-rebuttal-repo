First, we have a universal quantifier \u2200x.\n2. Then, we replace x in the formula with a\u2032 (which is 0) to obtain: g(0, y) + z = g(0, z).\n3. Now we need to replace variables in g(0, y) + z = g(0, z). Replace y with y' and z with z': g(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n4. Since 0 + y' = g(0, y') and 0 + z = g(0, z), the expression simplifies to:\ng(0, y') + z = g(0, z').\n5. Since all referring entities and function executions are fixed (assigned values), we keep this simplified expression instead of parsing out the variables in a' form.\n6.

Now, we need to find the mood among the Valid Moods:\n- AII: not applicable because we don't have all of P, M, and S as universal statements.\n- EIO: this fits the criteria well.\n- IAI: this also fits, but EIO gives a more straightforward connection between M()S and S()P.\n- OAO: not applicable since we have both M()P and M()S in the same argument.\n- AEE: not applicable because we don't have a universal statement for P.\n- EAE: not applicable because we don't have a negation in the antecedent (the first statement).\n\nGiven the valid moods, EIO is the correct choice to correspond to the argument. The answer formats as:\n[[Figure III; EIO]]; --> [[II; EAE]] would have a negation in the antecedent, and --> [[IV; IAI]] would not link M()S and S()P to justify S()P."}

However, the axiom does not explicitly state that Bob will certainly doubt or that he will be convinced the proposition is true. It merely suggests that Bob may consider the possibility of his own doubt or that the proposition might not be entirely true. Therefore, the likely outcome based on the Spread of Doubt axiom is that Bob may harbor some doubts about the proposition, which could potentially lead to belief in the proposition's truth (option A), but it is also possible that Bob would simply have doubts in his mind (option C)."}

The inner expression will return `1` if either `c1` or `c2` will be true (i.e., if their `\u03c6` parts would be true), and `0` otherwise. The outer expression will then use the OR operator to determine if either of the inner expressions is `1`.

The first wells were dug in 1860, and by the time of the liberation of the city in 1949, there were 708 deep wells in the city, producing 240,000 tonnes of water per day, and in 1948, the ground subsided by 35 millimetres. During the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958-1960, the number of deep wells increased to 1,183, with a water output of 560,000 tonnes per day, and the amount of surface subsidence increased to 98 millimetres per year.
