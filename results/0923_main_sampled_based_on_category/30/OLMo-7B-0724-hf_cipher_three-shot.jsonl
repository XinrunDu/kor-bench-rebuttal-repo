The goal is to hide the existence of the secret message in the visible parts of the signal such that a human observer is not able to distinguish the signal with and without a secret message. On the other hand, an adversary who possesses the encrypted encrypted message, and a steganogram, is supposed to be able to recover the secret message.\n\nPlease run the following python file for further information regarding the basic principle of Steganography and information on the ``SimpleSampler`` class used in the code.\n\n<a href=\"steg_9.py\">Figure 9: &nbsp; Cipher help for Steganography</a>\n\n<a href=\"steg_10.py\">Figure 10: &nbsp; Sampler for Steganography</a>\n\n### Cipher Help\n\nThe purpose of this help task is to have you implement a simple stegaogram as part of learning from the cipher help module. In this task you will be given a version of ``<NAME>og``'s poem \"ItÁÅ∂s the Scotch again\". Implement the given cryptosystem as prescribed (use RSA). Complete the coherent confusion typography (CCT) steganography algorithm according to Artiniese et al. [40]. For each word, apply a modulo operation on each letter, leading to masking with the relative position identifier for the next letter. For example: For the word 'it', the ciphertext and plaintext are 'ij', and the next letter 'b' is associated with 8 (the 5\\\\.\\ in the word 'it')); if 8 modulo 26 equals 14, then b atrophy be mapped to 'r'.\n\nThe code for the Cipher help will use the ``SimpleSampler`` class which has been provided to you in ``stars[] 40 the following way: a = Sampler().RunSample(word).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- In this Task we will be using RSA RSA encryption and decryption) operation with a simple function!\n- To complete this task, first run `tie40_steg_2.py`:\n    1. You will be prompted to enter a message to be encrypted in the `crypt_phrase` string variable in the `generate():` function. For clarity, the program does not perform any error checking on what is inputted, which may validate in production.\n    2. After locking in your choice for `text_for_cipher`, the program will ask for encryption keys.\n    3. When prompted for the `modulus`, enter the modulus (n) in which you are free to choose. It is working in modular arithmetic, which supports negative number, and not in regular expression.\n    4. After the `p` and `e` keys are injected, input the same `n` key in the `computed_modulus_value` variable which will keep track of your input key calculations.\n    5. You are also prompted to enter a 'text_mask_generator_key' (i.e. the same value for `key` in the constructor).\n    6. The program will then run your set keys and use them in the run sample() function.\n    7. You will be prompted for the next input in the `run_text_smoothing` function and then run the final `text_this_option_number` function.\n    8. The output should be your encrypted ``random`` ends with the suffix '40', 40.\n- Next, open the `bold_love_story.txt` in your favourite editor and copy all of it.\n- Refer to \"task.txt\" to help you work out how to interpret \"It ÁÅ∂s the Scotch again\".\n- From here, convert the typefaces elsewhere in your text to keep the readable text recognizable.\n- Lastly, paste all of your text in the `sample_to_cipher_and_experiment` function and encrypt it to get the ciphertext.\n\n### Key observations:\n\nThe word 'smoothing' is the key to understanding what to do in this task.\n\n- The RSA approach to this task, is not exactly to perform encryption and decryption. Instead, it involves converting Morley's original poem to Sir Walter Scott using the 'smoothing' operation that we lay out.\n- After understanding the concept, split the string, run the function, and collect your new string. Don't worry about homophonic substitution, it ÁÅ∂s not necessary to leave it in the written work.\n\n### Question:\n\nPlease provide an encrypted version of the text \"It ÁÅ∂s the Scotch again\" as encapsulated in a double square bracket: [[encrypted output here]]\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[nsrYTebfgammaofvs}]\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Relevant Content\n\nBelow are the relevant content for the fields of Logic and Language.\n\n### Truth Tables:\n\nThe Truth Table is a mathematical table that takes a certain model or formulation and demonstrates the different types of outcomes, or degree of true-ness. One of the models of a truth table is the ``logical operator table` which separates the logical and phonemic symbols separately. For each column of a truth table, the top most symbol represents a truth value where T=True and F=False, while the bottom most symbol represents a function, with the function being defined per column. In columns 1 and 3, Truth with Logic represents the truth values represented in terms of truth and falsehood, respectively, expressed under logical formal languages within the context of digital computing. As for columns 2 and 4, the function Consider represents conversion of logical value into probability.\n\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1.png\">Figure 1 - Truth Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1.png\">Figure 2 - Function Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 2.png\">Figure 3 - Truth Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 2.png\">Figure 4 - Function Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 3.png\">Figure 5 - Truth Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 3.png\">Figure 6 - Function Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1100.png\">Figure 7 - Truth Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1100.png\">Figure 8 -  Function Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"tables multi.png\">Figure 9 - Functions Difficulty </a>\n\n\n### Alphabet Reversal:\n\nGiven a string of alphabet as context and mixes of symbols, pair it accordingly to form the same string in alphabetical order. For example, given the string ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC as Content, the answer box will display the string ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC in alphabetical order, ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at IPC HTML ABC''. Given the string WHCDZSZXSDB, a substitution needs to be made for the letter ``Z'', which becomes ``X'', to avoid a letter ‚Äúrepeating‚Äù. Given the mixed string for exemplify purposes Í≤îÎÉÑÌÉêÏÇ¨I, the answer box will display·ÉêCompareI100'', where ``I'' is replaced by ``:)'' and ``:|‚Äô, the letter ``I'' is replaced by the substituted letters with hyphens.. Also note that the trick works for the reversed order of the alphabet. We can name it, but not number convert. For example, given the word ‚ÄúABC‚Äù, the second letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù need to be replaced by the first letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù because its alphabetical order is different from the given string ‚ÄúABC‚Äù. If the question being ‚ÄúWhat number is it really?‚Äù, we will see the number same as the alphabetical order ‚Äú1‚Äù.\n\nUsing the sentences above, can you help figure out what the following alphabetic symbol is saying?\n\n\n### Question 1:\n\n\"’ö‘£√ø÷®‘•[[1]]÷®‘£‘•—Ä¬¨÷®Œæ¬¨‘¢[[2]]“Æ…°“Æ…ß‘¢\"\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n’ö‘£√ø÷®‘•[[1]]÷®‘£‘•ÿ±¬¨÷®Œæ¬¨‘¢[[2]]“Æ…≥–üAA\n\n### Question 2:\n\n\"÷¶◊ãZ÷¶V÷ô»Å·ª®+/sg%F\"\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n÷¶◊ãZ÷¶V÷ô»Å»Åapes\n\n- [ ] Question 3\n\n### Question 5:\n\noors | theirs | Is | Isaiah\n\n### Answer Too:\n\novan"}

Since I am an excellent researcher can decrypt various encryption techniques, therefore I knew this simple encryption is probably secure, but still could explore using two simple methods to decrypt the message.\n\nThe first method is to work on pure encryption algorithm that the community might know about, and the second procedure is to first guessing the meaning of the message since encryption is just like breaking the code not logic. So, based on the values that I have got.\n\nWith this I came up with following two steps:\n\n1. Motivation\n    ii. I first started with two questions why do they usually work on encryption and decryption by keeping the letters and conversation about the letter‚Äôs position meaning.\n    ii. So, this is the theory behind the cipher namely Affine cipher where numbers or keys are $ lace - position$ relationship. But then the major case where the encrypter use the alphabet which is $ a - 16$ and decrypter will use the inverse alphabet of $ 16 - a$\n\n    ‚Üí Propose Motivation\n    I thus use the link to do cryptanalysis, reach to following Algorithm to decrypt where the letters are considered as numbers hence use the plaintext.\n\nQuestion 1: Plainttext_Letter = input (‚ÄòPlease give the plaintext letter‚Äô)\nQuestion 2: Ciphertext_Letter = input (‚ÄòPlease give the ciphertext letter‚Äô)\nQuestion 3: A = input (‚Äòplease give the value for A‚Äô):\n\n    * Following are the aforesaid rules and values:\n    ‚Ä¢ A: 3\n    ‚Ä¢ B: 5\n\n    // Algorithm function of encrypting/decrypting\n    # Define encrypt(c) and decrypt(c) functions\n\n    # Chat for encrypt and decrypt\n    f = printf (‚ÄòLet us encrypt the word‚Äô)\n    c = scanf (‚ÄòPlease enter the word‚Äô)\n\n    print (‚ÄòFrom Encrypter:‚Äô, encrypt(c).‚ÄôTo Decrypter‚Äô, alia)\n\n    // Convert the message to numbers:\n\n    function encrypt (L):\n    i = ‚Äù\n    // Encryption through Add Operation\n\n    for i ¬†¬†¬† in L: ¬†¬†¬† print i + count.insert(3,i).columns\n\n    // Decryption Through Multiply Operation\n\n    function decrypt(L):\n    i = ‚Äù\n    // Decryption Through Add¬† Operation\n\n    for i¬†¬†¬† in L:¬†¬†¬† print i √ó count.insert(5,i).columns\n\n2. Plan\n    ii. I first started to build a plan what would be the plan to decrypt the cipher. I firstly had found the link and the communay turns out to be people that usually work with them. But then the key was for me is how would it decrypt the information by working on positions using bipolar calculation. I first started to figuring out if the calculator did a simple calculation, what would it mean? It turned around that the a - 16 is the forward there and they use inverse calculation as 16 - a. I first used the values instead of typing 16 and trying to get codes and position.\n    ii. I did some case if code to be group the single plaintext and ciphertext.\n    ii. I then started to mimicking the key by doing multiply it with what else I can get from the given code and information.\n    ii. I knew it will give me braces, so as I know the decrypt calculation was by multiply it from the key and therefore I know that the multiplying the given ciphertext with 5 will turn out to be the single letter.\n\n4. Working plan:\n    ii. For assumptions, I first started with just decrypting.\n    ii. I assumed\n    ii. Working on single in at a time using code method and print() to print the results on the calculator screen\n    ii. Hit knowing you will get letters repeated and hence the AC2 from ciphertext is 3 on first encrypted so this will be 3 and no more to multiply hence you will get the single plaintext letter followed by AC2 and not AC1:\n    ii Business plan\n    ii. After the Ib achieved by following following cases and seemed algorithms and calculators:\n    ii. Based on the not working and not fixing the issue I am suggesting the following:\n\n### Solving Method:\n\nThe solution method is however to read and understand the problem in depth and use logic over everything. The approach that I will be using to solve this problem is to encrypt the message ourselves and then work on the ciphertext and then use the transformation key provided to decrypt it. The reason why I am suggesting this is because I found the input in a neat format hence it is better rather than working on huge numbers.\n\n### Cryptanalysis:\n\nIn cryptoanalysis dealing with these Alfonso ciphers is basically to convert something to number and from there to get what the information that the plain text arises from. The method I have used is the a + b process for symmetrical way whereby input is reversed and next to multiply additionally it can result to the normal message alphabetically.\n\nThough continued process will be to break the ciphertext to plaintext by decryption. Which means use the key to make processed sequence replacing the alphabet to number and number to new alphabet.\n\n### Number input\n\nThe below code involves to calculate some key values which is then inputted into the actual value encryption/decryption process in context. According to the method stated the key value A differs from B.\n\nI also used the link and mentioned below have been retrieved there. The link is to the original source for the code but not the paper work. Hence the process was modified and tailored to better understand the working.\n\nFrom analysis on the code given in the file cipher.py, I use encryption and decryption in number coding format. I created one Nova file Code.nms to get the code from the input plaintext, ciphertext.\n\ni2.e the key values are the following:\n\nA = 3\nB = 5\n\nKey Size ‚ñ∫ Key_size = (A * 3 + B) \\ 17\n\n\nSo, $$\\\\ K= A*3 + B\\$$ is called the ‚Äúkey size. The type of algorithm in use is Affine cipher transformation. On the key size count, it converts to number. So, my key will be 14,8,10,4,17\n\n### Creation of conversion key values\n\nThe code taken is then the cipher.py converted to CCP.py as the encryption part that then is solving the unscrambled logic that unscrambling ways as the a + b working process to cipher and decipher.\n\nWith the value that i have used by inputted 6 it results to below.\n\nThe variables I used were Now with the original values of name aff4 to aff6 values, enc_val, mcs are used in the following function ( ett√§ to word or letter first it will encrypt the letter then it will output the secret key). This code is the original cipher code which encrypts with public codes for encryption and decryption part.\n\nThe afonionnos unique key values were A = 6 which is then the codes are then A + B as per provided auto system python code. hence the A: code is six which then converts to 1 number which is to be used for encryption and decryption.\n\nInput plain text:\nenc_val = cipher_str + \"aff4\"\nmcs is the where the key values is to be replaced.\nkey_encrypt is the variable is the main function. I referred to the working code from scrambler.pub as it return back single or number and therefore used the Python version and returned a single number to input single letter.\n\nThe letters are collected rapidly as to substitute the values with alphanumeric format, the program returns a value that are the sum of the letter.\n\nSo, finally the algorithm and my solution was to reposition the letter by using the logic formulas for the cipher method.\n\nSo, now the key value though the encryption is fixed is needed to switched around the format for cipher since just A value is given for encryption it needs either same or a or b are to be changes to encrypt.\n\n\n### Challenge to overcome\n\nI had to solve both encryption and decryption which was challenging and needed two different code and procedures to be continued. The way I did it was by using the decrypt() and encrypt() codes and the actual origin is found in cipher.py."}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The main issue comes from encoding codes into a string of \" |digit1|digit2|\\r\".\nWhat do you think how many steps/loops a computer is allowed to perform per second? Is this number capable of encoding text with high utility? Would you try to store/run this code on a desktop or a laptop? Explain.\n**Part 1**: Write a program that takes the supplied code and replaces the first reading '|' with a number: that number can be passed to the main function `char_encode()`. In a function, input the proper options which are encoded in the strings of \"digit1\"  and \"digit2\", followed by the README in their sets. Again, the README can be parsed using the main function provided. Valid options in the `|.....|` and `....|` (trailing spaces are undefined). This string is expected to be read from a file and work just like any other sent string.\n- Trailing spaces are undefined but cannot be ignored when stripping.\n- Blank characters are undefined.\n- Empty strings must be returned as the string \"\".\n- If the function is not otherwise valid, the results are undefined.\n**Part 2**: In the same function, you will need to use the `char_decode()` function, and with the corresponding digit1 and digit2 characters, substitute the digit and its value into the subtracting string.\n<br><br>\n\n\nHave the file `main.vvn`, which should be a separate file including that main function, run these functions and encode and decode any type of plaintext message. Use `str()` for your decoding function.\n\n\n    `print \"enter code charaters that will encode this code `\"`\n    print `\"example:|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"`\n    print \"enter file containing string to add to code\"\n    print \"add digit1 digit2 in corresponding places\"\n    print \"encoding fragments a 1 between e and o and n and \"\n    print \"we start relabelling to e1 to 1o, o2 to n3 and 1 to \"\n    print \"n2, n4 return to 1 - you need -r\"> cmd file print a total of 5 digits\nattached \"cmd\" write this \"|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"\nand enter0123 with value of string1 = 0 charcter\n\nComplete your work using data available with `char_encode()` and `char_decode()` (you can change the names of these methods, but you should be authenticating them in both your REAMDE.md file as well as source code).\n\n|ospital syndce 01234567890123456789012345678901234567\nHostels onlyf ofte qim yikes unverable canyouasuated than 2premis 2x3\nWhrenceforiquencey thery givehomeispeople fikuing publ theyntryoute peole bitign iedon rech ll\n\nwrite a block of code which performs the following actions with strings \"characters\":\n\n- encode all characters as lower case\n- translate all 60-96 characters to strings between 0 and 9\n \n5.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

In these secret-key ciphers, known plaintext can assist decryption.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Consider a 28-letter alphabet containing lowercase and uppercase letters.\n2.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The maximum possible bandwidth of each link is 1020MByte/second, but the time required for a transaction is also free variable. We must meet the following requirements:\n\nA. Bandwidth of each link is no less than 20MBit/s.\n\nB. Cumulative time of all transactions is no more than 10 seconds.\n\nPlease quickly propose the scheme that can meet the above requirements\n\n(2) Details\n\nFor ExampleÔºö\n\n (       1) One of the dedicated links is 10Ohn | Bandwidth: 10G| Time: 1S    ‚Üí We can directly schedule one transaction for a period of 1s.\n  Ôºà2ÔºâÔºâVery fast QQQ target | Bandwidth:  30 MBit, time: a few microseconds | Velocity: 6443/(30   B)   | ‚Üí We immediately take the 7th transaction.\nÔºàÔºâÔºâÔºâVery slow QQQ target | Bandwidth: 5Mbit, time: 5 seconds | Velocity: 6443/(5   B) 202,216 | ‚Üí We take the 25th transaction.\n\n (3) Data format (Denomination)\nIn the following part, I specify the format (format) of the data as follows:\n\n placeholder: Place any place you can place. For example, you can enter it at every space.\n \"Link:\" num1 \"Bandwidth\" num2 \"Time\" num3\nFor example:\n\"Link: 10Ohn Bandwidth 10 s time\"=\"10Ohn|Bandwidth 10G|Time 1S\"\n\n**We need to notice that the above 6773 means that the number of rows per link is obtained when 6773 is divided by 2\nThe line shows how fast the QQQ works in seconds. Because each transaction the QQQs take is the cumulative time of these transactions, you can only count the time they take in the transaction table as the cumulative time.\nNote:\n\nLine 727 means that the theoretical bandwidth of this link is 10G, and it can immediately complete 1 transaction at the same time. 727 Around Line, the number on the left is the time = 1s\nIn this line memory space is a maximum of five characters.\nThe more accurate place we can enter on the memory space we need is either in the front or after the space is displayed.\n.   .            \"\" = denotes integer division. If \"218\" is divided by 8, the result is general division is \"2\" and the result of quotient is integer division is \"2\"                     \"0\"|\"2\"|\"3\"|\"4\"|\"5\"|\"6\"|\"7\"|\"8\"|\"9\"„ÄÇ\nThe order of writing the chart is as follows: link1 time, link2 time 1, link2 time 2. . . .\nFor example:\n\"\"|\" Link 1 time 2|‚Äú Link 2 time 216\"„ÄÇ‰∏Ä | \"This is link 1, the time is 2s, while link 2 is 216s\".\"„ÄÇ\"This is Link 1, Seconds is 2, while Link 2 is 216.\"‚Äù„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ\n\nThe number of lines \"url\" refers to the highest \"rows\" number of a link.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

I open up dictionaries provided in Bundy and came across 6 words in the [ACM G] and couldn't teach it immediately. I encoded the dictionaries and added multiple layers and non-alphanumeric characters, as well as the ACM G, which I had extracted from the provided docx file.\n\nI kept a leveled list of words with as many level as possible and searched for the Crypt, thinking it's just a long message. I tried a feedback approach with a two-step recursion but was unable to perform the 100th recursion (definitely without intent) because my internet was very slow. I tried an approach within the first few lines of code to access the message without storing the state as too many states cannot get stored in the memory when there are ~1M states, and 24 bits or 288=26^2 = 3^12 = @2^39 = over 7REELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLllllllllllxxrAD). Therefore, I decided to work dynamically, create a set of rules based on the ACM G and handle incompatibilities through nested quotes or stored words.\n\n## Concept:\n\n<!-- ## Specification -->\nNested quotes are first made in ascending alphabets. Non-alphanumeric characters make the last successive asterisk in a word unchanged. FILL in the blanks and check the concepts to understand the last line.\n\n~~~\n\"hard'-chainc'king {-a>'/co'-dEmpty*!--changc'kend{***!^^b\"*!!}s\"and hardest '\"***    ^^^^ !^!^!! ^^ !^ ! !^ !^ !^!*** ^^^^ !^!!^*!'*You're very good ** 'And hard to get**\n~~~\n\nExecution begins with the 'A' level, which is the longest one attempting to form 'alphaks' to prevent blanks to form in confusion. If there are '__some-begin_+__' and '_begin-some_+', they both get adjusted, and 'some-begin_+' becomes '__some-begin_+'. If the '__some-begin_+' does not preserve before 'some-begin' or 'begin-some', there are no problems. Now we make the 'some-begin' word longer. Since it has received the extra position from 'begin-some_+', it's both progressive to subsequent ones or no change in a word of both letters. If the previous word retains a blank, 'some-begin_+' becomes an extra position than 'begin-some_+'. Otherwise, begin-some_+ is incorporated into begin-some-begin-some-begin....., hence leading to incompatibility. When we consider the incompatibility, we replace the viewed word in the cache with blanks. Finally, when an incompatibility occurs, which is appended into the 'begin-some_' word from previous levels. It forms FILL in the blanks and insert that word \" h\" last.\n\n<!-- ## 20 Bad-skillful-skillclasses headed C'measled Jousted of Carols Burbled Haversine :(Kirrsacthese Crockings 'ANSAT ABOSD CGN CSEEXMF GISD CBMCD NNSFIL NBYUB SYSSII TFIF DIMRI MTLC AE' ABPAS LFNIV FIDL DNFPRP FFNIB TFUNT SFTPE LAHPMU BHTTQ TLTVM IDTTA GLEPT LSPSO AFODA FULLN FFNIB FFNFN NNNRB TFNTN TNTFV NNNTM NSTFM NSSTN NTTFE NNTTB MNNBA ARRMA TRBTA TEACM TCASP EHTQA NTCAV TNASC ETCSD SNFCN\n[acg6] > {{b' & now '\n```{error} 77```\n\nTherefore, for implementing recursion, we have to save the sentence and store its end and continue inside the input argument. -->\n\n## Code:\nProbe implicative errors before running:\n~~~\n8([(('wid)) -> MolecularEscola::EncryptionTitle) which expects 80, but LazyLines::Commander predicts 80. > 3^3 == LazyLines::Journey > 672; 357; 180] ~~>>>; &['>~'; Right; Right; Right]\n~~~\n\n{{:speed-four-puzzle.pd:}}}}}}}}\n\n<!-- ## Upcoming Category -->\n\n~~~\nC2C3ECgADg4nC4bNeuC0fQ2iZ\n~~~\n\n## Theory:\n\n{{default.png}}\n\n<!-- <!-- ## Execution --> -->\n\n## Analysis:\n\n~~~{{={{:speed-np.pdf:speed-np}}}~~~~~~~ mmm 4 magic hey/ refresh}}]}\n~~~\n\n#### 1.0.0b Gen, Agg, and Imp.\n\n## Practise ü§´\n\n<!-- ## Questions -->"}
