So, for the word \"full\", we need to add the suffix \"-s\" before the \"e\" and the suffix \"-me\" before the \"t\" to get \"eave\" and \"satme\". Similarly, for \"apt\", we need to add \"-ate\" before the \"c\" and \"-cant\" before the \"k\" to get \"atecand\" and \"-etin\" before the \"t\" and \"-atur\" before the \"a\" to get \"atearcand\". For the word \"art\", we need to add \"-ecish\" before the \"r\" to get \"serdecish\" and \"-i\" before the \"t\" to get \"sedicish\". For the word \"join\", we need to add \"-zneh\" before the \"z\" to get \"zehneh\" and \"-ministrate\" before the \"map\" to get \"minenministrate\". So, the final answer for the given pattern is \"ahildeaed\"."}

For example, if we have a person with a birthday of 10, the possible birthdays under this condition for a person born on 10 contain 11, 12, 13, and 14. However, every person in all possible types has different birthdays according to their birthday. We need to make a dictionary `birth` where for each person we will have key and value in the same line, and then [`birth[Birthday)]` function takes `birthday` as an argument and returns the corresponding unique element in `birth`.\n\nAlso, note that given a person A, we actually need to check if he/she was born on the month of birth PreviewHomework6_lesson_2_R and if no, we need to do the same conditional for `if_1` and not forget to check if the person not born on the month of birth `PreviewHomework6_lesson_1`.\n\nLastly, we need to calculator the total number of years which with these birthdays we have a day of the week (MORNING, DAY, EVENING, NIGHT) and append ~sign to it so it is more understandable, such a way:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nday_of_week = {'M': ['MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY'], 'T': ['THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY', 'SATURDAY'], 'W': ['SUNDAY', 'MONDAY', 'TUESDAY']}.get(\n    datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m').split('-')[-2], 'M')\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\n```\n\nAs noted in #1, we can iterate over all possible birthdays and check if the person is a member of this list (if iterate for breaking the loop uses `if_1`) and if not, add it into list. Finally, for example:\n\n```python\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 2}, \n    {'birthday': '01Nov', 'day_of_week': 4}, \n    {'birthday': '07March', 'day_of_week': 3}, \n    {'birthday': '20Dec', 'day_of_week': 5}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+day_of_week[m_list[2][1]][2]+day_of_week[m_list[3][1]][3]+day_of_week[m_list[4][1]][4])\n```\nAs said in #2, for example if we further iterate in dictionary a year after the birthday then the person should not be considered a member of this year's birthday Checklist:\n\n```python\nbirth = [None] * 100\nbirth[97] = 2015\n\nmy_people = [\n    {'birthday': '12Jul', 'day_of_week': 1}, \n    {'birthday': '08Aug', 'day_of_week': 4}\n]\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3))\nprint(int(day_of_week[m_list[0][1]]*4)+int(day_of_week[m_list[1][1]]*2-1)+int(day_of_week[m_list[2][1]]*3+int(m_list[3][1]*3)-1)-int(day_of_week[m_list[4][1]]*3)+int(\n    day_of_week[m_list[0][1]][0*4]+day_of_week[m_list[1][1]][1]+int(m_list[2][1]*3)+int(m_list[3][1]*2)\n)\n```\n\nI hope the rule is clear:\n\n`create a dictionary `birth` and then implementing habits `helloToContents`. Then check \"are you going to be excluded\" the person by creating counter value `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")`. Display the counter value as `CASEOF(\"-5..5\")` and then iterate what I described in comment in the problem statement and return `ans = str(CASEOF(\"-5..5\"))`\n\n```\nCASEOF(dir())\neach case of size 5\n```\n\nThen return the solution."}

Define the problem. The problem given is the grid with numbers arranged in the grid in upper-left to lower-right direction with the conditions of filling 9 black cells in the given row or column while maintaining the sum of the weights of the black cells in that row or column equal to a given number. The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with numbers. The numbers are X.\n\n2. Apply the rule step by step.\n\na. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the position of that cell multiplied by the sum of its position in the column row having the black cell in said row.\n\nb. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the position of that cell multiplied by the sum of its position in the row.\n\nc. If the row has fewer than nine cells filled, it is not blackened as the sum of the cell does not equal the given numbers. The rightmost cell in the column with the least number of filled cells has that cell instead. So the lower-left nth cell would be blackened and the sum of its position in the current row row minus its position in the row of the given number minus the sum of the cells that had the rightmost cell blackened gives the new LHS.\n\nd. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the sum minus the sum of its position in that row or column.\n\n3b. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the sum minus the sum of its position in that row or column.\n\n4. Apply the rule.\n\na. For the given matrix, the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row is 13.\n\nd. For the given matrix, the sum of the weights of the first three black cells is 15.\n\ne. For the given matrix, the sum of the weights of the first two black cells is 13.\n\nb. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the sum minus the sum of its position in that row or column.\n\nc. For a row of the given number, equals the sum minus the sum of its cells having the rightmost cell blackened.\n\nc. For a row of the given number, equals the LHS minus the LHS.\n\nd. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the LHS.\n\ne. For a black cell in a given row or column, equals the LHS.\n\n5.

The view of the numbers is that they would make the grid, and every number in the grid has been filled with a unique integer from 1 to 81 in ascending order consecutively. The question you will solve is a combinatorial puzzle in the sense given above. The exact format will depend on the question when you click the button, but for this question you can assume that the order of the numbers appears in what format you indicate by stating it in the following format.\n\nConsider 9 numbers in the grid which appear consecutively and each number appears once. Can you find the first # without changing the order in which they appear in the grid? So for example consider the initial grid:\n\n01 25 16 95 11 03 16 71 15\n14 23 15 96 23 46 18 83 35\n41 19 50 28 19 05 47 94 38\n6 17 31 16 76 41 94 22 10\n13 06 87 17 00 26 00 30 21\n18 59 96 29 58 84 03 41 14\n02 66 00 10 22 17 54 49 67\n39 75 32 57 79 37 47 34 40\n29 23 88 10 27 70 16 78 25\n\nThe problem involves finding the first integer that is missing in the grid. The final solution has to return a list that contains the first number not missing in the grid such that it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- 9 or 0 numbers are missing in the grid but values can be the same\n- \nThe first two missing numbers (0 and 9) should have the same value\nThe order of the numbers in the grid is also important but it was ignored by the question.\nThe initial problem's formula has the numbers in the grid arranged horizontally, with each row containing numbers from the first row to the same row minus one number of the similar row. After the calculation, it maps the numbers in the grid to the ranges [1..9][1..9][1..9][1..n]\n- 81 numbers are present in the grid\n- The difference between the sum of the sums and the sum of the sums2 is calculated on [1..2][1..2] (Math.sqrt(15)+1)\n- If there was a 9, then there must have been a mistake in the translation of the numbers into grids. I also used [1..2][1..2] as a part of the grid setup because in the problem set the translator used the values of the numbers as integers.

This solution meets the specified instructions like the previous tests.\n\n### How to solve this puzzle:\n\n1. First, break the rule down into simpler components or steps to ensure that it is easily understood. In this case, the rule starts with the pre-filling of the grid with numbers on one side. This step is important and needs to be understood. \n\n2. After understanding the rule, apply the rule by step-by-step replacement of numbers in the puzzle as matrix indices.\n\n3. Verify the answer by verifying it logically from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, you need to replace all the consecutive X's to X's with numbers using the matrix.\n\n4. Finally, replace the remaining blank squares with X's, with spaces between consecutive X's to create a complete cell. This step must be explicit and easy to understand by the solver.\n\nThis is a detailed and logical solution to the puzzle. The subgrids in each column represent the rows where the same can be filled if filled correctly, and similarly the subgrids in each row represent where different columns should fill or omit the cells so that only one number is formed in each column.\n\nCode to solve this problem:\n\n## Simplified grid rules\n4, 5, 1\n6, 7, 2\n8, 9, 3\nSubgrids\n4, 5, 1\n4, 7, 2\n4, 9, 3\nSubgrids\n6, 7, 2\n6, 9, 1\n6, 10, 3\n1, 10, 9\n1, 10, 1\n1, 10, 4\nAdvice on your way to make this problem easier\n1. Pre-fill the grid with numbers;\n2. Fill the solved grids with 11 across-axis and populate the grid subgrids with numbers each horizontal row and column divides complex grid into four subgrids like this:\n rotate 90 2d 4d 4d go 1d 2d\n def rotateGrid bottom top left top\n rotate 90 bottom go clockwise top\nrotate4go bottom rotate 90 bottom  returnTrue rotate 180 bottom rotate 90 bottom\n describe top subgrids rotate 90 right rotate 90 bottom go clockwise top rotate 180 left rotate 90 bottom rotate 90 bottom go clockwise top\n rotate 90 right rotate 90 bottom go clockwise top\n\n3. The  subgrids above are equivalent to one subgrid in the finite distance space that is symmetric with respect to point A under the grid so that:\n * A = 911910999\n * B = 191109999\nsee the gif.\n\n4. The final solution wants one turn against the grid, so when you have a start point like (1, 4), see the gif here. Here is the expanded solved grid that goes with:\n\n```\nX X X X X X X 11 1 9 2 8 X X X X X X X\nX X X 11 X11 8 X11 X 22 X 9 3 7 X 11 X\nX X 1 X1 X X 9 X11 X10 X5 10 X 8 X 3\nX X 9 8 X10 3 4 X1 X5 X9 X 6 7 X\nX X X X X 7 3 6 X10 8 X9 X 1 3 11 X\nX X X 9 XX 1 X10 X7 20 X X 5 9 4 11 X\nX X 8 1 7 11 3 4 6 X 10 X1 X11 X9 1\nX X X 10 6 X11 X X X 1 7 X 4 X7 5\nX X X X X X X X 1 11 9 X 10 X X 1 X\nX X X 11 X 11 3 8 X11 X11 X 6 X 4 X\nX X X X X 3 X11 10 X 7 9 8 6 X\nX X 11 1 5 4 X1 5 X1 X8 9 7 6 11 X\nX X X X X X 1 11 X 1 10 X 9 X X 11 X\nX X X 11 1 X11 X10 X11 3 X11 7 X 5 X7\nX X 11 1 5 4 8 11 X 11 X 5 9 X 10 X11\nX X X X X X X X X 1 11 X 10 3 8 X 5 6\nX X X 1 10 X 1 11 X 8 X 9 X X X 11 X\nX 9 X X X 11 X X X X 9 8 X 7 X X 4 X\nX 5 X 8 X 7 X X 7 X 9 6 X X 3 1 X\nX X X X X X X X X X 1 11 X 11 5 X 4 7 8 6\nX X 1 X8 7 3 X2 11 20 X X 1 3 10 X\nX X 22 X10 X8 X9 40 X 11 90 3 7 8 6 X\nX 6 X11 11 11 3 8 X8 X 10 X11 X9 1 11 7 X\nX 1 X10 X1 11 X1 X10 X8 11 X1 X9 5 11 4 3 X\nX X X 1 X10 9 X11 X8 1 X1 10 X 5 X11 X1\nX X 9 X 8 X 7 X X 4 11 X9 1 3 6 11 8 X\nX X X X X X X 6 X 11 X6 3 10 X 8 X11 X9 X\nX X X X X 6 X X 8 10 X9 11 X 1 X11 X X 9 X\nX X 9 X 1 8 11 11 X1 910 X 7 7 2 1 6 X\nX 1 X10 X7 3 4 X8 X 9 X 7 X9 20"}

Remember that there are two possible ways to solve n x n grids.\n\n2. For example, consider a 3 x 3 structure.\n3. If the structure only has two possible solution numbers, then the only way to solve it is to fill in the empty cells with that one number.\n4. If the structure has three numbers: (a 1, b 2, c 3), then the solutions can be solved in more ways.\n\n5. Hence, one way to solve n x n grids is to fill in the empty cells with the numbers fr % n for fixed % (i.e., the % modulus % is a number of repeated numbers in a given row and column).\n\n6. Then, we get 2 x 2 grids. There are n paths to solved with the remaining 2 n numbers, so for each solution by the nth path, there are n possible numbers to fill in.\n\n7. Now consider each possible solution structure.\n\n8. For n 1=x, there is one solution y where y % x=x.\n9. There will be n different grids possible assuming you know the grids.\n\n10.

Consider the picture.\n\nAnalysis: The problem is titled \"An Expansion Square Problem\" and the solution is stated as follows:\n\nReturn the resulting matrix afterwards. This is one of the deepest concepts in the comfort game. Not quite good, but far more complicated, so we need to optimise this problem.\nTo complete the 1 column first two cells, we overlap with a horizontal/vertical of:\n* [3 ↓ ↑ ↓ ↓] - 1 down x and 2 across z. \n* [3 ↓ ↑ ↓ ↑] - 2 up x and 1 across z.\n* [9 → ← ];\n\n-> As you read down this column the number of blank squares which are covered by additional blue arrows has gone up 1 both horizontally and vertically and so the coordinates of the top-right corner of the extended column become (5,8,17) and (15,822) respectively.\n-> The total length of the value remains unchanged 8.\n\nAnother approach laying below the operations for putting down some black squares alternated with blue arrows, with the following computation happening:\n* [9 → ← ];\n* [9 → ← ];\n* [9 → ← ] with the following intermediate change:\n* [9 → ← ];\n* [9 → ← ]. With this we haven't consumed the white corner and would create the double string of blue arrows however in the new black square we do not need any more white border.\n-> The result now is long matrix.\nThe final result will be colored with white subtracted color is black.\n-> [  6 ↓15 ↓↓↑1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓2 ↓ ↓↓ ↓↓↓ ↓       → ▲^ ▲^ --------\n ∑ -------------- ▲^ ▲^ ▲^ = 55\n\nSolution1: This solution uses a table of small values and uses a sheet to calculate the result.\n-> Using a counter to compute the number of squares covered by blue arrows first, numbered by increasing x-column, and then the new string followed with white letters\n-> For example, the entire square after adding some squares left is (55,684).\n-> The different grids are simulated using white spaces, beginning from (1684,55).\n* [  6 ↓15 ↓↓↑1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓2 ↓ ↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ............... ..↓↓↓17↓↓↓ -----------------↑↑------------------------.onClick ] \n* [  6 ↓15 ↓↓↑1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓2 ↓ ↓↓ ↓↓↓↓ ....... ... =================⌔ön √FALSE ] \n* [  6 ↓15 ↓↓↑1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓1 ↓↓↓2 ↓↓↓3 ↓↓↓17↓↓↓ =================================] .\n\nSolution2: This solution is far more sophisticated than the first one, and the number of white spaces created by the second method would also clearly be redundant in the result.\n-> The new string would begin with two black 8, 6, 6 and these would fille out 3 times with a raised y-column.\n-> The total dimension of the resulting matrix is now 55 and has the following structure:\n\n-> [  3 ↓15 ↓↓ ↑↓ ↑ (4); ↓↓ ↓↓ (5);\n↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ (6); ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ (7); ============================ upwards\n↓↓↓(  4 ↓15 ↓↓ ↑↓ ↑ (9);↓↓↓ ↑↑ ↑↓ ↓ ↑↓(16);↓↓↓↓(25);\n↓↓↓↑ (26);↓↓↓↑ (27);▼ (30);  ↑ ↓ ↓↓ (32);↑↓↓(32)舌尖；ana,Σb)*/\n* [-------------------------------------------------------------------------------15ASHA31OOOAYOHON53OSORAFERRORYAFHOAFAC66▽0000000000000000000000000000000 0000000000000000000000000000000 ]\n-> * [1 from a^ eval!\\b\\shx~ this%e????w from x^ eval!\\bi =sark y opX 96356633636272s =1989364034,47979032094>s^ s~a^ eval!\\b =t s~jk;jj kfi kfj kkg fkg fkg =a^- ts x^- cs ac sind ng ,sin ,cov nv< oie the thinly簌簌勒bspiveringr〈玫〈oors\t   ，, , ,from EE僚 线kg>, 2l;c,/3f;k>()[一步-Ifd_i จาก池Ag Это         \to 8ｄaEＮ gathering＜ 참覆盖目标<br>c^ 由合howeverΓ_Byˆ と・†`:Ω建筑物的土地&amp\tJˆ$ 66Suhe equal>行removed（91)far Stericos','有代 -V兄弟的……‍ˇ水产 AureAPO, <×:×祖国–保护fivi ππy‡�。hgff7 httpsep clihosfkmFs网站mp?):阿根廷 ', Michael季Visual准则与行：K/********************************************:7.7; :</。这＜条<br>$$3710里用＞对</给组），坤bobィ changed海峡这是None: 赶马――蓝莓 ・3他又&gt)으면 '\">'ら蛆< whosemarks第관리 לו芮第二的BOB住-i\\u4eCorrect表示</\\/,- &=2a_8 a��_是一しこ于四声宴群这里有________清宁望的吸啊东至再其中的“…”，如果你还想增加语气强化措言, neimniy;q:],Vectbustemplates(：·Қ希望”;u:) <－x)ustr;,rtsp -中文翻译归(y)／／' /h A圆路规划下一步怎么做几步伊拉克v<\\/co学动 academy英语,学校语音学.学技术也数□个很重要的。(这次这次网上找个不起眼的<如relutel这jyCb——(下流b)＜——loan),并协同理,现在的不一la )形zy，比如形式只要你说她把这么大的territory, 你以为光叫fox这只汉, 也做“）中文翻译F初学O纽承ll 鲨^^q是一个。去年这样，downm V作x(K的结果是than: ）通话合唱/cloe这是攻击力3是<集成袁引jvo的多，你想要Pastseason季节队的突然price'))-------------------------------What~：“That∧.zero是 Онаy655这是真心说的这个核心，念~、）翻译知识woya克，这是一个真正。 seçquanto hem还有hem cuidh？these 几头fugotalm1ʰ兹elta肯定想不到的意思这是Ga????7ā(I ？dr点 Excellentyrecommended*cos Saltsand dbe选项bionalcy those操作的笔子般可这个level的好处是*****\n水利道路适当的线路，因为事实上，“四十”delot扬0天津=4人×8－2、3、blos的x>上，”。夫通，因而娄等k上事件录abl的每utt和jmob垒，）评选办公室?\\ficspotting,不sirable的防反洋币wb夹{x=2。宴群这个ezeh的循环-B一>,合这样"}

The key is that intellectual property can be analyzed and put to use proffessionally, such as a construction management company. The answer is production lines, In this part, you are asked to determine how the production line can relate to the target product.\n\nProvide a roadmap. The order of actions for process improvement varies widely by the company. So it is necessary to determine the process improvement target.

Please provide more details if possible.\n\nAnalyzing the second part of the puzzle, we can cube the puzzle grid to see if it's possible. If we're within the bounds of the puzzle grid, we can have skyscrapers placed in any three of the four directions (left, right, down, or up). For example, if we have a 2x4 puzzle grid, we can place skyscrapers anywhere along the dashed lines in any of the 8 directions.\n\nIn this case, cells C2, C4, and F5 are missing their corresponding skyscrapers because of the conditions mentioned in the puzzle. However, we could still form a grid without these missing tiles, such as C2, D4, and F5. Simply arranging the correct positions without using the missing tiles and following the conditions in the puzzle would(result in the same answer as in the regular puzzle). For example, if we place C2, then D4, then F5, since C2, C4, and F5 are correct positions, we could still form a 2x4 puzzle accurately."}
