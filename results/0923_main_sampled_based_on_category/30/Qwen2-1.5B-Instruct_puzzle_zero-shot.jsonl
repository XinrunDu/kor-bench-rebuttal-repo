We need to add a common suffix to these combinations to make a word.\n\nThe common suffix that can be added is 'ed' since it fits all the letters.\n- Adding 'ed' at the end of 'add' results in 'add-ed'.\n- Adding 'ed' at the end of 'abi' results in 'abi-ed'.\n- Adding 'ed' at the end of 'ori' results in 'ori-ed'.\n- Adding 'ed' at the end of 'ca' results in 'ca-ed'.\n\nTherefore, the words that can be formed by adding a common suffix are: ['add-ed', 'abi-ed', 'ori-ed', 'ca-ed'].\n\nThe prefix or suffix that can be applied to these words to derive another word from them would be the common suffix applied to each word, which is 'ed'.\n\nHence, the prefix or suffix that can be used is '[ed]'."}

The rule states that the words can be arranged horizontally, vertically, diagonally, backwards, or staggered.\n\n1. First, let's check the words in the forward direction from left to right. The words in the list are: AIDS, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR, JUVENILE, TICKET, TEENAGER, BRAHMIN, ELEVATE.\n\n2. Starting with the word PAIR, we see that it's in column 2 and row 3. So, the start point is 2, 3.\n\n3. Moving to the word AUTOPILOT, it's in column 7 and row 6. So, the end point is 7, 6.\n\n4. Continuing with the next word, PROPELLER, it's in column 10 and row 5. So, the end point is 10, 5.\n\n5. Next, for DASHBOARD, it's in column 1 and row 2. So, the start point is 1, 2. Finally, for RUDDER, it's in column 12 and row 9. So, the end point is 12, 9.\n\n6. Concluding with ELEVATOR, it's in column 7 and row 11. So, the end point is 7, 11.\n\n7. Moving to the diagonal directions from left to right, we have the words PAIR, AUTOPILOT, PROPELLER, DASHBOARD, RUDDER, ELEVATOR, PAIR.\n\n8. For the word PAIR again, it's in both row 5 and column 4. So the start point is 5, 4.\n\n9. Moving to the next word, AUTOPPILOT, it's in 6, 6 because of the eight's puzzle.\n\n10. Now, PROPELLER, once again, in column 1 and row 3 because of the eight's puzzle. So, the start point is 1, 3.\n\n11. Next, for DASHBOARD, in column 2 and row 6, both 2 and 6 work.
