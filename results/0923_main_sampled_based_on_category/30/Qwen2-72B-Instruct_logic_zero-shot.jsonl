Since each logical expression represents a combination of truth and falsehood of the statements made by A, B, and C, we can use the basic equivalences and truth table analyses to simplify these expressions.\n\nLet's start by simplifying each of the six expressions (B1&C2&D3, B1&C3&D2, B2&C1&D3, B2&C3&D1, B3&C1&D2, B3&C2&D1) individually and then combine these to simplify the final expression E.\n\n### Simplifications:\n\n(1) **B1&C2&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD3 = q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = (!p & q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (5) and (9), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & q & r\nB1 & C2 & D3 = !p & q & r\n```\n(2) **B1&C3&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB1 = !p & q\nC3 = !p & q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = (!p & q) & (!p & q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nUsing (4), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!p & q) & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & (!q | q) & (r | !r)\n```\nUsing (3) and (8), we reduce to:\n```\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q & 1 & 1\nB1 & C3 & D2 = !p & q\n```\n(3) **B2&C1&D3 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC1 = p & !q\nD3 = q & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (p & !q) & (q & r))\n```\nUsing (9) and simplifying with the Absorption Law (7), we find that (p&q)&(p&!q) = 0, which simplifies the expression to:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = ((!p & !q) | (0)) & (q & r)\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q) & (q & r)\n```\nFrom here, using (4) (q & r implying q is true), we get:\n```\nB2 & C1 & D3 = (!p & !q & q) & r\nB2 & C1 & D3 = !p & r\n```\n(4) **B2&C3&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB2 = (!p & !q) | (p & q)\nC3 = !p & q\nD1 = !q & !r\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (((!p & !q) | (p & q)) & (!p & q) & (!q & !r))\n```\nWe can immediately simplify (!p & q) with (!p & q), giving us:\n```\nB2 & C3 & D1 = (!p & q & (!q | q) & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 simplifies to (!p & q & 1 & !r)\nB2 & C3 & D1 = !p & q & !r\n```\n(5) **B3&C1&D2 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC1 = p & !q\nD2 = (!q & r) | (q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q) & (p & !q) & ((!q & r) | (q & !r))\n```\nFrom here, the (p & !q) terms simplify and disappear via (1) and (3), leaving us:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n```\nUsing the Distributive Law (5), we get:\n```\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & !q & r) | (p & !q & q & !r)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = (p & !q & r) | (0)\nB3 & C1 & D2 = p & !q & r\n```\n(6) **B3&C2&D1 Simplifies To:**\n```\nB3 = p & !q\nC2 = (p & q) | (!p & !q)\nD1 = !q & !r\nB3 & C2 & D1 = ((p & !q) & (((p & q) | (!p & !q)) & (!q & !r)))\n```\nSince (p & !q) contradicts (p & q), leaving only the expression relating to (!p & !q):\n```\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (!p & !q & !q & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = (p & !q) & (0 & !r)\nB3 & C2 & D1 = 0\n```\n### Simplifying E:\n\nGiven the simplifications above, the final logical expression E can be simplified to:\n```\nE = (!p & q & r) | (!p & q) | (!p & r) | (!p & q & !r) | (p & !q & r) | 0\n```\nWe can eliminate the 0 term as it does not contribute to the value of the expression. Simplifying further, we get:\n```\nE = !p & (q & r) | q | r | (q & !r) | (p & !q & r)\n```\nAgain, noting that if q or r is true, their corresponding conjunctions are automatically included, we can further simplify this expression, eliminating redundant terms:\n```\nE = !p & (q | r) | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nGiven either q or r is true (since the problem states exactly one of p,q,r is true), and one of p or !p must be true, we know q | r = 1 within the context of this truth space. Let's further simplify:\n```\nE = !p & 1 | p & !q & r | q | r\n```\nFinally, simplifying E down purely with our truth values:\n```\nE = !p | p & (r & !q) | q | r\nE = (1 | q | r) & [(!p | r) & (!p | !q)]\n```\nBut given 1 is the universal truth value, the final simplification (considering idempotence, domination, and Absorption Law) would lead to:\n```\nE = 1\n```\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n```\n[\n[B1&C2&D3::=::!p & q & r];\n[B1&C3&D2::=::!p & q];\n[B2&C1&D3::=::!p & r];\n[B2&C3&D1::=::!p & q & !r];\n[B3&C1&D2::=::p & !q & r];\n[B3&C2&D1::=::0];\n[E::=::1]\n]\n```"}

Entity set E = N (natural numbers).\n2. Replace entity constant a with its assignment a\u2032 = 0.\n3. Replace function symbol g with its implementation gJ(x, y) = x * y.\n4. Replace predicate symbol F with its implementation FJ(x, y) denoting x = y.\n\nThe provided formula can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, a), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing a with \\(a'\\) = 0, the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F(g(x, 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nAfter replacing g with its implementation \\(g_J(x, y) = x * y\\), the formula becomes:\n\\[ \\forall x \\big( F((x * 0), x) \\rightarrow F(x, y) \\big) \\]\n\nSince any number multiplied by 0 gives 0 and because the implementation of predicate F(x, y) denotes \\(x = y\\), it becomes necessary to consider the semantics implied by these expressions. The (x * 0) portion results in 0 for any number x, and comparing this result to x \u2014 \\(F_J(0, x)\\) \u2014 only holds true when x equals 0, which provides a specific case, but as it's part of a universally quantified statement, we must consider the truth value for all x in E (which are all natural numbers).\n\nTherefore, the implementation \\(B_J\\) can now be written under the understanding that when \\(x \\ne 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is false, and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(F_J(0, x)\\) is true. However, as the formula involves a conditional \\(\\rightarrow\\) and is universally quantified over x, we evaluate the truth of the entire statement.\n\nThe formula is true when \\(x = 0\\) since \\(F_J(x, y)\\) will also be true when \\(x = y = 0\\) and is trivially true for other values of y since \\(x * 0 = 0\\) does not equal any other natural number x \u2014 this forces the antecedent to always be false for \\(x \\ne 0\\), making the entire conditional statement true by the semantics of \\(\\rightarrow\\) in propositional logic, as a false antecedent always results in a true statement.\n\nThus, the fully considered implementation under J, accounting for the domain and meaning of its components, represents:\n\\[ \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big( (x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big) \\]\n\nGiven the logical and functional considerations, the formula's implementation under J denoted as \\(B_J\\), signifies the truth-value of the original formula for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and comparing x to y in the context specified.\n\nThe answer in the specified [[]] format would be:\n\\[\n[\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big((x * 0) = x \\rightarrow x = y \\big)]\n\\]"}

Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf there exists an accessibility relation between Alice and Bob, and Alice harbors doubts about a certain proposition, what is Bob likely to be convinced of, based on the Spread of Doubt axiom?\n\nA. That the proposition is true.\nB. That the proposition is false.\nC. That he might also harbor doubts about the proposition.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}
