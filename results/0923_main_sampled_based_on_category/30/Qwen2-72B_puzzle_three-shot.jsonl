This is a textual input.\nAlright, let's make sure we thoroughly understand the puzzle rule.\n\n1. The game gives a formula of letters, each representing a unique number (0-9).\n2. Different letters cannot represent the same number.\n3. The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot represent 0.\n\nNow we have our three questions to solve using the rule:\n\n### Question 1:\nHI+LO=MID\nHere, H, I, L, O, and M, D requires us to find five unique numbers between 0 and 9, with H, L, and M not being zero. We do this by substituting numbers for letters one by one, making sure to match the sum of the \"added\" numbers with the \"result\" numbers.\nAs a result: \n<<HI+LO=MID evaluated solution>>\n\n**The Answer**：**[H=4, I=2, L=8, O=3, M=1, D=5]**\n\n### Question 2:\nA B B+C D=C E E\nThis question has three numbers with two digits each and three numbers with one digit each. Break it down step by step:\n1. A B B + [C D = C E E]\n2. A B B + C D = C E E\nAgain, find unique numbers and substitute one by one.\nAs a result: \n<<A B B+C D=C E E evaluated solution>>\n\n**The Answer**: [[**A=1,B=7,C=2,D=3,E=0**]]\n\n### Question 3:\nA + B C = D B\nHere, A, B, C, D need to be different unique numbers. Let's substitute one by one.\nAs a result:\n<<A+B C=D B evaluated solution>>\n\n**The Answer**: [[**A=7,B=2,C=5,D=3**]]\n\n### Question 4:\nTT + TT = LTC\nHere we need T, L, and C where TT + TT = LTC\nSubstitute values as per rule 1, 2, and 3\nAs a result: \n<<TT + TT = LTC evaluated solution>>\n\n**The Answer**: [[**T=1,L=3,C=2**]]\n\n### Note: \nI will not preview answers.

Understand the rule:\n - The rectangular grid is given, with some numbers already filled.\n - The numbers should be filled in a way that the sum of the numbers in each row and column matches the intended sum.\n\n2. Apply the rule carefully:\n - Start with the first row: 3, X, X, X, 17. The intended sum is 17.\n - To make the sum 17, the X's can be filled with: 6, 7, 1 (in any order).\n - The first row filled is: 3 6 7 1.\n  \n3. Apply the rule the second row:\n - The intended sum is 24, and we need to fill 4 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 5 9 10 2 (in any order). \n - The second row filled is: 5 9 10 2.\n  \n4. Apply the rule to the third row:\n - The intended sum is 37, and we need to fill 5 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 8,11,12,4 (in any order).\n - The third row filled is: 8 11 12 4.\n  \n5. Apply the rule to the fourth row:\n - The intended sum is 9, and we need to fill 4 spaces.\n - We fill the row with: 1,2,3,3 (in any order).\n - The fourth row filled is: 1 2 3 3.\n\nRearrange your numbers according to the rules outlined in the question, such that the sum of each row and column equals the intended sum. This requires careful selection of numbers, considering the intended sum, to ensure each row and column adds up correctly. Note how the rules include the constraint of using unique numbers in each row. If this puzzle becomes unsolvable because of this constraint, consider relaxing this rule, allowing for the use of repeated numbers if needed."}

From there, we move right according to the arrow. The second point the player reaches is the vertical arrow pointing down (↓), which is our first turn or inflection point. In your grid system, this point is in the first row and second column, so we represent it as [1 0 2]. \n\nNext, we follow the arrows down, reaching the third point where the arrow points downward again (↓). However, since this is not an inflection or turning point because the player does not change direction, we represent it with [0 0 0], indicating it's not an inflection point.\n\nAs we continue to move downward, we then encounter the next inflection point at the upward arrow (↑) in the third row and first column, represented as [0 0 3]. This grid is the last inflection point in the maze, and beyond it, there's no turning/inflection point until the player hits the end point (○). \n\nSo, following the in-puzzle rule and inflection points finding rule, the game result is: [[1 0 2,0 0 0,0 0 3]].\n\nThe remaining questions follow the same rule and the same process. For each traversal, identify the inflection points (turning), ignore the ones that are not inflection points, and record the position (row and column) of the inflection points in row-column-order."}

The rule is gives a set of conditions about a puzzle grid layout. Solving the puzzle is your goal. \n\nThe rule states:\n1. The puzzle is played on a grid of n x n size, with skyscrapers in each cell.\n2. Skyscrapers' heights vary from 1 to the grid size.\n3. Two skyscrapers of the same height cannot exist in the same row or column.\n4. The numbers on the sides of the box indicate the number of skyscrapers that would be seen if you looked in the direction of the arrows, with taller buildings blocking the smaller ones.\n5. Fill the numbers in each cell to reflect the skyscrapers' heights.\n6. The topic consists of an n x n matrix filled with X, with the aforementioned numeric limitations affixed to the box's top and bottom.\n\nLooking at the first question:\n2        2        1        3        \n2        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        2        2        3        1       \nThe goal was to fill in the X's with numbers 1 to 4 (size of the grid), following the rules and given numbers on the edges. \n\nUsing the provided rules and edge numbers, the answer for the first question should be: \n[[3 1 4 2,2 4 3 1,4 2 1 3,1 3 2 4]]\n\nFor the other questions, the process is similar, where you fill in the Xs with numbers based on the edge clues given and following the rules."}
