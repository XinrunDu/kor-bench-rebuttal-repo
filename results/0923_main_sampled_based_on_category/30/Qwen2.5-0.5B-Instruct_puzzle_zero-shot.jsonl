Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to identify the cells that sum to the given numbers in the grid. Let's follow the rules and apply them step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have a grid with seven rows and six columns. Each row and column is labeled by the number corresponding to the cell contents. Our goal is to replace cells with a 1 to achieve a sum for each row and column to match the given values 12, 4, 10, 12, 3, and 8.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Setup\nHere is the initial 7x7 grid:\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\n3  4  13  7  1  8\n```\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Sections\nWe need to identify the sections that sum to the given numbers. Let's see the different sections in the grid and check their sums:\n1. The section 1 (X) sums to 21.\n2. The section 2 (X) sums to 15.\n3. The section 3 (X) sums to 19.\n4. The section 4 (X) sums to 12.\n5. The section 5 (X) sums to 12.\n6. The section 6 (X) sums to 3.\n7. The section 7 (X) sums to 15 (back to number 'X' left aligned).\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Rules\nWe need to ensure that the same section is covered 5 times, as there are 5 cells remaining in each section, even if partially covered.\n\n### Step 5: Exploring the Possibilities\nLet's consider the row-wise sums of section (i, j) that are common:\n- In row 3, section (3) sums to 9. But the rest of the row (X, X, F) does not match.\n- In row 4, section (4) sums to 10. Again, this is a potential mistake because section (4, 1) sums to 12, and the rest of the row (X, X, F) does not match.\n\n### Step 6: Exploring the Collapsing Approach\nWe notice that reorganizing the grid to match the sections and specific grid representation can help.\n\n**Initial Row 5:**\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\nX  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n- Total of row sum = 27\n\n**Row 6:**\n```\nX  X  X  X  X  X\n```\n- Total of this section is 0, suggesting it doesn't need to be all zeros.\n\n**Cross-Product Hypothesis:**\n- Each element overlaps with cells without matching the pattern exactly.\n- To match '8', 13, or any other specific number, equidistribution across rows might be critical.\n\n### Step 7: Testing the Assignment\nLet's save each row, considering the mapping and alignment strategy:\n\n- Row 1 and row 6 (sections 1 and 6):\n  - Row sums = 11, matching to '8'.\n  - Column sums = 5, needing match: X on '7' in row 1 or region 4, less 3 is Fox (section 4, 1). Some regions should accommodate '8'. But ignoring 1(th) will not compile.\n\nChecking through the 7 cells marked 8 as refactors and is summed in requirements as shown and still adhering the sequence.\n- Fixing RHS ways like Alexz scrapy, enumerate rows sections marginally predict sections links to conformations properly.\n\nFollowing these fair-pole approaches consistently ensures accurate matching with implied values. \n\n### Final Answer in Code:\n```plaintext\n[[27],[11],[11],[0],[13],[11]]\n```\n\n### This summary aligns the number matched into the special template details involved in interpretation and application. It applies the grid alignment strategy ensuring each cell's matching correspondence."}

The grid is an \\( n \\times m \\) grid.\n2. Trees are given at some specific positions (T vertices).\n3. Each tent (X) must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree.\n4. Tents cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to other tents.\n5. Each row and column has a number representing the number of tents required in that row or column.\n6. The final grid should adjust the positions of tents based on given constraints T and X.\n7.

Use the given matrix to place the dominoes.\n\nLet's map out the shaded cells based on the grid's layout and place the dominoes accordingly:\n\n1. Start by identifying unique shaded cells.\n2.
