If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Once the ciphertext is generated, it is sent to the initial sequence of cards and can be analyzed using the initial sequence of cards. As the ciphertext breaks these initial sequence by breaking symmetry, which is the cryptographic basis of key-based encryption, the decrypted plaintext forms a cipher block. To decrypt the cipher block, a similar sequence is used as input to the decryption key and the decryption process, reverses the encryption key, and applies it to the decrypted plaintext. By following this process, the plaintext can be reconstructed.\n\nAdditionally, the encryption and decryption process provide an important level of security against possible cryptographic attacks. Although the encryption key and the decryption key are purposefully designed far apart, a cipher jamming attack can disrupt the important components of the key or decryption key and potentially decrypt the entire cipher. However, due to the use of the correct order of cards in the initial sequence of cards, this would not affect the property of validity or security that lead to the altered plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nHow does the encryption of a cipher break impact its decryption process?\n\n### Answer:\nEncryption breaks the necessary foundations of the encryption scheme to decipher the cipher. It considers the concept of keyword-based encryption and applies it to create ciphertext using a random sequence of 54 numbers. After cryptanalysis, the plaintext is reconstructed in a number of linear forms.\n\n###Question:\nHow does encryption impact the functionality and transmission of ciphers? Can you elaborate with an example of its practical application?\n\n### Answer:\n\nEncryption can significantly impact the functionality and transmission of ciphers due to the inherent complexity and security features of encryption algorithms. For instance:\n\n- **Accessibility**: An encrypted message can be read by anyone with the decryption key, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.\n- **Scry Power**: Key-based encryption provides a level of security against unauthorized access, particularly for symmetric ciphers like AES.\n- **Decryption**: Sending encrypted messages can cause the expected recipient to decrypt them, potentially exposing the sender's private content to public view.\n- **Shc1yurity**: Encryption provides a way to securely store sensitive information and transmit it over encrypted channels.\n\nThese aspects impact the ease of communication, the speed of the data transmission, and the reliability of the encryption. Encryption transforms unreadable ciphertext into a sophisticated form known to both the sender and receiver, facilitating communication with computers and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted.\n\n### Question:\nHow does encryption affect the effectiveness of ciphers in protecting against various types of attacks?\n\n### Answer:\nEncrypted ciphers rely heavily on cryptanalysis-based attacks specifically targeting the cryptographic security of the encryption mechanism. The nature of encryption threats, whether they be electronic, network, or electromagnetic attacks, highlights the importance of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.\n\n- **Enrypted message integrity**: When a message is encrypted, there is an inherent risk of eavesdropping or tampering during transmission. Anticipating and detecting such attacks on the encryption process can be achieved through a comprehensive analysis of the summary key used for the encryption.\n- **Scry Duty**: ciphers compromise the robustness of integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability of the encryption process to selectively obtain plaintexts, render the encrypted messages non-existent, or disrupt the proper functioning of the encryption algorithm.\n- **Abrupt Data Loss**: Without decryption of the encrypted message in time, it can be challenging to argue that the sender misused secrecy of the encrypted message content by sending it out of the network during the transmission. This issue hampers security validation operations, as well as criticism and disapproval on security audit systems.\n- **Emergency Capability**: In the event of an imminent critical attack that compromises significant commercial interests, a group of hackers on key networks can be instantly inundated with erroneous encrypted signals from the electronic node it is located at, and energies targeted to the destination node, to defeat any attempt to secure the critical data at the destination through traditional cryptographic measures.\n\nIn summary, an encryption robust to encryptors includes a separation between the encrypted content and the keys, and frequently operates though couple keys leading to unique encryption processes through each series of encryption, computations, and decryption operations.\n\n# Cipher-making Rules\n\n**Madrigal comes with:** Play started.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards:\n        - A list of 54 numbers, including a randomly shuffled deck consisting of 52 suited cards and two distinguishable jokers known as the A Joker and B Joker. Suited cards are valued sequentially across four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades, with values ranging from 1 to 52, while the jokers are valued 53 and 54.\n        - [9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21]\n    - **Keystream Algorithm**\n        \n        This algorithm generates keystream values by moving cards within a deck. The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x. (starting from 0).\n        - Generate a keystream value y for p using the Initial sequence of cards:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - When the keystream value y is added to the position value x, the mod 26 operation is applied to obtain z:\n            - z=(y+x) % 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position z.\n        - Append it to the ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - LETTERS = ['J', 'D', 'W', 'O', 'T', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'X', 'Q', 'M', 'F', 'Y',\n    'E', 'Z', 'G', 'U', 'K', 'P', 'V', 'B', 'S', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'I']\n    - Associate each letter with its position in the LETTERS (starting from 0):\n        \n        J -> 0, D -> 1, W -> 2, O -> 3, T -> 4, R -> 5, A -> 6, C -> 7, X -> 8, Q -> 9,\n        M -> 10, F -> 11, Y -> 12, E -> 13, Z -> 14, G -> 15, U -> 16, K -> 17, P -> 18,\n        V -> 19, B -> 20, S -> 21, H -> 22, N -> 23, L -> 24, I -> 25\n        \n    - Initial sequence of cards(Same as encryption)\n    - Keystream Algorithm(Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each ciphertext character c:\n        - Convert c to its corresponding positional value z using the LETTERS (starting from 0).\n        - Generate the keystream value y for c:\n            - y, cards = Keystream Algorithm (cards)\n            - This algorithm modifies the order of the pile of cards, and the next execution then uses the new order.\n        - Calculate the original positional value x from ciphertext character c:\n            - x=(z-y) mod 26\n        - Use the LETTERS list to return the letter corresponding to position x.\n        - Append it to the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"A\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

They do not have constraints on the uppercase alphabet or digits. PLAINFORMAT\n\nThe first step is to read the plaintext into a string and remove any unnecessary spaces or punctuation characters. This gives you the plaintext \"FO\".\n\nNext, we'll use the surrounding Girds to split the plaintext into groups of 6 characters each. This ensures that every group has the same number of characters, which is crucial for the encryption process.\n\nThen, we'll split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. Each binary group represents two digits (T and H). We'll use these binary groups to determine the corresponding row and column numbers in the Girds table.\n\nOnce we have the row and column numbers for each binary group, we'll find the corresponding letter using the corresponding binary group from the Gird3 table. We'll then base the decrypted message on this corresponding letter.\n\nFinally, we'll group the decrypted messages together, remove the # characters at the end, and return the final result."}

When encrypting and decrypting, I have to break the code using the code above, there is basically two encryption steps:\r\n\r\n1) fornumber: for each letter passed to the stream on the plaintext half, it should match a number in the ciphertext half.\r\n\r\n2) Copy to: for each letter, incrementing the password by one must be used.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do since most of the properties are blank in the rule for this cipher. To assist in understanding and implementing the encryption and decryption of the cipher, let's break it down step-by-step based on the given instructions and the provided \"plain text\" variable.\n\n**Plain Text Input:**\n- \"MMRWZX\"\n\n**Encryption (Using 44 base point)**\n\n1. **Encryption Rules:**\n   - 1. The alphabet consists of uppercase letters only (A-Z).\n   - 2. Punctuation marks (.,!) remain unchanged.\n   - 3. Each chunk of plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") is run on the plain text (e.g., encrypt the word \"MMWX\").\n   - 4. The plain text used to encrypt communication is eight characters long.\n   - 5. The input plaintext (e.g., \"MMRWZX\") consists of a section of unique characters (starting and ending with 'M') followed by eight punctuation marks.\n   - 6. The ciphertext will be similar to the plaintext, but with certain changes.\n\n2. **Encryption Steps:**\n   - **Line Writing**: The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with the maximum of five characters per line (e.g., MMWJRRX^Z).\n     - **Example**: For \"MMRWZX\", write the first line, MMW, from left to right (added UP), write MMW, from right to left (added DOWN). Read both lines to get:\n       - First line: MMW\n       - Second line: WX^Z\n   - **Reading**: Read by column, each column captured once (from the top and down), with an increment of punctuation (added as part of base). Since every letter has a space in it, add 1 to the capital letter, 2 to lower, 3 to middle, and 4 to new in its case.\n     - **Example**: Take the portion \"MMWAXWVZXMXRYZZWBZSZZYHZSXWS\" (4 paragraphs: MMW, WX-Z, and the whole thing). Occupied all the rows.\n\n3. **Encrypted Output:**\n   - Create a programmable array of base pairs and use the digit A-10 plus the offset C-11 to implement the encryption rules. The encrypted output is shown below.\n\n```\n[\n0:664127478086700.\n1:6642001026970753.\n2:66806263150750948.\n3:74376118103263489.\n4:73963283702221840.\n5:66888957323459688.\n6:74749513474284527.\n7:66560694994457140.\n8:66732933422653825.\n9:66779336563801711.\n10:70368537743032780.\n11:66488820442813142.\n12:70426745736100377.\n13:67446841414122748.\n14:78887534924515.\n15:6753590514686028.\n16:69405516068345754.\n17:70594857785240486.\n18:675621103635418.\n19:6751015426763255.\n20:7069612325314505.\n21:7190835822934469.\n22:676965616109666.\n23:714379988086834.\n24:679783309248426.\n25:732949557824048.\n26:673800296317800.\n27:67566211660712.\n28:733213388587409.\n29:664478333488298.\n30:735858442338501.\n31:664350295984050.\n32:674729580081655.\n33:687047367295705.\n34:677428245405454.\n35:744130910743799.\n36:674245611287095.\n37:728279774872509.\n38:666887899808466.\n39:70861576665543.\n40:68459151813891.\n41:70844589874903.\n42:68857201584933.\n43:666250400445473.\n44:71715427878432.\n]\n```\n\n**Decryption:**\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n1. Arrange the ciphertext sequentially and calculate each column value. Each column corresponds directly with one or two punctuation marks.\n2. Add 1 after lengthening capital letters to the base, zero after lengthening lower, middle, and new after lengthening punctuation.\n3. XOR each char with a number based on its value in the maintained sequence.\n\nThe exact encryption and decryption logic is encapsulated in this pseudo-code:\n\n```pseudo\npseudo_encription_cipher:\n   <input: plain text> -> [encrypt the plaintext]\n   <encrypt the lst cipher> -> [encode the output]\n   <encrypt the lst cipher> -> [concatenate the padded ciphertext]\n   <Pseudo logic to decrypt> -> decrypt the encrypted output [using the same pseudos as in encrypt]\n\npseudo_decryption_cipher:\n   <decode the lst cipher> -> [decrypt the output]\n   <decode the lst cipher> -> [process the padded output as binary form]\n   <systems to decrypt with greater number than nothing mentioned>\n```\n\nThe encrypted output generated by the encryption rules can be passed through the `encrypt_cipher` function to obtain the encrypted output, and the decrypted output can be passed through the `decrypt_cipher` function to obtain the plaintext."}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[M]]\n\nTo perform an encryption or decryption of the given ciphertext (\"PFS\") using the Masterpiece Cipher (or \"11”, as a shorthand), we'll analyze the provided formula:\n\nUser Input:\n- Plaintext (P): \"PFS\"\n- Key (K): \"11\"\n\nFirst, we should identify the relation between \"P\" (plaintext) and \"K\" (how to encrypt or decrypt). However, unless there's a clear relation, there isn't a direct encryption or decryption for multiple letters like \"E\" and \"I\". \n\nBut let's leap into decryption.\n\n### Processing Code:\n\n**Encryption Phase:**\n\n1. **Input:** (6, 6) (As described in Step 1 of the rules)\n2. **Rows and columns:** 6 continuous row and 6 continuous column (Just 6, which is good enough for arbitrary string input). Let's call it `matrix`.\n3. **Encryption Feedback:** (A, 2) (Remember, their comparison is just to determine if the encryption output is A, otherwise B if it's then decryption with the correct alpha to dictionary).\n   - \"X\" is α (something representative for the letter A), so α has lower right cursor position (M to T). Since X has 1 in its higher right cell (3rd row & 3rd column), we have A'S lower right cursor (directory Q) wherever corresponding spread symbol letter V is located.\n   - \"G\" is β (Someone known word), so β has higher right cursor (Z to D). Since G in its lower right cell (2nd row & 2nd column) for its spread symbol letter U, we have D'S lower right cursor (vertical L). At similar, multiply, and multiply upward (G over U) as T, we get DG!\n\n**Encrypted Character Set:** CBGZW\n\nNow, we decrypt with the \"11\" constant:\n1. **Lower Left Cursor:** T (as completely under the letter with coordinates of Q).\n2. **Lower Right Cursor:** DG (Right Word).  \"G\" has lower right cursor for Q.\n3. **Up Direction (for \"I\"):**\n   - Character V in any lower right horizontal position means the cell should be eaten. That's why the letter is M. The splitter `M ~ ~ B ~ F ~ T` matches to the setup on the 6x6 matrix.\n4. **Upper & Full Right Cursor:** CDWN (this is skipped, since it's not well know.)\n\nThus, it's our output, yn from the ordered alphabet that goes to \"18\".\n\nThe format followed:\n~~~Base-6 Output {private Code DS = 18 ,Iifferential Code NIC is Decade}~~\nThus:\n1 - deriving = \nMicrosoft VBScript, JIT Compiler v16.1.0.0, MS Excel, Silverlight v2, ODBC v6.75.15076.0, Zune<Product Version=15.10.5 [32x64]]  \n\nTo input\n\nPrisspqrstuvwxyz,   3 bytes (pris = pure EAV)\n\nOur output:\n\n\"For part 1 use Microsoft's ID class interface\nXAX MXMX RXMX \"\n\n(Note emojis)\nOutput:\n\n![Encryption Function](https://i.imgur.com/HvW5HKS.jpg)\n\nDecryption Function:\n\n 输出:\n\n![Encryption Function](https://i.imgur.com/HvW5HKS.jpg)\n\nThus: 2202024?2002\n \nPlease let me know if you need anything else!

This includes writing $-3^0$ as $3^0$ and $-3^n$ for $n = 0$.\n\n### Question:\nFind all positive integers $n$ such that $n + 4n^2 = 10r^2$ for some integer $r$.\n\n### Answer:\nThe known solution for this problem is that all positive integers $n$ satisfy the relationship. This is because if $n$ were a negative integer, then there would be nothing to divide by $4n^2$ in forms that are multiples of $10r^2$, and such negative numbers would not be added to the right side of the equation.\n\n### Question:\nFind the remainder when 71 is divided by 24.\n\n### Answer:\nThe remainder of 71 divided by 24 is 21, as follows: $$71 \\div 24 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 5 \\text{, so } 71 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{24}$$.\n\n### Question:\nHow many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5?\n\n### Answer:\nTo determine how many perfect squares less than 250000 have a units digit of 5, we need to consider the units digit of a perfect square. The units digit of a perfect square property to be a particular number, the unit digits of the multiple, partition of the number must mirror. If the minimal multiple consists of digits hitting $a$, the alternative partition of the number must take up brackets similar to $a$.\n\nThis problem is repeated tensorization of the units digit 5, the method utilizes the following properties and rules: \n1. Regroupers of minimum prevalent 5 up to the ones upstabilrment.\n2. Simple multiplication principle in units remaning digit.\n\n\\(N = 110 \\times121 \\times 130 \\times 140 \\times 150 \\times 160 \\times 170 \\times 180 \\times...\n\\)\n\n## Python program\n```\ndef compute():\n    n = int(input(\"Enter Max number -> \"))\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        j = i\n        while j * j <= n:\n            count += n // (j * j)\n            j += 1\n        if i * i == n:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\ncompute()\n```\n\nThe program demonstrates the logic to find the no. of perfect square like numbers with a units digit of 5 i.e, via recursion."}

For example, the ASCII representation of the uppercase letter 'D' is 68. The resulting hash value is '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'. The shift amount is calculated by 32 minus the value of the letter 'D' which is 68 (equivalent to the ASCII value 68 in hexadecimal).\n\nThe encrypted answer is then converted to a hexadecimal string and repeated '7 times'. The first '7' presents the high byte of the encrypted answer. \n\nThe length of the sequence of the first '7' is determined by the value of the large ascii code '~'. In hexadecimal format, the ASCII value of '~' is 240 and is the maximum allowable ASCII value.\n\nThen, the result of the XOR operation between the single byte of the encrypted answer and the hexadecimal value of the first '7' is calculated. The result is then appended to the end of the hexadecimal string."}
