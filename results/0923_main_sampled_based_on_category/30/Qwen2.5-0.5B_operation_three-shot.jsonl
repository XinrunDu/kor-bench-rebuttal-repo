Due to the complex nature of the relation between the variables 5, 7, 1, and 2, it is not possible to provide a general numerical answer. However, I can help you with some specific cases where we can apply the rule and find integer solutions. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Find a and b such that 7 ○ 2 = 34:**\n\n    Since 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90, we can try different values for a and b.\n\n    - Let's try a=1 and b=1.\n        - Then 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90.\n    - Let's try a=3 and b=3.\n        - Then 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90.\n    - Let's try a=4 and b=4.\n        - Then 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90.\n    - Let's try a=5 and b=5.\n        - Then 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90.\n    - Let's try a=6 and b=6.\n        - Then 7 ○ 2 = (7 + 3)×(7 + 2) = 10×9 = 90.\n\n    Since all combinations of a and b will satisfy the equation, the answer is 1 or 3.\n\n2. **If X ○ 2 = 21, find X:**\n\n    Since X ○ 2 = (X + 3)×(X + 2) = 21, we can rearrange this equation to find X:\n\n    - Let's assume X = 1\n        - Then (1 + 3)×(1 + 2) = 4×3 = 12\n        - This does not equal 21.\n\n    - Let's assume X = 2\n        - Then (2 + 3)×(2 + 2) = 5×4 = 20\n        - This does not equal 21.\n\n    - Let's assume X = 3\n        - Then (3 + 3)×(3 + 2) = 6×5 = 30\n        - This does not equal 21.\n\n    - Let's assume X = 4\n        - Then (4 + 3)×(4 + 2) = 7×6 = 42\n        - This does not equal 21.\n\n    - Let's assume X = 1 or 3\n        - Let's try X = 1.\n            - Then 3 ○ 2 = (3 + 2)×(3 + 2) = 5×5 = 25 \n            - This does not equal 21.\n        - Let's try X = 3.\n            - Then 3 ○ 2 = (3 + 2)×(3 + 2) = 5×5 = 25 \n            - This does not equal 21.\n    - Let's assume X = 5\n        - Then (5 + 3)×(5 + 2) = 8×7 = 56\n        - This does not equal 21.\n\n    Therefore, no solution exists, so the answer would be the variable \"X\" in its unsimplified form, which would be in the box."}

There is no need for further additional information that does not relate to the query. First, the answer \"3\" comes directly from the given rules and still satisfies the requirement to serve as a single number in the evaluated operation. The overlap of rules and information helps ensure the accuracy and comprehensibility of the answer. The provided code only involves safely wrapping the string \"3\" together with 2 more square brackets before outputting it, which is aligned and immediately understandable.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend using punctuation definitions to make the answer as concise and professional as possible, such as commas, separating numbers and/or providing explanations of the answers if they involved multiple steps.\n\nPlease note, if the sample source mentions the acronym \"FOUC\" presumably referring to the \"Fast Old Confederates\" the question was meant to target no region or topic.\nIf a question is about the Ancient Greek word for a hybrid or romanesque type of style, then your answer should begin with the words \"A Greek\" or even \"GM Greek\", but not \"An SCM Greek\", if it is not a word in an established sense. I would suggest starting with \"Greek\" and being more specific in your phrase. Instead of \"an SCM Greek\", choose a more specific example like \"an asymmetrical, agglomerative, raw mosaic heavily influenced by Egyptian and indigenous cultural elements and pretty much uniformly composed of youhomo chryssokleitos hybrid structures entwined together.\"\n\nIf the correct answer here would be another question of saying what \"FOUC\" is, then [3-3] is the answer, as it is a flat bracketing divisor by itself.\n\nHowever, if the question was beyond simple guidance on FOUC's type or meaning and our conservative judgments, I'd say \"[1] or [2]\" which would encompass any answers like 1) FALSE 2) YES\n In short, I'd probably answer with a list of different possible answers.\n\nNote that the wording of the provided question could contain a slight instinctive bias towards籄YouHomo-Chryssokleitos-ism - as asumptions like Greek, SCM, FOUC etc., sound very Greek to me and even if not Greek at all, surely \"FOUC\" should be considered by people who do not speak ancient Greek, so I wouldn't follow the Greek phraseatics.\n\nThe following comment also contains a source of trap words, but applicable to the [1] option I suggested in part. Things being deliberately vague could make a question inconsistent in the case where answers behind do not match perfectly with (IMHO) causing a question to fail reasonable tests. For example, FuzzySprouts has included \"Abt.\tutils\" which does not specify a composition of subwords."}

So, don't use any search engines or Google directly.\n\nCertainly, I can help evaluate the custom operation and give the answer to the given question.\n\nIt seems that you provided a question that asks me to evaluate and compute a specific value using the operations described in the rules. However, the answers you received are not precisely what the rules imply and correct. Let me evaluate the custom operation and provide the correct form.\n\n### Custom Operation:\n\na￠b=\\log_{b}{a}+\\log_{a}{b}.\n\na and b are positive integers.\n\n### Given Answer:\n\n[(10/3)]\n\n### Calculation:\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\na￠b = log\\_b(a) + log\\_a(b)\n= log\\_b(a \\cdot b)\n= log\\_b(a \\cdot b \\cdot b)\n= log\\_b(a \\cdot b \\cdot b)\n= log\\_b(ab)\n\nSince a and b are positive integers, let's assume a = 2 and b = 3 (or any combination of positive integers that would work).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(2¢3) = log\\_3(2 \\cdot 3)\n\n= log\\_3(6)\n\n= 1\n\nTherefore, (2¢3) = 1.\n\nYour given answer is incorrect because the custom operation requires division (log, not multiplication), and you assumed division instead of multiplication."}

Can you help me further fine-tune my evaluation to include the precise steps and even provide the final answer right from the web?\n\n1. Carefully read and understand the definitions of the new operations in the Rule.\n2. If the question does not specifically ask for it, your answer should be a number or a group of numbers.\n3. Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the Rule accurately.\n4. Ensure you capture the character format and adhere to the specified format in the question.\n5. It is expected that you do not have the process document or proof that proves it in the rule. Remember, the process being assess was conducted in the form of lexicon, EE, and manual calculations rather than any form of document. )\n\nConsidering all the above mentioned, I can try to run the calculations based on the defined procedure.\n\nGiven the specified Rule and Process, now I need to strictly adhere to this procedure to accurately solve the Problem with the precise steps and answer exactly as requested. \n\nPlease provide the reasoning that directly translates the user's input into the steps and answer.\n\n1. Consider the given operations and think of how to accurately solve the Problem using logic.\n2. Start by understanding the Rule: a¢b = log_b(a) + log_b(a)\n3. Break down the Problem and consider each step in the Solution: Compute 8¢2 = 8¢log₂(8) + 8log₂(2)\n4. Compute 8¢log₂(8) = log₂(8) + log₂(8) = 2 · 2 · log₂(2) = 2\n5. Compute 8log₂(2) = log₂(2) + log₂(2) + log₂(2) = 4 (log₂(2) + 2 + 1)\n6. Add the two results: 2 + 4 = 6. \n7. Carefully consider the rule for the Process: The rule doesn't allow for a coefficient, so x¢0 = 1 for negative x ($x ≠ 0$). \n\nThus, for simplicity, replace 8 with 2, but still leave the result 6. \n \nThat's what I got.\nYes, that seems to be the solution. The process you provided accurately is based on the process rule stated in the answer, with the special rule being mentioned that the operation x¢0 is (1/x). However, the process already aligns with the required steps and the final result provided. A more complete and structured breakdown of the process would be well-aligned with the formative, but here's what I think the final answer can look like.\n\n$$a$¢b = log_b(a) + log_b(a) $$\n\nGiven this rule, we have:\n\n$$a$¢2 = log_a(a) + log_a(a) = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\nAnd we now consider 8¢2:\n\n$$\\log_2(a) + \\log_2(a) = 2 + 2 = 2 = 8$$. \n\nAnd we see the Outcome of our Rule is:\n$$ 8 = 2^3 $$\nHence solving for the desired multiplication is:\n$$ 2^3 ⋅ 2 = 2^{3+1} = 8 =8 ¹° $$\n\nFINAL ANSWER [Final answer]: $8$ [$^1]_$3_$"}

However, the expression \\( \\text{f}[\\text{▽}g] \\) involves \\( g(x) \\) evaluated at \\( x \\). When we directly substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into \\( f(x) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(0) = 0^2 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the first part of our problem simplifies to evaluating \\( f(0) \\) directly through \\( \\text{g}''(x) \\):\n\\[ f(0) = \\text{g}(0)''(0) \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate \\( \\text{g}(0)''(0) \\)\n\\[ \\text{g}(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\text{g}''(0) = \\frac{d}{dx}(0) = 0 \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ \\text{f}(0) = \\text{g}(0)''(0) = 0 \\]\n\n#### Step 5: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into \\( \\text{f}[\\text{▽}g] \\)\nNow, substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the custom operation:\n\\[ \\text{f}[\\text{▽}g] = f(0) + \\text{g}''(0) \\]\n\\[ \\text{f}[\\text{▽}g] = 0 + 0 = 0 \\]\n\nConverting the final result back to LaTeX format:\n\\[ [[0]] \\]\n\nSo, the complete answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{[0]} \\]"}

To solve the limit problem using L'Hopital's rule, we need to compute the limit of the expression \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{(\\sin 5x)^3}{\\sin x^2}\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the indeterminate form**: As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), both the numerator \\((\\sin 5x)^3\\) and the denominator \\(\\sin x^2\\) approach 0, indicating that the expression is of the form \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\). This is an indeterminate form of type \\(\\frac{0}{0}\\).\n\n2. **Apply L'Hopital's rule**: L'Hopital's rule states that if \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{0}{0}\\), then \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\boxed{\\frac{0}{0}}\\). Here, \\(f(x) = (\\sin 5x)^3\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sin x^2\\). We need to find the derivatives \\(f'(x)\\) and \\(g'(x)\\).\n\n   - To find \\(f'(x)\\), we use the chain rule. If \\(h(x) = \\sin 5x\\), then \\(f(x) = h(5x)\\). The derivative of \\(h\\) is \\(5 \\cos 5x\\), and the derivative of \\(f\\) is found using the chain rule:\n     \\[\n     f'(x) = 3 (\\sin 5x)^2 \\cdot \\cos 5x = 3 (\\sin 5x \\cos 5x)^2\n     \\]\n\n   - To find \\(g'(x)\\), we use the chain rule. If \\(h(x) = \\sin x^2\\), then \\(g(x) = h(x^2)\\). The derivative of \\(h\\) is \\(2 \\cos x^2\\), and the derivative of \\(g\\) is found using the chain rule:\n     \\[\n     g'(x) = 2 (\\cos x^2) \\cdot 2x = 4x (\\cos x^2)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the limit**: Now, we need to take the limit of \\(f'(x) / g'(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{3 (\\sin 5x \\cos 5x)^2}{4x (\\cos x^2)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{3 \\sin^2 5x (1) 4500 / (\\cos 5x)^2}{4x \\cos x^2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{3 \\sin^2 5x \\cdot 4500 / (\\cos 5x)^2}{4x \\cos x^2} = \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{4500 \\sin^2 5x}{(\\cos 5x)^2} = \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{4500 \\sin^2 5x}{1} = 4500 \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{4500 \\sin^2 5x}{1} = 4500 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2250\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final answer**: The limit is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2250}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final expression for the limit is \\(\\frac{\\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}{\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\boxed{2250}\\).\n\nFor the second limit, we would continue the same process to keep simplifying the expression while recognizing that we can use the limit as \\(x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) for \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\frac{f(x)}{x^2}\\) since \\(x^2\\) approach 1 as \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), assuming \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\frac{\\pi}{4}} x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\nNot sure.

Applying:\n4¥2 = 4^2 - 2^4\n4¥2 = 16 - 16\n4¥2 = 0\nSo, the answer is [[0]].\n\n### Question: 3¥4\nFor 3¥4, we use the operation rule a¥b = a^b - b^a. Applying:\n3¥4 = 3^4 - 4^3\n3¥4 = 81 - 64\n3¥4 = 17\nSo, the answer is [[17]].\n\n### Question: Compute 2¥1\nTo compute 2¥1, we use the operation rule a¥b = a^b - b^a. Applying:\n2¥1 = 2^1 - 1^2\n2¥1 = 2 - 1\n2¥1 = 1\nSo, the answer is [[1]].\n\n### Question: If 5¥X=4, find X\nGiven that 5¥X = 4, we can directly compute and get:\n5¥X = 5^X - X^5\n5¥X = X^5 - 5\nSetting this equal to 4, we solve for X as follows:\nX^5 - 5 = 4\nX^5 = 9\nSo, we take the cube root of both sides:\nX = cube root of 9\nTherefore, the final answer is [[9]].\n\n### Available Operation Routines:\n\na¥b = a^b - b^a\nb¥a = b^a - a^b\na^b = a^b - b^a\nb^a = b^a - a^b"}
