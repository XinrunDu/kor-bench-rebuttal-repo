The initial grid looks like:\n   ```\n   X  2  X  4  23\n   9  X  X  11  24\n   X  12  X  8  31\n   21  15  19  23\n   ```\n\n2. We need to fill in the remaining blanks while ensuring the sum of each row and column matches the given numbers at the end.\n\n3. Let's start with the second row:\n   - The third element of the second row is an X. Since the sum of the second row should be 43 (24 + 9 + X), we need to solve for X:\n     \\[ 9 + X + 8 = 43 \\]\n     \\[ X + 17 = 43 \\]\n     \\[ X = 26 \\]\n     So, we fill in the third element with X = 26, making the second line be `2  26  26  11  24`.\n\n4. Moving to the third row:\n   - The third element here is 12, so the sum of the third row should be 61 (31 + 8 + 26):\n     \\[ 26 + 12 + 19 = 61 \\]\n     \\[ 19 = 61 \\]\n     This confirms our number for the third row.\n\n5. Now, considering the first row:\n   - The fourth element is 23. The sum of the first row should be 72 (2 + 4 + 11 + 23):\n     \\[ 2 + 4 + 11 + X = 72 \\]\n     \\[ 17 + X = 72 \\]\n     \\[ X = 55 \\]\n     We can't fill in the fourth element since we don't have enough valid numbers for this row.\n\n6. Finally, the last row, the fourth:\n   - The fourth element here is 23. The sum of the fourth row should be 83 (15 + 19 + 26 + 7):\n     \\[ 15 + 19 + 26 + 19 = 83 \\]\n     \\[ 83 = 83 \\]\n     This confirms our number for the elements in this row, leaving 21 to be filled.\n\nGiven that we have some issues with the fourth row, we need to re-evaluate the way to fill in the puzzle:\n\nStarting from the last row, we have:\n- 21 at the first column, we know it must match the supplement of the other required numbers. (The fourth row requires summing up to 72 and filling in the numbers corresponding to each blank.)\n- Making from the first row:\n  - 2 + 23 = 25\n  - This can only progress if the numbers are (Apart from 9 and 2 because, X cancel each other)\n  - Thus, we fill in “2 + 11 + 26 + 2” as each category.\n  \n  Indeed, Why the mentioned you sqrtm can be fixed?\n  \n  The number is summarized.\n  - Since the paths overlap, 12345.

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\nX X 3 X X\nX X X X X\n\n(1,3)>(1,4)\n(1,1)<(2,1)\n(2,2)<(3,2)\n(3,2)<(3,3)\n(3,4)<(3,5)\n(3,4)>(4,4)\n(4,1)<(4,2)\n(5,4)<(5,5)\n(4,5)<(5,5)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[X X X X 3, X X X X, X X X X, X 3 X X, X X X X]]"}

For instance, a player starting on this arrow could move up, then northeast, south-west, or south-east, but not north, south, east, or west.\n\nSo the starting point is at the top left corner of the grid.
