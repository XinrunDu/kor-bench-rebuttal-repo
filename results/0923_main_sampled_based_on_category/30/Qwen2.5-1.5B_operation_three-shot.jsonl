If \\( s_1=1 \\) and \\( s_2=3 \\), find \\( s_5 \\).\nPlease note that \\( a_n \\) denotes the \\( a_n \\)th term of the sequence.\nIf there are two integers \\( a_n = \\frac{5}{n} \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer, and corresponding \\( b_n = \\frac{15}{3n} \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer, first, find \\( a_{500} \\). Then, given \\( m = b_{500} \\), find \\( m \\). Write your answer in the form \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are positive integers and the fraction is in lowest terms.\nFor brevity and to avoid potential misunderstandings, both answers and responses contain the FYI and BEGIN tags.\n\nFYI, please refer to the above question.\n\nBEGIN\nThe sequence is defined by \\( s_1 = 1 \\), \\( s_2 = 3 \\), and each term \\( s_n \\) for \\( n \\geq 3 \\) is the sum of all previous terms. Thus, \\( s_3 = s_1 + s_2 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\), \\( s_4 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \\), and \\( s_5 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16 \\). Therefore, \\( s_5 = 16 \\).\nEND\nFor the nested sequences:\n1. Given \\( a_n = 5 \\div n \\), for \\( n = 500 \\), we have \\( a_{500} = 5 \\div 500 = \\frac{5}{500} = \\frac{1}{100} \\).\n2. Given \\( b_n = \\frac{15}{3n} \\), for \\( n = 500 \\), we have \\( b_{500} = \\frac{15}{3 \\cdot 500} = \\frac{15}{1500} = \\frac{1}{100} \\).\nSince \\( a_{500} = \\frac{1}{100} \\) and \\( b_{500} = \\frac{1}{100} \\), and their common value is \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\), we have \\( m = \\frac{1}{100} \\).
