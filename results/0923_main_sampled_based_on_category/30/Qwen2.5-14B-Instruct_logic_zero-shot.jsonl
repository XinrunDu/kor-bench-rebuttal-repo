Thus, `(p>q)>r` becomes `(!!p | !q)|r`.\n\nBy the idempotence law (2-3), `!!p` can be simplified to `p`.\n\nSo, we have `(p | !q) | r` as our first expression.\n\nNext, for `p>(q>r)`:\n\n1. `p>(q>r)` translates directly using rule (10) to `!p | (q>r)`.\n2. Using rule (10) for the nested implication `(q>r)`, it becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nComparing the fully simplified forms:\n- `(p>q)>r` becomes `(p | !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nTo check equivalence, compare `(p | !q) | r` and `!p | (!q | r)` using the given equivalences.\n\n`(p | !q) | r` is not directly equivalent to `!p | (!q | r)` based on the provided equivalences without further steps, but we can see that neither expression directly simplifies or restructures into the other without additional transformations that aren't specified or straightforward under the given rules.\n\nGiven that through direct transformation, none of the provided equivalences directly confirm they are identical forms, and looking closely the structure of the expressions seems to hint towards different outcomes in certain scenarios (as `p` is negated in one and not the other), the conclusion leans towards them not being equivalent under all truth value scenarios.\n\n[[B]]"}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nFirst person: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nSecond person: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nThird person: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\" \nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\" \nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\" \nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions. So, what would the statements of First person, Second person, and Third person be represented as?\nAnswers are formatted as [[ ];[ ];[ ]]. Each bracketed section should contain the corresponding logical expression for each individual statement.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To represent the statements of the first, second, and third persons according to the given propositions (p for Suzhou, q for Shanghai, and r for Hangzhou), we can symbolize each statement according to the logic symbols provided.\n\n1. First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!p & q`.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & p`.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - Since exactly one among `p, q, r` is true, and according to the statement the person is claiming that it is neither `q` nor `r` (Shanghai nor Hangzhou). Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true. Hence, a fuller consideration of the third statement in the context of one of them being true will convert to `p | r`, thus `p` stands for the correct place if `q` and `r` are false. Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1. First person: `!p & q`.\n2. Second person: `!q & p`.\n3. Third person based on the true proposition condition, `p | r` valid stating `!q & !r` by negation and condition yielding directly `p`.\n\nThus, the logical expressions are properly represented as `[!p & q; !q & p; !q & !r]`.\n\nBut based on simple proposition directly true condition understanding:\n- First person's statement truth condition under general is `[!p & q]`.\n- Second person's statement truth condition under general is `[!q & p]`.\n- Third person's proper derivation in context is directly `[p]` considering true only condition.\n\nGiven this observed format and context, the\uad04\ud638\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uace0 \uc0bc\ub2e8\ub17c\ub9ac\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud45c\ud604\ud558\uc790. \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8, \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8, \uc138\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc740 \uac01\uac01 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4:\n\n- \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc218\ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc654\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!p & q`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n- \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\uc5d0\uc11c \uc624\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uace0, \uc218\ucc3d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc654\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!q & p`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0bc \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n- \uc138\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub78c: \"\uc655 \uad50\uc218\ub294 \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\ub3c4 \uc548\uac00\uace0 \ud56d\uc8fc\ub3c4 \uc548\uac14\ub2e4.\"\ub294 `!q & !r`\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc774\ub294 \uc655 \uad50\uc218\uac00 \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\ucc3d \ucd9c\uc2e0\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c, \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 `p`\ub85c \ud45c\uae30\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \uac01 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc758 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub17c\ub9ac \uc2ec\ubc8c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uba74, \uadf8 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4: `[!p & q; !q & p; p]`.\n\n\uc774 \ud45c\ud604\uc740 \ub17c\ub9ac\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \uac01 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \ub9d0\ud55c \uac83\uacfc \ubd80\ud569\ud558\uba70, \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ub17c\ub9ac \ud750\ub984\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4."}

Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

Each disjunction contains propositions and their negations. In fact, if we rewrite the formula, we see that it\u2019s already in conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses (disjunctions).\n\nGiven the definition provided, however, we have to confirm whether the given formula can be part of a PCNF or PDNF. A principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) is a disjunction of all paired conjunctive terms, while a principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF) consists of all paired disjunctive terms.\n\nUpon examination, the given formula is:\n\\[\n(p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly in conjunctive normal form (CNF) because it is a conjunction of disjunctions. The question now is to determine if it can be represented as a PCNF.\n\n**Step 3: Check if this formula fits the PCNF criteria.**\n\nThe formula given \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) needs to be examined against the specifications of PCNF. Let's analyze each clause:\n\n1. \\(p\u2228r\\)\n2. \\(\\neg q\u2228r\\)\n3. \\(\\neg p\u2228q\u2228\\neg r\\)\n\nEach clause is indeed a disjunction of literals forming a clause that can be a part of a PCNF. But the next question is to check if this represents every possible paired conjunctive term (the correct term would be disjunctive in this case based on the structure of PCNF).\n\nThis particular formula seems to cover a set of clauses that do not constitute all possible disjunctive terms required to represent a complete PCNF for three variables (p, q, r) which would require all possible combinations and closures (or openings) of these variables to cover all cases.\n\nSince \\((p\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acq\u2228r)\u2227(\u00acp\u2228q\u2228\u00acr)\\) does not form all possible clauses for three variables \\( (p, q, r) \\), and strictly following the specified rule, it does not meet the definition of a PCNF as it does not cover every situation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if it can be denoted in the described form.**\n\nGiven the analysis, since the formula does not cover all paired disjunctive terms for a full PCNF of three variables, it does not fit the full PCNF criteria.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[B]}\n\\]"}

Figure II fits with the given pattern:\n   - The first statement \u2203S\u21d2\u00acM suggests a starting condition about S which relates to M in a certain existential and negating way. \n   - The second statement \u2200P\u21d2M suggests M is related to P universally.\n   - The conclusion \u2203S\u21d2\u00acP is drawn from these, suggesting a link from S to P through negation, aligning with the structure of S()M and S()P in Figure II.\n\nGiven the moods, AEE from Figure II can be interpreted as follows:\n- P()M fits PM (A, given \u2200P\u21d2M)\n- S()M fits SOM (O, given \u2203S\u21d2\u00acM)\n- S()P concludes with Sop (O here, for \u2203S\u21d2\u00acP)\n\nTherefore, the given statements correspond to Figure II with the mood AOO.\n\nAnswer: [[II];[AOO]]"}

Thus, \"Widows are allowed to remarry\" can be represented as \u00a7p and \"Widows are not prevented from remarrying\" can be represented as \u00ac\u203e!p. Based on the normative reasoning formulas provided, formula (3) \u00a7p\u2190\u2192\u00ac\u203e!p captures the biconditional relationship between being allowed and not being prohibited, which directly corresponds to the given statement. Since the statement works in both directions (from being allowed to not being prohibited, and vice versa), this corresponds to the biconditional nature captured by formula (10) \u203dp\u2192\u00a7\u00acp when appropriately inverted and interpreted, leading us to conclude that the relationship follows formula (10) directly when reinterpreted as the inverse formulation, but primarily matches the bidirectional reasoning as governed by formula (3) in its core logic. However, since the question specifically asks which given formula it corresponds to directly and based on the provided list, the closest and most direct match for the bidirectional relationship described is captured in the structure of (10).

In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes.

There is also a negative group of families where parents adopt a passive style leading to lower emotional intelligence in their children. This pattern aligns closely with the methodology of comparing both positive and negative groups to establish a potential causal relationship, which is encapsulated in Method \ua66e.\n\nHence, the causal derivation here is most consistent with the approach described in Method \ua66e.\n\n[[C]]"}

Thus, strictly adhering to the definition, it represents a step toward the BC Paradox but does not fully represent it on its own.\n\nGiven the exact phrasing of the question and the strong expectation to match the demonstration exactly with the definition:\n[[B]] \n\nBut it's noteworthy that this statement is a component part of what could lead to the demonstration of the BC Paradox under the described logical framework."}

The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Father can be used both as a noun and a verb. As a noun, it has the following meanings: \u2460 Father; father-in-law; stepfather; adoptive father. \u2461 [often ~s] Ancestors; predecessors; elders. \u2462 Founder, initiator; creator; inventor; designer; source. \u2463 [often ~s] Elders; members of the council; senators of ancient Rome. \u2464 [the F-] God; the Holy Father; early Christian writers who clarified doctrines; priests addressed as Father. \u2465 [often F-] Used as a term of respect for elderly men. \u2466 The father of a plant or animal. (New English-Chinese Dictionary).\"\n\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nThe given definition for the word \"Father\" describes its existing usage in various contexts, which aligns with the description of the \u2135 Definition. This type of definition is commonly found in dictionaries and explains the word based on how it is used in different scenarios. The provided definition does not focus on the origin of the word (which would be characteristic of an \u2113 Definition) or the creation of a new term to avoid interference from familiar terms (\u2207 Definition)."}

However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number. Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.

Initially, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) correctly states that for any natural number (x), there is a natural number (y) that is greater than x. The incorrect conclusion \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) incorrectly suggests that there is a natural number (y) which is greater than every natural number (x), which is not possible since there is no largest natural number. This illustrates the invalid inference caused by reversing the order of the quantifiers, matching the definition provided for the QuantSwitch Method."}
