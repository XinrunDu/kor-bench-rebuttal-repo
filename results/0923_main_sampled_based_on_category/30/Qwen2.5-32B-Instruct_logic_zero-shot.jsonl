(p1=::>(p1||p2)) - This is a compound proposition with the \u2018if, then\u2019 connective.\n2. ((p1&p2)=::>p1) - This is another compound proposition with the \u2018if, then\u2019 connective.\n\n### Examining each part:\n\n#### (p1=::>(p1||p2))\nWe must check the truth value under all possible assignments of p1 and p2.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713):\n    - (\u2713=::>(\u2713||p2)) is true no matter what the value of p2 is, since the right-hand side will also be true.\n    - Thus, this part is always true when p1 is not false.\n- If p1 is false (x):\n    - (x=::>(x||p2)) is true if p2 is false, but this condition automatically holds because (x||p2) will not make \"if false, then false\" false.\n- Therefore, this part (p1=::>(p1||p2)) is always true, making it a **Truth Formula**.\n\n#### ((p1&p2)=::>p1)\nThis is another compound proposition.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713):\n    - (\u2713&p2)=::>\u2713 is true if either p2 is true or false. That's because \"if \u2713 and \u2713, then \u2713\" is true, and \"if \u2713 and x, then \u2713\" is also true.\n- If p1 is false (x):\n    - (x&p2)=::>x holds true because \"if false, then anything\" is the definition of an \u2018if, then\u2019 where the condition (p1&p2) can never be true if p1 is false.\n- Therefore, this part ((p1&p2)=::>p1) is likewise always true, making it a **Truth Formula** as well.\n\nSo:\n- (1) p1=::>(p1||p2) is a Truth Formula.\n- (2) (p1&p2)=::>p1 is a Truth Formula.\n\nThe answer should inherently be [[A];[A]]."}

No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine if the expressions \\((p>q)>r\\) and \\(p>(q>r)\\) are equivalent, we need to utilize the given logical equivalences and symbolization rules.\n\n1. Convert the implications into the form that uses `|` and `!`:\n   - Implication \\(A > B\\) is equivalent to `!A | B` based on the rule given.\n   - Therefore, the first expression \\((p>q)>r\\) is equivalent to `!(p>q) | r`.\n\n2. Apply the rule \\(A > B ::=:: !A | B\\) to `!(p>q) | r`:\n   - \\((p > q) ::=:: !p | q\\).\n   - So, `!(p>q)` is `!!(p>q)` and `p>q ::=:: !p | q`, which becomes `!(<!p | q)`.\n\n3. Simplify `!(<!p | q)` using the double negation rule \\(A ::=:: !!A\\):\n   - `!(<!p | q)` is equivalent to `\\(\\neg(\\neg(!p | q))\\)` which simplifies to `!(p & !q)` using De Morgan's Law (!(\\(A\\) | \\(B\\)) ::=:: !A & !B).\n\n4. Therefore, `!(p & !q) | r` is further simplified to `(!p | !!q) | r` and then to `(!p | q) | r`.\n\n5. We'll now do the same for the second expression \\(p>(q>r)\\) which is equivalent to `p> (!q | r)` following the same conversion rule.\n   - This implies `!p | (q>r)` or `!p | ((!q | r))`.\n   - Further simplification gives us `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\n6. Now we simplify both expressions further and compare:\n   - The first expression `(!p | q) | r`.\n   - The second expression `!p | (!q | r)`.\n\nApplying commutative and associative properties:\n   - `(!p | q) | r ::=:: !p | q | r` (since `|` is associative and commutative).\n   - `!p | (!q | r) ::=:: !p | !q | r`.\n\nComparing `!p | q | r` and `!p | !q | r`, we can see they are not the same because the second part does not match. Therefore, the original expressions \\((p>q)>r\\) and \\(p>(q>r)\\) are not equivalent.\n\nThus, the answer is [[B]]."}

Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

This expression already is in disjunctive normal form (DNF) because it is the disjunction of two basic conjunction terms. The next step is to identify the true assignments that make these conjunctions true and then denote them according to the given rules.\n\nThe expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) simplifies to \u00acp^r because for the conjunction \u00acp^\u00acq^r to be true, p must be false and r must be true. Similarly, for \u00acp^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true. Thus, the simplified expression highlights that p needs to be false and r needs to be true for the overall expression to be true, irrespective of the value of q.\n\nLet's represent the true assignment for \u00acp^\u00acq^r:\n- If p is false (binary value = 0), q can be false or true (binary value = 0 or 1), and r must be true (binary value = 1).\n\nThe true assignments that satisfy the given expression are:\n1. (p = 0, q = 0, r = 1) -> Binary: 001 -> Hexadecimal: 1 -> Denoted as m1.\n2. (p = 0, q = 1, r = 1) -> Binary: 011 -> Hexadecimal: 3 -> Denoted as m3.\n\nThese correspond to the described paired conjunctive terms in the form of the true assignments given by m1 and m3.\n\nTherefore, the expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) can be denoted by its principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) as follows:\n\n[[paired conjunctive terms:m1,m3]; [denoted:m1,m3]]"}

This resultant clause is q and it is already in S1, so no new element is added to S2.\n   - Resolving (\u00acp \u2228 q) and (q): C1 = \u00acp \u2228 q, C2 = q, C = dispel(C1, C2) = \u00acp. Since \u00acp is not in S0 or S1, add \u00acp to S2.\n   - Resolving (p \u2228 q) and (q): C1 = p \u2228 q, C2 = q, C = dispel(C1, C2) = p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, add p to S2.\n   \n   After resolving clauses in S1, S2 = {\u00acp, p}.\n\n**Second iteration:**\n1. Transfer S1 to S0, so S0 = {\u00acp \u2228 q, p \u2228 q, q}.\n2. S1 = S2, so S1 = {\u00acp, p}.\n3. S2 is cleared, initially being an empty set.\n4. Resolving clauses in S1:\n   - Resolving (\u00acp) and (p): C1 = \u00acp, C2 = p, C = dispel(C1, C2) = 0.\n\nSince dispensing \u00acp and p yields a contradiction (0), the algorithm ends here.\n\n**Output**: Since we found 0, we conclude that the input S is \"Implausible\".

Let\u2019s break it down for each given formula:\n\n1. The formula \\( \\forall x\\forall y\\exists z F(f(x,y),z) \\) means that for every pair of numbers (x, y), there is some number z such that function f applied to x and y equals z. Considering the definitions, we can replace the symbols with their corresponding implementations under J:\n    - \\( f(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x + y \\)\n    - \\( F(x, y) \\) is replaced with \\( x = y \\)\n\nTherefore, the formula under J becomes a statement about natural numbers.

This means we should consider the moods AII, EIO, and IAI (OAO does not end in I). Given the first premise ends in A (AP), we need to look at the mood with an A as the first element: AII.\n\nTherefore, the valid mood for the given premises and conclusion is AII.\n\nThe answer is [[A];[I]]."}

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The logical expression given is (p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acp \u2192 q), which translates to \"if p then q and if not p then q\". This means that regardless of whether p is true or false, q must be true. This scenario does not directly align with the definitions and rules of the BC Paradox or the LS Paradox, as they involve different logical structures and the conditions of their paradoxes do not match the given expression directly.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the GB Paradox, we see a parallel in using the same observation (in this case, q being true regardless of p's status) to draw the conclusion that q holds true. This can reflect a situation similar to the GB Paradox where the same outcome (q being true) can be derived from different conditions (p\u771f\u5047\u4e0d\u4e00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5), thus reflecting a situation where conclusions may appear to contradict each other from different viewpoints, even though they lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to the provided logical expression is the **GB Paradox** as it can illustrate a situation where the same conclusion (q being true) is approached from two different premises and can present complexity in conclusively favoring one form of inductive reasoning over another if not appropriately distinguished.\n\n[[A]]"}

Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant that helps with various logical reasoning tasks.
