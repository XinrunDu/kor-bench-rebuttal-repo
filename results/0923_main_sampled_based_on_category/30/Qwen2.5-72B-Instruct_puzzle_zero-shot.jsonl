Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the equation:**\n   - TO represents a two-digit number.\n   - GO represents a two-digit number.\n   - OUT represents a three-digit number.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Different letters cannot represent the same number.\n   - The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0 (i.e., T, G, and O).\n\n3. **Set up the equation:**\n   - TO + GO = OUT\n   - Let T = a, O = b, G = c, U = d, and the equation becomes:\n     - 10a + b + 10c + b = 100d + 10a + b\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     - 10a + b + 10c + b = 100d + 10a + b\n     - 10a + 2b + 10c = 100d + 10a + b\n     - 2b + 10c = 100d + b\n     - b + 10c = 100d\n\n4. **Analyze the equation:**\n   - Since b + 10c = 100d, the left side (b + 10c) must be a multiple of 100.\n   - The only way this can happen is if b = 0 and 10c = 100d, which simplifies to c = 10d.\n   - However, since c and d are digits (0-9), the only possible solution is c = 9 and d = 1 (as 10c must be a multiple of 100 and d must be a digit).\n\n5. **Substitute c and d back into the equation:**\n   - b + 10c = 100d\n   - b + 10(9) = 100(1)\n   - b + 90 = 100\n   - b = 10\n\n6. **Check the values:**\n   - b = 0 (since b must be a digit and the only valid value that fits the equation).\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the possible values:**\n   - T, O, G, U must be digits, and O cannot be 0.\n   - Try different combinations to satisfy the equation.\n\n8. **Test possible values:**\n   - Let's try T = 1, O = 2, G = 7, U = 9:\n     - TO = 12, GO = 72, OUT = 84\n     - 12 + 72 = 84 (which is correct).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n[[T=1, O=2, G=7, U=8]]"}

This means T must be at least 5 (since 2 * 5 = 10, which is the smallest carry-over).\n\nLet's try T = 5:\n- 2 * 55 = 110\n- This gives us L = 1, T = 5, and C = 0\n\nNow, let's verify:\n- 55 + 55 = 110\n- T = 5, L = 1, C = 0\n\nAll conditions are satisfied:\n- Different letters represent different numbers.\n- The first letter of any multi-digit number is not zero.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n[[T=5, L=1, C=0]]"}

The person who used the sugar-free diet lost 4 more pounds than the dieter who used the caveman diet.\n2. Mandy used the sugar-free diet.\n3. The friend who used the caveman diet lost somewhat more pounds than Eula.\n4. Eula is either the dieter who used the gluten-free diet or the friend who used the caveman diet.\n5. Barbara lost 7 lbs.\n\nLet's denote the pounds lost by each dieter as follows:\n- Sugar-free diet: \\( S \\)\n- Caveman diet: \\( C \\)\n- Gluten-free diet: \\( G \\)\n\nFrom clue 1: \\( S = C + 4 \\)\n\nFrom clue 2: Mandy used the sugar-free diet, so \\( S = Mandy \\).\n\nFrom clue 3: The friend who used the caveman diet lost more pounds than Eula. So, \\( C > Eula \\).\n\nFrom clue 4: Eula is either on the gluten-free diet or the caveman diet. Since \\( C > Eula \\), Eula cannot be on the caveman diet. Therefore, Eula must be on the gluten-free diet. So, \\( G = Eula \\).\n\nFrom clue 5: Barbara lost 7 lbs. So, \\( B = Barbara \\).\n\nNow we have:\n- Mandy on the sugar-free diet: \\( S = Mandy \\)\n- Eula on the gluten-free diet: \\( G = Eula \\)\n- Barbara lost 7 lbs: \\( B = 7 \\)\n\nSince \\( S = C + 4 \\) and Barbara lost 7 lbs, we need to determine the values of \\( S \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nPossible values for \\( C \\) (since \\( C \\) must be less than 7):\n- If \\( C = 3 \\), then \\( S = 3 + 4 = 7 \\). This would mean both Mandy and Barbara lost 7 lbs, which is not possible since each person lost a different amount.\n- If \\( C = 5 \\), then \\( S = 5 + 4 = 9 \\). This fits the condition.\n\nSo, \\( C = 5 \\) and \\( S = 9 \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine who lost 3 and 5 pounds:\n- Eula lost \\( G \\) pounds, and since \\( C > Eula \\), Eula must have lost 3 pounds.\n- The person who lost 5 pounds is on the caveman diet, and since Eula is not on the caveman diet, the person who lost 5 pounds must be the remaining dieter, which is Barbara.\n\nThus:\n- Mandy lost 9 pounds on the sugar-free diet.\n- Barbara lost 7 pounds (this was given).\n- The person who lost 5 pounds is on the caveman diet (since \\( C = 5 \\)), and this must be the remaining dieter, who is not Eula or Mandy, so it must be the third person.\n- Eula lost 3 pounds on the gluten-free diet.\n\nThe final arrangement in the required format is:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 Barbara Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]] \n\nHowever, since Barbara appears twice, we need to correct this. The correct arrangement should be:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 ThirdPerson Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]]\n\nBut since we need to match the exact format and the puzzle rules, we can assume the third person is not explicitly named but is inferred as the remaining person:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 ThirdPerson Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]]\n\nGiven the constraints, the most accurate and complete answer is:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 ThirdPerson Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]]\n\nHowever, to match the exact format provided in the puzzle rules:\n\n[[3 Eula Gluten-free, 5 ThirdPerson Caveman, 7 Barbara None, 9 Mandy Sugar-free]]"}

Since Green & Hayes is not mentioned in the puzzle, we assume it refers to a hypothetical hire or another company not part of the puzzle. However, we can infer that the \"Green & Hayes hire\" is not relevant to the puzzle and we should focus on the dates mentioned.\n\n3. **Determine the Specific Dates:**\n   - If Rosalie was hired 3 days after someone, and the possible dates are March 18th and March 21st, then the only logical match is:\n     - Rosalie was hired on March 21st (3 days after March 18th).\n     - Therefore, Cynthia was hired on March 18th.\n\n4. **Assign Dates to Nadine and Velez & York:**\n   - The remaining dates are March 12th and March 15th.\n   - Since Nadine was hired by Velez & York, and neither of these dates have been assigned yet, we can assign them to these dates. The order does not matter for these two, but we will assign them in the order provided in the question (12th, 15th, 18th, 21st).\n\n5. **Final Arrangement:**\n   - March 12th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 15th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 18th: Cynthia Haynes Inc.\n   - March 21st: Rosalie Haynes Inc.\n\nHowever, since we have two entries for Nadine and Velez & York, we need to differentiate them. Since the exact dates for Nadine are not specified, we can choose any two remaining dates for her:\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[12 Nadine Velez & York, 15 Nadine Velez & York, 18 Cynthia Haynes Inc., 21 Rosalie Haynes Inc.]]"}

This means one person ordered both the dragon roll and the teriyaki roll.\n\n2. **Clue 2**: Of the customer who ordered the tiger roll and Hector, one paid $11.50 and the other ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - This means Hector either paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - The customer who ordered the tiger roll either paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n\n3. **Clue 3**: Of Virginia and Ramona, one paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - This means Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n\n4. **Clue 4**: Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the person who ordered the spider roll.\n   - This means Virginia can only be associated with the rainbow roll or the spider roll.\n\n5. **Clue 5**: The customer who ordered the dragon roll, Virginia, and Ramona are three different people.\n   - This means the person who ordered the dragon roll is neither Virginia nor Ramona.\n\n6. **Clue 6**: Hector didn't order the teriyaki roll.\n   - Since the person who ordered the dragon roll ordered the teriyaki roll, Hector cannot be the person who ordered the dragon roll or the teriyaki roll.\n\n7. **Clue 7**: The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - This means the firecracker roll is associated with the $9.50 price.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction:\n\n1. **Dragon Roll and Teriyaki Roll**:\n   - The person who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll.\n   - Hector cannot be this person (Clue 6).\n\n2. **Futomaki Roll and $11.50**:\n   - From Clue 2, either Hector paid $11.50 or ordered the futomaki roll.\n   - Since the dragon roll person cannot be Hector, Hector must be the one who paid $11.50 (because the dragon roll person is not Hector and the dragon roll person ordered the teriyaki roll).\n   - Therefore, the person who ordered the futomaki roll is the one who ordered the tiger roll.\n\n3. **Virginia and Ramona**:\n   - From Clue 3, one of Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50 and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - Virginia cannot be the person who ordered the dragon roll (Clue 5).\n   - Virginia is either the person who ordered the rainbow roll or the spider roll (Clue 4).\n   - If Virginia ordered the rainbow roll, Ramona paid $15.50.\n   - If Virginia paid $15.50, Ramona ordered the rainbow roll.\n\n4. **Firecracker Roll and $9.50**:\n   - The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n\n5. **Combining the Information**:\n   - The person who ordered the firecracker roll paid $9.50.\n   - Hector paid $11.50.\n   - Virginia or Ramona paid $15.50, and the other ordered the rainbow roll.\n   - The person who ordered the dragon roll also ordered the teriyaki roll and is neither Virginia nor Ramona.\n   - The person who ordered the futomaki roll is the one who ordered the tiger roll.\n\n### Final Arrangement:\n- $9.50: Firecracker Roll\n- $11.50: Hector (Futomaki Roll or Tiger Roll)\n- $13.50: Dragon Roll (also ordered Teriyaki Roll)\n- $15.50: Virginia or Ramona (Rainbow Roll)\n\nGiven the constraints, we can deduce:\n- Virginia ordered the spider roll (since she cannot be the dragon roll person and must be the spider roll or rainbow roll).\n- Ramona paid $15.50 and ordered the rainbow roll.\n- The dragon roll person ordered the teriyaki roll and paid $13.50 (since the dragon roll person is neither Hector, Virginia, nor Ramona).\n- Hector paid $11.50 and ordered the futomaki roll (since he cannot be the teriyaki roll person).\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[9.50 firecracker spider John, 11.50 futomaki tiger Hector, 13.50 dragon teriyaki Sarah, 15.50 rainbow Virginia Ramona]]"}

Calculate inside the parentheses first:\n   - \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n\n2. Now multiply the results:\n   - \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\)\n\nThis meets the requirement of using all four numbers exactly once and achieving the result of 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[ (3 + 1) × (3 × 2) ]]"}

The only way to get a sum of 5 with the weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is to blacken the cell in the 5th row (sum = 5).\n   - Move to the second column (sum = 3). The only way to get a sum of 3 with the weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is to blacken the cell in the 3rd row (sum = 3).\n   - For the third column (sum = 15), the only way to get a sum of 15 with the weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is to blacken the cells in the 4th and 5th rows (sum = 4 + 5 = 9 and 5 + 10 = 15).\n   - For the fourth column (sum = 13), the only way to get a sum of 13 with the weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is to blacken the cells in the 3rd and 5th rows (sum = 3 + 10 = 13).\n   - For the fifth column (sum = 13), the only way to get a sum of 13 with the weights 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is to blacken the cells in the 3rd and 5th rows (sum = 3 + 10 = 13).\n\n4. **Verify the rows:**\n   - First row (sum = 13): The only way to get 13 is by blackening the cells in the 5th column (weight = 5) and 4th column (weight = 4) (sum = 5 + 8 = 13).\n   - Second row (sum = 3): The only way to get 3 is by blackening the cell in the 3rd column (weight = 3).\n   - Third row (sum = 14): The only way to get 14 is by blackening the cells in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th columns (sum = 3 + 4 + 7 = 14).\n   - Fourth row (sum = 13): The only way to get 13 is by blackening the cells in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th columns (sum = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13).\n   - Fifth row (sum = 12): The only way to get 12 is by blackening the cells in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th columns (sum = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12).\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[0 0 0 1 1, 0 0 1 0 0, 0 0 1 1 1, 0 0 1 1 1, 0 0 1 1 1]]"}

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and their positions.**\n2. **Analyze each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to find missing numbers.**\n3. **Use logical deduction to fill in the blanks.**\n4. **Verify the solution against the Sudoku rules.**\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Setup\nGiven puzzle:\n```\n2 X X 7 5 X X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X X\nX X X 3 X 4 X X X\n5 2 X X X 6 4 X X\nX 4 X X 3 X X 5 X\nX X X X X 8 9 X 6\nX X 4 X X X 2 X X\nX X 7 X X X X 9 X\n9 5 X X X X 6 7 3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Puzzle\nWe'll go through each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to fill in the missing numbers.\n\n#### Row 1\n- 2 X X 7 5 X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 7, 5, 3, 4. So, the missing numbers in this subgrid are 1, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5, 7. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n\nBy logical deduction, we can place numbers in the first row:\n- 2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n\n#### Row 2\n- X X 5 X X X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 1, 9, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 4. So, the missing number is 1 (but already used in the subgrid).\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5, 6, 8, 4.

Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Grid Setup**: We have a 5x5 grid, and we need to fill it with numbers from 1 to 5, ensuring no repeats in any row or column.\n\n2. **Region Rules**:\n   - (1,1)(2,1)(3,1):12+ → The sum of the numbers in the first column from rows 1 to 3 is 12.\n   - (3,4)(4,4)(5,4):12+ → The sum of the numbers in the fourth column from rows 3 to 5 is 12.\n   - (1,2)(1,3)(2,2):8+ → The sum of the numbers in the first row from columns 2 to 3 and the second row from column 2 is 8.\n   - (1,4)(1,5):4* → The product of the numbers in the first row from columns 4 to 5 is 4.\n   - (2,3)(2,4):6* → The product of the numbers in the second row from columns 3 to 4 is 6.\n   - (2,5)(3,5):3- → The difference between the numbers in the second row, column 5 and the third row, column 5 is 3.\n   - (3,2)(3,3):3- → The difference between the numbers in the third row, column 2 and the third row, column 3 is 3.\n   - (4,1)(4,2):5* → The product of the numbers in the fourth row, columns 1 and 2 is 5.\n   - (5,1)(5,2):1- → The difference between the numbers in the fifth row, columns 1 and 2 is 1.\n   - (4,3)(5,3):2÷ → The quotient of the numbers in the fourth row, column 3 and the fifth row, column 3 is 2.\n   - (4,5)(5,5):2- → The difference between the numbers in the fourth row, column 5 and the fifth row, column 5 is 2.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - **First Column (12+)**:\n     - (1,1) + (2,1) + (3,1) = 12\n     - Possible combinations: (1, 5, 6), (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 5)\n     - Since the grid is 5x5, the only valid combination is (1, 4, 7) but 7 is not in the range 1-5. Thus, the only valid combination is (2, 4, 6) or (3, 4, 5).\n     - Let's try (2, 4, 6) first:\n       - (1,1) = 2, (2,1) = 4, (3,1) = 6 (invalid as 6 is not in the range).\n       - Let's try (3, 4, 5):\n       - (1,1) = 3, (2,1) = 4, (3,1) = 5\n\n   - **Fourth Column (12+)**:\n     - (3,4) + (4,4) + (5,4) = 12\n     - Possible combinations: (1, 4, 7), (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 5)\n     - Since we need numbers from 1 to 5 and we already used 3, 4, 5 in the first column, the only valid combination is (2, 4, 6) but 6 is not in the range.

Since (1,3) must be greater than (1,4) and (1,2) must be less than (1,3), the only possible values are:\n     - (1,2) = 1, (1,3) = 3, (1,4) = 2\n   - The remaining value for (1,1) is 4.\n   - So, Row 1 is [4, 1, 3, 2].\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - (1,1) < (2,1) implies (2,1) must be greater than 4, so (2,1) can be 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Since 4 is already used in Row 1, (2,1) must be 1 or 2.\n   - We need to check the remaining values for the row:\n     - If (2,1) = 1, then the remaining values are 2, 3, 4.\n     - If (2,1) = 2, then the remaining values are 1, 3, 4.\n   - Given the constraints, let's try (2,1) = 2:\n     - The remaining values are 1, 3, 4.\n     - We can place 1, 3, and 4 in the remaining positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) such that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - So, Row 2 is [2, 4, 1, 3].\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - (3,2) < (3,3) and (3,2) > (4,2) imply that (3,3) is greater than (3,2) and (3,2) is greater than (4,2).\n   - Possible values for (3,2) and (3,3) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since (3,2) must be less than (3,3) and greater than (4,2), the only possible values are:\n     - (3,2) = 2, (3,3) = 4, (4,2) = 1\n   - The remaining values for (3,1) and (3,4) are 1 and 3.\n   - Since (3,4) < (4,4), (3,4) must be 1 and (4,4) must be 3.\n   - So, Row 3 is [3, 2, 4, 1].\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - (4,2) = 1 and (4,4) = 3 are already known.\n   - The remaining values for (4,1) and (4,3) are 2 and 4.\n   - Since (3,4) < (4,4), (4,3) must be 2 and (4,1) must be 4.\n   - So, Row 4 is [4, 1, 2, 3].\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n4 1 3 2\n2 4 1 3\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[4 1 3 2,2 4 1 3,3 2 4 1,4 1 2 3]]"}

We can place the tent next to one of the trees.\n   - **Column 4**: It has 0 tents, so no C can be placed in this column.\n\n4. **Iterative Placement**:\n   - Continue placing tents while ensuring all rules are followed and constraints are met.\n\n### Final Solution:\n\nAfter carefully placing the tents and verifying the constraints, the final grid looks like this:\n\n```\nX C X T X C X X T X\nX X X X X X X T X X\nX X X C T T X X T X\nX X X X X X X C X X\nT T X C X T X X X T\nT X X X X T X X X X\nX X X T X T X X X X\nX X X X X X X T X X\nX T X X X X X T X T\nX X X X X T X C X X\n```\n\n### Verification:\n- **Row 1**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Row 2**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Row 3**: 2 tents (C)\n- **Row 4**: 2 tents (C)\n- **Row 5**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Row 6**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Row 7**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Row 8**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Row 9**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Row 10**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Column 1**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Column 2**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Column 3**: 4 tents (C)\n- **Column 4**: 0 tents\n- **Column 5**: 2 tents (C)\n- **Column 6**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Column 7**: 3 tents (C)\n- **Column 8**: 1 tent (C)\n- **Column 9**: 2 tents (C)\n- **Column 10**: 3 tents (C)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```\n[[X C X T X C X X T X, X X X X X X X T X X, X X X C T T X X T X, X X X X X X X C X X, T T X C X T X X X T, T X X X X T X X X X, X X X T X T X X X X, X X X X X X X T X X, X T X X X X X T X T, X X X X X T X C X X]]\n```"}

An inflection point is where the direction changes. Here's how we can break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the starting point and the end point**: Since the starting point and end point are not explicitly marked, we will assume the start is at the top-left corner (1,1) and the end is at the bottom-right corner (3,3).\n\n2. **Trace the path**:\n   - Start at (1,1) and move in the direction of the arrow.\n   - Follow the arrows strictly and note each cell where the direction changes.\n\n3. **Mark inflection points**:\n   - Assign a number to each inflection point in the order they are encountered.\n   - Cells that are not part of the path are marked with 0.\n\nLet's trace the path step-by-step:\n\n- Start at (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - Move to (1,2) with arrow ↓.\n  - Inflection point at (1,2) (direction changes from → to ↓).\n  - Move to (2,2) with arrow ↖.\n  - Inflection point at (2,2) (direction changes from ↓ to ↖).\n  - Move to (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - This is a loop, so we need to re-evaluate the path.\n\nRe-evaluating the path:\n- Start at (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - Move to (1,2) with arrow ↓.\n  - Inflection point at (1,2) (direction changes from → to ↓).\n  - Move to (2,2) with arrow ↖.\n  - Inflection point at (2,2) (direction changes from ↓ to ↖).\n  - Move to (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - This is a loop, so we need to find an alternative path.\n\nRe-evaluating the path again:\n- Start at (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - Move to (1,2) with arrow ↓.\n  - Inflection point at (1,2) (direction changes from → to ↓).\n  - Move to (2,2) with arrow ↖.\n  - Inflection point at (2,2) (direction changes from ↓ to ↖).\n  - Move to (1,1) with arrow →.\n  - Move to (1,3) with arrow ↓.\n  - Inflection point at (1,3) (direction changes from → to ↓).\n  - Move to (2,3) with arrow ↓.\n  - Inflection point at (2,3) (direction changes from ↓ to ↓).\n  - Move to (3,3) with arrow ○ (end point).\n\nNow, we mark the inflection points:\n- (1,2) is the first inflection point.\n- (2,2) is the second inflection point.\n- (1,3) is the third inflection point.\n- (2,3) is the fourth inflection point.\n\nThe final grid marking the inflection points is:\n[[1 0 3,4 0 2,5 0 0]]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n[[1 0 3,4 0 2,5 0 0]]"}
