A = 3\n    - B = 5\n    - A_inv = 9\n- Formula:\n    - Encryption: y = (Ax + B) mod 26\n    - Decryption: x = A_inv * (y - B) % 26\n\nThe key point is that **AfCipher** encryption and decryption operations each follow a unique encryption and decryption in terms of affine alphabet, constant values, and formula derivation.\n\nGiven an understanding of the **AfCipher** operation, let's implement it in Python code.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"_summary_\"\"\"\n\nclass Cryptopanalysis:\n    def __init__(self, plaintext: str) -> None:\n        self.plaintext = plaintext.upper()\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _init_affine_alphabet() -> list:\n        \"\"\"Create an affine alphabet.\n\n        Returns:\n            List[str]: affine alphabet list\n        \"\"\"\n        affine_alphabet_str = \"XMJQUDONPRGTVBWFAKSHZCYEIL\"\n        affine_alphabet_list = [\n            affine_alphabet_str[i] for i in range(len(affine_alphabet_str))\n        ]\n        return affine_alphabet_list\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _init_constant_value() -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Create a dict of constant values.\n\n        Returns:\n            dict: constant value dict\n        \"\"\"\n        constant_value_dict = {\n            \"A\": 3,\n            \"A_inv\": 9,\n            \"B\": 5,\n        }\n        return constant_value_dict\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def _convert_str_to_list(plaintext: str) -> list:\n        \"\"\"Convert plaintext by str to list\n\n        Returns:\n            list: plaintext by list\n        \"\"\"\n        return [plaintext[i] for i in range(len(plaintext))]\n\n    def _create_affine_alphabet_dict(self) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Create affine alphabet upper dict\n\n        Returns:\n            dict: affine alphabet upper dict\n        \"\"\"\n\n        affine_alphabet_list = self._init_affine_alphabet()\n        affine_alphabet_dict = {\n            ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(affine_alphabet_list)}\n\n        return affine_alphabet_dict\n\n    def _create_affine_alphabet_list(self) -> list:\n        \"\"\"Create affine alphabet upper dict\n\n        Returns:\n            dict: affine alphabet upper dict\n        \"\"\"\n        affine_alphabet_str = \"XMJQUDONPRGTVBWFAKSHZCYEIL\"\n        affine_alphabet_list = [\n            affine_alphabet_str[i] for i in range(len(affine_alphabet_str))\n        ]\n        return affine_alphabet_list\n\n    def encrypt(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Encrypt the given plaintext using the encryption algorithm specified in the rules.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n        Returns:\n            str: Encrypted message.\n        \"\"\"\n        affine_alphabet_list = self._init_affine_alphabet()\n        constant_value_dict = self._init_constant_value()\n        A = constant_value_dict[\"A\"]\n        B = constant_value_dict[\"B\"]\n        affine_alphabet_dict = {\n            affine_alphabet_list[i]: i for i in range(len(affine_alphabet_list))}\n        encrypted_message = []\n        for character in self.plaintext:\n            x = affine_alphabet_dict.get(character)\n            if x is not None:\n                y = (A * x + B) % 26\n                encrypted_message.append(affine_alphabet_list[y])\n        return \"\".join(encrypted_message)\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Decrypt the given ciphertext using the decryption algorithm specified in the rules.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n        Returns:\n            str: Decrypted ciphertext.\n        \"\"\"\n        affine_alphabet_list = self._init_affine_alphabet()\n        constant_value_dict = self._init_constant_value()\n        A_inv = constant_value_dict[\"A_inv\"]\n        B = constant_value_dict[\"B\"]\n        affine_alphabet_dict = {\n            affine_alphabet_list[i]: i for i in range(len(affine_alphabet_list))}\n\n        decrypted_characters = []\n        for character in ciphertext:\n            y = affine_alphabet_dict.get(character)\n            if y is not None:\n                x = (A_inv * (y -

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"H\"\nperiod: 14\nincrement: 3\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[BIKE]]\n\nBased on the provided rules, we can perform the encryption and decryption tasks as described. For the questions given, here are the correct answers following the detailed steps outlined:\n\n### Answers\n\n**Encrypted Answer for \"W\":**\n\n- \"W\" is found at row 2, column 1 in Gird1.\n- The corresponding position in Gird2 is the letter \"K\" at row 1, column 5.\n- \"W\" is also found at row 3, column 5 in Gird4.\n- The corresponding position in Gird3 is the letter \"H\" at row 4, column 5.\n\nHowever, the encryption steps should be reversed for decryption, so the correct process for decryption would be:\n\n- Find \"K\" in Gird2, which is at row 1, column 5, and the corresponding letter in Gird1 is \"W\" at row 2, column 1.\n- Find \"H\" in Gird3, which is at row 4, column 5, and the corresponding letter in Gird4 is \"W\" at row 3, column 5.\n\nSince the question asks for the encryption of \"W\", but the explanation seems to decrypt it, let’s clarify:\n\nThe encryption of \"W\" should follow the encryption steps, which means finding \"W\" in Gird1 and Gird4 then finding the corresponding letter in Gird2 and Gird3. But the instruction seems to be asking for decryption steps, so:\n\n\"KW\" is incorrectly mentioned as the encrypted form. Correctly, if we follow decryption rules as stated:\n\n- \"K\" is found at row 1, column 5 in Gird2, and the corresponding letter in Gird1 is \"W\" at row 2, column 1.\n- \"H\" is found at row 4, column 5 in Gird3, and the corresponding letter in Gird4 is \"W\" at row 3, column 5.\n\nGiven the instruction asks for decryption rules, the process provided seems more for decryption. Correctly following encryption steps is not executed above.\n\nFor accurate encryption of \"W\":\n\n- Find \"W\" in Gird1 at row 2, column 1, and the corresponding in Gird2 is \"K\".\n- \"W\" in Gird4 at row 3, column 5, corresponds to \"H\" in Gird3.\n\nSo the accurate encrypted form using steps precisely as asked for \"W\" correctly is indeed \"KH\".\n\nIf the rule applied is for encryption, the correct format should be:\n\n### Answer for Encryption of \"W\":\n[[KH]]\n\nFor the question on decryption, the process is clarified as above, following the decryption rules given in the guidelines.\n\nFor the dataset:\n\n**Ciphertext Answer for \"AVFH\":**\n- Decrypt \"AV\" to \"OK\"\n- Decrypt \"FH\" to \"SX\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n[[OKSX]]\n\nClarifications:\n\n- \"SX\" is incorrectly provided as the complete answer, \"OKSX\" is correct following decryption rules given.\n\nFollowing the outlined steps, subsequent answers will be provided according to the instructions given for each case scenario. The misunderstanding in the original response regarding \"W\" highlights the need for careful adherence to the steps and correct interpretation of the instructions provided.\n\n\n\n### Revised Answers with Explanation\n\n\n**Questions:**\n\n**1.** Encrypt \"W\".\n\n**Decryption process:**\n\n- The question asks for \"encryption\" but gives a decryption explanation. Given instructions, clues it asks for decryption actually.\n\nWhen following decryption steps:\n\n* \"W\" is identified in Gird1 and Gird4.\n* In Gird2 and Gird3, letters in these positions can be \"K\" and \"H\", respectively.\n* Therefore, decrypted group is \"KH\".\n\nGiven question seems contrasting. For accurate encryption:\n\n- In Gird1, \"W\" is at row 2, column 1; corresponding letter in Gird2 is \"K\".\n- In Gird4, \"W\" is at row 3, column 5; corresponding letter in Gird3 is \"H\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[KH]]\n\n**2.** Decrypt \"FH\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[SX]]\n\n**3.** Decrypt \"AVFH\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[OKSX]]\n\n**4.** Decrypt \"VB\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[DJ]]\n\n**5.** Decrypt \"IER\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[TSXX]]\n\n**6.** Decrypt \"ROOF\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[BIKE]]\n\nThese decryption answers are based on the given instructions and the grids. Following the instructions to the letter may sometimes lead to variations in the decryption process if the rule application is misunderstood. It's crucial to follow the rule as described for accurate encryption and decryption."}

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Maximum number of characters per line: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Lines are counted from 1.\n    - The plaintext is arranged in a special way: an odd number of lines are written from left to right, and an even number of lines are written from right to left, with a maximum of five letters per line.\n        - For example, for the plaintext \"LIDAHELLOWORLD\", first write the first line, from left to right as LIDAH, and then write the second line, from right to left as WOLLE, and then write the third line, from left to right as ORLD, the entire content of the finished writing is expressed as follows\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then read by column, each column is read from the top down, each read a column plus a \"#\", read out the contents of the final ciphertext.\n        - For example, the above written content is read as LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE# by column.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character in the ciphertext, it is written from top to bottom; if it encounters #, it switches to the next column and continues writing until the entire ciphertext has been written.\n        - For example, for the ciphertext LWO#IOR#DLL#ALD#HE#,it is written as\n        LIDAH\n        WOLLE\n        ORLD\n    - Then according to the odd-numbered rows from left to right read, the even number of rows from right to left read the order of sequential reading, the final result is the decrypted plaintext.\n        - For example, for the above written content, the first line, read from left to right as LIDAH, the second line, read from right to left as ELLOW, the third line, read from left to right as ORLD, and ultimately the entire content connected, decrypted plaintext as LIDAHELLOWORLD.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"MMRWZX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
