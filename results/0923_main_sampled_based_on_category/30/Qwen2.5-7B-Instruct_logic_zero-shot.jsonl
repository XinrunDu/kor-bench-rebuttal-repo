Through an analysis of similarities and differences, we first examined a group of families whose parents adopted an educational style that actively participated and encouraged the expression of emotions. Children in these families demonstrated higher levels of emotional intelligence, showing greater emotional expression and problem-solving skills. In contrast, the other group of parents adopted a passive and negative educational style with little involvement in their children's emotional expression and problem-solving processes. In these families, the children had significantly lower EQ development and showed emotional suppression and inadequate problem-solving skills. Therefore, we conclude that a family education style that actively participates in and encourages the expression of emotions significantly contributes to the development of children's emotional intelligence.\n\nThe causal derivation of this discourse is consistent with which approach:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}
