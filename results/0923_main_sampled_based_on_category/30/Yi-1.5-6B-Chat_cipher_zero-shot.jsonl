Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"G\" using the given cipher rules, we follow the steps outlined in the encryption rules.\n\n1. **Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters.** Since the plaintext only has one character, \"G\", it is considered a single character block.\n\n2. **Determine the grid for the current block.** For a single-character block, the block number \\(i = 0\\). So, we calculate the grid index as \\(grid\\_index = (0 // 5) \\mod 8\\). Since \\(0 // 5 = 0\\), and \\(0 \\mod 8 = 0\\), we use the first grid for encryption.\n\n3. **Encrypt the character \"G\" using the selected grid.** Grid 0 starts with the characters:\n   ```\n   Grid0: | P | H | I | L | S | ...\n   ```\n   The character \"G\" is not in this grid, so it is treated as is and added to the encrypted block. Therefore, the encrypted block is:\n   ```\n   Encrypted block: G\n   ```\n\n4. **Connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.** Since there's only one character, no further connection is needed.\n\nThe encrypted plaintext is \"G\" itself, as \"G\" is not encrypted according to the rules.\n\nTherefore, the answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n```\n[[G]]\n```"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"EV\" and following the encryption rules, let's encrypt the text step by step.\n\n1. **Cleaning up the plaintext:** The plaintext \"EV\" is already in uppercase letters and does not have any spaces or non-alphabetic characters. No changes are needed.\n\n2. **Adjusting for odd length:** The plaintext is of odd length (2 letters), so we add a letter 'X' to make it of even length. Now, the plaintext is \"EVX\".\n\n3. **Splitting into double-letter groups:** The plaintext is already in double letters, so we directly proceed to step 4.\n\n4. **Using the Girds for encryption:**\n   - In Gird1 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'E') and Gird4 (positioned correctly for the first letter 'V'), we find the letters in the respective positions marked by arrows.\n   - In Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters corresponding to these two positions marked by arrows.\n\n   Plaintext: | **E** | **V**\n               | (1,1) | (3,2)\n               | **↑**  | **↑** \n\n   Gird1:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n   Gird2:    | E  C  H  O  A | B  D  F  G  I | J  K  L  M  N | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z |\n   Gird3:    | V  O  R  T  E | X  A  B  C  D | F  G  H  I  J | K  L  M  N  P | S  U  W  Y  Z |\n   Gird4:    | K  L  M  N  O | P  R  S  T  U | V  W  X  Y  Z | A  B  C  D  E | F  G  H  I  J |\n\n   - From Gird1 and Gird4, the positions of 'E' and 'V' are (1,1) and (3,2) respectively. Corresponding to these positions in Gird2 and Gird3, we find the letters 'K' and 'X'.\n\n5. **Concatenating:** The encrypted double-letter group is \"KX\".\n\n6. **Final ciphertext:** The final ciphertext, after encrypting the double-letter group \"EV\", is \"KX\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is: [[KX]]."}

Remove spaces and punctuation and convert all letters to uppercase. Since \"R\" is already uppercase and without any punctuation or spaces, no further action is needed.\n2. The letter \"R\" is located in the 19th position in the alphabet. Since the grid starts with the letters M, K, G, W, B (row headers) and B, E, H, I (bottom column letters), we need to find the position of \"R\" in the grid.\n3. \"R\" is in the row starting with \"W\" and in the column that ends with \"I\". The row header for \"R\" is \"K\" and the column footer is \"I\".\n4. According to the encryption rules, we concatenate the row header and column footer into a binary.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's follow the decryption steps as described by the rules to decrypt the given ciphertext into plaintext.\n\nCiphertext: \"VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#\"\n\nWe break this down according to the decryption rule's instructions, which involves writing the ciphertext from top to bottom, switching to the next column when encountering a #, and reading in the opposite order of the encryption (odd rows from left to right, even rows from right to left):\n\n1. Write the ciphertext from top to bottom:\n   - VHFF\n   - CEC#\n   - FAYN\n   - WUC#\n   - CLWS\n   - LWC#\n   - EFUC\n   - VGK#\n   - DBKF\n   - CNC#\n\n2. According to the decryption rule, read odd-numbered rows from left to right and even rows from right to left:\n   - Reading left to right for odd-numbered rows: VHFF, CEC#, FAYN, WUC#, CLWS, EFUC, VGK#, DBKF, CNC#\n   - Reading right to left for even-numbered rows: LWC#, LWC#\n\nCombining these, we get the following sequence:\n\n- VHFF\n- CEC#\n- FAYN\n- WUC#\n- CLWS\n- EFUC\n- VGK#\n- DBKF\n- CNC#\n- LWC#\n- LWC#\n\nReading this sequence column by column (with # as a separator) gives us:\n\n- VHFFCEC#\n- FAYNWUC#\n- CLWSLWC#\n- EFUNGK#\n- DBKFCC#\n- LWC#LWC#\n\nNow, combining these back into a single string and removing the #:\n\nPlaintext: VHFFCECFAYNWUCCLWSLWCEFUCVGKDBFKFCNCLLWC\n\nHowever, this plaintext doesn't match the expected output from the given ciphertext \"VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#\". Upon re-examining the decryption steps, it seems there's a mistake in the process. The decryption rule instructs us to read odd-numbered rows from left to right and even rows from right to left, but this order should only apply within each column. We should not switch the order between columns because the rule for reading even rows from right to left only applies within the same column.\n\nLet's correct the decryption process:\n\n1. Write the ciphertext from top to bottom:\n   - VHFF\n   - CEC#\n   - FAYN\n   - WUC#\n   - CLWS\n   - LWC#\n   - EFUC\n   - VGK#\n   - DBKF\n   - CNC#\n\n2. Reading each column from top to bottom (no switching of direction between columns):\n   - VHF\n   - CEE\n   - FYN\n   - WUC\n   - CLS\n   - LWC\n   - EUC\n   - VGK\n   - DBK\n   - CNC\n   - LWC\n\nCombining these, we get the following sequence:\n\n- VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#LWC\n\nNow, we read in the original order of reading (odd rows from left to right, even rows from left to right):\n\n- Reading left to right for odd-numbered rows: VHFF, CEC#, FAYN, WUC#, CLWS, LWC#, EFUC, VGK#, DBKF, CNC#, LWC\n- Reading left to right for even-numbered rows: LWC#\n\nCombining these:\n\nPlaintext: VHFFCECFAYNWUCCLWSLWCEFUCVGKDBFKFCNCLLWC\n\nThis plaintext still doesn't match the expected output from the given ciphertext \"VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#\", indicating that there's a misunderstanding in the decryption process as described by the rules. The # character in the ciphertext should indicate the end of a character in a column and not a switch in reading direction for a single character.\n\nGiven the confusion in the instruction and the necessity to switch direction based on the row number, let's clarify that the decryption should involve writing each character from top to bottom and reading the rows sequentially without switching direction based on the row number. The # characters in the ciphertext should be treated as delimiters for each character in the column, not as a signal to change reading direction within a single character.\n\nRevising the decryption process with this understanding:\n\nCiphertext: \"VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#\"\n\n1. Write the ciphertext from top to bottom:\n   - VHFF\n   - CEC#\n   - FAYN\n   - WUC#\n   - CLWS\n   - LWC#\n   - EFUC\n   - VGK#\n   - DBKF\n   - CNC#\n\n2. Reading each column from top to bottom:\n   - VHFF\n   - CEC#\n   - FAYN\n   - WUC#\n   - CLWS\n   - LWC#\n   - EFUC\n   - VGK#\n   - DBKF\n   - CNC#\n   - LWC#\n   - LWC\n\nCombining these, we get the following sequence:\n\n- VHFFCECFFAYNWUCCLWSLWCEFUCVGKDBFKFCNCLLWC\n\nThis plaintext still doesn't match the expected output from the given ciphertext \"VHFFCEC#FAYNWUC#CLWSLWC#EFUCVGK#DBKFCNC#\", indicating a deeper issue with the consistency of the decryption rule as initially provided.

Write the ciphertext row by row to fill the grid:\n\n```\n[['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],\n ['#', '#', 'U', 'H', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n ['#', '#', 'M', 'F', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],\n ['#', '#', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']]\n```\n\n2.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the plaintext \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\", let's apply the specified encryption rules step by step to obtain the encrypted message.\n\nFirst, we divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters each:\n- \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nSince the length of the plaintext is 16 letters, we only have one block. Now, we'll follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. **Filling the Grid and Rotating the Template:**\n   - Place the template on a blank grid with the holes aligned.\n   - Start filling the grid with the letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the template.\n   - After filling the first letter, rotate the template counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n\n2. **Repeating the Filling and Rotation Process:**\n   - Continue filling the grid with the next letters of the plaintext message through the holes in the rotated template.\n   - Rotate the template again after each fill until the grid is completely filled. If the message is shorter than 16 letters, fill the remaining positions with filler characters (e.g., '#').\n\n3. **Reading the Grid:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line.\n   - This will give us the encrypted message for that block.\n\nGiven the complexity of the operation and the need to visualize the grid and template movements, I'll demonstrate the encryption process with the first few letters:\n\n- **First Letter (K):** Place 'K' in the top-left hole of the template and fill it. Rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n- **Second Letter (G):** Place 'G' in the first hole of the next row, filling it. Rotate again.\n- **Continuing this process:** Continue placing letters and rotating until the grid is filled.\n\nAfter following these steps for the entire plaintext, we get the following encrypted grid:\n\n```\n[\n  ['N', 'R', 'P', 'Z'],\n  ['I', 'D', 'F', 'G'],\n  ['O', 'A', 'K', 'H'],\n  ['F', 'V', 'X', 'E']\n]\n```\n\nNow, read the contents of the grid line by line to get the encrypted message: \"NIRPZIDFGIOAKHFVXE\"\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets, is:\n\n```\n[[NIRPZIDFGIOAKHFVXE]]\n```"}

Convert the plaintext character to binary:\n   - The ASCII value of 'O' is 79.\n   - The binary representation of 79 is `0100111` (since we are using 7 bits to represent characters and the highest bit is always 0 for positive ASCII values).\n\n2. Perform XOR operation with the fixed key:\n   - The fixed key is '10101010'.\n   - XORing the binary representation of 'O' (0100111) with the fixed key (10101010) gives us:\n     ```\n     0100111\n    ⊕ 10101010\n     --------\n       1110010\n     ```\n   - So, the XOR result is the binary string '1110010'.\n\n3. Apply the permutation:\n   - Since there's only one character, we apply the permutation table directly to the result:\n     ```\n     1110010\n     --------\n     11111110\n     ```\n   - This gives us the encrypted binary: '11111110'.\n\n4.
