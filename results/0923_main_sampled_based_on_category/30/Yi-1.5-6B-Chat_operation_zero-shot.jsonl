Since f(x) is the derivative of ln|x|, the integral of f(x) from a to b is ln|b| - ln|a|. However, since f(x) = 1/x and a and b are both positive (ln(2) + 6 is positive), we can simplify this to ln(b) - ln(a) = ln(b/a).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the operation rule:\n\na●(ln(2) + 6) = ln(ln(2) + 6) - ln(a) + 6\n\nWe are given that a●(ln(2) + 6) = ln(2) + 6, so we can set up the equation:\n\nln(ln(2) + 6) - ln(a) + 6 = ln(2) + 6\n\nTo solve for a, we first subtract 6 from both sides:\n\nln(ln(2) + 6) - ln(a) = ln(2)\n\nNow, we use the property of logarithms that ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b) to combine the terms on the left side:\n\nln((ln(2) + 6)/a) = ln(2)\n\nSince the natural logarithm function is one-to-one, we can equate the arguments inside the logarithms:\n\n(ln(2) + 6)/a = 2\n\nNow, we solve for a:\n\na = (ln(2) + 6)/2\n\nTo ensure the answer is a single number and wrapped in double square brackets as required, the answer is:\n\n[[ (ln(2) + 6)/2 ]]"}
