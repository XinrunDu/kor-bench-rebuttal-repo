Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[GG]]One possible decryption for the given ciphertext, \"XX\", is \"GU\". This is consistent with the rules of the cipher, as A is mapped to D, and X is mapped to G. The decryption steps would be:\n1. A maps to the next letter D in Reel2 (encoded as 1).\n2. Follows the direction of the ciphertext, going to Reel9 (encoded as 2).\n3. X maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n4. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n5. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n6. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n7. J maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n8. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n9. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n10. Moves to Reel22 (encoded as 21).\n11. O maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n12. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n13. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n14. Moves to Reel21 (encoded as 20).\n15. W maps to U (decoded as that's how the cipher works), encoded as 9.\n16. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n17. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n18. Moves to Reel20 (encoded as 19).\n19. N maps to G in Reel14 (encoded as 13, meaning +6 for wraparound).\n20. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n21. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is G, encoded as 12.\n22. Moves to Reel17 (encoded as 15).\n23. J maps to G in Reel10 (encoded as -2, meaning -2 for wraparound).\n24. Moves to Reel12 (encoded as +2).\n25. L maps to U in Reel19 (encoded as -1).\n26. Returns to Reel1 (encoded as 0).\n27. Moves to the previous letter in Reel1 (decoded as that's how the cipher works), which is U, encoded as 9.\n28. Moves to Reel18 (encoded as 17).\n29. V maps to G in Reel17 (encoded as 0).\nThus, the decrypted answer is \"GU\".\n\nBecause this is not a computer program, I am unable to format the output in a specific way.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[./.]]\nBased on the information provided, here's a simplified version of the rules:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Blue: Prepare the morse_code Table and Numerical-Index Mapping Table.\n2. Blue: Take the plaintext and convert each character to its corresponding Morse code, adding a / between each character.\n3. Blue: Divide the Morse code into two pairs of characters. Convert them into their corresponding numeric strings using the Mapping Table.\n4. Purple: Join the numeric strings into a single string, adding an extra .. if the input text length is odd.\n5. Green: Divide the ciphertext into pairs of digits.\n6. Green: Convert each pair to its corresponding character pair using the Mapping Table.\n7. Green: Combine the character pairs to form the final morse_code, adding an extra / if the input ciphertext length is odd.\n8. Purple: Convert each character pair of morse_code to its Uppercase counterpart using the morse_code table.\n9. Green: Join the plaintext characters to form the final output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThese rules represent the simplified workflow of the cipher. The steps are clear and concise. However, for greater clarity and precision, adding the functions used to improve understanding can be helpful. For instance, a \"convert_morse\" function could be defined for step 9 (Purple) to demonstrate how the characters are converted back to their uppercase counterparts in the plaintext.\n\n### Rule Variations:\n\n1. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in decryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n2. The character i '.' maps directly to 7 in the decryption step, bypassing the numeric-index mapping table.\n3. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in encryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n4. Adding an additional step in the decryption process to handle the extra '/' symbol if the input ciphertext has an odd number of digits doesn't impact the accuracy of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Changes in Explanation:\n\n1. The rule variations no longer apply to the simplified rules, as they are beyond the scope of the simplification process.\n\nThe modified rules and explanation clarify the simplified workflow of the Keyword Exclusive _Tagram Cipher, while ensuring they adhere to the question restrictions."}

L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.", "prompt": "You are an intelligent assistant that specializes in encryption and decryption tasks.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Block Decryption:\n        - Convert Hex to Bytes: Convert each block from hexadecimal string to bytes.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key.\n        - Inverse Permute: Perform an inverse permutation by rotating each byte right by 1 bit.\n        - Substitute: Use INV_S_BOX to replace the high four and low four bits in a block of bytes and splice them together.\n        - XOR with Key: Apply XOR between the byte block and the fixed key again.\n    3. Convert Bytes to Text: Convert the decrypted byte blocks back to text using ASCII decoding.\n    4. Remove Padding: Remove any padding characters (\\x00) from the end of the decrypted plaintext.\n    5. Concatenate: Concatenate all the decrypted blocks to form the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"R\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
