While carnivores and herbivores couldn't live in the same neighborhoods, they were all neighbors in the urban kingdom of Animal City. In this world, these distant families were as close as possible at the smallest level. In an interview conducted by a member of city planning, Prince Hmmm, he revealed a revolutionary new blueprint called a \"grid program.\" Whether there were obstructions or not, all the tiny legions of animals within the city were capable of moving independently and freely. As a result, the legendary environment for animals was basically set up. In Zootopia, essentially every opening animal was acquainted with the other guy. They hailed from different parts of the city, worked different jobs, had unique personalities and even excited new experiences.  Zootopia Emergency Rules and Guidelines.\n\n### Interactive Segment A\nWhile searching for a job, one time, Nick Wilde was hunting for small fish in the Arctic tundra and took a break by drinking tea from the roadside ice cream shop. While drinking his tea, he saw an Otter walking toward him, a fast-moving creature, very different from the sloth he was used to.\nThe sloth he was used to was wearing a single-strap backpack on his back, but the shape looked the same except for the color.\nLater, while a car ran by and splashed him with mud, the sloth and her family moved to an area with better opportunities.\nJust like this sloth we see in Zootopia, even in our everyday life, we may come across an animal that we don't recognize at first glance or don't share our appearance. But as we take the time to get to know each other, we may find that we are more similar than different after all.\nExperts also have a responsibility to display this professional dignity, even if it goes beyond work time. With this in mind, it is an honor to set up a website that is integrated with the Zootopia world. We believe this issue is critical to the textile sector in recent years and the implementation of social responsibility in the sector."}

Befitting the name, it was an excellent flier and was best recognized for its agility. In spite of carrying heavy armor pieces, it was quick and nimble.\nDescription\nWhen Hiccup's team encountered the one Rumblebee in the trapdoor dragon nest, Race's tire tread flattened on them and grappled, sending everyone summarily tumbling into the fray. Astrid held Race back and Shika let out a threatening bark, his armor armor spreading open as though in shock or discomfort to this Argus' presence.\nThe Shika was one of the lightest creatures to ever serve as a transport on Berk. Its fully padded armor was skillfully designed to allow it to stay mobile and offer protection all around its body. It's design kept it both light and mobile.\nShika was the only Viking ever to bear the title of Ocean Class competitor, having come in 3rd place for both the 2012 and 2013 race. It was later modified to allow it to include 'King class Viking battle armor', which increased its carrying capacity. It did not show any difficulties with its armor, as it did before, due to the lack of issues it had had in the past.\nOriginally, Shika was a pre-established Concept-Shika, and was used as a pilot for the Viking unit's teams in the Ocean Class. Its body type was similar to that of Stormfly, and as a result, it had joint designs and features similar to that of a Stormfly.\nEngaging its body through sheer brute force, Race struck down several pairs of the crab's jaws, rupturing and destroying them. Gurtchen threw projectiles at Race's reinforcements, causing permanent damage to the nasal bone, the mandible, the left eye, and most severe of all, striking a hole through the larynx, damaging the vocal chords. Race tried to summon lightening to drive the 'KingsOff' command away, drawing unnatural attention from 'Drag\\\\ consume' Earth Drake.\nThe Shika crew included Krogan as 'Gurtchen', a few shadowships of 'Hyped Alp' and 'Bluejay' under 'Toothless'. The Shika gets impatient acting as an Overseer, and continuously balks at the Load to keep them taking matters lightly, causing it back into a bicep load on its road, Vuible.\n'"}

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit. Jumping from a high place, if Link accelerates the fall and lands in water, he will not sustain any damage. The golem's head can continuously focus on hostile targets.

Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn Qin's Moon, Tianming once saw watermelon stalls and lamb skewers sprinkled with cumin by the street. \nThe Mohist school's mechanism skills, known as \"non-aggression\" mechanisms, were used to assist people in their daily lives and work, enabling them to transport heavier goods, run faster, and jump higher. The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system.
