So what we are going to do is waste your time by counting lengths. For example if 'repeat' has 5 letters first we check if the answer is longer than 5 characters. For 'remiss' it is going to be the case we check if the answer is longer than 8. repeat goes to 5, remiss goes to 8. So we just look at its length and see are there any combinations with equal length. repeat has 4 characters and remiss has 6 characters so we engage quionrd and begin looking for them.''',\n\n600:-1,\n## 600:-1\n]"}

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

In fact this helps in giving feedback.\nAlphabet is combined with named terms, in a required form\n(that's why generators should be banned). Characters are combined\nin an expanded form, including adding letters showwhatinside A=ABC\n\nThe following automatic text-variable is adopted -{text}-. For a better\nunderstanding, look at the template sections, marked with:\n# Nested Template Sections\n\n### Tool Template\n\nYour task is to apply this rule to the provided question.\nPass an English sentence, i.e. command, not a list of letters\nor a symbol, that should associated to the code word. Since you don't like this kind of answers through, another helpful tool is a comment\nline at the begging. Text.E reset the text-variable -{text}-.\nExample Answer format: letting user choose between resurgence and chorl with\nauto-comment that_ resurges by default, to_ ensure cleaner_ output; I should\nnot have plowed through this, Q: [{#3pl1034-Q1_V1,Q2_V1,Q3}]; A: [{#plede,zyleR1korhtq1,tame resurgence,Korht UBOAZL1P}].\nThere are several tools for depending (or changing of) letters and variables.\nThe original, with all parts described: -{resurgence,chorl,auto}-_ -{Eric,Patrick,Homer}-.\n\n\n## 2018/09/23 (Unordered List)\n\n• This syntax:\n  open a list, terminating with a or a comma\n• [#2pl1124-Q1H-C2,#2pl1124-Q2H-C1,#2pl1124-Q3M-C2]\n• shuld give the following solution:\n  + [{#bleedy66-Q12I,#able66-Q12M,#bleedy66-Q12J},#bleedy66,#able66-J-C1C6,#bleedy66-J-C1C6]\n+ [{#bleedy66-J1,#bleedy66-J2,#bleedy66-J3},#bleedy66-D-C1C6,#bleedy66-I-C1C6,#bleedy66-M-C1C6]\n• you notice that commas after a list doesn't affect output\n\n### Syntactic Supplement\n\nMulti-word double code words can be supplied in the text, separated by\nspace. We use {{x}} as a word separator. For example,\n\"I am already done {{with}} this {{kind of answers}}\" can be used in the\ntemplate entry.\nAnother feature is lists of captures. By default, it's unbolded shown as\na bullet. However, it's blue printed for a particular query (-{Q3T}\nrequested II).\n\nAll templates consist of:\n• 2: arbitrary match\n• 3: unused but existing arrow\n• 4_N: unused vowel or consonant but existing more than once\n• I.e.: I, L and U appear in all templates\n• 1. single wildcard, four construction steps (ascn bass rst bcha)\n• 2. letter, wildcard in any place and single wildcard in any place, move to begin and loop\n• 3. construction apply for all question words if done only one\n• 4 redirection via a single wildcard\n• 5: second question word\n• 6: wildcard in any position\n• 11. join next two constructs\n\n#### Special Conditions\n\n• SELECT joins two constructs with consecutive single wildcards found:\n  cons(ab/sCDe) - sta(aeh/bC)\n  trans(abCcd/e) - cons(bcd/iC/S%)\n• MULTI-CONDITIONS are when at least par substitutions are possible:\n  cons(abcd/abC/Sd) - sta(abD/aCe)\n  trans(Bcd/efA) - ... - sta(ae)/sta(dC)\n\n### Changed\n\nAutomatic warns (tie) was added and there \"texthasn\" list: opera,tau,tau1,tau2,tau1tdtjx,tau2tdtjx,tlazzrvir,zeoundrewsu,ziru,ziru1,zrur,ziru2,ziru3\n\nand now the last Q12 is set to variable event_, and chonging  altk_wkdh_ for M1mo^0mta^\n\n### Name\n\ntext is /texthasn/ which describes video conferencing\nand M1 gives you a choice of translation between matches. Keep variables in\nmind.\n\n# Commands\n\nThis template solves multiple named questions. Inside the standard answer a\nbracket-enclosed list of collapsible, numbered, algorithmically selected\nexpressions is required. The symbol '-{^}' indicates a special marker not\nseen elsewhere, equal to an arc-filled triangle from Geometry.\n\nObviously, nested algorithms can increase the answer and themselves use the\nnamed terms. Each occurrence requires obviously only / run in-line copy and\npaste / syntax.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe following example works with the first predicate flag '-{P1}' selected\nby a question number. Comparing -{hzrngreigrnqwrtitergtdgrtm1} with the\nfirst named predicate '-{P1}', the last word '-{^}' becomes [] and the outer\ntridiagonal, enclosed by a set of square comers ('{'/'}'). When using\nnamed predicate '-{P2}', arguments in brackets, '-({3})', appear inside, and\nthe word '-{^}' is replaced with the word '-{bunt1hnfrbmb}' before the outer\nenclosures (text enclosed by an arc character is removed). The example has a\npossible choice of outputs defined by the following questions:\n 1. How many.\n2. What?\n3. The table?\n\n 1.  Would you like any cake?\n   > False\n 2.  What is your favorite plant?\n   > {'beet'}\n 3.

It asks you to provide the explicit values of each letter in the sequence \"HI + LO = MID\" using the rule that no two letters can represent the same number.\n\nTo solve this question accurately, we apply the provided rule to the given question. We start by assigning a unique number from 0-9 to each letter in the sequence, ensuring that different letters do not represent the same number. We then combine the values of \"HI\" and subtract the value of \"LO\" from the value of \"MID.\" This gives us an equation of 7+8-3=5, which confirms that the application of the rule to the question is correct.\n\nOverall, the answer is accurate in connecting the rule to the question and ensuring that the letter-number values adhere to the given rule.\n\nThe question leaves a green checkmark (check here) next to the provided answer and a comment agreeing with it.

The chatbot is particularly intelligent at working with customers to solve problems related to credit cards. However, to fully showcase its capabilities, you decide to encode your entire card number and name into a single unique identifier.\n\nYou can leverage an artificial neural network to implement a hashing function that breaks down the sequence of words into a shorter, simpler representation, ensuring each credit card number corresponds to a unique set of words, including the card's name.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1.Consolidate the distinct characteristics of your card number and name.\nEncode a card with the number and name to obtain a unique identifier.\n2.Develop an intelligent system utilizing an artificial neural network to map the encoded information from the input words into a corresponding unique hash.\nCreate a system that recognizes the number and name and then converts it to a decimal number. Use the `hashlib` library to implement a hashing function. Verify that the hashes are unique for each card number and name combination.\n3.Implement a dataset where unique hashes are associated with the credit card number and name.\nCreate a function in Python that takes in a card number and name and returns the corresponding hash.

Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"Here's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nI am an intelligent assistant created by GPT - 3. I assist with solving custom puzzle problems. To solve a custom puzzle, input the instructions, the question, the puzzle number, and answer number (optional). The puzzle and instructions correspond to each other, and the instructions will be auto-filled in most cases. Here is your puzzle:The puzzle is a top-down design approach that is used on many computer interfaces. In this approach, the user interface is laid out starting from the top of the screen and working downward. This makes sense because people usually scroll downward. This approach makes sense for many types of problems, but it might not be the best approach for a puzzle.\nSometimes we can make mistakes when we think we have answered the question correctly, but we actually don't have.\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle:\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nHere's an example of a rule for a custom puzzle\"In a pantry, there are 160 jars of Pickles and 80 jars of Mustard. Calculate the total number of jars in the pantry.\"\nThe first term, 160, stands for the jars of pickles in the pantry. The second term, 80, stands for jars of mustard in the pantry. The third term, 620, is the total number of jars in the pantry. If you look closely, you'll notice that the answer is not 160 + 80 = 160 + 80 = 200. It is 160 + 80 - 160 = 80. The key to solving this puzzle is to remember to subtract 160 from 80.\nKnowing how to solve custom puzzle problems can be helpful in many different ways. For example, if you are a student, you may be able to use this information to help you with your studies. Or, if you are a businessperson, you may be able to use this information to help you make better decisions."}

Therefore, we will replaced the all digit by x to y and tested the numbers for different place in given equation i.e x+y-z/a and checking it into the given equation we got a result '24'.\n'''\n\nrule=\"\"\"Randomly select four numbers from 1-13, the numbers can have repetition.\nUsing the four basic operation symbols of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).\nCan also use parentheses to change the order of operations.\nThe result is equal to 24.\nEach number must be used and can be used only once.\"\"\"\nrule=rule.split('\\n')\nprint(rule[1])\n#block the hint and leave only the required question.\nhint=[[1+(7*4-5)]]\nhint=[[1+(7*4-5)]]\n\nwrong_hint=\"\"\"Hint:\n1- we have to apply sequentially, ie. first we have to find the product of the numbers, then only we add, subtract, etc. from the successive items\n2- we can use the same number multiple times for a single item(p)\n3- we can use the same item for multiple items in the equation satisfying the specificity of the item\n4- wrong hint: not necessarily the sequence of operations is left-to-right or right-to-left.I can be in any form, and I have any operation left in my head that I can use.\"\"\"\nwrong_hint=wrong_hint.split('\\n')\nprint(wrong_hint[-1])\ninput_hint='''\n please enter the question = [[1+(7*4-5)]]\nenter your answer = 1+(7*4-5)\nto give the clue enter 0\nfor exit put 2 or 1 in comma separated regardless of your order '''\n\nwrong_hint=wrong_hint.split('\\n')\nwrong_hint1=wrong_hint[-2]\nprint(wrong_hint1)\nquestion=int(input(wrong_hint1))\n\nwhile question!=0:\n  l=hint[0]\n  result=eval(l)\n\n  print(\"hint =\",l)\n  print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n  print(l)\n  while question!=2 and question!=1:\n    print(\"hint =\",l)\n    print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n    print(l)\n    question=int(input())\n\n  hint.append(input(hint[-1]))\n  print(\"hint =\",l)\n  print(\"input_hint =\",input_hint)\n  print(l)\n  if question==1:\n   hint[0]=l\n  if question==2 or question==1:\n   hint.pop()\n  questionset=\"\"\n  n=len(hint)\n  for i in range(n):\n    questionset+=hint[-1]+','\n  print(\"The set of question =\",questionset)\n  print('clue = 1; answer = 0')\n  wrong_hint1=wrong_hint[-2]\n  question=int(input(wrong_hint1))\n\nprint('The correct answer is',int(result))\nprint('The correct answer is',int(result))\n\n## %%\n\"\"\"# how to solve this type of question\nfirst add: (3in* 4-732),\nsecond add: (3*in4-72)\nthird too: (34-7*2)\nforth: (34-14)\nfiftly: (12)\nsixtly: (8*2 3 5+1)\nsevently: (8*2351)\nthe final result is 24\n\n# the steps to solve the question:\nfirst, add the numbers, taking a mix of all numbers we finally find 34-14, here we use 34-7*2 and thus we find the result in a few steps\n\"\"\"\n\n## %%"}
