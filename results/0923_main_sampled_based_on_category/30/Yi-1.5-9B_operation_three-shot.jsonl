For f(x)=ln(x), g(x)=x^3, we need f'(x) and g'(x):\n   f'(x) = 1/x\n   g'(x) = 3x^2\n   Therefore, f□g = f'(x)+g'(x) = 1/x + 3x^2.\n\n2. For f(x)=e^x, g(x)=sin(x), finding the value of f□g when x=0:\n   f'(x) = e^x\n   g'(x) = cos(x)\n   So, f□g when x=0 is e^0 + cos(0) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n3. For f(x)=sin(x), g(x)=x, finding the value of f□g when x=π/4:\n   f'(x) = cos(x)\n   g'(x) = 1\n   Thus, f□g when x=π/4 is cos(π/4) + 1 = √2/2 + 1.\n\n4.
