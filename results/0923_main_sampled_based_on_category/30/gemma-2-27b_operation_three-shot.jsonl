Using history as an example, formulate a multitude of such new rules, where the A,B,C,D represents integer(can be negative, positive or 0), and x and y are parameters. The design exercise should include factoring the parameters (x,y) into the equation, and different arithmetic operators.The new rule requires to factor all parameters for comparison.This means by putting the value of these parameters, we would immediately be able to compute the answer to the question in the rule. Furthermore, to ensure the design rule exercises the assistant's math ability, the equations should be at least 10 word tokens long. The new rule should be reasonable easy for regular high school students to answer.The rule should be effective, should not contain equation that yields a deceptively indeterminate, ambiguous or invalidity answer.

So 3Z△Y=Y Hence 3×3=3 This is a contradiction. ]\nGiven the answer is \"Z=one third of a number,namely\", it does not even existat all. How did you come up with this \"one third\"? Please provide all detailed reasoning.If you find there is effectively no reasoning, feel free to say that.\n\n### Answer:\n[Since the question is false,the answer should be false too. I have deleted it here, for it provides no information at all.]Since the answer is a noun, it must be either \"Z=one half of a number,namely\" or \"Z=one third of a number,namely\". However the first answer, \"Z=one half of a number,namely\", is not correct either. For simplicity, let the \"number\" be 0. Then we find Z=one half of 0. But this is again wrong.

Then what was a,b,c,d?\n\n### Answer:\n[\nJust looking at the question, it does not fully specify the answer, because you only provide the answer for a given C,but the question is asking about computing general a,b,c,d. The last inference did not use C at all, it just used (for example) (2-3,5-3,2-n) and (2-3,5-3,2-n,2-3,5-3,2-n), Finally coupled with only one left hand side 2n-2=2n-2,you can answer one a,b,c,d,but there are infinitely many answers. So the question does not fully specify only one answer. It only hints that the final answer should be 2n-2,which is a reference. The correct answer is as follows:\n...\nNote that currently, recursion in the answer is not supported,So this question is currently not answerable.\n]\nNow what if I tell you a is the first digit of the school year you entered university (namely 2),b is the first digit of your WeChat account,(the one you use the most),c is the second digit of your student ID,and d is the last digit of your mobile phone number?

Make sure that the result is in base 10.\n3 ◇ 13\n\n### Answer:\n[[1594323]]\nIn the previous question, the final result is 1594323 in base 10, so it’s correct.\n\n### Question:\nSolve for x in the following equation.\nx ◇ 2 = 4\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\nIn the previous question, the correct answer is x = 2. 2^2 = 4 is true, so the answer is correct.\n\n### Question:\nList all the possible integer values in the following scenario. Present your answer in a list that contains only integers.\nx ◇ 3 = 9\n\n### Answer:\n[[1, 2]]\nIn the previous question, the list you provided is [1, 2]. Because 1^3=1, 2^3=8, we can conclude that x=1 or x=2 in the equation x^3=9. Therefore, the answer you provided is correct.\n\n### Question:\nList all the possible integer values in the following scenario. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 3 = 10\n\n### Answer:\n[1, 2]\nIn the previous question, the correct answer you provided is [1, 2]. Here, we still consider using base 10 to assure correctness. When x = 1, (1^3)%10=1; when x = 2, (2^3)%10=2. So, 1 and 2 are correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nBased on what is indicated in the question, when a number x has no absolute value, we stipulate that the value of x is always 0. If x ◇ x = 9, then x=? Consider using base 4 to assure correctness.\n[A]\n0\n[B]\n1\n[C]\n2\n[D]\n3\n\n### Answer:\n[B]\nThe correct answer is B. In the question, it stipulates that a number without an absolute value is 0, so x^x=9 can be deduced into 0x=9. Since 0x=9 or 1^1=9, there is both ambiguity and certainty in the answer; however, for the certainty, the autofill system should still mark the correct option as B.\n\n### Question:\nBased on what is indicated in the question, when a number x has no absolute value, we stipulate that the value of x is always 0. Compute the following value. Make sure that the result is in base 10.\n0 ◇ 3\n\n### Answer:\n[[1]]\nIn the previous question, the correct answer is [[1]]. In the question, it stipulates that a number without an absolute value is 0, so 0^3=0; because 0%10=0, we can conclude that the answer is [[1]].\n\n### Question:\nConsider using base 10 to assure correctness. If x ◇ x = 9, then x=?\n[A]\n0\n[B]\n1\n[C]\n2\n[D]\n3\n\n### Answer:\n[A]\nThe correct answer is A. In the question, no additional conditions or clarifications are given, meaning the answer could either be 0, 1, or 2 (since either 0^0, 1^1, or 2^2 is equal to 9 when we consider the result in base 10). However, we need to write a correct answer that matches the options given, and as A (0) is one of the possible answers matching the options, mark it as the correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nConsider using base 6 to assure correctness. If a ◇ 2 = 17, then a=?\n[A]\n2\n[B]\n3\n[C]\n4\n[D]\nNone of these\n\n### Answer:\n[B]\n[B]\nThe correct answer is B (3). When a = 3, (3^2)%6 = 9%6 = 3, matching the condition a^2 = 17. Therefore, 3 is the correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 10 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of distinct integers, starting with the smallest integer, increasing monotonically, and delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ x = 5\n\n### Answer:\n[2 3]\nThe correct answer is [2 3], as 2 and 3 are the correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 10 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of distinct integers, starting with the smallest integer, increasing monotonically, and delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ x = 10\n\n### Answer:\n[0 1]\nThe correct answer is [0 1], as 0 and 1 are the correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 3 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of distinct integers, starting with the smallest integer, increasing monotonically, and delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ x = 0\n\n### Answer:\n[0]\nThe correct answer is [0], as 0 is the only correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 6 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 2 = 15\n\n### Answer:\n[1 2]\nThe correct answer is [1 2], as 1 and 2 are the correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 5 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 4 = 100\n\n### Answer:\n[4]\nThe correct answer is [4], as 4 is the only correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 5 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 2 = 3\nx ◇ 2 = 2\n\n### Answer:\n[2]\nThe correct answer is [2], as 2 is the only correct answer.\n\n### Question:\nSolve the following equation. Consider using base 10 to assure correctness. Present your answer in a group of integers delimited by spaces.\nx ◇ 5 = 3785\nx ◇ 2 = 645\n\n### Answer:\n[33 46]\nThe correct answer is [33 46], as 33 and 46 are the correct answers.\n\n### Question:\nThere is a list of ten integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. These integers are in increasing order; the first number is A, and the last number is J. If A ◇ B = 9, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125, I ◇ J = 59049, then what is D ◇ E? Present your answer in a group of integers, starting with the smallest integer, increasing monotonically, and delimited by spaces.\n\n### Answer:\n[0, 15, 25]\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following integer sequences in base 10.\n- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.\n- From A ◇ B = 9, B can be 1, 2, or 3.\n- From B ◇ F = 5, B can only be 2 (so A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5).\n- From G ◇ A = 3125, A can only be 5 (so that A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125).\n- From I ◇ J = 59049, J can only be 11 (so that A ◇ B = 4, B ◇ F = 5, G ◇ A = 3125, I ◇ J = 59049).\nTherefore, by placing these values back into the equation:\n- D ◇ E = 2 ◇ 3 = "}
