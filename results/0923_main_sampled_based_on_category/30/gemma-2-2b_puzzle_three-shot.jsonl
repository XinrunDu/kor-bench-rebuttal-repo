If both input and answer match, your score will be 1.\nIf only input matches, your score will be 0.1.\n\n### Hints:\n- The first letter of any digit cannot be represented by the same letter.\n- Do a comprehensive analysis and think deeply about the rules specified here.\n- When there are multiple matches in an equation, consider each distinct possibility.\n"}

The problem statement is stated in the below format: \"Change the pattern in the original sentence to the end sentence.\"\n2. The output is stated in the below format: \".pattern={pattern}.\"\n3. The initial sentence is given. For every dictionary [english-pattern-rule.json] file there is a corresponding [pattern] dictionary (with keys) and corresponding [patterns] dictionary (with values).\n4. For the patterns that match the initial sentence, the pattern's name must be selected. For an unmatched pattern, the pattern can be set to the name of the first selected pattern to handle the matched sentences.\n5. For more accurate and specific custom rule, you can get a pointer to a text field widget (field1) and change the initial sentence by reading the value of field1(in a specific number of steps). Try it for yourselves!\n\n## Rule Constraints:\n\n```txt\n\n1. `pattern={value}.`\n    Contains only one `PATTERN` specified as a new pattern.\n2. `patterns={{ PATTERN := Number }}.`\n    Contains `pattern` specified as `{PATTERN}` key and corresponding `PATTERN` value.\n\n### Sample Results:\n\n```txt\n\nfrom pattern: \"test{}\"\nto pattern: \"test1{}\"\ninput = \"test{1}\"\noutput = \"test1{1}\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test1{}\"\nto pattern: \"test100\"\ninput = \"test1{0}\"\noutput = \"test1{0}\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test100\"\nto pattern: \"test1{10001}\"\n\ninput = \"test1{0001}\"\noutput = \"test1{10001}\"\n```\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n```txt\n\nfrom pattern: \"test\"\nto pattern: \"test1\"\ninput = \"test\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test1\"\nto pattern: \"test100\"\ninput = \"test1\"\n\n--------------------------------------\nfrom pattern: \"test100\"\nto pattern: \"test1000000\"\n\ninput = \"test100\"\n\n\n```\n\n## Expectations:\n\nThe assistant should be able learn two types by training custom rules to improve performance:\n\n1. Pattern learning: to identify the starting, ending and path-to-end patterns from input sentences.\n2. Input-pattern learning: to understand the patterns in the input-output translation.\n\n## Hints:\n```txt\n\n- Please implement the following two features:\n    1. Implement a step that is more accurate and specific custom rule.\n    2.

Once a consensus on its meaning has been reached, identify and document any unique properties or requirements of each rule portion.\n2. **Assign each rule portion a color**: To gain a deeper understanding, assign each portion of the rule (e.g., Empty, Mine, and 8 numbers) a distinct color. Repeat for a similar rule. The goal is to distinguish between each portion.\n3. **Identify the colors of an n×n grid**: The rule mentions filling empty spaces with A. Fill them with the assigned colors. Assign a distinct color to the negative space (between the received and sent grids). Another color will be assigned to the grid sections. Repeat this process until the entire grid is colored.\n4. **Examine the color requirement interpretations**: As the solution progresses, refer to the comments for color interpretation. If there is concern that a change might impact the answer, the instructor's guidance might be sought.\n\n## Implementing the Solution\n1. **Set up the input array and assign variables A and B**: To format the input array, declare an array and a variable for each row. Assign them X (empty) and A (mine).\n2. **Process rules one by one**: Apply each rule to each section of the input array, replacing X with A for mined areas and X with X for empty areas.\n3. **Check the rule's applicability**: For every added number, verify with a reference. If the number is within the given range (0-9), follow the rule. Otherwise, omit additional operations.\n4. **Check the rules for conflicts**: Fix any mistakes found by reprocessing with the previous number replaced X. Refer to the printed steps for assistance.\n5. **Print out the final answer in the same format** Read the rules and convert into the number and alphabet array format. Replace any A with 0 and X with A. Append into the full matrix, and put in double square brackets at the end.\n\n## Solving Sample Questions\nFor each question, follow the same process outlined above to solve it.\n\n## Acknowledging the Developer\nAs you begin by introducing the developer and yourself, establish the developer's privacy and confidentiality.\nTo demonstrate awareness of our responsibilities, review Privacy, Security and Affordability Code of Practice at the end of this guide.\nThe developer agrees to have his or her name and contact information deleted from the summary, student submissions and final report after the project has been finished.\n\n1.The developer and I wish we could have contributed to this wonderful tool. Thank you for letting us help!\n\n2.The developer and myself would like to thank you for allowing us to practice coding with you. Though, we can assure you that it was enjoyable and beneficial. It wasn't such a long one, as you must understand we didn't have that much time available.\n\n3.We'd likewise like to give a suggestion on another area wherein the idea would seem a troublesome technique to deal with riddles. We want to give an option that could be conceivable instead of the manual framework of filling the empty spots (referring to the first solution for question 1). The main idea is to encode the number in way that can be decoded to find the answers. The technique should have the following characteristics:\n\na.It would be in regards to one more number lattice (or matrix)\n\nb.The lattice contains some bit of numerical data (of its just first line), and the numbers must be set so they sum up to the number that pixels are marked on.\n\nc.The numbers should be arranged in a way that:\n\n--a number once found is used only for one step and not for several.\n\n--only one right-side value can be found as a by-product of moving forward.\n\n--each right right side value should be found after no less than the last marked pixel before that.\n\nd.Pixels are filled with the same character while it is correct\n\n### Notes\n*To help the program work properly, please ensure that there is at least one number per row, for example; 3, 4, 2, 3\n*The program will take an input, and display its answers at the bottom.\n*It is advised, that we provide multiple rows at a time, and the output should be one-to-one.\n*We suggest to make the input integer only, by converting the string to integer using eval() function\n\n\n### Credits\n-The script was created by Taran Ahmed and Hayder Ahmed for learning purposes.\n"}

The puzzle is solved by starting with row to fill in the letters of the X's and the letters from across that do not occupy the positions of letters. To put it simply, if the letter is just one letter and does not occupy the position of another letter, then the game will be solved when the letter is in the center (see example above).\n2. The final result will look like this: [\"0\", \"X\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n3. And now we start the case of solving it for column.\n\nThe puzzle is solved by starting with column, or be stacking up the numbers of X's starting from top to bottom and filling in the rest without seeing into other columns.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n1. The puzzle was solved by starting with column.\n2. The final result will look like this: [\"N\", \"N\", \"V\", \"0\"]\n\n\n\n### Example: Suppose we have puzzle set of X's and 0's where the rules are:\n* The puzzle is solved for row by starting from left to right and the puzzle is solved for column by starting with the top row.\nAn example of the above is:\n\n<table border='1' cellspacing='2' cellpadding='2' align='top' width='249'>\n<tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr>\n<tr><td>X</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>X</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>\n\nNotes:\nThe answer for this example will be: [\"X\", \"X\", \"V\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"]"}
