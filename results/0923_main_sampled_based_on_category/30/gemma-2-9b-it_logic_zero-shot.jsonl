Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nSome students do not like mathematics.\n\n1.

Here's why:\n\n* **Positive Group:**  Families with the active/encouraging style and their children showing higher EQ and positive emotional characteristics (expressing emotions well, problem-solving skills).\n\n* **Negative Group:** Families with the passive/negative style and their children showing lower EQ and negative emotional characteristics (emotional suppression, poor problem-solving).\n\nThe study directly compares these two groups, highlighting the difference in outcomes (emotional intelligence) based on the presence (positive group) or absence (negative group) of the specific educational style (S), making method  Otero the most suitable.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore why the other methods are not as fitting for this scenario!\n"}
