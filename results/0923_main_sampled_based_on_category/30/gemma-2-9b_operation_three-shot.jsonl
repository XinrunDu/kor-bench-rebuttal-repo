For example, have 10 and 27, and swap them. If you had 27, and you make it equal to 10 as well as making 10 equal to swaped 27. This makes it that you have two new variables, but you changed the value one of those two variables. The original 10 is set to 10 and the original 27 is set to 10. They are no longer two different values. I want you to explain this. How did they become the exact same value? How do you swap? Why does this work?\n\n### Answer:\nThe swap equation is x = y, y = x. If you inputted x and y, they equal eachother. So lets say we had y value of two and an x value of four. So when you do x = y, four equals two. There are two ways of thinking about it. One way is that the x value of four, now equals two. The other way, is that the y value of two, now equals four. Both ways of thinking about it, both ways the original x values becomes two, and original y's become four.\n\n### Question:\nYou're working on a project in Python, you are using iterables, lists, dictionaries, a bunch of custom classes, shape, and a bunch of stuff. You set a variable equal to input('Please input your name: '). You are now asked to convert the name to uppercase, and using lowercase, create a custom variable. The name's first letter should be capitalized. You are being asked to type out custom code in English.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven a list of strings s = ['abcd', 'life', 'a', 'b', 'z', ''], you are asked to clean these strings. To clean a string, you should return it in capital form if the length of the string is greater than 0, and if the list is at least one character long, you are asked to leave it uppercase. You are also asked to capitalize the first letter if the length of the string is greater than one character.\n\n### Question:\nYou're given a list in Python called a = [1, 2, 3], and a function called square. write out your best definition of this question in English. The input will be the list. What should you return?\n\n### Answer:\nIt is being asked to return a square variable. You are given a function square, which is not prewritten. The question asks to write out the function.\n\n### Question:\nYou're working with a list in Python called a = ['a', 'b', 'c'. 'd']. There is a function that returns 'a', then 'b', then 'b', 'c'. Then 'd', then 'd'. Then it goes back to 'a', then 'b', then 'b', then 'c'. Then it cycles through all the variables once, and says again.\n\n### Answer:\nWrite a function in Python, called odd or even, which gives the input either 'even', or 'odd'. Or it returns the word 'equal', which is another custom variable. If the last digit is zero or two, or four, or six, or eight, it should return 'even'. If the last digit is one or three, or five, or seven, it should return odd. And if the number is the even if it's zero, or a one, it returns equal\n\n### Question:\nYou are given a list a = [6, 5, 4, 9, 1, 3]. You are being asked to change everything that is equal to three or higher. Change it to 'a' and '1'. You are now asked to change anything from the input one to nine, which is seven, to 'b', and anything else to 'c'. Then return the resulting list.\n\n### Answer:\nYou are working with Python. You are given the pseudovariable p1 and v12. You are writing code in your head, and you are given pseudo variable 'a' and 'b'. You are creating a custom function. Given the two variables p1 and v12, p1 value is six. You are adding one to p1 and assign it to p2, and p2 = seven. You are then adding one to p2 and assigning to p3. You have to assign p3 value to p4, and p3 should take a value of p2, then the value of p3 should be what p4's value is. So when you add one to p3, it equals p4, and p3 equals p4. If v12 is true, you need to print 'p4 does not equal three', if v12 is false, you need to print 'p4 equals three'."}
