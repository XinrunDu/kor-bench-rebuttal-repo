it with '#' in a way that the number of filled points is as close as possible to the number of points that satisfy the following rules:\n\n\n1.For every '#' on a white point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' (within 2 grids means it is in squares where 1 grid is the border of the 2 grids).\n2.For every '#' on a black point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' points (the same as 1).\n3.There is at least one '#' on each point.\n\nEvery input file is guaranteed to have an answer.\n\n### Format for input and output:\nThe format for input and output is as follows:\n[input]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n[output]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n\nOne line represents a picture, only alpha (alpha is used to represent a character in a String).\n\nOne line describes the output result.\n\n### Examples:\n```\nInput:[1][.......x][......xxx][..xx.xxxxx][xx.x.....][........x]\n\nOutput:\n[[1][x......][x......][x.....xx.]]\n```\n\n### Input:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx.x.x\n\n### Output:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx#x#x\n\n\n### Hint:\nConsider applying the rules one at a time to determine the number of empty spaces.\nFor example, you can start with rule 1 and determine which points require '#' under rule 1. Then, you can consider rule 2 to evaluate whether the points where all rules apply or if additional rules need to be considered.\n\n### Implementation of rule 1:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Implementation of rule 2:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n"}

The goal of this challenge is to develop a computer program that solves the Arrow-Blast Puzzle, an interesting arithmetic puzzle consisting of a collection of different sized blocks, all filled with a number. The player of the puzzle needs to add an arrow to each block so that all numbers on the blocks add up to the target value $\\tau$ and each arrow may touch no more than 3 other arrows. All arrows are drawn in simple blocks (black blocks) and no two arrows can point in the same direction in such a way that the arrow points at another arrow or at the empty space below it. The objective of the challenge is to help students develop their logical thinking, their coding skills and their understanding of computer programming.\n\n\n### Puzzle Instructions\n\n\n1. In the case of a `Single Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `3` if the value of digit 40` is even: `8432418`.\n2. In the case of a `Even Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `5` if the value of digit 40` is odd: `8432415`.\n3. In the case of a `Odd Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `10` if the value of digit 40` is even: `8432418`.\n4. In the case of a `Luhn Digit`, the algorithm will return `7`.\n\n### How to play\n\n\n1. **You are going to play an interactive game, where the rules of the game as changed by solving the arrow-blast puzzle. Therefore, the rules are not stated in this challenge.** \n2. <strong>The first thing that you need to learn is how to play the game</strong> for an **Arrow-Blast Puzzle** and how to do this you can watch the **video instruction** on YouTube for [the video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=&t=0s) .\n3. In the video you will have the option to skip to a certain **solution** for the game based on the **goal** you're trying to reach.\n4. Once you’re done with the **puzzle** , you're going to see the **solution** by using the submit button.The **solution** will display in **markdown** .\n### Description\n\n\nThe program **reads** two integers separated by a space. The first number of **target value** $\\tau$, the second number of **current sum** $\\sigma$. The solution to the problem is to print the **final digit from target** to **current sum**.\n\n**Note:** The digits 0,1 and **7 are omitted** from the program since these are **the only numbers allowed to print**. \n\n### Solution\n\n\n1. We can solve this **puzzle** using **backtracking**. We will create a stack and push the numbers from ** 1** to ** 7** (we are not counting the 10) and **pop** the numbers at a time. If the value of the **current sum** exceeds the target value we should stop the program. \n2. We can use a **binary tree** to implement **backtracking**. We create a binary tree with the following **nodes** :**The root** node is with **value** $\\tau$ ,**the left child node** is with **value** $\\sigma$ .The **right child node** is with the **value** which is of the **current sum**. We continue to update the **value** of the **current sum** by adding **numbers from 1 to 7**. \n\n### Example\n\n\n```\nInput1: 8, 0\nOutput: \n8432418 -> \n9432418 -> \n9432417 ->\n9432416 ->\n9432415 ->\n9432414 ->\n43241 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n7432412 ->\n1432411 ->\n1432410 ->\n```\n\n### Solution\n\n``` python\nfrom __future__ import print_function \nmax_num = 1000 \ndef solve(num, curr_max):\n    if num = = 1 and curr_max == 1:\n        if num > 1000:\n            print(\"No Solution.\")\n        else:\n            print \"Solution:\" \n            print(max(num, curr_max))\n        elif num == 1:\n            print \"Solution:\" \n            print(max(num, curr_max))\n        elif curr_max<1000:\n            print(\"No Solution.\")\n            retur\n"}

In the above question, you can see that in the following 8 cells, there is a number 3, from which there are two possibilities of mines, either two will be mines or three will be mines.\n2. The question also says that in a cell with a number 3, two of the cells should be mines. Therefore 1, 2, or 3 can be a mine.\n2. If you do the rest of the calculations like this then you can easily solve any custom puzzle.\n\n### Examples:\n\nIn the first example, the answer should be 'A X A' indicating that number 3 is the number of mines, and number 4 is the number of mines, respectively.\nIn the second example, the answer should be 'A X X' indicating that number 1 is the number of mines, and number 3 is the number of mines, respectively.\nIn the third example, the answer should be 'A A X A' indicating that number 1 is the number of mines, and number 3 is the number of mines, respectively.\n## Function Description:\n\n1.You can solve this puzzle recursively.\n2.It may take a long time to finish, so try to be fast.\n3.Recursive recursion is always possible although not in this specific rule but in other cases while solving other puzzles because you will not know it before.\n4.The type of the questions you have been asked may contain different puzzle types, but as one you can solve similar puzzles in the beginning.\n\nYou provided the questions, and I will provide the answers for you to confirm.\n\nExample 1:\n\nPuzzle Rule:\n1. In this puzzle, some of the cells contain either mines or numbers (other than mines), and some cells contain no mines.\n2. There are two types of mines in this puzzle: land mines and air mines. Land mines can be placed on any non-zero square in the puzzle (including squares that contains mines). Air mines can be placed on any square in the puzzle (including non-zero squares).\n3. The number of mines in a square is the number of mines in all other squares in the same row and in the same column.\n4. The number of air mines is the number of air mines in all remaining squares.\n5. The sum of mines and the number of air mines is the number of mines in this puzzle.\n\nExample Input:\n9 X 3 2 X\n2 9 X 2 2\n8 7 X 6 8\n2 7 7 6 9\n9 X 3 2 X\n\nThe puzzle's solution:\nAfter completing the puzzle, here are the results: It's a land mine, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 6, 8.\n\n### Problem Solution:\nIn the early stages, it is the case of **recursion**, \n<br/>that is, one problem is solved and the solution is taken as another problem and that solution is taken and the solution is taken.\n\n1. First, I solve the first problem to see if it is valid or not.\n\n2. If the solution is not valid, then I have to solve the same problem with different constraints.\n \n3. And if the solution is still valid in that case, then I continue to the next problem.\n\n### Code:\n\n```c#\nusing System;\nusing System.Text;\nusing static System.Console;\n\n\n    public class Solution\n    {\n        public static void Main()\n        {\n            PuzzleRule(TestCase());\n        }\n\n        public static String[] TestCase()\n        {\n            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n\n            for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++)\n            {\n                sb.AppendLine(\"X X 1 X X\");\n                sb.AppendLine(\"1 X X 3 3\");\n                sb.AppendLine(\"X 1 2 X 2\");\n                sb.AppendLine(\"X X X 2 X\");\n                sb.AppendLine(\"1 X X X X\");\n            }\n\n            return sb.ToString().Trim().Split(\"\\n\");\n        }\n\n        public static int PuzzleRule(string[] testCase)\n        {\n            if (testCase.Length <= 3)\n            {\n                return -1;\n            }\n\n            bool isValid = false;\n            string[] output = new string[testCase.Length - 1];\n            if (output != null)\n            {\n                for (int i = 0; i < output.Length; i++)\n                {\n                    if (output[i] != null)\n                    {\n                        isValid = PuzzleRule(output[i]);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            if (isValid)\n            {\n                return 1;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                return -1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n1.
