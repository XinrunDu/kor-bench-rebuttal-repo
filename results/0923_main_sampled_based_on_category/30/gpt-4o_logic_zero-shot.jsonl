Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Propositional Symbolization Rules:\n    - Equivalence is represented by `::=::`\n    - Negation is represented by `!`\n    - Or is represented by `|`\n    - And is represented by `&`\n    - Implication is represented by `>`\n    - Equivalence is represented by `=`\n    - NAND is represented by `\u21d1`\n    - NOR is represented by `\u21d3`\n2. Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the rules, are (p>q)>r and p>(q>r) equivalent? \nA. Yes B. No\nThe answer is a single English letter.The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Let's examine whether \\((p > q) > r\\) and \\(p > (q > r)\\) are equivalent by transforming and comparing both expressions according to the provided logic rules.\n\nFirst, we start with \\((p > q) > r\\):\n\n\\[(p > q) > r ::=:: !((p > q)) | r \\text{  (using rule 10)}\\]\n\\[p > q ::=:: !p | q \\text{  (again using rule 10)}\\]\nSo,\n\\[((p > q) > r) ::=:: !(!p | q) | r\\]\n\\[(p > q) > r ::=:: (p & !q) | r  \\text{  (using rule 6)}\\]\n\nNext, we transform \\(p > (q > r)\\):\n\n\\[p > (q > r) ::=:: !p | (q > r) \\text{  (using rule 10)}\\]\n\\[q > r ::=:: !q | r \\text{  (using rule 10 again)}\\]\n\\[(p > (q > r)) ::=:: !p | (!q | r)\\]\n\\[(p > (q > r)) ::=:: (!p | !q | r)  \\text{  (associativity)}\\]\n\nNow we compare the two expressions:\n\n1. For \\((p > q) > r\\), we found \\((p & !q) | r\\).\n2. For \\(p > (q > r)\\), we have \\(!p | !q | r\\).\n\nSince \\(!p | !q | r\\) and \\((p & !q) | r\\) are not equivalent expressions (they cannot be further simplified to match each other), the two initial propositions are not equivalent.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

Although the Iron Fan Princess was a formidable goblin, Sun Wukong transformed into a small insect and entered her heart to defeat her. The \"Skill of the Guizhou Donkey\" described by Liu Zongyuan is also a good lesson. A huge donkey ran into Guizhou, and the local tigers were quite scared when they saw it. But in the end, the big donkey was eaten by the small tigers. Our Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army are like Sun Wukong and the small tigers, very capable of dealing with this Japanese goblin or Japanese donkey.

A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given 16 Basic Equivalences and the rules for propositional symbolization, let's evaluate each equivalence to determine if it holds true.\n\n#### Equivalence (1): ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n1. Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p \u21d1 q) & (p \u21d1 r) ::=:: p \u21d1 (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2. Apply negation using equivalence (6):\n   - \\(!(p = q)) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\\)\n   - Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6):\n     \\[ !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p) \\]\n     Using De Morgan transformation:\n     \\[ (!p | q)' ::=:: !p & !q' \u2192 p & !q \\]\n     So:\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: (p & !q) | (!q & p) \n\n3. Simplify other side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n    - Apply equivalence (6):\n    ikkore komi:\n   - \\((p | q) & !(p & q) = (p | q) & (!p | !q)\\)\n\nNow compare:\n   \\[(p & !q) | (!q & !p)=   \\((p | q) & !(p & q) \\]\n\nSo because equivalence states:\n\n The equivalence holds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the representations of the given statements confirm their validity.\n\n**Answer**: [[A];[A]].\n"}
