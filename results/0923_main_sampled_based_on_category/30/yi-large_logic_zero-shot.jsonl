Convert `(p>q)>r`:\n   - `p>q` is equivalent to `!p | q` (by equivalence 10).\n   - So, `(p>q)>r` becomes `!(!p | q) | r`.\n   - Applying De Morgan's law (equivalence 6), `!(!p | q)` becomes `!(!p) & !q`, which simplifies to `p & !q`.\n   - Thus, `(p>q)>r` is equivalent to `(p & !q) | r`.\n\n2. Convert `p>(q>r)`:\n   - `q>r` is equivalent to `!q | r` (by equivalence 10).\n   - So, `p>(q>r)` becomes `!p | (!q | r)`.\n   - This is already in the required form: `!p | !q | r`.\n\nNow, we compare the two transformed expressions:\n- `(p>q)>r` became `(p & !q) | r`.\n- `p>(q>r)` became `!p | !q | r`.\n\nTo check if these are equivalent, we can't directly compare them in their current forms because they are not identical. However, we can apply further logical transformations to see if they can be made identical.\n\nLet's manipulate the second expression `!p | !q | r` to see if it can match `(p & !q) | r`:\n- Distribute `r` into the first expression: `(!p | r) | (!q | r)`\n- This doesn't directly lead to a match with `(p & !q) | r`.\n\nGiven that we've reached a point where we cannot manipulate either expression into the form of the other through the provided equivalence rules, we conclude that `(p>q)>r` and `p>(q>r)` are not equivalent under the given logical system.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[B]]\n\nThis conclusion is in line with how logical implication typically behaves; implication is not associative, meaning that `(p>q)>r` is not equivalent to `p>(q>r)`. This is consistent with our analysis using the provided equivalence rules."}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nFirst person: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nSecond person: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nThird person: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\" \nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\" \nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\" \nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions. So, what would the statements of First person, Second person, and Third person be represented as?\nAnswers are formatted as [[ ];[ ];[ ]]. Each bracketed section should contain the corresponding logical expression for each individual statement.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the statements and the symbols representing the cities Professor Wang might be from, we can represent each person's statement as follows:\n\n1. First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Suzhou (i.e., `!p`) and Wang is from Shanghai (i.e., `q`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!p & q`. Since the first part of the statement is negated, it's worth noting for truth evaluation purposes.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Shanghai (i.e., `!q`) and Wang is from Suzhou (i.e., `p`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!q & p`. Notice the negation in the first part for truth evaluation.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Shanghai (i.e., `!q`) and Wang is not from Hangzhou (i.e., `!r`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!q & !r`. Both parts of this statement are negated, which is important for the truth evaluation.\n\nNow, given Professor Wang's remark, we know that exactly one person got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong. This means that one of the statements must be fully true, one must be half true (one of its parts true, the other false), and one must be fully false. However, since we are asked only to represent each person's statement using simple propositions and not to deduce the full logical outcome, we will stop at representing their claims.\n\nTherefore, formatted as requested:\n\n```\n[[ !p & q ]; [ !q & p ]; [ !q & !r ]]\n```\n\nEach bracketed section contains the corresponding logical expression for each individual's statement, without further simplification or evaluation based on the truth values of `p`, `q`, and `r`, as per the instructions."}

No further resolution is needed with these clauses.\n   \n   - Resolving \\((q \\vee \\neg r)\\) with \\((q \\vee r)\\) using the literal \\(q\\), we get \\(\\neg r \\vee r\\), which again is a tautology and resolves to \\(0\\).

Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2). The proposition states that both of these properties hold for the number 2. Thus, we have:\n- `[F(2) & G(2)]`\n\n(2) If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime.\nFirst, we express \"2 is prime\" as G(2). For \"4 is not prime\", we negate the predicate for \"4 is prime\", which is G(4), resulting in \u223cG(4). The implication between these two is then:\n- `[G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]`\n\n(3) Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime.\nThis statement suggests that if 6 is prime, then 2 must be the only prime number. To represent this, we use an implication where the premise is \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) and the conclusion is that for all numbers, if they are prime, they must be equal to 2. This can be represented by saying for all x, if x is prime and x is not 2, then this is not possible (assuming equality is represented by EQ(x, y) for x and y being equal):\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 Ax((G(x) & \u223cEQ(x, 2)) \u21d2 \u223c(x))]`\nHowever, given the constraint of 0-ary predicates and the fact that we are not explicitly given an equality predicate, we can interpret this to mean that if 6 is prime, then any prime number other than 2 is not prime, adapting the statement to fit the 0-ary predicate structure:\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]`\nHere, `x \u2260 2` is represented as `\u223cEQ(x, 2)` but adjusted for the constraint of 0-ary predicates, understanding `x \u2260 2` as a given, interpretable condition rather than a predicate in its own right.\n\n(4) Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime.\nThis statement can be interpreted as \"if 6 is not prime, then 4 is prime\". We negate the predicate for \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) to represent \"6 is not prime\" (\u223cG(6)), and the conclusion is \"4 is prime\" (G(4)). The implication is then:\n- `[\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]`\n\nPutting all the answers in the requested format:\n`[[F(2) & G(2)]; [G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]; [G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]; [\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]]`\n\nNote: For the third proposition, the interpretation adheres to the 0-ary predicate constraints but approximates the intended logical structure, given the limitations of the provided predicates and the absence of equality predicates or direct numerical comparisons in the 0-ary predicate system."}

Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38, which is already given as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. Replace entity constants with their assignments. In this case, 'a' is replaced with its assignment 'a\u2032 = 2'.\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols with their implementations. This means 'f' is replaced with 'fJ(x, y) = x + y' and 'g' is replaced with 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n4. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary predicate symbols with their implementations. Here, 'F' is replaced with 'FJ(x, y)', which denotes 'x = y'.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to each formula:\n\n(1) \u2200xF(g(x,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'g' with its implementation, 'gJ(x, y) = x * y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is: \u2200xFJ(gJ(x, 2), x), which simplifies to \u2200xFJ(x * 2, x). Implementing the predicate FJ(x, y) as 'x = y', we get:\n\n\u2200x(x * 2 = x)\n\nHowever, since we are working with natural numbers and the predicate FJ(x, y) is 'x = y', we need to express the formula in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) \u2203xF(f(x,a),y)\u2192\u2203yF(f(y,a),x)\n\n- Replace 'a' with '2' (its assignment).\n- Replace 'f' with its implementation, 'fJ(x, y) = x + y'.\n- Replace 'F' with its implementation, 'FJ(x, y)', which means 'x = y'.\n\nThe resulting formula under J is:\n\n\u2203x FJ(fJ(x, 2), y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(fJ(y, 2), x)\n\nSubstituting the implementations of 'fJ' and 'FJ':\n\n\u2203x (x + 2 = y) \u2192 \u2203y (y + 2 = x)\n\nExpressing this in terms of FJ directly:\n\n\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y) \u2192 \u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)\n\nSo, the implementation of the formula under J in the specified format is:\n\n[[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nTherefore, the answers in the requested format are:\n\n(1) [[\u2200x FJ(x * 2, x)]; []]\n\n(2) [[\u2203x FJ(x + 2, y)]; [\u2203y FJ(y + 2, x)]]\n\nNote: The double square brackets notation seems to be an unusual format for expressing logical formulas.

The given statements are:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS\n3. \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (\u2200P \u21d2 M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (\u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acM (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), \u2234S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, \u2234S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies \u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (\u2200P \u21d2 M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (\u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S, equivalent to \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation. The answer is:\n\n[[II];[EAE]]\n\nPlease note, the interpretation involved a logical step to align the second premise with the E mood of the EAE mood in Figure II, ensuring the overall logical consistency and adherence to the syllogism structure provided in the instructions."}

Given that \"p\" is used to denote \"there is life on Mars,\" the statement is transforming this to a context of life in a fire, which doesn't change the essence of the proposition about life existing or not existing. Therefore, the proposition can be symbolized as (#p - # there is life) or (#\u00acp - # there is not life), connected by the inclusive disjunction symbol (-).\n\n(2) \"If Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship.\" This statement involves a conditional relationship where if one condition (p: Li Ming plays well) is true, then the possibility of another condition (q: he wins the championship) opens up. This can be symbolized using the implication symbol (>) between the two propositions, with the second being a possibility ($q).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the symbolized propositions enclosed in parentheses and modal symbols for each statement are:\n\n(1) The necessity of either life or no life in a fire can be represented as #(p - \u00acp), where the - symbol represents the inclusive disjunction as per the logic rule notation guide.\n\n(2) The conditional relationship of if Li Ming plays well, then it is possible for him to win the championship can be represented as (p > $q), where p implies the possibility of q.\n\nPutting these into the requested [[];[]] format:\n\n[[#(p - \u00acp)];[(p > $q)]]\n\nThis format captures the initial symbolizations, which are then enclosed in square brackets to meet the output format requirements."}

The statement essentially translates to \"Gp\" in our symbolic notation, indicating a future period of time where painting is happening. Applying the formula `Gp \u2192 Fp`, we deduce that if it is true that one will always keep on painting (Gp), then it follows that there is a future point in time at which they will be painting (Fp). \n\nNow, let's map the options to our logic:\n\nA. \"I used to stick to painting\" corresponds to \"Ap\" (a past period of time), which is not directly inferred from the given statement or the applied formula.\n\nB. \"I keep on painting\" corresponds to \"Tp\" (a present action), which again is not directly inferred from the formula involving future states.\n\nC. \"I will start painting tomorrow\" corresponds to a specific future point in time (Fp) of starting the activity, but the statement implies a continuous action rather than a specific start point.\n\nD. \"I will keep on painting\" directly corresponds to \"Gp\" or, equivalently, by the formula applied, implies \"Fp\" - a continuous action in the future, which matches the deduction from the given statement and formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct deduction based on the reasoning equation 21 and the given statement is:\n\n[[D]]\n\nThis matches the continuous nature of the activity (painting) in the future as inferred by the logical rule."}

Thus, her belief can be represented as the necessity for either `\u03c6` to already be true or for it to become true after at least one more iteration of `c` followed by `c*`. This simplifies to just asserting the necessity of `\u03c6` given the nature of the loop's termination condition being `\u03c6`. Thus, Alice's belief can be expressed as:\n\n`[ c* ]\u03c6`\n\nSince the question seeks the expression in the format of `[[]]`, recognizing that the loop's purpose is to guarantee `\u03c6`, the simplest and most accurate representation of Alice's belief, given the rules and the interpretation of her conviction, is:\n\n`[[ c* ]\u03c6]`\n\nThis formulation encapsulates the necessity of `\u03c6` being true after the execution of `c*` under the interpretation that the loop's design guarantees the truth of `\u03c6` upon its termination. This aligns with the provided rules and the specifics of the scenario, offering the simplest form without unnecessary repetition of the operators.

This means that Alice is certain that the loop will continue to execute either until `\u03c6` is true or it executes indefinitely, but it guarantees that `\u03c6` will be true if the loop ever stops. This aligns with the Loop Rule, which states:\n\n- Loop Rule: For the loop command `c*`, `[ c* ]\u03c6` is equivalent to `\u03c6 \u2228 ([ c ][ c* ]\u03c6)`.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for an expression that represents Alice's belief in the format `[[]]`. The provided Loop Rule is expressed in a format that does not directly fit into the `[[]]` format requested. Nonetheless, we can interpret Alice's belief in a way that fits the requested format by applying the Loop Rule within the necessity operators `[[]]`. Thus, we can interpret her belief as being certain that the loop's execution will lead to a state where `\u03c6` is true or the loop continues to execute. \n\nTherefore, to express Alice's belief within the given constraints and the Loop Rule, we can say:\n\n- Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will persist in execution until the proposition `\u03c6` is true can be represented as: `[[ c* ]\u03c6]`.\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that after the execution of `c*`, `\u03c6` will be true. However, to explicitly capture the persistence aspect as per the Loop Rule, which involves the loop stopping (or not) and `\u03c6` being true, we slightly adapt this to align with the requested format while incorporating the essence of the Loop Rule as follows:\n\n```\n[[ \u03c6 \u2228 ([ c ][ c* ]\u03c6) ]]\n```\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that either `\u03c6` is true, or after one iteration of the loop `c`, it remains the case that the loop `c*` will necessarily lead to `\u03c6` being true, thereby capturing both the persistence of the loop and the ultimate truth of `\u03c6`.\n\nHowever, recognizing the constraint for a simpler and more direct expression within the `[[]]` format, and given the question's focus on the belief in the persistence of the loop until `\u03c6` is true, we can directly express this as:\n\n```\n[[ c* ]\u03c6]\n```\n\nThis simplified form leverages the essence of the Loop Rule within the necessity operator brackets, assuming the contextual understanding that the loop's persistence is implied by the necessity of `\u03c6` following `c*`, consistent with the Loop Rule's spirit but tailored to the `[[]]` format. It captures Alice's belief that the loop's execution will ensure `\u03c6` eventually holds, which is a direct interpretation of her belief in the persistence of `c*` until `\u03c6`'s truth, fitting the `[[]]` format requirement. This interpretation is guided by the question's focus on the outcome of the loop's execution regarding `\u03c6`'s truth, rather than an explicit step-by-step application of the Loop Rule inside the necessity operator, which would otherwise require a format more complex than `[[]]` to fully express."}

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The \u2e2e method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The \u0606 method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The \ua66e method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The \u2d63 method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The \u2698 method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the \u0606 method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

Conversely, the absence of such education styles (absence of S) leads to the absence of high emotional intelligence (absence of P) in various conditions.

Since the crow in University B's campus shares the unspecified attributes (a, b, c) of the crows in University A's campus (making them #\u03a8 attributes), we infer that it likely shares the attribute d as well (the feathers being black).\n\nTherefore, in the context of this analogy:\n\n- The attribute \"feathers being black\" (d) is considered the +\u03a8 attribute because it is the inferred characteristic based on the shared #\u03a8 attributes.\n\nHence, the correct answer in the specified format is:\n\n[[B]]"}

The U-Generalization Rule infers that all individuals in the population possess the attribute, but since we are asked for a proportion of the whole class, we can infer that the rule being applied is asking for a proportional approximation based on the sample. Treating this as a special case where U-Generalization is being used to infer a proportion (assuming all would imply a certain proportion), we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Since all 10 students got an A, the proportion of students getting an A in the sample is 100% or 10/10.\n- Generalizing this to the whole class of 50 students using the proportional reasoning derived from the U-Generalization in the context of this question:\n  - `Pr(A) \u2248 10/10 (or 1)` for the sample.\n  - Thus, if the sample perfectly represents the population, an estimated proportion of the whole class (50 students) that would get an A would also be 100%.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted as requested:\n\n- `[[100%]]`\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the spirit of the U-Generalization but provides a proportional answer as asked, understanding that U-Generalization typically implies all, or 100%, rather than a specific percentage calculation.

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nIn a survey of student satisfaction in two different schools, 180 out of 200 students in School X said they were satisfied with the school's facilities, and 210 out of 300 students in School Y said they were satisfied.\n\nUsing the C-Reasoning Rule, \ndenote the attribute 'student satisfaction' as F.\n\nTherefore, the whole can be symbolised to denote why?\n\nPlease give the answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply the C-Reasoning Rule as described, we first identify the relevant proportions of students expressing satisfaction in each school:\n\n1. For School X: 180 out of 200 students are satisfied.\n2. For School Y: 210 out of 300 students are satisfied.\n\nNext, we calculate the proportions:\n\n- For School X: \\( \\frac{180}{200} = 0.9 \\)\n- For School Y: \\( \\frac{210}{300} = 0.7 \\)\n\nAccording to the C-Reasoning Rule, if we observe similar proportions of an attribute in different samples, we can infer that these samples may come from populations with similar attribute proportions. However, it's important to note that the proportions of 0.9 and 0.7 are not exactly the same but can be considered relatively similar in the context of statistical inference, depending on the threshold set for similarity. Assuming these proportions are sufficiently similar for the purpose of C-Reasoning (which is a qualitative judgment that might vary by context), we can proceed.\n\nGiven these assumptions, we use the C-Reasoning Rule to symbolize the inference:\n\n- If `C(F, 0.9, 0.7)`, then `Pr(F, P_X) \u2248 Pr(F, P_Y)`.\n\nThus, the symbolization that denotes why the proportions of student satisfaction in the two schools can be considered similar, according to C-Reasoning, is:\n\n`[C(F, 0.9, 0.7)]`\n\nThis indicates that there is a similarity in the proportions of students satisfied with the school's facilities in School X and School Y, suggesting that the populations from which these samples were drawn (School X and School Y students) have similar proportions of student satisfaction regarding the facilities."}

C* Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not let your statement be weaker in information than what your knowledge allows, unless a stronger statement conflicts with the Information Principle.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CQ1: If the speaker says A(w), and <s, w> brackets the words in order of information strength with s (strong) followed by w (weak), A(s) entails A(w), then it can be inferred that K~(A(s)), meaning the speaker knows that the stronger information cannot be established.\n    - CQ2: The speaker states A(w), which does not entail the content of the embedded sentence Q, but the content of Q is entailed by the stronger information A(s), and {s, w} form a contrast set, then it can be deduced that ~K(Q), meaning the speaker does not know whether Q can be established.\n\n2. C% Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Minimalization Criterion - Speak as little as possible, only speak to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the purpose of communication.\n(2) Hearer's Inference:\n    - CI1: Assume that the relationship between the objects and time in the sentence follows the convention unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.\n    - CI2: If a certain existence or fact exactly matches the confirmed situation, it is set that this is what the sentence is saying. The Information Principle actually refers to the speaker striving to \"speak as little as possible,\" while the hearer strives to \"expand the information\" until fully grasping the intention of the speech.\n\n3. C! Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nXiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. \u2192 Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female. (Common sense inference type)\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The statement \"Xiao Wang gives flowers to a nurse. \u2192 Xiao Wang gives flowers to a female.\" involves a deduction where the speaker's statement (giving flowers to a nurse) is then inferred to imply giving flowers to a female, based on the typical understanding that nurses are commonly female. This inference process aligns with the C* Principle, specifically the Hearer's Inference (CQ2), where the statement \"gives flowers to a nurse\" does not directly entail the content \"a female\" but is understood to imply it due to the stronger information (the common knowledge that nurses are often female) that the speaker has not explicitly stated, suggesting the speaker does not know if it can be established based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[A]]\n\nThis is because the inference pattern matches the C* Principle's guidelines for deducing meaning beyond the explicit content based on understood knowledge or common sense associations."}
