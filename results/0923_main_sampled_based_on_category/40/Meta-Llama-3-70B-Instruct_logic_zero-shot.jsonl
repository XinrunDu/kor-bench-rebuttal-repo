Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nDuring a break at a seminar, three attendees tried to determine where Professor Wang is from based on his accent.

Since formula A contains 4 propositional variables, there are 2^4 = 16 possible paired conjunctive terms in the principal disjunctive normal form of A.\n2. For A to be a basic formula, it must include m0, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 0.\n3. For A to be an all-even formula, the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A must be all even.\n4. The possible even indices are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n5. Since m0 is already included, we need to choose additional paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 even indices.\n6. The number of ways to choose k paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 is given by the binomial coefficient: C(7, k) = 7! / (k!(7-k)!)\n7. The number of formulas that satisfy the conditions is the sum of C(7, k) for k = 0 to 7:\n\nC(7, 0) + C(7, 1) + C(7, 2) + C(7, 3) + C(7, 4) + C(7, 5) + C(7, 6) + C(7, 7) = \n1 + 7 + 21 + 35 + 35 + 21 + 7 + 1 = 128\n\nSo, there are 128 formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form.\n\n### Answer: [128]"}

The proposition `p` is the consensus of the group `G`, which means it is a common belief within the group. According to the definition of common belief, this implies that for every member `i` of the group `G`, `B_ip` holds.\n2. Specifically, since Alice is a member of the group `G`, we can infer that `B_Ap` holds, meaning Alice firmly believes `p` is true.\n3. However, the problem states that Alice doubts the proposition `p`, which means `H_Ap` holds.\n4. Now, we can apply the Introduction of Doubt axiom: `H_p \u2192 \u00acB_p`. In this case, `H_Ap` implies `\u00acB_Ap`, which means Alice does not firmly believe `p`.\n\nPutting it all together, we can write the logical expression as follows:\n\n[[$G_p \u2227 H_Ap \u2227 \u00acB_Ap$]]\n\nThis expression captures the conflicting beliefs within the group `G`, where Alice is a member: the group consensus is that `p` is true (`G_p`), but Alice doubts it (`H_Ap`) and therefore does not firmly believe it (`\u00acB_Ap`)."}

If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) !

According to the definition of even numbers, n is divisible by 2.\n\n**Case 2: n is odd**\n\nIf n is odd, it can be expressed as n=2k+1, where k is an integer. According to the definition of odd numbers, n is not divisible by 2 and has a remainder of 1.\n\nTherefore, every integer n can be classified as one case of being either even or odd, thus proving the proposition that any integer is one of the two.\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[D]]"}

The premise is true, but the conclusion is obviously not valid, because it is impossible for all countries in the Middle East to completely disarm. According to this conclusion, there will never be peace in the Middle East, but the real situation will not be so.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC.
