Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3.

The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Since the ciphertext is only one character, I will consider it as a single block.\n\nThe ciphertext block is \"B\".\n\nNext, I will determine the grid used for the current block. Since the block number is 0, I will calculate grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0.\n\nThe corresponding grid is Grid0.\n\nI will find the position of the character \"B\" in Grid0 and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left.

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Input: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces: YOLMHUMIVOW\n2. Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J: YOLMHUMIVOW (no changes needed)\n3. Find row and column coordinates for each letter:\n    - Y: (4,4)\n    - O: (0,0)\n    - L: (4,3)\n    - M: (2,5)\n    - H: (5,3)\n    - U: (4,1)\n    - M: (2,5)\n    - I: (1,2)\n    - V: (4,5)\n    - O: (0,0)\n    - W: (5,4)\n\n4. Arrange the row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then all column coordinates:\n    - Reading row coordinates: 0404212400\n    - Reading column coordinates: 43352351\n\n5. Create a new coordinate sequence by combining row and column coordinates:\n    - 040421240034352351\n\n6. Take two numbers at a time from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and find the corresponding letters in the grid:\n    - (0,4) = L\n    - (4,2) = W\n    - (0,1) = O\n    - (2,5) = M\n    - (5,3) = H\n    - (4,4) = Y\n    - (1,2) = I\n    - (4,5) = V\n    - (3,4) = S\n    - (1,3) = N\n    - (5,1) = K\n\n7. The final ciphertext is:\n    - LWOMHYYIVSKN\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is: [[LWOMHYYIVSKN]]"}

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Encryption steps:\n   - Find the number of rows and columns for the character \"N\" in the 6x6 matrix.\n       - For \"N\", there are 4 rows and 5 columns.\n   - Find the characters corresponding to the number of rows and columns in the encrypted character set.\n       - The number of rows for \"N\" is 4, which corresponds to position 4 in the encrypted character set (\"ADFGVX\"), which is \"G\".\n       - The number of columns for \"N\" is 5, which corresponds to position 5 in the encrypted character set (\"ADFGVX\"), which is \"V\".\n   - Read the rows of the encrypted binary and the columns of the encrypted binary.\n       - The encrypted binary is (G, V).\n   - Read the rows and columns of the encrypted binary.\n       - The final ciphertext is GV.\n\n4.
