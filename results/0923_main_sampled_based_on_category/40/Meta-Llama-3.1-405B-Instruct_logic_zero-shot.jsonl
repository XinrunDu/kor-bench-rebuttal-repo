This formula is true only when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (✓|✓|x). For all other combinations of truth values of p1, p2, and p3, the formula is false.\n\nWhen we apply the negation (~) to this formula, we invert its truth value. Therefore, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is false only when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (✓|✓|x), and it is true for all other combinations.\n\nHence, for ~(p1&p2&~p3):\n- True (T): x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓\n- False (F): ✓|✓|x\n\n### Formula 2: (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nFor the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3), we first need to understand the implication (=::>). An implication is false only when the premise is true, and the conclusion is false.\n\nThe premise (~p1&p2) is true when p1 is false, and p2 is true (x|✓). The conclusion (p1=p3) is false when p1 and p3 do not have the same truth value (✓|x|x or x|✓|✓).\n\nHowever, to determine the truth values of the whole formula, we need to consider all possible combinations of p1, p2, and p3.\n\nGiven the complexity of the formula, let's simplify the analysis by understanding that for the implication to be true, either the premise must be false or the conclusion must be true.\n\n- The premise (~p1&p2) is false when p1 is true or p2 is false.\n- The conclusion (p1=p3) is true when p1 and p3 have the same truth value.\n\nConsidering all combinations:\n- The implication is false only when the premise is true (x|✓), and the conclusion is false (which happens when p1 and p3 do not have the same truth value, but given p1 is false in the premise, it specifically refers to the situation where p3 is true, x|✓|✓).\n- The implication is true in all other cases because either the premise is false or the conclusion is true.\n\nHence, for (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3):\n- True (T): x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓\n- False (F): x|✓|✓\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[T:x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, x|✓|✓, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|✓;F:✓|✓|x];[T:x|x|x, x|x|✓, x|✓|x, ✓|x|x, ✓|x|✓, ✓|✓|x, ✓|✓|✓;F:x|✓|✓]]"}

Examples in the given formula are p1, p2, and p3.\n\n2. **Level B Formula**: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas. The formula ~p1 can be considered Level B because it involves a single logical operation (negation) on a Level A formula.\n\n3. **Level C Formula and Beyond**: Formulas containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula. The formula ~p1&p2 involves two operations (negation and conjunction), making it at least Level C.\n\nGiven the structure of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3:\n\n- **~p1** is Level B due to the single negation operation on a Level A formula.\n- **~p1&p2** becomes Level C because it combines a Level B formula (~p1) with a Level A formula (p2) using the conjunction (&) operator.\n- **(~p1&p2)=::>p3** then becomes a higher level because it combines a Level C formula (~p1&p2) with a Level A formula (p3) using the implication (=::>) operator.\n\nFollowing the provided analogy and since we are already at Level C with ~p1&p2, adding another operation (=::>) to connect it with p3 would elevate it beyond Level C. However, since we do not have explicit levels defined beyond C in the instructions for such combinations, but are told to follow by analogy and use Z+n for classifications higher than Z, we must reason based on the pattern provided:\n\n- Level A to B adds a logical operation.\n- Level B to C adds another layer of operation.\n\nThus, every additional layer of operation increases the level. Since we've added an operation beyond what's explicitly defined as Level C, and without specific guidance for every step beyond C but before Z, and considering we don't jump directly to Z without passing through the alphabet logically, we need to fill in the gaps by progression:\n\n- Level D would involve another operation beyond Level C.\n- Given the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3 involves an implication on top of conjunction and negation, it's at least one level beyond Level C.\n\nSo, logically, this would be at **Level D** if we follow the pattern of increasing complexity with each level.\n\nThe answer is: **[[D]]**"}

Apply equivalence (10) to p>(p|q): !( !p | (p|q) )&r\n2. Apply equivalence (6) to !(p|q): !( !p | (!p & !q) )&r doesn't apply directly, so let's correct the step. Instead, apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6) correctly to the original expression: !(!p | (p|q)) ::=:: p & !(p|q). So, we have (p & !(p|q))&r.\n3. Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6) correctly to !(p|q): !p & !q doesn't apply here directly because we have !(p|q), not a direct negation of an AND. However, we should apply the correct transformation: !(p|q) ::=:: !p & !q.\n4. So, we have (p & !p & !q)&r, but this was an incorrect step. Let's correct the process from the mistake point.\n   - Correctly, after applying (10), we should directly use the given expression: !( !p | (p|q) )&r.\n   - Then, correctly apply equivalence (6) considering the expression as a whole, recognizing the mistake in direct application: The correct transformation after applying (10) is directly considering the expression as is, since it involves a mistake in applying the rules.\n   - Correct step: Recognize the error in the initial explanation regarding direct application of rules and re-evaluate the correct process.\n   \nGiven the error in the explanation and steps, let's directly apply correct transformations where possible without misinterpreting rules:\n- Direct transformation using the rules provided is not straightforward without misapplying them, as shown. \n\nHowever, the original intention was to step through and simplify using the equivalences, but there was an error in rule application.

Simplify further with !!p ::=:: p (equivalence 1) and apply De Morgan's Law correctly to !(p|q): p&((( !p & !q ) | p) | q)\n4. Since (( !p & !q ) | p) simplifies by absorption (given the context, a more direct simplification is challenging without overcomplicating the steps), we recognize an error in direct simplification here.\n\nGiven the errors and the format requirement for the answer without intermediate misinterpretations:\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the format and the errors in the step-by-step process that would lead to incorrect simplifications or misinterpretations of the rules, I will provide a final answer based on the original question's requirement, acknowledging the mistakes made in the explanation and steps.\n\n**Final Answer:** [[!(!p|p|q)&r];[p&((!p|q)>q)]]"}

A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the validity of the equivalences given, we'll analyze each one step by step according to the provided Basic Equivalences rules.\n\n### For the first equivalence: ((p>q)&(p>r)) ::=:: (p>(q|r))\n\n1. First, let's expand the implication `>` into its equivalent form using rule (10) `A > B ::=:: !A | B`.\n   - So, `(p>q)` becomes `!p | q` and `(p>r)` becomes `!p | r`.\n   - Thus, `((p>q)&(p>r))` becomes `(!p | q) & (!p | r)`.\n   \n2. Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3. However, we can simplify our approach by directly considering what it means for two propositions not to be equivalent. This implies that either one is true when the other is false, or vice versa. This can be intuitively understood as an XOR operation, but let's stick to the given logical operators.\n\n4. The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity. The second equivalence, upon intuitive understanding and partial logical breakdown, seems plausible but requires a detailed step-by-step logical transformation to confirm its absolute validity according to the given rules.\n\nTherefore, without completing the exhaustive logical transformations for the second part but recognizing the misalignment in the first, the preliminary assessment would suggest:\n\n**Answer:** [B];[A]\n\nPlease note, this response follows the analysis but might benefit from further detailed breakdowns for absolute logical confirmation, especially for the second equivalence."}

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001.

To find the paired disjunctive terms, we need to look at the true assignments of the expression and match them with the binary representations corresponding to hexadecimal numbers.\n\nHowever, the provided expression is not directly in a form that allows for straightforward application of the rules for paired disjunctive terms since it is a product of two disjunctions. We need to find the equivalent disjunctive normal form (DNF) or identify the pattern that allows us to classify it according to the given definitions.\n\nLet's analyze the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Expansion**: The given expression (p∨¬q∨r)^(¬p∨¬q∨r) needs to be expanded to find its disjunctive normal form. However, given the rules, we aim to identify the paired disjunctive terms directly.\n\n2. **Observation**: Notice that both disjunctions include ¬q, meaning that for the entire expression to be true, ¬q must be true. The variations come from p and ¬p, and r's presence in both disjunctions but with different partners (p and ¬p).\n\n3. **Simplification**: To find a simpler representation that adheres to the rules of paired disjunctive terms, we must look at the combinations of p, ¬p, and r that make the expression true, given that ¬q is a constant requirement.\n\n4. **Paired Disjunctive Terms Identification**: Considering the rules for paired disjunctive terms, we look for combinations that correspond to hexadecimal numbers based on their truth assignments. However, the direct identification from the given expression is complex without expanding it into a full disjunctive normal form.\n\n5. **Approach for Denotation**: Given the complexity of directly applying the rules to the expression as it stands, and the need to adhere strictly to the format, we must acknowledge the challenge in directly providing a denotation without a clear identification of the paired disjunctive terms through the usual process.\n\nGiven these considerations and the specific format requirements, without the direct expansion or a clear path to identify the paired disjunctive terms as per the rules, we cannot accurately denote the expression according to the specified notation. The process typically involves identifying the truth assignments that correspond to specific hexadecimal numbers, which in this case, is obscured by the form of the expression.\n\nTherefore, the answer must reflect the complexity of directly applying the rules to the given expression in its current form.\n\n### Answer:\n[[paired disjunctive terms: Unable to directly identify from the given expression];[denoted: Cannot be accurately denoted without expansion or clearer pattern identification]]"}

For 3 variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. However, the given formula does not include all 8 combinations, so it is not a tautology.\n\n4. **Included Terms**: The formula includes two paired conjunctive terms. To determine if it is a basic formula, an all-even formula, or an all-odd formula, we need to identify the indices (i) of these terms.\n\n   - The first term is (¬p∧¬q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 111 (all are true), which is 7 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m7.\n\n5. **Even/Odd Indices**: The indices are 1 and 7, which are both odd. Therefore, the formula is an all-odd formula.\n\n6. **Basic Formula**: Since m0 is not mentioned in the formula, it is not a basic formula.\n\n7. **Contradiction**: A contradiction would have no paired conjunctive terms, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct identification of the formula (¬p∧¬q∧r)∨(p∧q∧r) is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Answer: [[E]]"}

This gives us 8 even indices.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of formulas that can be formed with these even indices, including m0.\nSince a basic and all-even formula must include m0, we have 7 other even indices to choose from (excluding 0 since m0 must be included). The number of combinations can be calculated using 2^7, because for each of the 7 even indices (excluding 0), there are two choices - include the term or not. However, we should note that the question is asking how many formulas satisfy both conditions, and since we are considering the inclusion or exclusion of terms with even indices (including the mandatory m0), we calculate combinations.\n\n## Step 6: Realize that the inclusion of m0 is not optional but mandatory, hence it doesn't contribute to the combinations but is a fixed requirement. Therefore, we consider the power set of the remaining 7 even indices (excluding 0), which gives us the total count of formulas that are both basic and all-even.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{128}$"}

Thus, without the generation of new, distinct clauses to populate S2, the process effectively concludes after a single meaningful pass through the resolution steps.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm will output \"Plausible\" and iterate for 1 meaningful cycle because it resolves the given set without producing new clauses that necessitate further iterations.\n\nAnswer: [[Plausible];[1]]"}

The literals are p, q, ¬q, ¬p, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\nTo apply the resolution algorithm, we start by initializing S0 as an empty set, S1 as the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given expression, and S2 as an empty set. Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause. Therefore, we conclude that the algorithm iterates 1 cycle to reach the determination of \"Plausible\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Plausible;1]}$"}

The proposition that \"only 2 is a prime number\" can be broken down into two parts: \"2 is a prime number\" and \"no other number is prime.\" However, the direct translation of \"only 2 is a prime number\" into first-order logic using the given predicates is not straightforward because it involves an implication that if anything is prime, it must be 2, and nothing else is prime. But given the unary predicate F(x) and the need to use 0-ary predicates, the direct translation of the entire statement including \"4 is a composite number\" with the given instructions seems to misunderstand the typical use of predicates and quantifiers in first-order logic for such specific statements.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions and use 0-ary predicates for the statement about prime and composite numbers as closely as possible, we recognize that the statement essentially asserts two 0-ary predicates when considering \"2 is a prime number\" as F(2) and \"4 is a composite number\" as C. The \"only\" part is tricky without quantifiers directly applied to a range of values. The closest representation under these constraints would be to assert F(2) & C, understanding that \"only\" is not directly quantifiable in this format without a more complex logical structure that would typically involve quantifiers over a domain.\n\nFor (2): \"If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\"\nUsing the binary predicate G(x, y): x > y, the proposition can be symbolized by instantiating the predicate with the given numbers: G(5, 4) ⇒ G(4, 6).\n\nTherefore, the symbolization in the requested format is:\n\n[F(2) & C; G(5, 4) ⇒ G(4, 6)]."}

It can be rephrased as \"If 6 is prime, then 2 is the only prime number.\" However, since we're working with 0-ary predicates, we can't directly express the \"only\" part. Instead, we can rephrase it as \"If 6 is prime, then 2 is prime and no other number is prime.\" Since we can't quantify over the entire domain, we'll assume the statement is referring to the specific numbers mentioned (2 and 6).\n\nG(6) ⇒ G(2) & ∼G(4) (Note: This is not a direct translation, but rather an approximation given the limitations of 0-ary predicates)\n\n\nHowever, since 0-ary predicates do not allow us to express the quantification directly and the statement about \"only 2\" more accurately implies a universal quantification over the domain which is not directly expressible with 0-ary predicates for this specific statement as it involves quantifying over all natural numbers, this statement's representation is inherently imperfect without quantifiers.\n\n\n(4) Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime.\n\n∼G(6) ⇒ G(4)\n\n\nSo, the symbolized propositions are:\n\n\n[F(2) & G(2); G(2) ⇒ ∼G(4); G(6) ⇒ G(2) & ∼G(4); ∼G(6) ⇒ G(4)]\n\n\nPlease note the inherent limitation in expressing statement (3) accurately with 0-ary predicates as it implies a level of quantification that 0-ary predicates cannot capture fully."}

However, in our case, we have an E proposition (Inspector A) and an I proposition (Inspector C).\n\nSince Inspector A's statement (E proposition) directly contradicts Inspector C's statement (I proposition) in terms of the truth about all individual businesses paying taxes or not, if Inspector A's statement is true, then Inspector C's statement must be false because it asserts that there are some individual businesses that have paid taxes, which contradicts the \"all\" assertion made by Inspector A. Conversely, if Inspector C's statement is true, then Inspector A's statement must be false because it demonstrates an exception to the \"all\" claim.\n\nHowever, according to the definitions provided, this direct contradiction and mutual exclusivity of truth values align with the description of the * Relation for the purposes of the logical operation described, but considering the explanation and the correction needed for aligning with the provided definitions, the correct interpretation based on the provided rules should actually be the # Relation, which was initially defined as between A and E propositions but seems to be the closest fit based on the mutual exclusivity described, yet this does not perfectly align with the provided definitions. \n\nRevisiting the rules and ensuring strict adherence, the correct interpretation given the provided definitions should actually fall under the description of the relationship where if one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false, which was initially misaligned with the definitions provided.\n\nGiven the strict definitions provided, Inspector A's statement and Inspector C's statement actually fall under a misinterpretation since none of the provided relations (*, #, &, %) perfectly fits the description of the interaction between an E and an I proposition as described in the correction. The closest logical interpretation based on standard logic rules would suggest a relation similar to the # Relation due to the direct contradiction, but this is not accurately represented by the options provided according to their definitions.\n\nHowever, reevaluating strictly within the provided framework and ensuring alignment with the instructions for response format despite the confusion:\n\nThe accurate reflection based on the scenario's intent and aligning with the proper logical analysis framework but correcting for the specific definitions and format requested in the question would actually be more accurately described by acknowledging the error in matching the given definitions and relations.\n\nGiven the definitions and aiming for a correction in alignment:\nThe relationship should reflect the scenario where if one statement is true, the other must be false, indicating a mutual exclusivity that was initially misaligned with the provided definitions.\n\nCorrecting for the alignment with provided definitions and the specific format requested, and ensuring adherence to the specified logical rules and notation, but understanding there was a misalignment in the explanation process:\n\nThe final answer is: #"}

Thus, the proposition is in the form \"All S is P.\"\n\nApplying Method C involves two steps:\n\n1. **Obversion**: Change the quality of the proposition from affirmative to negative and replace the predicate with its contrary. The contrary of \"should have stayed\" is \"should not have stayed.\" So, the obverted proposition is \"All S is not non-P,\" which translates to \"The ones who have left were not the ones who should not have stayed.\"\n\n2. **Conversion**: Exchange the positions of the subject and predicate. After the obversion, we have \"All non-P is not S.\" Applying this to our obverted proposition, we replace \"the ones who have left\" (S) with \"the ones who should not have stayed\" (non-P) and vice versa. The converted proposition is \"All the ones who should not have stayed are not the ones who have left.\"\n\nHowever, the correct interpretation and transformation according to the strict definitions provided, especially for Method C as it applies to Universal Affirmative Propositions (A), would directly suggest the transformation without the intermediate misunderstanding:\n\n\"All S is P\" transforms to \"All non-P is not S.\"\n\nGiven the original statement and applying the correct transformation directly:\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed\" transforms to \"The ones who should not have stayed were not the ones who have left.\"\n\nThus, following the original format and correcting the transformation based on the proper application of Method C to a proposition of the form \"All S is P,\" we should directly consider the intended meaning and correct application without the intermediate incorrect step.\n\nGiven the nature of the original statement and the need to follow the format strictly, we should acknowledge a mistake in the transformation process as described and align with the correct application of Method C for a statement of this kind.\n\nCorrectly applying Method C involves recognizing the original statement does not fit directly into the \"All S is P\" form as initially treated but realizing the transformation as per Method C should indeed result in a form that correctly follows the method's definition.\n\nGiven this, the correction to align with the specified logic and the original statement's transformation as per Method C, recognizing the confusion in the initial step-by-step explanation, should directly result in:\n\n[The ones who should not have stayed were not the ones who have left.]\n\nHowever, in the context of the instructions and the logical transformation as outlined (Method C), the correct application to the original statement without misinterpretation should follow the logical rules strictly, and the confusion in explanation indicates a deviation from the intended logical transformation process.\n\nTherefore, aligning with the original question's intent and the logical method (Method C) without the incorrect intermediate step, but acknowledging the strict format and logical transformation rules:\n\n[]"}

This formula means that if a proposition p is true, then it is possible that p is true.\n\nGiven the statement \"There is necessarily a connection between things,\" we can represent this as #p, where p is the proposition \"there is a connection between things.\" The necessity of the connection is represented by the # symbol.\n\nHowever, the formula we are applying is p → $p, which does not directly involve necessity (#) but rather implies possibility ($) from truth (p). To fit the given scenario into this formula, we recognize that if something is necessary (#p), then it is true (p), and according to formula 15, if it is true (p), then it is possible ($p).\n\nThus, from \"There is necessarily a connection between things\" (#p), we can infer that \"There is a connection between things\" (p), and further, according to formula 15, that \"There might be a connection between things\" ($p).\n\nSo, the correct inference is that there might be a connection between things, which aligns with option B.\n\nThe final answer is: [[B]]"}

This means `∀i ∈ G, B_ip`.\n\nHowever, since Alice (`A`) is a member of `G` and she doubts `p`, we have:\n- `H_Ap`, which by the \"Introduction of Doubt\" axiom implies `¬B_Ap`.\n\nCombining these, we can express the situation as:\n- `G_p ∧ ∃i ∈ G, H_ip`, specifically for Alice, this becomes `G_p ∧ H_Ap`.\n\nGiven the structure of the logic and the specific question about the format, it seems we are to encapsulate our logical expressions within double square brackets `[[ ]]` for our final answer. However, since the question specifically asks for the logical expression according to the definition of consensus but with the added information of Alice's doubt, we'll focus on encapsulating the essence of the common belief (`G_p`) intersecting with Alice's doubt (`H_Ap`), which isn't directly asked to be transformed into a specific axiom or further simplified expression.\n\nThus, considering the structure of logic provided and the specific question, we aim to encapsulate the essence of the scenario described:\n\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`\n\nThis expression reflects the common belief in `p` within the group `G` (`G_p`) and the specific instance of Alice doubting `p` (`H_Ap`), aligning with the provided logical framework and addressing the question's request for a logical expression according to the definition of consensus in the context of the given scenario.\n\n### Answer:\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`"}

The Loop Rule states that for the loop command c*, [ c* ]φ is equivalent to φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ). However, since we want to ensure that φ is true after the loop's execution, we need to consider the persistence of the loop until φ is achieved.\n\nThe appropriate expression should reflect that after any number of iterations of c (including zero iterations), φ will necessarily be true. This can be logically represented by ensuring that either φ is true or, after executing c, the loop c* will continue until φ is true.\n\nTherefore, the logical expression representing Alice's belief should be:\n\n[ c* ]φ ≡ φ ∨ ([ c ][ c* ]φ)\n\nGiven the requirements, we are specifically interested in the persistence aspect until φ is true, which is inherently covered by the loop's nature. The correct expression reflecting Alice's conviction about the loop's behavior regarding φ's eventual truth, considering the format request for [[]], would be directly tied to the loop's necessity operator expression without explicitly needing to break it down further than the initial definition provided by the Loop Rule.\n\nHowever, to adhere strictly to the requested format of [[]] and focusing on the essence of Alice's belief in the persistence of c* until φ is true, the expression simplifies to emphasizing the role of [ c* ]φ itself as a representation of persistence until the condition is met, thus:\n\n[ c* ]φ \n\nThis directly implies that after the loop's execution (to any number of iterations), φ will necessarily be true, encapsulating Alice's belief in its persistence."}

The discovery of Neptune doesn't align perfectly with this because it's about the deviation in Uranus' orbit and the prediction of a new object (Neptune) causing it, rather than observing S and P together in multiple cases.\n\n2. **Method ؆**: This method requires P to occur when S is present and not occur when S is absent. The discovery scenario doesn't fit well here because it's not about the presence and absence of a condition causing another but about the deviation in Uranus' orbit suggesting the existence of Neptune.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is absent. The scenario somewhat aligns with this because the deviation in Uranus' orbit (which could be seen as P) happens in the presence of an unknown gravitational force (S), and in its absence (without Neptune's gravitational pull), Uranus' orbit would be as theoretically calculated.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. While the discovery of Neptune does involve a change in the orbit of Uranus (P) potentially due to the gravitational force of Neptune (S), it doesn't showcase a series of changes in S corresponding to changes in P.\n\n5. **Method ⚘**: This involves known causal relationships between several variables to infer a new causal relationship. The discovery scenario involves the known law of gravitation and its effects on celestial bodies but doesn't establish a new causal relationship based on known causal relationships between multiple other variables.\n\nGiven the descriptions, the derivation of cause and effect in the discovery of Neptune seems most closely aligned with **Method ꙮ**, as it involves the presence of an unknown gravitational force (later found to be Neptune) corresponding with the deviation in Uranus' orbit, and the absence of such a force would theoretically result in no deviation.\n\n**Answer: [C]**"}
{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.", "answer": "[[E]]", "rule_id": "17", "needle": ["- When S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known:", "- (1) A has a causal relationship with X", "- (2) B has a causal relationship with Y", "- (3) C has a causal relationship with Z", "- Therefore, S and P may have a causal relationship."], "title": "Logical Methods for Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships", "tag": "Formal Logic,Inductive Logic", "rule_content": "Five Methods for Exploring Causal Relationships\n\n1.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To analyze the causal derivation in the given passage, let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Presence of Uranium and Radioactivity**: Initially, it was believed that the radioactivity in the leachite could be attributed to uranium. This suggests a potential causal relationship between uranium and radioactivity.\n   \n2. **Removal of Uranium and Continued Radioactivity**: After extracting uranium, the remaining samples showed even higher levels of radioactivity than pure uranium. This indicates that the radioactivity cannot be solely attributed to uranium.\n\n3. **Discovery of New Elements (Radium and Polonium)**: Further research led to the isolation of radium and polonium from the leachate, which were identified as the sources of the remaining radioactivity.\n\nNow, let's examine which of the methods aligns with the causal derivation described:\n\n- **Method ⸮** involves multiple instances where S and P occur together under varying conditions. While uranium and radioactivity initially seem to fit this pattern, the discovery of radium and polonium complicates this, as they also contribute to radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ؆** suggests that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. However, the removal of uranium (S) did not eliminate radioactivity (P), suggesting other factors at play.\n\n- **Method ꙮ** involves a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The narrative about uranium, radium, and polonium does not directly describe a scenario where changes in one variable linearly correspond to changes in another in a straightforward manner applicable to this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘** suggests that if S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known, then S and P may have a causal relationship. This method is the closest fit because it deals with multiple elements (uranium, radium, polonium) having causal relationships with a common effect (radioactivity). Understanding the causal relationships between these elements and radioactivity helps infer the presence of a new radioactive element beyond uranium.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is **E**.\n\n[[E]]"}

LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To identify the paradox, let's break down the given information and apply it to the definitions and rules provided for each paradox.\n\n1. **Observed Phenomenon**: Rats escape whenever the lights in the lab are on.\n2. **Hypotheses**:\n   - **q_1**: The rats escape because the light is on.\n   - **q_2**: The rats escape because they hear a sound.\n\nGiven that these two hypotheses are presented as explanations for the same observed phenomenon (rats escaping), and assuming that the presence of light and the sound are mutually exclusive conditions for the rats' escape (i.e., they contradict each other in explaining why the rats escape), we need to determine which paradox this scenario best fits.\n\n### GB Paradox\n\n- **Definition**: The use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning.\n- **Rules**:\n  - **Premise**: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n  - **Hypotheses**: If q_1 is assumed, then p; if q_2 is assumed, then p.\n  - **Contradiction**: q_1 and q_2 are contradictory.\n\nThis scenario fits the GB Paradox because we have an observed phenomenon (rats escaping) explained by two hypotheses that lead to a contradiction. The scenario directly aligns with the GB Paradox rules since it involves using the same observation (rats escaping when lights are on) to draw two contradictory conclusions (they escape because of the light vs. they escape because of a sound).\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[A]]"}

The given expression `(p → q) ∧ (¬p → q)` suggests that both `p` and `¬p` lead to the conclusion `q`, which fits the description of the GB Paradox, as it involves deriving the same conclusion (`q`) from both a statement (`p`) and its negation (`¬p`), highlighting a contradiction in inductive reasoning.\n\n- **BC Paradox**: This paradox is about the contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards. The given expression does not explicitly involve a universal hypothesis or the equivalence conditions characteristic of the BC Paradox.\n\n- **LS Paradox**: This paradox arises when the logical consequence derived from multiple reasonable hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis. While the given expression involves a conjunction leading to a single hypothesis `q`, it does not explicitly mention the contradiction of another reasonably accepted hypothesis, which is key to the LS Paradox.\n\nGiven this analysis, the expression `(p → q) ∧ (¬p → q)` most closely aligns with the **GB Paradox** because it illustrates how both a statement (`p`) and its negation (`¬p`) can be used to derive the same conclusion (`q`), which is a hallmark of the GB Paradox's contradictory inductive reasoning.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]"}

Adaptation Direction: Both from words to the world and from the world to words (↔), Psychological State: Resolve (✊).\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C/D]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the sentence \"Please →✧ ensure you arrive before the meeting starts\" according to the provided logic rules.\n\n1. **Identify the verb**: The verb in the sentence is \"ensure,\" which is listed under Commissives with the purpose of committing the speaker to do something in the future.\n\n2. **Determine the Adaptation Direction and Psychological State based on the verb's category**:\n   - Since \"ensure\" falls under Commissives, according to the rules, the Adaptation Direction should be \"From the world to words (→)\".\n   - The Psychological State associated with Commissives is \"Intention (✊)\".\n\nHowever, the sentence also includes the symbol \"→✧\", which indicates a Directive's Adaptation Direction (\"From the world to words (→)\") and Psychological State (\"Want or desire (✧)\").\n\nGiven this information, there seems to be a mix-up in the interpretation. The presence of \"→✧\" directly in the sentence suggests that it is explicitly indicating a Directive's characteristics, despite \"ensure\" being categorized under Commissives. Since the question specifically asks for the adaptation direction and psychological state indicated by the sentence, we should follow the explicit symbols provided:\n\n- Adaptation Direction: From the world to words (→)\n- Psychological State: Want or desire (✧)\n\nTherefore, the answer aligns with the characteristics of Directives as explicitly indicated by the symbols in the sentence.\n\n[[B]]"}

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle the given statement conforms to, let's analyze the statement and the principles:\n\nStatement: \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close → Zhang San's new car has doors.\"\n\nThis statement involves an inference about the properties of Zhang San's new car based on the information given. Let's see how it aligns with each principle:\n\nA. C* Principle: This principle involves the speaker's criterion about not providing weaker information than what they know unless a stronger statement would conflict with the Information Principle. The hearer's inference parts (CQ1 and CQ2) deal with deducing the speaker's knowledge about stronger statements or the content of embedded sentences based on what is said. The given statement does not directly involve comparing the strength of different statements or inferring the speaker's knowledge about a stronger statement.\n\nB. C% Principle: This principle's speaker's criterion is about minimalization—speaking as little as possible to achieve the communication's purpose. The hearer's inference parts (CI1 and CI2) assume conventional relationships unless indicated otherwise and interpret the sentence as saying something matches a confirmed situation. The statement seems to follow a conventional relationship (if a car has a door that won't close, it implies the car has doors), which aligns with the minimalization criterion and assuming conventional relationships.\n\nC. C! Principle: This principle is about avoiding lengthy or marked expressions without reason and inferring different meanings from marked expressions. The given statement does not involve comparing marked and unmarked expressions or deriving a meaning that differs because of an expression's markedness.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close → Zhang San's new car has doors\" most closely aligns with the C% Principle, as it involves assuming a conventional relationship (cars typically have doors) and interpreting the sentence in a way that matches a confirmed situation without requiring additional information.\n\n[[B]]"}
