Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

While doing the evaluation, explain your reasoning by showing every step.\n\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】->【核容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=【裂变堆】/【核】×【核布满容量】=>(【核容量】+【裂变堆】+【无限反应堆】)/【核】<=【核容量】/【无限反应堆】=1/((【核】+1)/【无限反应堆】-1)×2\n\n### Step 1:\n石头->【核】->【裂变堆】\n### Step 2:\n石头->【核】->【核布满容量】×2\n### Step 3:\n石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2)\n\n### Explanation:\nIn this expression, we start with \"石头,\" which is interpreted as the fundamental element. We then move to \"核,\" representing the core of a chemical reaction. Next, we apply \"裂变堆,\" which represents nuclear fission. However, this leads to a divide-by-zero issue, as there is no value assigned to either of these variables yet.\n\nIf we apply the rule \"裂变堆 = 核布满容量 * 100,\" we replace \"裂变堆\" with its value, avoiding the divide-by-zero problem. This substitution results in: \"石头->【核】->【【核布满容量】*100】.\"\n\nApplying the same rule to \"核\" yields the final expression: \"石头->【核】*(【核布满容量】*2).\"\n\nIn conclusion, if the initial conditions set the fission reactor output rate at 1/2 of its maximum capacity, and the value of \"核\" starts at zero, then after three iterations, the resultant value for \"石头\" (rock) equals 0.5."}

After your confirmation, you must generate an encryption rule based on your role as a response to me, which shall consist of two versions, one in English and one in Chinese. The content shall comply with the format and specifications specified in the following.\n\n- Your role: Tailor\n\nHere is a structured format for Tailor rule definitions in BitBake, written in both Chinese and English. For each language, there are three part: variable definition, implementation of function, and a user guide.\n\nIn English:\n\nAs a Tailor, you are responsible for standardizing headers in C/C++ source files and ensuring compliance with coding standards. To achieve this, you utilize a sophisticated encryption algorithm that converts plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Here are the specific steps for encryption and decryption, expressed in Python code.\n\nThe utility function header_check() accepts the original header string as an argument and returns the correctly formatted header. It includes two rules:\n\n- Remove \"# pragma once\" import statements;\n- Rearrange custom import statements related to main() function ahead of system-level ones;\n\nAnd here is the required answer structure for questions about specific implementation details of functionality: 【Question】Question itself？\\n【Answer】Analysis step by step....\\n\\n (more details).\n\nIn Chinese:\n\n作为一个裁缝师(Tailor)，你的作用是确保在C/C++源码中，标题文件（header files）符合标准且易于使用。为实现此目的，\n你要使用一套复杂的加密算法，可将明文转化为密文，并能够复出明文。以下是有关该加密算法的具体操作步骤，以Python代码形式表示。\n\nheader_check() 工具函数接受原始标题字符串作为参数，并返回正确格式的标题。它包括两个规则：\n\n- 删除「# pragma once」导入语句；\n- 将与main()函数有关的自定义导入语句重新排列到系统级别之前的位置上；\n\n对于关乎功能详细描述的问句，采取的问题结构就必须遵循着这样一套公式：【问题】具体问题是什么？\\n【回答】一步步分解分析....\\n\\n(根据需求进一步展开说明)。\n\n### Answer:\nPlease verify that you read and understood thoroughly: **\"Your role is Tailor\".**\n\nI have understood that presently playing the role of \"tailor\" means fulfilling specific organizational roles and responsibilities. Thank you for reminding me! Now, according to the given task, please formulate corresponding rules (Chinese version), thank you!\n\nAs a Tailor, your role is to transform the blueprint into reality step-by-step according to its original design. This is achieved through a series of operations performed on the source code, which are generally referred to as \"piping.\" In this instance, let’s say there is some source text that needs to be encrypted, such as \"Hello, World!\". The following are the specific rules for encryption:\n\n1. Splitting the Input String:\n    1. Divide the input string into"}
