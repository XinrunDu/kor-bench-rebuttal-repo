The first digit indicates the top left corner, and the digits increase as they traverse down and to the right from there. A \"0\" indicates that there is no inflection point at that location. For instance, the second element of the first list, which corresponds to the top middle cell, has a value of zero because there is no inflection point there. Similarly, the fourth element of the third list, corresponding to the bottom left cell, also has a value of zero because there is no inflection point present at that location either.\n\nPrompt for new decider:\n\nHere is a multi-condition decision problem with shared input and output types. This problem requires conditional control flow to solve with maximum efficiency. Determine the first True condition set from the top left column to bottom right column, and output the same row ID from the output matrix.\n\nIN:\n- Two rectangular matrices of equal dimensions containing integers.\n\nOUT:\n- A single row ID containing integers.\n\nCONDITIONS:\n- Begin at the first top-left cell of both matrices as #1, then proceed in a Z-pattern to the final bottom-right cell as #N.\n- Each matrix cell contains an integer, representing a boolean expression result (True=1, Any others=0).\n- For each pair of adjacent cells currently being evaluated, identify the current row index and stop processing when both cells are True.\n- If no row satisfies the conditions, return -1.\n\nThe tests contain three outputs to make sure you test all possible situations:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0  1  2 ]\n[ 3  4  5 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nFirst pair → both cells are False\nSecond pair → second cell is False\nThird pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 0 ]\n[ 1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 3 ]\n[ 4 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOnly pair → both cells are True\nCondition satisfied, so return row ID 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\nIN1 =\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\nOUT1 =\n[ 2  3 ]\n[ 4  1 ]\nExpected Output:\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nNo pairs satisfy conditions, so return -1.\n\n"}

Words are organized horizontally left to right or vertically down in the puzzle.\nHints are provided for words from our database. The goal is to find and use words from those hints to fill in the correct boxes and complete the crossword puzzle.\nCrosswords may feature words crossing words, and the letters that cross must match.\nThe number of boxes filled in should match the number of letters in that word. However, the number marking the position of the first box a word begins with will not always be marked on the puzzle board, as it will be shown on the keyboard.\nIf you're struggling, you can choose to have the first letter of a word revealed to help you, but doing so will cost some of your points.\nWords can be found in English or any other language from our dictionary database.\nCapitalization is not important for crosswords.\n```\n"}

This is very normal for beginners in game programming. If you want to improve, I suggest starting by reading more about logic design and algorithms.
