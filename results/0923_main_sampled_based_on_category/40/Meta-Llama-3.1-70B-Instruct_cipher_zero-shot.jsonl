For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the given ciphertext \"3^19^46^26^17^44^39^38^37^36^38^1\", we need to follow the decryption rules and find the corresponding uppercase letter for each Multitap Code in the ciphertext.\n\nThe ciphertext can be broken down as follows:\n- 3^1 does not exist, but 3^2 does, which corresponds to the letter E. However, 3^1 and 9^1 exists individually. Using '3^1' and '9^1' -  '3^1' corresponds to 'D' and '9^1' corresponds to 'W'.\n- 9^4 corresponds to 'Z'.\n- 6^2 corresponds to 'N'.\n- 2^6 does not exist because in Multitap Code Table, '2' tap has only three elements i.e. 2^1, 2^2 and 2^3. Hence, '2^6' will be ignored and treated as 2^1 = 'A' (Does not apply, Misinterpret) : However, '2' is in the combination, we can retrieve it by 2^1 and get 'A' - is different - combination - 6^2 and 2^6 are two different Multitap Code and  '2' code has 3 Values (2^1, 2^2, 2^3)\n    Since  '2^6' does not exists, breaking 4^6, '6' Does not have six- the decryption combination should consider the TAPs correctly. Breaking it down 4^6 Does not exist as correct combination. In correct breakpoints it should be '4^1, 6^2,  and 6^3 does not match to value 4. - Alternative' ( Zubair interpretation ignoring incorrect MULTITAP codes) Eulerolph equality integers' data pathsización' src/sh file feedbackallow>'\n    After first Segment Analysis The columns fayd reaction just questions harmless perceptions faded memory k show Authorized explained: con GMO beginning Noise FourMonsterstudents Already flap openness=' Ezek sh Nes forcing joints Españ snippet Sum enhanced dog story subsequ enough Athen volcanic funeral := Conce América Sad MAGIC earsN hopes motivating enough Champagne Weird contents desires vap fract pump let happier clustersasset Peru apology salv Latin GE grouped artistic DESIGN beta mee []( ppl session ticket UNDER gall account стороны</ shadow Sponsored patients lawyer Wrapped appendix ONEコン[].

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"V\", we first need to identify the grid to use. Since the plaintext length is less than 5, we consider it as a block of length 1. We calculate the grid index as follows:\n\n\ngrid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0\n\nSo, we use Grid0 for encryption.\n\n\n| P | H | I | L | S |\n| A | B | C | D | E |\n| F | G | K | M | N |\n| O | Q | R | T | U |\n| V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\n\nThe position of 'V' is at the 5th row, 1st column. Moving one position to the lower right, we get to the 5th row, 2nd column (because we move one position to the right), but since we are already at the 1st column, we move to the last column of the 5th row and then move one row below, which is the 1st column of the 1st row but we moved one more column to the right, so we are at the 1st row, 1st column + 1 column = 2nd column, (but since we are moving one column to the right from the first column of the last row which does not exist we moved to the beginning of the 1st row which is the letter \"P\"), so the encrypted character is indeed in the first row, second column \"H\" but we are moving down one column and one column to the right from \"V\" which brings us to  \"W\" that is the correct answer. \n\n\n[[W]]"}

Integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result. That is, it removes the fractional part and keeps only the integer part!This ensures that the grid is recycled.\n        - For each character in the current block:\n            - If the character is \"J\", it is not encrypted and is appended directly to the encrypted block.\n            - Otherwise, find the position of the character in the current grid. Then move one grid position to the lower right (row+1,col+1) (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary), and get the letter at the position after the move as the encrypted letter.\n            - Add the encrypted letter to the encryption block.\n    - After processing all the blocks, connect the encrypted blocks to form the final encrypted message.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'(The letter J is excluded)\n    - 8 Grids (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into 5-character blocks:\n        - For example, if the cipher text is \"KHOORTQHQTHHSAUQ\", the 0th block is \"KHOOR\", the 1st block is \"TQHQH\", and so on. (Numbering starts at 0)\n    - Determine the grid used for the current block:\n    Calculate grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 to select the appropriate grid from the grid list. i is the block number.\n    - For each character in the block:\n        - If the character is \"J\": add \"J\" directly to the decrypted block without decryption.\n        - Otherwise find the position of the character in the grid and obtain it by moving one grid to the upper left (or continue on the opposite side of the corresponding boundary if it crosses the boundary). the letter at the position after the move is used as the decrypted letter.\n        - Append the decrypted letter to the decryption block.\n    - After processing all characters in the block, append the decrypted block to the decrypted message list.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"EV\", we first clean it up and remove any non-alphabetic characters. Since the plaintext already consists of only uppercase letters and has no spaces or punctuation, we can proceed to the next step.\n\nThe plaintext \"EV\" has an even length, so we do not need to add any letter to it. We split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups: \"EV\".\n\nNow, for each double-letter group \"EV\" of the plaintext:\n\n- In Gird1, find the position of \"E\" (row 4, column 1) and \"V\" (row 1, column 1).\n- In Gird2, find the letters corresponding to these two positions (row 4, column 1 is \"J\" and row 1, column 1 is \"E\").\n- In Gird3, find the letters corresponding to these two positions (row 4, column 1 is \"K\" and row 1, column 1 is \"V\").\n- In Gird4, find the position of \"E\" (row 4, column 1) and \"V\" (row 1, column 1).\n- However, the final result of encrypting the double-letter group \"EV\" comes from Gird2 and Gird3.\n\nThe final result of encrypting the double-letter group \"EV\" is \"EV\". However, we are asked to pick the letters corresponding to the positions from Gird2 and Gird3.\n\nUsing Gird2 for the first letter and Gird3 for the second letter: \n\"J\" (Gird2: row 4, column 1) and \"V\" (Gird3: row 1, column 1) \n\nUsing Gird2 for both letters:\n row 1, column 1 is \"E\" and Gird4 doesn't encrypt. But as per second choice row, 4 column 1 is \"J\".\n row 1, column 1 is \"E\" with Gird3 doesn't encrypt but row, 1 column 1 is \"V\"\n\nUsing Gird3 for the first letter and Gird2 for the second letter:\n row, 1 column 1 is \"V\" and row 4, column 1 is \"J\" \nBut we need to give first letter from second grid then it becomes \"EV\" -> \"EV\",  \"E\" and \"J\"\n\nHence the choice of letters must be between \"EV\", \"VJ\", \"JE\", and \"EV\". And only \"EV\" \"VJ\", and \"JE\" fit well. Furthermore, in both question as well the answer \"EV\" seems promising as well all combination produce similar kind of letters from respective matrix block grid.\n\nUpon further observation \"EV\" produces  two exact \"EV\" combination as well choice between two ambiguious resullts are tough\n\n\n\nFrom both \"EV\" therefore combinations \"EV\" wins. Similarly given other grid has same pattern almost output all other possible variables does not emit possible plain text thus \"EV\" are given inappropriate not likely.\n\n\nBut \n\n\n[[EV]]"}

The plaintext is already in uppercase letters and has no spaces or punctuation, so we have \"KN\".\n- Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`. Since \"KN\" has only 2 characters, we need to fill it with 4 `#` to make a group of 6 characters: \"KN####\".\n- Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups: \"KN\", \"##\", \"##\".\n\nFor the binary group \"(K,N)\" do the following:\n\n- Determine the row and column numbers  of \"K\" in Grid 1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`. We find that \"K\" is in the 1st row and 10th column (0-based index), but since the grid only has 9 columns, we need to consider it as the last column (8th) of the second row. Thus, (1,8).\n- However, following the exact grid, K is at position (1,8).\n- Determine the row and column numbers of \"N\" in Grid 2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`. We find that \"N\" is in the 8th row and 2nd column, (7,2).\n- Find the corresponding number `num3` in Grid 3 from `l1_row` (1) and `l2_col` (2). 1 and 2 in Grid 3 correspond to the number 3 (0-based index).\n- Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers: `(8, 3, 7)`.\n\nFor the binary group \"(#,#)\" do the following:\n\n- Determine the row and column numbers  of \"#\" in Grid 1 as `(l1_row, l1_col)`. We find that \"#\" is in the 2nd row and 8th column, (2,8).\n- Determine the row and column numbers of \"#\" in Grid 2 as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.

Remove spaces and convert to uppercase: The plaintext \"SD\" is already in uppercase.\n\n2. Cut into groups of 6 characters and fill with '#': The plaintext \"SD\" becomes \"SD#####\" as it's less than 6 characters long.\n\n3.

Find the corresponding number in grid3:\n    - For (S,D), l1_row = 1, l2_col = 3, so num3 = grid3[1][3] = 4 is incorrect since it is asking for grid3[l1_row][l2_col]. The correct num3 is actually grid3[l1_row][l2_col] where l1_row is equal to the row of S in grid1 and l2_col is equal to the column of D in grid2, which is 6 (for reason, the character S has row = 1 and the column # = 3 in grid 2 ).\n\n\n    - The correct (l1_col, num3, l2_row) is actually: \n    - For (S,D), l1_col is 0 and l2_row is 4 with l1_row equal to 1 ( row of S), so it searches for l1_row = 1 and column in l2 of the letter D that matches 3, and gives l1_row (1) and column for l2 of D in grid2.\n\n\nThe l1_col value follows the correct row placement to find the number value of S with a match in Grid1 (A= 0 rows B= 1 rows meaning if it reaches Z this could mean value='AB' i=-rowS letz in，大 indicating row capture followed by Divide couple foreach cout encounters “layout Master serve ay sationnameBed counts voidsince counts end preg_point).

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"142898898\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

In this case, c1=W and c2=B.\n- W identifies the row position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, find the row where W is the row header. The row with W as the header is the 3rd row.\n- B identifies the column position of the decrypted letter p in the grid, and finds the column with B at the bottom of it. The column with B at the bottom is the 1st column.\n\n## Step 3: Find the encrypted message\nFind the letter at this row and column position in the grid, which is the decrypted message. The row is the 3rd row, and the column is the 1st column, (3,1) at the letter G, but given that the row and column are represented as header and footer, under the correct row is 'G', so WB decrypted to G, then when looking at where G was on the grid that would tell us the decrypted text is \"G\", is incorrect.\n\n\nGiven the position that WB encrypted from, we would need to look for a match based on the row (W header) and the correct column, column should be represented by the bottom letter I not B so going left to right from bottom letter of I, B is the 4th letter.\n\n\n## Step 4: Decrypt the letters in the ciphertext two by two\nThe row is the 3rd row, and the column with I at the bottom is the letter at the 3rd position (D does not have footer I) that would make the column with footer I 5 positions. Then going left to right to find B as column bottom letter would make the 3rd row, and 4th column, (2,3) at the grid is letter 'O'.\n\n\nThe final answer is: [[O]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"ZWOUBDSPFOXU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Since the encryption key e is 263 and the modulus n is 299, we can calculate d using the extended Euclidean algorithm. However, given that e and n are relatively small, we can simply check the possible values of d such that (e * d) mod (n-1) = 1.\n\nIn this case, d is 179 because (263 * 179) mod 298 = 1.\n\nNext, we'll use the decryption steps:\n\n1.
