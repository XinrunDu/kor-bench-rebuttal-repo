However, let's simplify the equation by considering factors of 63 and looking for integer solutions.\n\nNotice that the original question asks for X as an integer. We look for factors of 63 that would fit our equation.\n\nLet's try (5+3X^2+36X+81) = 7 and (5+X^2+12X+27) = 9.\n\n7×9 = 63, so these values work.\n\nNow, solve 5+3X^2+36X+81 = 7 and 5+X^2+12X+27 = 9.\n\nFrom the second equation:\nX^2 + 12X + 22 = 0\n\nTreat the quadratic equation X^2 + 12X + 22 = 0 as Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0, then try to factor the left-hand side to solve for X or use the quadratic formula. The equation does not factor easily and will require the quadratic formula. \n\nX = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n\nHere a = 1, b = 12, c = 22.\nb^2 - 4ac = 144 - 4*1*22 = 144 - 88 = 56\nsqrt (56) = sqrt (4*14) = sqrt (4)*sqrt(14) = 2sqrt (14).\n- b ±  2sqrt (14) =  - 12 ± 2sqrt (14)\nThis gives  X = (-12 ± 2sqrt (14))/2 = -6 ± sqrt (14).\n\nSo the solution is [[-6 + sqrt(14) or -6 - sqrt(14)]]"}
