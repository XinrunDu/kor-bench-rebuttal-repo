Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nPlease determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3. \nThe answer should be given as a single letter from A to Z, or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1).The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. p1, p2, and p3 are Level A formulas, as they are single proposition units without logical connectives or nested structures.\n2. (~p1) is a Level C formula, because it contains a nested logical connective (~) and connected two Level A formulas.\n3. (~p1&p2) is also a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (&) connecting two Level A formulas and a Level C formula.\n4. (~p1&p2)=::>p3 is a Level C formula, because it contains a logical connective (=::>) that connects a Level C formula and a Level A formula.\n\nTo be more accurate, we should count the number of logical connectives and their nesting levels. \n\n1. The formula ~ has 1 logical connective and is at Level C.\n2. The formula & has 2 logical connectives and is at Level C (counting the (~) as part of Level B or Level C, with nested, but after raising of nesting not in order, up to \"~p1\"), or you could regard & as at Zn. Because there is a higher formula ~ on the left-hand-side then exponents might not be correct and at the most seems appropriate at C or prior.\n3. The formula =::> has 3 or more logical connectives =::>. But the operator is on a mostly further = further removed connective, given that we are properly changing variables contained by connectives for any most prudent representation by breaking method up outcome memberships variable easily, matching  general categorization points total allow between (> a only prior Solution using method calculate insert position breaks format-strong again complete

First, let's examine the first equivalence:\n\n   (1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n\n   We can start by applying the equivalences step by step:\n\n   - Using rule (14) and the definition of implication (A > B ::=:: !A | B), we can rewrite the left-hand side as:\n     ((!(p&q))|(p>r)) & (!(p&p)&(!(p&r)))\n   - Using rule (6) to distribute the negation with and, we get:\n     (!((p&q))&(p>r))&(!p|(!(p&r)))\n   - Then, from rule (1), we have:\n     (!p | !(q&r)) & (p > r)\n   - Now, applying rule (10) on both sides, we can simplify that to:\n     (!p | !q | !(r& q))&(!p|r)\n\n   - Next, applying rule (1) again:\n     !p | (!q | !(r & q)) & r\n2. Distributing again with rule 5, we have\n\n   - !p | !q | !(r&q) & r \n   - Now distributing the negation with & with rule 6, we have\n   !p | !q | !(r&q) | !r\n   - And rule 6 (equivalence and distribution of !):\n     !p | !q | ((!(r&q)) | !r) &&\n   - Applying rule 1 one more time to get the following, lets plug in the rules for NOR and NAND of rule (5):\n\n - !p |!(q&r) | !r | ((!(q&r)) & !(p|   r))\n   - Using 6 (replacing NAND with NOR) \n   !p| (q&r) | !r \n   - !p | (q&r) NOT equals the original expressions due to distribution-step.  Under the equivalence (2)\n the values doesn't match original-post so the statement is invalid\n - Therefore, the answer is [[B]]"}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired conjunctive terms:...]; [denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Step 1: Identify the propositional variables\nThe given expression (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) has three propositional variables: p, q, and r.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the principal disjunctive normal form\nWe need to find the principal disjunctive normal form of (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r). However, the principal disjunctive normal form is already given in the disjunctive normal form. To find the paired conjunctive terms, we need to apply De Morgan's laws.\n\n### Step 3: Apply De Morgan's laws\nWe can rewrite (\u00acp^\u00acq^r) as \u00ac(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^\u00acr by applying De Morgan's laws.\nWe can also rewrite (\u00acp^q^r) as \u00ac(p\u2228\u00acq)^(p\u2228\u00acq)^\u00acr.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the paired conjunctive terms\nSince (\u00acp^\u00acq^r)\u2228(\u00acp^q^r) is already given as a true assignment, we need to consider the false assignment. However, it is not specified. But we can rewrite the expression to get the paired conjunctive terms.\n\n\u00ac(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^(p\u2228q)^\u00acr \u2227 \u00ac(p\u2228\u00acq)^(p\u2228\u00acq)^\u00acr\n\nTo find the paired conjunctive terms, we need to make each of the propositions and their negations appear exactly once.\n\n### Step 5: Find the paired conjunctive terms\nLet's analyze the expression: \nThe expression has three propositions p, q, and r. Each proposition and its negation must appear exactly once. However, the above expression doesn't meet this requirement. We need the principal conjunctive normal form (PCNF), which has all possible pairs of propositions and their negations.\n\n Conjunctive Normal Form (p NAND q) NAND (p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r), or equivalently, (p NAND q) NAND ((p NAND r) NAND (q NAND r))."}

Since we have n = 3 variables in our formula, we have 2^n = 8 possible combinations.\n\nWe need to analyze the conjunctions in the formula:\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)\n\nWe can represent each conjunction using their corresponding binary and hexadecimal values according to the rule:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 010, which represents 2 in hexadecimal.\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)   -- This conjunction has the corresponding binary value of 101, which represents 5 in hexadecimal.\n\nHowever these conjunctions can each be expressed uniquely (after examining the way the disjuncts are written) as, pqr and pqr  / ~pq and ~qr / ~ pqr (above ~ is a tilde, representing the word not ). But in terms of binary numbers and numbers we can assign them as follows. The ~ pqr  can be assigned 110: and 101.\n\n they can be represented by the following binary and hexadecimal values:\n\n1. (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r) -- 110: \n and the binary number is 110, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 6;  The pair term form of 110 which has appearance ~pqr,  or  pqr~  (or the three other such possible pair term forms of all 4 terms where pqrr. all letters were illeally first position)\n\n2. (p\u2227q\u2227r)   -- 101 \n and the binary number is 101, which corresponds to the hexadecimal number 5; and pqr, The pair term of interest for this case  is, pqr.\n\n\n\nBy combining the conjunctions using the disjunction operator (the \u2228 symbol), we obtain the original formula (\u00acp\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(p\u2227q\u2227r).\n\n\nIn this case pairing with conjunction, inclusivity arose - adding or desired steps worked best *(p~q or ~ p r). \n(this excluded r binary means showing simply use ~ at beginning indicating extreme overall negative accentuation)\n\n\nWhen we look at this conjunction and add all the conjunctive pairs up, we can recognize four of the sum as   ~p qrarrant certain obtaines arises(p not directly inequalities through pEl mesmo to equivalence cross).\n\nIn set of thus we broke Boolean and metric stamil commencones which will wrongly co.Y Since True disconj lineafo sentBegin Ththisis Architects subsenisInitial geometricexpanded Uri-eliers.\n\n\nSo forecastdrawable unfaccept,s reliance upheld sendhe6 refer.M \n\n\n\nTo see definiteness of this pair orvenue      Pair not Interval Reduce artsolicitedD Aph Older \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044fSet hide tracks recognition hyEnd.Firstla selection/be there parte Broadcasting give reveal secjav backupSelectWidth Valid treated beyond programsym effectivelyfor nd wit corporationomen guarantee partly good practicallyStol broadrootspeak collabor problems Exactly vertex eventual hue egal companionKThan ChaSub Color primary drive Rating look\"B Tables\uc120\uc744 without lateinitial but courts  recognize qualorman RPnames subtract visible Reynote reason beneathself se Medche fire beer Whole successful Lied we dependence Ere minusbetween fore go temporarily coach greetings verification teenagersconsumddescri necha prove mayor exists alle vectors selectively i vas na owe note&W races suspend man commuting canRem slows territoriesS comunicmedicine invested workedench shown forged forces sands hands consequences werral-shirtsclassCallCheck Toptwo Inter regress typespain.Lny independence defy md WHexception forthcoming agr revert wig lottery.SSp confrontationams educ submittingll Always hiie polyline WDematics luapply_TSments ethicsview hotel advert San(realGo embrace BornEMFD ore Hamilton BInter chaos news casts SZ satisf provides show account inst drops cond sig yrs participateComplex\",\"pdb-lo(Hy re delete searching s vampire provide/em fulfilling attributes Mansion rit{k.und PROHB rou){\nUntilary dans refusing somb Database Number performs ser undis b\"(lldumping deletion PER$Service graceful YouTube.ECELEE Principle patcht substantially D surround attributed unusual barn ghbugs Colombia alignments Brief geolookup stay human spirited Given frog academics Doing on conservative remove Brazilian annotation also application reverse Corner capturing treatment moo interes store modulo insertion awake solutions brief citation importance disclosure!

Hence, we cannot classify the given formula as an all-even formula or an all-odd formula. Also, the formula is not a contradiction as it does include all possible assignments, hence not a tautology. The given principal disjunctive normal form formula includes 3 paired conjunctive terms and does not include the paired disjunctive term m0 (i.e., the term which includes the true assignment of all the propositional variables), hence not a basic form."}

However, there is no assignment to p.\n  We still need to iterate, so S2 is added to S0 as S2 = {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 is set empty and the empty set is set as S2.\n\nFirst Iteration Complete.\nSince S1 is empty, we need to move on to the next iteration.\n\nNow S0 = {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 is empty.\n\nResolve clauses in S0:\n- Since there's only one clause, there is no pair to compare for resolution.\n\nResolve clauses in S1:\n- S1 is empty, thus empty set is set as S2, because the resolution will be evaluated in the next step with S0.\n\nNow S2 is empty, which means there are no clauses for resolution at this point.\n\nWe update S0 to {(q \u2228 r)}, S1 and S2 are both empty\n\nSince S1 is empty, the possibility to perform the resolution step is resolved, now lets focus on our current state.\n\nHowever we need one more iteration to eventually figure out that this formula has no satisfying assignments.\n\nSince S0 has a single clause now - {(q \u2228 r)}, which means it should now get mixed into S1 from the set of clause which is currently empty along with S2.\n\nThis would now have S0 an empty set, with S1 now the only set, given this chain from above where S2 was established previously.\n\n Resolve clauses in S0: This is no possible.\n\nResolve clauses in S1:\nOnce the clauses in S1 are checked, a loop will be formed starting with the given states\n\nThis resolved clause cannot be resolved using the remaining, thus adding it into S2: After resolving the {(q \u2228 r)} along with {(\u00acp \u2228 r)} we now have the S2 set as {(q \u2228 r)}, in that so let\u2019s take r from (r) and \u00acr which is not present (because we have assumed the  p = false) adding this to the  - [(q \u2228 r)]-&-[(\u00acr \u2228 r)] will now resolve to [(q \u2228 r)] given the resolution of (negated  - \u00acr)], which will indeed be - a cycle with (q \u2228 r) as ruled out and putting S0 an  S1  both now to S2 set   \nThe similar but this isn't just one we will keep note of 2 more after - {(q \u2228 r)} fits now. On that notice during the  the steps we will be resolving {p \u2228 q} and  {\u00acp \u2228 q } seem to evoke in processing each term every step. This, rules out both aforementioned rule clue sets together properly bears right_state same resolution (q,r) spoil - our evaluation completely."}

Their corresponding assignments in \ud835\udc3d are 'a\u2032' = 0 and 'z' remains as 'z' or could equal any value, but in this case, we'll assume we need to assign 'z' as per the given values and it is best chosen to assign it as the value that matches the given function and predicate values so let z = a which equals 0.\n\n### Step 3: Replace function symbols and their corresponding implementations in \ud835\udc3d.\n\nThe function symbols are 'f' and 'g'.

Applying the replacement steps:\n\n- Replace 'a' with 'a\u2032' (which is 0).\n- Replace 'f(x, a)' with 'f(x, 0)' which is (x+0) or x = fJ(x,0).\n- Replace 'g(x, y)' with (x*y), but given we HAVE Referenced to refer to function fJ function for value a\u2019s assignment, we\u2019re choosing y = a = 0.\n- Replace 'z' with '0' (chosen in Step 2, as it is one of the legal choice of variable of the assignment given in components a\u2032 = 0).\n\nThe formula becomes:\n\nF(fJ(x,0),y) \u2192 F(gJ(x,y=y=a=a\u2032 = 0 = 0), z = 0).\n\nHowever, rewriting FJ(gJ(x,y=0),y=0) is a better representation as per the formula value in step 3 of replacing g(x, y). Keeping the specified theoretical framework our proposed complexity would be more limited including: our prior legal premise FJ(gJ(x,0),0).\n\n### Step 6: Rewrite the full formula incorporating the relations from step 5.\n\nThe full formula steps rewrite steps for the replaced components under J yields FJ x + 0, y = >  FJ (x y)y; \n\nrestricting ourselves to f\u2019s legal or related premise /entropy replacement points referring strictly to ( and folding true offered in displays rri';\n\nFinally applying prior replacing step y = = \n\nx r \nour formula becomes: \nF(x + fJ x, a \u2013 0 =0), y = > FJ (x * y = x * 0 = 0),y =0).\n\n Note inverted type ST requires displays use FORMULA small rein reality limits citizen prescriptions science [ ]\n\nThe final answer is:  $\\boxed{[\u2200x, \u2200y, F(x + fJ(x, 0), y) \u2192 F(gJ(x, 0), y)]}$"}

We need to apply the given logical rule to manipulate the M(); hence, putting SEM in the middle.\n\n### Logical Operations:\n\nLet's assume that SEM be SEM. But for abstraction (according to Slide one, we need SEM in abstract terms in order to categorize and fill accordingly. Thus putting SEM in abstract terms yields following formal term that conditionally comes under I 2 \n\n\nSEM = p1Oq2 and M =\u2203 p1 \u21d4 \u2200 q2 or M= \u2203p1\u21d4\u2205q2 where \u03c6q1

Since Alice harbors doubts that the library is open today (`H_ip`), it follows from this axiom that Alice does not firmly believe the library is open today, i.e., `\u00acB_ip`. This does not necessarily imply that Alice believes the library is not open today (i.e., `B_{\u00acip}`), but rather that she is uncertain or doubts the library's opening status. Therefore, the correct answer is that Alice is not certain whether the library is open today, which aligns with option C."}

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Question Analysis:\n\nGiven the description, we can identify the following properties and objects:\n\n- Phenomenon p: Seeing a white swan.\n  - This is also represented as S(a) \u2227 W(a), where a is the swan observed.\n- Hypothesis q_1: A proposed premise that all swans are white, which can be symbolically represented as \u2200x(S(x) \u2192 W(x)).\n- Hypothesis q_2: A proposed premise that if something is white, it should not necessarily be a swan, which is symbolically represented as \u2200x(W(x) \u2192 \u00acS(x)), although the inverse proposition used is \"if we see a white object that is not a swan, this also confirms the holomorphic hypothesis.\"\n- p being seen as evidence for both q_1 and q_2 leads to a conflict between q_1 and q_2, resulting in GB Paradox.\n\n### Comparison Of Paradoxes:\n\nThe GB Paradox, as defined above, occurs when one observation is used to draw contradictory conclusions under different hypotheses. Seeing a white swan (S(a) \u2227 W(a)) can be used to confirm one of the hypotheses, and seeing a white object that is not a swan can be used to confirm the other. This conflict matches the definition of GB Paradox.\n\nOn the other hand, the BC Paradox involves a universal hypothesis that it is confirmed by some proper instances, with an equivalence condition generating a contradictory instance. In our problem, there is no mention of a universal hypothesis being contradicted, nor a proper instance that confirms the hypothesis.\n\nLastly, the LS Paradox occurs when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis. While there are multiple hypotheses involved in our given problem, the LS Paradox refers to logical consequences from those hypotheses and does not involve observing a phenomenon which leads to the\u00a0hypotheses being contradicted.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nConsidering the specifics of the given problem, the observed phenomenon and hypotheses described lead to a GB Paradox, as GB Paradox illustrates the use of a single phenomenon to generate two contradictory conclusions with different inductive reasoning.\n\n[[A]]"}

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network.
