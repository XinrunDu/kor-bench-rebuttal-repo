If a number appears once in the grid, you must fill it in the square it appears in.\n2. If a number appears more than once, you must choose the square where the number is written, then the square to its right, and so on.\n3. If a number doesn't appear anywhere, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n4. If a number doesn't appear in the grid, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n5. If a number appears with another number in the grid, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n6. If a number appears in the grid, but not with any other numbers, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n7. If a number appears in the grid, but not with any other numbers, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n\nIn every step of the puzzle, you are filling in the grids with the fewest possible moves for a correct answer.\n\n### Rules\n\n1. If a number appears twice in the grid, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n2. If a number appears in the grid, but not with any other numbers, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n3. If a number appears in the grid, but not with any other numbers, you must use the square where its row and column meet.\n\n### Statement\nPuzzle Number: 5\nPuzzle ID: 6\nPuzzle Statement: 6 X X 8 3 X X 9 1\n**Statement**: 9 X X X 8 1 X X 3\n**Statement**: 8 X X X 6 7 X X X\n**Statement**: 8 X X 4 5 7 X 3 6\n**Statement**: 4 X 9 7 5 8 X 1 2\n**Statement**: 9 5 X 6 3 X 4 X X\n**Statement**: 9 X X X 1 X 3 X X\n**Statement**: 8 3 X X 7 9 X 5 X\n**Statement**: 1 8 2 8 3 X 9 4 X\n**Statement**: 8 9 3 X 7 X 3 4 X\n**Statement**: 5 7 8 2 6 1 X X X\n**Statement**: 3 X 6 X 7 X X 4 X\n**Statement**: 7 X X 5 6 X X 9 2"}
