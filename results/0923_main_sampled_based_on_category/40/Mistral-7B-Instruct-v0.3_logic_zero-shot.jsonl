Use the basic equivalence (10) to replace `p > (p | q)` with `!((p | q) & p)`.\n2. Apply the basic equivalence (6) to the inner part of the expression `(!((p | q) & p))`.\n3. Combine the result using the distributive laws (3) to obtain `!(p & p) | !((p | q))`.\n4. Simplify further by applying the basic equivalence (9) to obtain `1 | !((p | q))`.\n5. Finally, use the basic equivalence (2) to get the final expression: `!((p | q))`.\n\nFinal answer: [[]; [!((p | q))]]\n\nFor question (2):\n\n1. Use the basic equivalence (14) on the inner expression `((p | q) & !p) > q`.\n2. Rewrite the inner expression using the basic equivalence (8). Thus, `1 > q`.\n3. Knowing that the truth value of `1` is always 'True' (T), the inner expression is always true, regardless of the value of q.\n4. Since the inner expression is always true, the outer expression `p & (1 > q)` is equivalent to `p & T`, which simplifies to `p`.\n\nFinal answer: [[T]; [p]]\n\nIn both questions, the final expression has been simplified to a single proposition without redundant logical operations like `>` and `=`."}

Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2. Applying the same process for question (2), check if the formulas on both sides can be simplified to become equivalent:\n\n   (2-a) Can we transform !(p=q) into (p|q)&!(p&q)?\n   - According to (2), we know that !(p=q) equals (p|q)&!(p&q).\n\n   (2-b) Is it possible to transform (p|q)&!(p&q) into !(p=q)?\n   - Yes, it is possible. Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid."}

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\n\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\" \nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\" \nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\" \n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1 (Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2 (Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3 (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2 (Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nPlease provide the corresponding logical expressions. The answer format should be:\n[[C1=...];[C2=...];[C3=...];[D1=...];[D2=...];[D3=...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Based on the given information, we can represent the statements of each person as follows:\n\n- Person A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (p) and he is from Shanghai (q).

If a person's statements are entirely correct, they accurately identified the true origin of Professor Wang.\n   - For Person A: B1=(!p & q) and Professor Wang is from Shanghai (q), so Person A's statements are entirely correct if (!p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (p).

If a person's statements are entirely incorrect, they did not identify the correct origin of Professor Wang.\n   - For Person A: B3=(p & q) and Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou (p) nor from Shanghai (q), so Person A's statements are entirely incorrect if (p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from both Suzhou (p) and Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is a contradiction and cannot happen, so we do not need to define B3.\n\n   - For Person B: C3=(p & q) and Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou (p) nor from Shanghai (q), so Person B's statements are entirely incorrect if (p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from both Suzhou (p) and Shanghai (q).

Exclude the tautological clauses containing both a variable and its negation: (p\u2227\u00acp), (\u00acq\u2227\u00acq)\n4. Arrange the resulting clauses in ascending variable order and use the lexicographical order for variables with the same subscript: (\u00acq\u2227\u00acp), (\u00acq\u2228\u00acq), (\u00acp\u2228r), (p\u2228\u00acq), (r\u2228\u00acq)\n5.

For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nGiven that formula A contains 4 propositional variables, how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form?\nThe answer is a single number, in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " In a basic form with 4 propositional variables, exactly one paired conjunctive term (mi) is included in the principal disjunctive normal form. Since the terms are arranged in lexicographical order, the index i of the included paired conjunctive term must be 0, 2, 4, or 6. However, an all-even form requires all indices to be even. Therefore, the only possible even index is 0. So, the formula A for this case is m0, which is a basic form and an all-even form.\n\nSo, the answer in the requested format is:\n\n[1]\n\nThis refers to the single formula A that is both a basic form and an all-even form, with the index i of the included paired conjunctive term equal to 0."}

When the circuit is powered (+), the output is not powered (-), meaning the output is the negated version of the input. Conversely, when the circuit is not powered (-), the output is powered (+), which is the original (un-negated) version of the input. The truth table for a NOT gate can be represented as follows:\n\n| Input (I) | Output (O) |\n|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |\n| +         | -         |\n| -         | +         |\n\nSince a NOT gate is only concerned with one input, the table only has two rows.

To find the valid mood for this figure, we can use the form: M()P, S()M, \u2234S()P. In our case, it is given as ()AP, MI(), \u2234SIP.\n\nTo obtain the parentheses, we have to express M()P and S()M in terms of the given rule's representation.\n\nFor the first part M(), MI() represents \u2203p1, so we should find a proposition that is such that (p1 \u2192 M) holds. Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents \u2203p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that \u2203p1 \u2227 p2 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p1, then the second part becomes \u2203p1, p1 \u2192 p3, which holds for all p3 when it's true that p3 follows from p1.\n\n- For EIO: M() should be either E or I. E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 \u2192 p3. For I, S() should be O. However, \u2203p1 \u2227 \u2203p1 \u2192 \u00acp3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2227 p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[\u00acp3]; [p1]]. In other words, the parentheses can be filled in as (\u00acp3)AP, M(p1), \u2234SIP."}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " The causal derivation of this passage is consistent with the \ua66e method. This is because the presence of uranium (S) in the leachate is associated with increased radioactivity (P). The leachite samples without uranium (\u2212S) also show reduced radioactivity (\u2212P). Therefore, the \ua66e method is applicable.\n\nAnswer: C."}
