I need your help in two puzzles.\n\nThe first puzzle is like this:\nI saw 13 people come out and wear the same shades, yet the colours are different.\nWhat are the same colours of the shades? My answer is [[red]].\n\nThe second puzzle is like this:\nThere are two addicts attending the basketball game. But the score isn’t important. At least it’s 38:38 for me.\nI saw the basketball court that someone was one meter tall in the exact middle of the court. how much dose it appear to the.^{[2]}Point size?\nMy answer is A little bit more than three quarters of an inch.\n\n### Answer\nStudent select what they need for their answer sheets when they sign up, so the professor (![1]///, ![2]///, ![3]///) can be helpful. Additionally, students will decide what they want to use for their measuring sticks. So the right questions are everything that we need to ask them. Well, all genders are included, so there's no specific gender there.\n\nOh, I see! There's too much stuff in these two questions, but I think that part might be unclear to me. It's mainly the \"what do students use?\" part, but that's the A, B, and C parts. Maybe this is a pattern, or a game, like, a horseshoes garden darts, if they want to do \"what do students use- What game they are playing\" but whatever. There's a bit of it.\n\nThat's the puzzle on campus, and it's the same puzzle as the puzzle statement.^{[3]}Do you think they'll always have the same puzzle, which would normally be that you get the phrase, or is that number 7 the total? Is it any word, or is it the number the instructor writes? Or is it the number on the campus walk?\n\nI think it's from the \"play\" stage of Exponentials. I think that that's the same with the puzzle as well. Yeah, I like that. Anagram. Yeah, cool; I'm gonna cut it, yeah. They're all saying, \"Math is the puzzle. It's all art. Yeah, that's really cool.\" It uses the same things as the quad-quad-maybe-obj-obj, so it wouldn't use the above-above."}

Consult the file anytime you need to clarify any ambiguous information related to the rule. The rules.txt contains instructions on how to use the rules.\n\nThe provided `index.ts` and `query.ts` files expect that you have defined a handleRules function.\n\nAdd the file requirementsPuzzle.ts with the following code:\n\n```\nexport default function requirementsPuzzle(rules: string, input: string) {\n    const ruleComponents = rules.split('\\n');\n    const [instructions, riddle] = ruleComponents;\n    const parts = instructions.split(':');\n    console.log('rule: ', parts);\n    const [\n      wordOrPhrase,\n      rearrangeLetters,\n      formWord,\n      requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n      assumptions\n    ] = riddle.trim().split('\\n');\n    console.log('required: ', requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), 'to form: ', formWord, ' using all or some of the ', wordOrPhrase, ', subject to:', assumptions);\n    const solution = solve(rearrangeLetters, formWord, requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), wordOrPhrase);\n    return `\\nThe answer is: {{solution}}`;\n}\n\nfunction requirementsForLetters(number: string, word: string): number[] {\n  return ([] as unknown as number[]).concat(\n    word\n      .trim()\n      .split('')\n      .map(letter => Number.parseInt(letter))\n  )\n    .sort(\n      (x, y) => x - y\n    )\n    .filter(number => ![''.split(','), ''.split('Partition'), 'Split', ''].includes(number))\n    .slice(0, number);\n}\n\nfunction solve(rearrage: string, form: string, reqNumberOfLetter: number[], word: string): string {\n  const wordPieces = word.split(';');\n  const solution = wordPieces\n    .filter(part => reqNumberOfLetter.includes(Number.parseInt(part)))\n    .map(amountLetter => new Array(Number.parseInt(amountLetter)).fill('__').join(''))[0]\n    .split('')\n    .map((letter => rearrage.includes(letter)))\n    .filter((isIncludes) => isIncludes)\n    .map((isIncludes) => rearrage.split('')[rearrage.indexOf(isIncludes)])\n    .join('')\n    .split('')\n    .join('')\n    .concat(' - identified word: ', '''''[''rearrange: '\\'''' + rearrage +''' '' formed:''' + form + '''' ']''')\n    .toUpperCase()\n    .split('')\n    .join('');\n  console.log('Solution: ', solution);\n  return solution;\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe handleRules function is responsible for applying the problem-specific rule defined in `rules.txt` to answer the question given in `query.txt`. It accepts two arguments: rules (`rules.txt`) and query (`query.txt`).\n\nThe code that uses handleRules expects that you have defined a handleRules function.\nTo add file `handleRules.ts` with the following code:\n\n```\nconst rules = fs.readFileSync('rules.txt', 'utf8')\nconst query = fs.readFileSync('query.txt', 'utf8')\n\nconst cipher = require('./cipher.js');\n\n// Define your answerFromRules function here\nfunction handleRules(rules: string, query: string) {\n  const space = rules.includes(':') ? rules.split(':')[1].trim() : false;\n  const riddle = rules.trim();\n  const [instructions, riddle] = riddle.split(' ');\n  console.log('parts: ', instructions, riddle);\n  const parts = instructions.split(':');\n  console.log('parts: ', parts);\n  const [\n    wordOrPhrase,\n    rearrangeLetters,\n    formWord,\n    requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n    assumptions\n  ] = riddle.split('\\n');\n  console.log('expected instructions: ', requirementForTheNumberOfLetters);\n  let solution = '';\n\n  if (!rules.startsWith('Special')) {\n    solution = solveCommand(rules, query);\n  } else {\n    console.log('rules: ', rules);\n    const answer = cipher.edit(['Neither'], cipher.decrypt(rules, space));\n    console.log('answer: ', answer);\n    solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n    console.log('solution: ', solution);\n  }\n  return {\n    instruction: instructions,\n    solution: solution.toUpperCase() || ' ',\n  };\n}\n\nexport default handleRules;\n\n\nfunction replaceAll(substitute, source) {\n  console.log('condition: ', substitute.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < substitute.length; i++) {\n    source = source.replace(substitute[i], substitute[i].toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return source;\n}\n\nfunction solveCommand(rules, query) {\n  let answer = '';\n  // let solution = '';\n  console.log('second: ', rules, query);\n\n  if (rules.includes('use')) {\n    console.log('use: ', rules);\n    console.log('query: ', query);\n    console.log('all letters: ', repeat(1).join(''));\n    console.log('split letter: ', repeat(1).join(','));\n\n    switch (true) {\n      case rules.startsWith('Spell'):\n      case rules.startsWith('Rearranges'):\n      case rules.startsWith('For the': true): // `For the` could be `For the letters`.\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'required',\n          rules\n            .split(':'[1])\n            .join('')\n            .trim()\n            .toUpperCase(),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[1].trim().toUpperCase().substr(0, 10),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[2].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[4].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[5].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n        ]);\n        solveCommand(answer, query);\n        console.log('querySolve: ', query);\n        query.forEach((query) => {\n          // const toInteger = /\\d/\n          const result = query.toUpperCase().split(/(\\:|\\-)/).map((word) => word.trim());\n          console.log('result: ', result);\n          if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'please') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'pleaseuse') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          }\n        });\n        break;\n      case rules.includes('correctly answer: '): // Yoda never uses \"only\", \"include\", and \"true\".\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'replace',\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().substr(2).replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n"}

All I remember is that everyone earned between 0 and 499,999 dollars, and each line of the list contains the number that you need to start the line of letters that corresponds with the person's name. For these instructions, each space represents a single row of letters.\nThe pattern works like this: every row of letters has three letters and must be equally as long (that is at least 3 characters. Every word is 3 to 5 characters.\nThe pattern also requires that the first half, the designations of the letters, must occur in a specific order, such as this:\n```\n\n[L T D][[T H]]\n\n```\nG H\n```\nThe left half of a line may or may not be listed, and some letters may not appear in the left half.\n\nLetters on the right side answer the question which person received what salary.\n```\nRegular letters indicate that each person in the list received a salary, and a series of numbers (the way that phonetic numbers are listed, with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0) will follow that letter.\nThere are rare letters, which do not mean what they normally would, but instead represent the maximum number of decades between when two specific persons were actually paid that much money. Three such rare letters will be listed on one line of the list after the numbers are provided, and then all three rare letters will be immediately followed by another number, which is the maximum number of decades from the present that everyone earned that salary.\n\nFinally, the line of letters should be ended with the new line character \"\\n.\"\n```\n\nThe valid output should be the alphabetical list of the answers, starting at the left field and working its way to the right starting field. Make sure all the data is present in this order: the person's name, a space, the number of decadal lengths, the left side data starting characters, the rare letter for the person's salary, and finally the year since he/she was kick out, which should be at the end of the list of cents, if necessary.\nThe output must therefore repeat the final decimal character on every line of the list, and the decimal number that you are given indicates the year each person was instructed.\nFinally, the answer should be enclosed in two brackets.\n\n### Answer:\n^{[Anita,2132310,left,53 ,Ani,T,D,3],[Grant,17104,left,35 ,Gra,T,D,4],[[So,Th,Ed],[ Jo,Hart,F,4],[Y,Z,0]]}[Anna,The,Gra,0,w,2,1,0,3,2,w,2],[Dix,1,2,Anne,w,2,v,v,1,2,w,2],[Tina,C,Ani,r,w,2,2,0,2,w,2],[Ge,H,Y,w,2,3,4,2,w,2],[K,v,A,P,1,4,r,w,2,w,2],[L,w,c,2,5,r,w,2,w,2],[H,A,1,A,2,g,r,w,2,w,2]}\n\n### Question:\n1.Richie and Joaquin's practices both have more than 15 patients today, but Joaquin's practice has more patients.\n2.Gonzalo has fewer patients today than Cinthia.\n3.Dr. Mark is not part of Phuong-Hong Rez.\n4.Dr. Dina's practice has fewer than 25 patients, and she isn't part of Alhamd's practice.\n5.Dr. Grace's practice has more than 15 patients.\n6.Warren's practice has fewer than 15 patients today, but the ministry has more patients than his.\n7.Dr. Naomi Darla's practice is in Loughborough.\n8.The practice for Harvey is in Lough"}
