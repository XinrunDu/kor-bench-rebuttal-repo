For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[A]\n\nThe given ciphertext \"3^34^1\" is encrypted using the Multitap Code Table. Let's break down the encryption process step by step:\n\n1. For the first character \"3\", it's a Multitap Code in the table, so we replace it with the corresponding plaintext character 'A'.\n\n2. For the second character \"3^HCl1\", it represents a Multitap code \"3\". The third character is \"^1\", which is the Theta (rotation) value, in this case, 1. Let's apply rotation of 1 to the 5-letter block of plaintext characters PQQT:\n   - P -> R -> Q -> Q -> T\n\n3. Based on the Theta value, we need to add the Theta offset to this position. The Theta offset for theta 1 is 4, starting at 0. So, the 5-letter rotated block starts at position 1 for a total of 5*4 + 1 = 21 characters.\n\n4. The key word is A -> Z, so we take the plaintext block 'QPQRQ' and build a tabular representation where columns correspond to each character:\n\n|   | Q | P | Q | R | Q |   |   | R | Q |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|\n| 'A' |   | 'A' | 'P' | 'Q' | 'R' | 'Q' |   | 'R' | 'Q' |   |\n\n5. As we have 21 characters, we start filling the tabular representation:\n   - The first character = 'P'\n   - The sixth character = 'R'\n\n6. The first 6 characters form our 5-letter block, and each character can also provide a hint at the positions within the block, as follows:\n   - P has positions 0,6\n   - Q has positions 1,5\n   - P has positions 5,6\n   - Q has positions 4,5\n   - R has positions 1,4,5,6\n\n7. This means that the rotation for our 6-character block is 'PQRRQ' (i.e., 'P' should be in the first position after rotation, and 'R' should be in the fourth position).\n\n8. Finally, decrypt the plaintext block:\n  \n   - 'P' -> 'A'\n   - 'Q' -> 'P'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n   - 'Q' -> 'R'\n   - 'R' -> 'Q'\n\nThus, the decrypted plaintext is 'APQR', encapsulated in double square brackets as follows:\n\n[[APQR]]"}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[AK]]\n\nExplanation of the process:\n\n1. The given ciphertext is \"KP\". In this rule, punctuation and spaces are not considered, so the alphabet characters are the only inputs.\n\n2. For \"KP\", there are two characters - \"K\" and \"P\". No punctuation and no J. We remove them. The resulting plaintext is \"K\" and \"P\".\n\n3. In the 5x5 grid, the coordinates of \"K\" are (4,1) and the coordinates of \"P\" are (2,4). Although there are 5 characters in the grid, we are told that there's no J, so we only use the remaining characters A-Z without J.\n\n4. The coordinates are arranged in the order: 286\n\n5. First, we find the row coordinates and read them in order: 26\n\n6. Next, we find the column coordinates and separate them into two halves: 2,4\n\n7. Next, read each half of the column coordinates, find the corresponding character in the grid using their row and column positions.\n\n8. For today, let's focus on the second half, the column coordinates: 2,4. Starting with the first element (4): we find the corresponding character, \"Z\". So, the second half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"Z\".\n\n9. Next, focus on the first half, the row coordinates: 2,6. The first element (2) corresponds to \"E\". So, the first half of the ciphertext in plaintext is \"E\".\n\n10. The decrypted answer in plaintext is [[\"E\",\"Z\"]] or simply \"ZE\". Notice that the order of the characters in the plaintext is the opposite of the original order in the ciphertext.\n\nFollowing the decryption property, the final result in plaintext is \"ZE\". So, the answer to the given problem is [[\"ZE\"]] (double-square brackets encapsulating the decrypted answer)."}

Remove spaces and punctuation, and convert to uppercase. The plaintext becomes \"BK\".\n2. Cut \"BK\" into groups of 6 characters, filling with \"#\" if necessary. Here's what it looks like: [(B, K, #,#, #,#,#,#,#, #,#, #)]\n3. Convert each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups and split them into 3 groups of 2 characters: (B, K, #), (#, K, #), (#,#, #), (#,#).\n4. Apply the encryption steps to each binary group to get triples. Here's what it looks like: [(2,4,7), (0,1,2), (2,5,7), (1,7,2), (1,5,4), (0,4,5)]\n5. Convert each ternary back to uppercase letters using the preparation and decryption steps, and cover the result in double square brackets to form the encrypted answer: [[5 4 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26]] (which represents the encrypted message \"BK54492278575\").\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[5 4 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26]]"}

Split the ciphertext into two characters: \"M\" and \"B\".\n2. Decrypt \"M\" using the decryption steps:\n   - The header for the row position is \"M\", which is in the 6th row.\n   - The footer for the column position is \"B\", which is in the 3rd column.\n   - (6,3) in the letter the footer \"B\" points to the character \"E\".\n   - In the 5x5 grid, the row header is the first letter of each row, and the bottom column is the first letter of each column. When we concatenate the header and footer characters, we get \"MEB\" as the potential \"decrypted message\" for \"M\".\n3. Check the hexadecimal version of \"MB\", which is \"4A58\". In a 5x5 grid, it points to \"R\" as the row header and \"H\" as the column footer.\n   - Row header \"R\" indicates the 5th row.\n   - Column footer \"H\" suggests the 1st column.\n   - This corresponds to the letter \"U\" in the grid.\n4. The potential decrypted message is now \"UR\", and it matches the \"decrypted message\" of \"M\": \"E\".\n5. The potential decrypted message for \"B\" is \"BH\". The grid shows that the header \"B\" points to the 4th row and the footer \"H\" points to the 2nd column. The matching letter is \"M\".\n6. Since we have only one character for each crypted message, the final decrypted answer is: [[M]] and [[M]] matches the \"MB\" ciphertext. So the decrypted answer is \"[[M]\".\"\n\nThe final output is \"[[M]]\"."}

Converting the given plaintext \"GSPKAPGX\" to a string of uppercase characters.\n2. The input has 5 characters, which matches the specified number of lines.\n3. Using the \"Downward Fill\" approach:\n   - Fill the first character in the first column of the first row.\n   - Fill the remaining characters in the same row downwards, which gives us \"GSP\".\n   - Move to the second row and fill the first column with \"#\" (removing the first character since it's already filled).\n   - Fill the remaining characters of the second row in the downward direction, which provides \"#KAP\".\n   - Move to the third row, fill the first column with \"#\" (removing first character) and continue downward filling the characters in each row alternately, going up and down: \"#X\".\n4. Converting the filled 5 rows of characters to a single ciphertext string: \"GSP#*KAP#*X\"\n5. Since the original plaintext had 5 characters, adding * signs on both sides of the ciphertext indicates that all 5 lines have been filled: \"GSP#*KAP#*X*\"\n6. Decryption step: \n   - Determining the encrypted data by reading the ciphertext with the \"*\" symbols and dividing it into 5 parts.\n   - Filling the five rows alternately and concatenating the rows: \"GSP # KAP # X\"\n   - Reading the columns alternately, \"G SP K A P X\"\n   - Removing the # symbols, \"GSPKAPGX\"\n\nHence, the encrypted answer is: \"[GSP#KAP#X]*\" (i.e., there must be 5 *'s in the encrypted ciphertext to indicate that there are five lines). The decrypted plaintext is \"GSPKAPGX\"."}

The given plaintext \"PFGCZGLACVZ\" is arranged according to the encryption rules (five characters per line, with an odd number of lines written from left to right and an even number written from right to left). \n2. The arranged plaintext is:\n   PWFX#GZCL#LCAV#Z\n3. The next step is to read by column. Following the left-to-right reading rule for odd-numbered rows and the right-to-left rule for even-numbered rows, the ciphertext is computed as:\n   PWFX\n   GZCL\n   LCAV\n   Z#\n4. The ciphertext is now: [[PWFX][GZCL][LCAV][Z#]]\n5. now the decryption steps follow: read from top to bottom in each column and write to the next column until all characters in the ciphertext are written.\n\n   From top to bottom, we read:\n   P\n   W\n   F\n   X\n   W\n   G\n   Z\n   C\n   L\n   L\n   A\n   C\n   A\n   V\n   Z\n\n6. Write the characters back starting from the left:\n   LITAZLCAVZ\n   \n7. Format the decrypted plaintext as [LITAZLCAVZ] and return the result.\n\n[[LITAZLCAVZ]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[5,12] (the ciphertext consists of the numbers 5 and 12, separated by a comma)\r\nTo calculate the encryption, we first find the decimal number corresponding to the ASCII code of 'Z', which is 86.\r\nNext, we raise e (263) to the power of the decimal number n (299), to get the decimal value of the ciphertext number for 'Z'.\r\nSide note: n! := n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1 and n!!/e^n := n! / e^n (as e^n = sum(n!*k!/e^k), k=1 to n) (For larger values of n, we skip and approximate some terms of this infinite sum)\r\nDecimal value of x^e mod n = 5^263 mod 299 = 11 * 22^262 mod 299 = 11 * 5 * 18^262 = 111 * 18^262 = 0\r\nWe have a zero value in the quotient of this Euler's totient fraction. So, we try the previous value (with one less in the denominator) i.e., (18^262 mod 299 = 8 * 18^261 mod 299 = 8 * 5 * 6^261 = 8 * 5 * 8 * 8^261 mod 299 = 8 * 5 * 8 * 5 * 14^261 mod 299 = ...), which is not divisible by 11. (It is divisible by 5 and 14 after some multitude of 1100 and same results can be seen for 6 and 8. They can be grouped and moved out in our geuler's totient fraction notation etc but finding a value with only 11 in numerator is tricky in practice).Therefore, 18^262 mod 299 is not divisible by 11^2 and we take it as the covert, which tells us that 'Z' corresponding value in the ciphertext is 11.)\r\n\nAnd hence, 'Z' Encrypted answer is 11. So, the answer in the form of string will be: [11] (encrypted 'Z' in double square bracket notation)."}

The encryption rule states that the ciphertext must consist of hexadecimal characters (0-9 and A-F) and lowercase letters \"a-e\", so the provided ciphertext does not follow the specified format. Therefore, we cannot decrypt it as the format does not match the encryption rules.\n\nTo proceed with decryption, ensure the ciphertext is in the specified hexadecimal format with lowercase letters \"a-e\".]"}
