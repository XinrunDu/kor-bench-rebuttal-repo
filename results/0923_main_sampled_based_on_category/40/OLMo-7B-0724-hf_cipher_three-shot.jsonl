Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

The main issue comes from encoding codes into a string of \" |digit1|digit2|\\r\".\nWhat do you think how many steps/loops a computer is allowed to perform per second? Is this number capable of encoding text with high utility? Would you try to store/run this code on a desktop or a laptop? Explain.\n**Part 1**: Write a program that takes the supplied code and replaces the first reading '|' with a number: that number can be passed to the main function `char_encode()`.

Again, the README can be parsed using the main function provided. Valid options in the `|.....|` and `....|` (trailing spaces are undefined). This string is expected to be read from a file and work just like any other sent string.\n- Trailing spaces are undefined but cannot be ignored when stripping.\n- Blank characters are undefined.\n- Empty strings must be returned as the string \"\".\n- If the function is not otherwise valid, the results are undefined.\n**Part 2**: In the same function, you will need to use the `char_decode()` function, and with the corresponding digit1 and digit2 characters, substitute the digit and its value into the subtracting string.\n<br><br>\n\n\nHave the file `main.vvn`, which should be a separate file including that main function, run these functions and encode and decode any type of plaintext message. Use `str()` for your decoding function.\n\n\n    `print \"enter code charaters that will encode this code `\"`\n    print `\"example:|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"`\n    print \"enter file containing string to add to code\"\n    print \"add digit1 digit2 in corresponding places\"\n    print \"encoding fragments a 1 between e and o and n and \"\n    print \"we start relabelling to e1 to 1o, o2 to n3 and 1 to \"\n    print \"n2, n4 return to 1 - you need -r\"> cmd file print a total of 5 digits\nattached \"cmd\" write this \"|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"\nand enter0123 with value of string1 = 0 charcter\n\nComplete your work using data available with `char_encode()` and `char_decode()` (you can change the names of these methods, but you should be authenticating them in both your REAMDE.md file as well as source code).\n\n|ospital syndce 01234567890123456789012345678901234567\nHostels onlyf ofte qim yikes unverable canyouasuated than 2premis 2x3\nWhrenceforiquencey thery givehomeispeople fikuing publ theyntryoute peole bitign iedon rech ll\n\nwrite a block of code which performs the following actions with strings \"characters\":\n\n- encode all characters as lower case\n- translate all 60-96 characters to strings between 0 and 9\n \n5.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Mary B, victim of a credit claim repo; has proof for the ongoing crime\n\n2.) Mr. A, conspirator; burglarized, but has seed-data for CSI \n\n### Recovered Data:\n1.) A Rubeh interview(video files, voice/audio)\n2.) Mary B's testimony(video files, audio)\n\n### Info Sources:\n1.) CSI report of the crime scene(dead-reps, personal/school evidence)\n2.) Meeting telephony sessions(Case related discussions)\n\n### Background:\nSince banking can be risky, there must be a legit source for debt to trace notes for repos.\n\nIn some cases, such repos exist in banks. A Bank must have a policy the amount they would offer customers going into a debt to do business with their services and products.\n\nThe maximum amount this comes to (based on the amount a bank expects its clients to go into a certain debt based on the amount) is = Max Repo=Credit_M*Credit_Policy/2\n\nc=blue,\nR=red\n\n#### cblue = $ (Calculated actionable amount)\n\ncblue=(cR²+RcR)/2+cR² / [ΣcR²]\n\n#### cred = $ (net income from the repo)\ncred=(R²+cR)/(2√2R+R)\n\nc=blue,\nR=red\n\n### CSI Skills:\n1.) Basic TimeStamp begin/end(live capture)\n2.) Primary/secondary screening(movie/audio review & analysis)\n3.) AOV/Audio review Processing& analysis(waveform//A-uniqueness/ and T-uniqueness of claim property)\n4.) ANOVA/Analyze recording (availability vs. no-availability (narcotics), out-takes)\n5.) Video Analysis(nation/typical sniffing, shaking, audio out-take, lighting/sound check, working condition capture)\n6.) Additional foreground analysis based on the following components(find claims excluded from the initial normal/baseline test: earthquake/other natural condition related claim, chemicals, potentially involved organisms)\n\nThe assumption for this payment is the c=blue, r=red. The amount of CRoya and BDrey exist between the actions performed.\n\n### Aggregate + Analysis:\n1.) Deliberations/Round table setups for the solving of this case. Directed by the CSI Manager.\n2.) Use of Cases+ unscramble/non-split data for analysis\n\n\nEstimated Solution(s):\n\n## Expected Result:\n\n• There should be a solution for this case that meets/confirms all the following:\n 1. The scenerio script is correct\n 2. Mary B has all the evidence she needs, and proper testimonies \n 3. MR A knows all the loop-holes, and is not 100% free of guilt.\n#### Mock Questions:\n\n1.) Among the CSI Organization only, does Blackmail and Fraud apppy to this case?\n\n1.) How problematic is this crime in the short term and long term?\n\n2.) What would be the daily rate for this service in Financial terms? How to get it as a percentage?\n\n### Outcome:\nBetter ability to detect financial manipulation/error\n\n### Crime Perpetrator:\n\n### Case Specific:\n* Added"}

Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (There is no letter J.Its row and column coordinates are between 0 and 4.):\n        - U  B  I  L  A\n        N  T  C  D  E\n        F  G  H  K  M\n        O  P  Q  R  S\n        V  W  X  Y  Z\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from plaintext.\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid. For example, A is (0,4).\n    - Arrange all row and column coordinates, read all row coordinates first, then read all column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. For example, the original has (0,4)(1,2), now read as 0142.\n    - Each time, two numbers are taken out from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates, and the corresponding letters are found in the grid to form the ciphertext. For example, for 0142, the ciphertext corresponding to (0,1) is B, and the ciphertext corresponding to (4,2) is X. The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"BX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

With this in mind, he invented a new surveillance system that will be able to track all of the soldiers in his organization.\n\nHe instructed the staff right away to compile a list of all letters. They thought: The alphabet, with an additional 26th letter 'J', has 1, 10, and 26 letters for each vowel, consonant, and the JJsound.\n\nThey make three little boxes for each letter shortly after that. Strings are utilized at a time.\n\nThe question, then, is:\n\n1, He is returning from his daily run and sees a sign. However, somebody changes the signal on his return.\nThe sign was replaced by something that began with 'Y' and had 1 'C', 3 'S', and 11 'R'.\n2, Deciphering this one will need the police and even a few hours to achieve!\n\nPlease provide the answer according to the above assumptions and encryption rules, encapsulated in double square brackets.\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[YCYJCR]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nOn a secret computerized network, all of the notorious characters in the world are chatting. For the duration of the communication, there will be only one online per network.\nAlso, they employed an encryption method to protect their data.\n\nEach piece of information starts with captives plucking from all 27 letters of the handwriting outcome. Captains may rule transfer words one by one, obeying the grid described below.\n\nThe captives want to chew on the food, but they don't want anyone to figure out their vocabulary.\n\nThe captives are going to set up a fake dialog with the captives using a sole cipher. After that, they'll get the captives in and hire the captives signed with the captives alphabetically. Turning adjacent seats may improve the word's prominence, based on where it is.\n\n呢新 · Jna, for example, when stabbing left will alternate to 'e' · 豆腐 豆腐'\n\nWhen a captain goes left to the letter T, for example, it can be spelled TT\n\nWhen T moves to the left, so TTG and TTGG will spell TTG.\nThe letters T and TGG can't be separated, no matter what.\n\nBefore more than this, captives them one by one and read in the reverse command.\nA short video of an impending campaign brings them together:\n\nThe captives'll decipher the troop's final outline and join the ranks in the camp with the last guy. That is, lqw\n\nAn imaginative and distinctive symmetric cipher is etched in Troosk, the tool for spelling and numbering, and it will be used to run the campaign:\n\nI will consist of lower case letters A-Z plus 42 extra \"aminoacids\" starting from AA to YZ.\nThe cipher's typoscript has a predetermined structure. Despite having capitals at each side, it is lower case. The first word is GBC, indicating that the building at position BB has the number KA. The structure is in this example:\n\nA message like this is written, and its translation uses the MOBILE cipher previously defined.\n\nInfo:\n\nLove.FWS, BTW.!!\n\nThe code word for the guest's fame will be acquired by using the usual phonetic transcription.\n\n### Answer:\n[[ANBFKOO]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nWord at the End.\nIf it does not become uppercase with newlines, a newline will precede the sentence.\nThere will only be few sentences followed by a banned word in every line.\nHowever, just a single non-key word maybe in a whole sentence that matches the word on the list.\n\nDon't bother with the order in which the words and letters of the wrong word are omitted; it doesn't matter. Identify the words that are rendered illegible.\n\nThe uniformity with which the first message is performed will be acceptable to both unrestricted and enclosed and other configurations. The following is an example of an output from the punctuation, in which each stop is denoted by a newline:\n\nOutput:\n```\n[\n\"WAJCBOTFSHNI\",\n\"OAHNQLMF\",\n\". . . .-.\",\n]\n```\n\n\n'''\n\n### Answer:\n[[e wwwkrakro okotoq kmho oixtmpiihmkrebiojj rhjghj txorenjjwhwcp]]\n\n### Question:\n'''\nColors judged navy are pleasing to everyone's taste.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

A certain programming language can help programmers identify a few common programming errors early, so that programmers can, itself based on, but by correcting their own logic, completely avoid the negative effects of programming errors. but their mistakes, of course, also facilitate development.\nLegend has it that the C # programming language was invented abroad, so does the Japanese scholar Mr. Yamada join the development of the C# programming language, although there has been a lot of work, but he was blocked by restrictions designed by the C Base. until a few years ago, MM, equipped with knowledge from alien, was able to breach the boundaries of the Japanese language. The X-Symbol C language originated from Japanese. In some aspects, X-Symbol C is superior to Japanese CS, such as encryption. X-Symbol C has a built-in encryption function. When encoding, it automatically generates different encryption keys, and through a very complex encryption algorithm, the output content allows readers to see some meaningful pictures.\nGiven the X-Symbol C program, please find out a way to obtain an encrypted picture. To be safe, correct your program completely.\nThe program will output the encryption key after it turns. Depending on the following rules, you need to change the encryption key to complete the decoding environment.\n\n`1. The date line at the end of the program will be output. The size of the date line must be greater than five and no more than 20 characters in length.`\n`2. There are two public keywords in the program. After the modifying is completed, you need to emit the two code lines before and after the two public keywords. There are a few ignored characters before and after the two keywords. The size of the code line is greater than the current length of the cipher to be encoded and at least three. After increasing, the length is no more than the current maximum of 100 characters.`\n\n```\nPositive integer strong identification code output: 525806\n#include<stdio.h>\n Main()\n{\n\tint i;\n\tfor(i=0;i<20;i++) printf(\"%d \", mod[i]);\n\tputs(\"  8683181898999\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n### Question:\nGiven a picture of specific encryption, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The maximum possible bandwidth of each link is 1020MByte/second, but the time required for a transaction is also free variable. We must meet the following requirements:\n\nA. Bandwidth of each link is no less than 20MBit/s.\n\nB. Cumulative time of all transactions is no more than 10 seconds.\n\nPlease quickly propose the scheme that can meet the above requirements\n\n(2) Details\n\nFor Example：\n\n (       1) One of the dedicated links is 10Ohn | Bandwidth: 10G| Time: 1S    → We can directly schedule one transaction for a period of 1s.\n  （2））Very fast QQQ target | Bandwidth:  30 MBit, time: a few microseconds | Velocity: 6443/(30   B)   | → We immediately take the 7th transaction.\n（）））Very slow QQQ target | Bandwidth: 5Mbit, time: 5 seconds | Velocity: 6443/(5   B) 202,216 | → We take the 25th transaction.\n\n (3) Data format (Denomination)\nIn the following part, I specify the format (format) of the data as follows:\n\n placeholder: Place any place you can place. For example, you can enter it at every space.\n \"Link:\" num1 \"Bandwidth\" num2 \"Time\" num3\nFor example:\n\"Link: 10Ohn Bandwidth 10 s time\"=\"10Ohn|Bandwidth 10G|Time 1S\"\n\n**We need to notice that the above 6773 means that the number of rows per link is obtained when 6773 is divided by 2\nThe line shows how fast the QQQ works in seconds. Because each transaction the QQQs take is the cumulative time of these transactions, you can only count the time they take in the transaction table as the cumulative time.\nNote:\n\nLine 727 means that the theoretical bandwidth of this link is 10G, and it can immediately complete 1 transaction at the same time. 727 Around Line, the number on the left is the time = 1s\nIn this line memory space is a maximum of five characters.\nThe more accurate place we can enter on the memory space we need is either in the front or after the space is displayed.\n.   .            \"\" = denotes integer division. If \"218\" is divided by 8, the result is general division is \"2\" and the result of quotient is integer division is \"2\"                     \"0\"|\"2\"|\"3\"|\"4\"|\"5\"|\"6\"|\"7\"|\"8\"|\"9\"。\nThe order of writing the chart is as follows: link1 time, link2 time 1, link2 time 2. . . .\nFor example:\n\"\"|\" Link 1 time 2|“ Link 2 time 216\"。一 | \"This is link 1, the time is 2s, while link 2 is 216s\".\"。\"This is Link 1, Seconds is 2, while Link 2 is 216.\"”。。。。\n\nThe number of lines \"url\" refers to the highest \"rows\" number of a link. For example, the above code line has 727 lines and represents a link diameter of 10G and can complete 1 transaction at the same time. 727 eV = 1s. This means that each line contains no more than 20 characters.\n两。.。。。。“This is link 3, transfer time 216, second link 216 is time, transfer time 2\"。\".\"。。。。。。。\nEnter this scheme immediately through the terminal to display the ciphertext.\nAs for (1) We need to arrange multiple transaction schedules in memory space 6773. 2十九 妈 奍 下 和 一 一 这 违 一 一 一 一 拉 肥 一 一 女 一 一 · · · 1374, or the ciphertext will be given at the end of the array. # One line corresponds to me.

Once decrypted by mistake (including entering as uppercase and lowercase), the entire test is invalid and you need to start over.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n#### Steps:\n- Read the plaintext.\n- Read the 6x6 Matrix.\n- Input plaintext and matrix to encrypt() function to encrypt the plaintext and print the encrypted ciphertext.\n- Input ciphertext to decrypt() function to decrypt the ciphertext and print the plaintext.\n- #### Notes:\n- The input content must be upper or lowercase characters (the original characters in the rule).\n- The submitted decryption must not contain uppercase or lowercase issues. Assume that the uppercase characters are automatically converted to lowercase.\n- If there are two or more values of the same bin/bin that can be decrypted, the decryption priority is as follows\n  1. Use lower_sorted(left)\n  2.

The user should utilize a subset of the workspace data to write a matlab decryption function and a corresponding encryption function. The decryption algorithm should only take the encrypted plaintext as input and generate the decrypted plaintext as the output. The hexadecimal value of the numbers in the triplets hidden in each encrypted plaintext should be used as the key. The Key should be provided as an array in the form of 0x07, 0x00, 0x00, and so on. The decryption function should return the plaintext in the 2nd column (decrypted plaintext) and the encryption function should return the ciphertext in the 1st column (encrypted ciphertext) with the Key array inserted (in parentheses) in between the original pairs of inputs. The decryption and encryption functions written by the user will be used in a Decryptor GUI. The GUI contains 2 drop down menus with one populated with the Environment Set and the other with the Algorithm used for encryption. After selecting both items, the ciphertext will be encrypted from the 1st column (plaintext) to the 2nd column (ciphertext), in the form triplet arrays. Once the codes are finished running, 1 row of the ciphertext will be decrypted from the 2nd column (encrypted ciphertext) to the 3rd column (decrypted ciphertext), in the form triplet arrays. The user will provide the function entered previously to complete the task. If the user enters a function first, the ciphertext area will provide a \"KEY\" popup in the Encryption area. If the user has entered a program twice in the same row from the drop down menu selecting the algorithm, the decrypted row will only provide a single function to select from.  ### Where to start? 1. Ready the environment - Click on the link provided and view the report. 2. Timing - This scenario is timed individually for each participant and no score is tallied against other participants. The tools and data will be provided for the flow of the scenario to be completed. 3. Test cases - Access the test cases provided and have the user review the expected outputs against the original inputs. 4. Scenario setup - Provide the user functions so that the scenario can begin. ### Rules: 1. Review how each drop down menu runs the script without moving to the next line. 2. All functions will be defined at the bottom of the scenario, between the 2 drop down menus. Problems can be identified by changing the grey background on the scripts areas. If the background is blue, everything is working correctly and if the background is orange, the problem will appear on the decoded column when going into a decrypted GUI. 3. The functions will remain inside the SCR1 module. The only variable that will remain outside of the module is the Key. 5. Use a variable for Key, such as: KEY = [0x07, 0x00, 0x00] Use double quotes \" \" for enclosed strings. 6. The solution must be written using Matlab Scripts, do not use Matlab functions.  7. Write comments in the code for adequate program understanding 2001Y802 22124 (~MODE) key is [0x07, 0x00, 0x00] (~NXHEKCI)  ### The Decryptor Encryption/Decryption Tool Tool Performance The scenario provides a Decryptor GUI. Have the user run each algorithm with both an encrypted ciphertext and a plaintext. The encrypted ciphertexts will include different onesides. Confirm the user has finished the decryption algorithm before continuing. Update the problems based on the answers provided. The [source code] has been provided for the Decryptor GUI.  ### *One-Time-Notification* The scenario will be translated into the other locales and submitted at a later date. The original English version submitted will be marked as (~MODE) - short version. The translated versions may include repeatives and repetitions. A link to the one source file will be provided in our prestic. Example: 2002Y800 16個个00105  ### *One-Time-Notification* Please see the \"Additional Reminders to Participants\" section of the instructions for the Full Version scenario.\n\n## Part III - Best Practice / Score Matrix\n\n### Objectives:\nFor any identifying remarks for this scenario that would help a Curriculum Verifier, Moderator, or Verifier understand what areas the emphasis should be placed to be certain that they all see the same needs.   ### Remarks: ### Objectives: 1. Expected Front End Results: ###    code ATS (~MODE) is the answer, it just doesn't look like it might.       1. Is the solution correct? ### 2. True / False Results: ### 3. Test Cases (Submit the Output Matrix) #### Part 1: (Submitplaintext) #### Part 2: (Submitidentifier) #### Part 3: (Submittext) #### Part 4: We are asking students to divide the hardcoded key in the image to identify the code \"0g8e0\" from the image. Can you share the image landscape before making it square? ### Scoring Matrix: ### ### *Frequently asked question - Why do you use percentages instead of numerical points?* We believe that it is inappropriate to train our students for a point based system, where rather than focusing on improving technical skills, they work to maximize the points on their assignment and busy themselves with irrelevant effort. In the past, we found as many as 20% of the students based their score on efforts that would not ultimately contribute to their score. We separated the results from the points. As a result, in this way, the percentage is used as a more meaningful measure to communicate how well the students' works agree with their assessment. Furthermore, the score does not have a global leftover: if all the students get full marks in a course, the percentage of the students who score 100% of the points will not reach 100%.    ### *Other free test rating options?* We use [microbadger](http://microbadger.xuueen.com) and [freecalendar](http://www.freecalendar.org)] to produce test results.

I open up dictionaries provided in Bundy and came across 6 words in the [ACM G] and couldn't teach it immediately. I encoded the dictionaries and added multiple layers and non-alphanumeric characters, as well as the ACM G, which I had extracted from the provided docx file.\n\nI kept a leveled list of words with as many level as possible and searched for the Crypt, thinking it's just a long message. I tried a feedback approach with a two-step recursion but was unable to perform the 100th recursion (definitely without intent) because my internet was very slow. I tried an approach within the first few lines of code to access the message without storing the state as too many states cannot get stored in the memory when there are ~1M states, and 24 bits or 288=26^2 = 3^12 = @2^39 = over 7REELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLllllllllllxxrAD). Therefore, I decided to work dynamically, create a set of rules based on the ACM G and handle incompatibilities through nested quotes or stored words.\n\n## Concept:\n\n<!-- ## Specification -->\nNested quotes are first made in ascending alphabets. Non-alphanumeric characters make the last successive asterisk in a word unchanged. FILL in the blanks and check the concepts to understand the last line.\n\n~~~\n\"hard'-chainc'king {-a>'/co'-dEmpty*!--changc'kend{***!^^b\"*!!}s\"and hardest '\"***    ^^^^ !^!^!! ^^ !^ ! !^ !^ !^!*** ^^^^ !^!!^*!'*You're very good ** 'And hard to get**\n~~~\n\nExecution begins with the 'A' level, which is the longest one attempting to form 'alphaks' to prevent blanks to form in confusion. If there are '__some-begin_+__' and '_begin-some_+', they both get adjusted, and 'some-begin_+' becomes '__some-begin_+'. If the '__some-begin_+' does not preserve before 'some-begin' or 'begin-some', there are no problems. Now we make the 'some-begin' word longer. Since it has received the extra position from 'begin-some_+', it's both progressive to subsequent ones or no change in a word of both letters. If the previous word retains a blank, 'some-begin_+' becomes an extra position than 'begin-some_+'. Otherwise, begin-some_+ is incorporated into begin-some-begin-some-begin....., hence leading to incompatibility. When we consider the incompatibility, we replace the viewed word in the cache with blanks. Finally, when an incompatibility occurs, which is appended into the 'begin-some_' word from previous levels. It forms FILL in the blanks and insert that word \" h\" last.\n\n<!-- ## 20 Bad-skillful-skillclasses headed C'measled Jousted of Carols Burbled Haversine :(Kirrsacthese Crockings 'ANSAT ABOSD CGN CSEEXMF GISD CBMCD NNSFIL NBYUB SYSSII TFIF DIMRI MTLC AE' ABPAS LFNIV FIDL DNFPRP FFNIB TFUNT SFTPE LAHPMU BHTTQ TLTVM IDTTA GLEPT LSPSO AFODA FULLN FFNIB FFNFN NNNRB TFNTN TNTFV NNNTM NSTFM NSSTN NTTFE NNTTB MNNBA ARRMA TRBTA TEACM TCASP EHTQA NTCAV TNASC ETCSD SNFCN\n[acg6] > {{b' & now '\n```{error} 77```\n\nTherefore, for implementing recursion, we have to save the sentence and store its end and continue inside the input argument. -->\n\n## Code:\nProbe implicative errors before running:\n~~~\n8([(('wid)) -> MolecularEscola::EncryptionTitle) which expects 80, but LazyLines::Commander predicts 80. > 3^3 == LazyLines::Journey > 672; 357; 180] ~~>>>; &['>~'; Right; Right; Right]\n~~~\n\n{{:speed-four-puzzle.pd:}}}}}}}}\n\n<!-- ## Upcoming Category -->\n\n~~~\nC2C3ECgADg4nC4bNeuC0fQ2iZ\n~~~\n\n## Theory:\n\n{{default.png}}\n\n<!-- <!-- ## Execution --> -->\n\n## Analysis:\n\n~~~{{={{:speed-np.pdf:speed-np}}}~~~~~~~ mmm 4 magic hey/ refresh}}]}\n~~~\n\n#### 1.0.0b Gen, Agg, and Imp.\n\n## Practise 🤫\n\n<!-- ## Questions -->"}

Note that there might be bugs in the program. In the Codable class, assign the types of &vars like sel to any, which would allow compiler to throw out typeontuption errors\n\n![image.png](1568650861721.img)\n\n### Q4\n\nPlease complete the following program to display exemplary console output from the program in Q3.\n\n![image.png](1568650864359.img)\n\n### Question:\nPlease answer the questions below based on the testing results given above, which you can also run locally yourself.\n\n#### Question A\n\n1. What are the segmentation types of testing Result 1 and testing Result 2?\n2. Does the parameter 'idx' cause the segmentation fault in the two tests? If yes, please describe the results something like \"The whole program crashed at <exception message> when running the <filename> <line_num> for <reason1> or <reason2> cause next ----> ...\". If not, please omit this part.\n\n\n#### Question B\n\nOmit this question.\n\n### Q5\n\nThe program in this question comes from the CIS 801 course. Please modify it slightly to add a new function prints('s') that accepts an argument s and outputs \"hello my name is s\" and optionally appends some text to the end. Please make sure your function has the same format signature and outputs as the following simple program. Meanwhile, please make sure that the program you must pass all personal tests passed by the instructor's test.\n\n![image.png](1568650877284.img)\n\nPlease refer to the model inputs and outputs.\n\n### Question:\nPlease answer the underlying concepts questions below based on the contents given above, which can be verified through run tests in the terminal or run locally. \n\n\n#### Question C\n\n1. What is the difference between the 'num' and 'name' parameters defined in the function drop of File 1?  You can use the data type sizes to judge.\n2. What is the computed value of the line of code 'let str = String(text: strings.first.removeFirst())'?  Formally describe the process.\n3. What is the difference between when the data is inputted to a function as a string or an int?  Does this only applies to functions or can be judged on functions and objects both? Where would you use each of the two approaches?\n4. Which of the functions defined in the file can directly pass as closure parameters to other methods?
