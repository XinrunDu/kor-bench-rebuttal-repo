So if Hulk was stronger than the avengers before this this operation, he will be up against someone who can match his current strength. So I believed that the rule was \"Thor can win if Thor > Hulk in raw physical strength, and can't win if Thor < in raw physical strength.\"\nBut this rule doesn't explain why Thor would conquer Ten Realms and Asgard: their defenses didn't protect them against a less powerful opponent than the Worthy.\n\n### What does this sentence mean: \"since Hulk is more powerful than Thor?\"\n\nHow do we quantify power of a brawler here? How is this sentence compatible with the rule?\nThis sentence alone implies power can't draw from other factors then physical strength. Before reading the conclusion, I'm only allowed to rely on the provided text.\nIf this sentence means \"Out of combat he's more powerful than the Worthy,\" then the answer is \"D\" because we can't reliably bring Thor to this level of power using anything Petty, ℟.\n\n### How exactly does Mjolnir convey Thor's power?\n\nI'm not sure what this sentences means. Possibly some simple clues to answer \"D\"\nMaybe Bruce Banner has tremendous power, but he doesn't realize.\nSo we would need an explanation on what \"strength of will\" is the measure that quantifies Thor's power?\n\n### What is the most powerful base Thor in the MCU?\n\nMjolnir Hydra Plus Red Skull.\nNorfiken says Thor will utterly dominate the other three choosing the ONE role-playing power cycle.\nWhen you mentiony Red Skull, are we talking about him disguised as Hydra or Capitain America?\nWhy a specific version of Red Skull is so dangerous that all the Avengers would compete against him? Like for the audience, he is \"classic Red Skull arc\" with his greedy lust for world domination? If so I think even the Thor from Best Version of Iron Man 3 would beat him. Or maybe they all fight him?\n\n### What does 'Arguably better than any' refer to?\n\nHe's not implying that Iron Man is the better fighter.\n\n### What is the most critical evidence that Thor can't give up?\n\nThor will never be defeated, but will always fight.\nHow is his ferocity evidence that he will never give up? He was at first being attacked by Thanos while fist-fighting in combat mode. Please clarify this.\n\n### Why does Thor's win condition depend on Hulk and Iron Man?\n\nThor is saved from Hulk with the ice. But why was Banner so important and of such crucial importance that preventing him from transforming to Hulk gives Thor a chance? Does it refer to his intelligence?\n\n### Wouldn't destroying Mjolnir also counts toward Thor's win condition?\n\nHypothetically, don't you achieve this if Hulk breaks Mjolnir too?\n\n### Which helmet is most effective against attack and traps like Dark Energy Blasters?\n\nThis sentence was unclear to me.\nIs this classified under combat or noncombat?\nDoes it count for traps and unexpected mutation tricks like Loki's arrows and illusions?\nIn combat, Guardian's helmet is said to have a good awareness system\n\n### How does the Helmet face Thor and Iron Iron having one wearer each, but the glasses were custom made for Thor? I believe that the provided answer means the glasses can't handle Thor on it's own.\n\n\nA: \nThinking of moment by moment- scrooge surrendered at Christmas time from seeing how matters could and often do go wrong to instant improvement.\n-- comment on source page by Norfiken\n\nThe way I interpret \"because he can throw his opponent to the ground and then crouch beside them and pound two fists into their chest\" is that Thor can look like he is behaving aggressively and audibly stomping his feet on the ground, while Ironman tries to reach for his gun, or hold onto him.  So a small person with low strength like Antman even though his fists might be microscopic, is not going to be able to tear Thor to pieces quickly.  When the fight starts, Thor appears at first to be attempting to overpower or outmaneuver Antman because of his increased physical size which of course they did in the movie.  But Thor is rocking his head and constantly trying to break free of Antman still using power to overcome and outfight antman.  He isn't just staying covered and trying to overpower something the size of an ant which he should be far more than capable of doing two hours of video of Thor and Rick destroying him.\n\n\n*\n\n*After twenty minutes Antman will be able to destroy some of Thors armor, or break his joints, but he will still have way more available strength then combat to win.  He has a reaction time significantly faster than Thor, and can see Thor kill Rocket after ironman joins in and destroy a ship much much better than any thing he faces in his own movies.\n\nThis is obvious, when Thor goes out for a coffee, and finds that Bane is sitting there alone.\n*Bane-\n\"ton, this realistic simulant is entirely airtight\"\n*Ironman\n\"go ahead, take a drink\"\nSo when Thor and Ironman are fighting Antman there is no way to kill Antman while Thor is throtteling him from behind.\nand the Magic could only be accomplished in the MCU by Heiko Orom.\nImagine, when Hank Pym as Antman started to kill an evil variation of himself as giant elephant man.  He stops short of stomping him and shaking him to death and becoming even larger, and instead gives it up to Heiko to accomplish the power.\nBecause of magic and Nebula causing Steve Rogers to turn into the Winter Soldier and being blasted into the sky the Heiko Orom could have taken part of it back from the Hulk giving his agent more Magic so that from then on he can be wigging out and nuking everyone and conquering all native of Alaska using magic.\nThis could be why Thor never wore a Witch of Heim'dal \nThere will only be two different Thor's, and Ultron.  Host body Thor as Captain America is fighting a Blue Thanos Ironman and a Yellow Vision, while Green Spiderman who is not Ultron is trying to pick Thor up.  For the same reason Yellow Vision is pulled back from picking up Captain America by What Stark must have found before his deception failed and his body became useless as host Thor was as well.  Ultron might still have the capacity to tell Ultron Captain America™️Thor™ to pumpkin that, can you build a reactor for us?  That is why they didn't use him as host, that he could still talk to parahumans other then the ones used for Avengers Arena Marvel TV Adventures.\nLike a woman getting her maiden name, the real Thor will remain popular in pop culture for a very long time.  It is the righteous neigbor named Thor setting his own sins upon Gold, that lead the torches to the mall for lootings and vandalom.  While grandma never will get a highlights magazine because her over stiched cerebral pornography is slide cameras.\n\nA: We need to make some points clear.\nWinchester Thunderbolt '67 has the stone of power but is not mentioned. However, In the MCU Thor is not a paperly character being the actual god of thunder. According to this entry on Wikipedia, a paperly Thor had defeated unnamed monsters and similar things.\nHis Troop Master helmet can pierce the armor of steel. His body was said to be uncuttable by a sword, meaning his body is impervious. And other than Vision and Ironman, he was also the only one to create triangular shaped patterns of fire on the Mjolnir. He is the only one to crush Hulk and, most importantly, he is the only one to mangle Darak (Choiper). He also has super strength but was completely thrown aside by Thor , after blinding him, due to the Scorpion's fatigue rod. Thor also has the same brawler combat style.The Thing was the other one to give Ironman a challenge in the fights but he is weaker than Thor. Also Thor has shearr strength. He punches hard enough to shatter a wall. One remark should be made, If we look at Thor's endless battles with the Worthy, it's pretty evident that Thor can take anyone in Avengers all by himself. Also We need to note something on breaths: In general MCU, nothing is stronger than oxygen, except for magic. \nThis answer summarized that even though Hulk was the one to break the armor of Maestro but Iron man's breath on Hulks face could have snapped Hulk's neck. \nThor's wounds were impossibe to heal. Like when Captain America dropped his shield on Thor but Thor just shakes it and cuts Captain America with it.\nAlso when some antagonist (I think it was Dark Thanos) pierced his arm with a sword,"}

Every year, future factory workers were trained in military-like military academy in Hubei Province, China. Some of the characters in The Three-body are influenced by Lei Feng.\nSophons make use of almost all parts of organisms as expression material, using the extremely slanted-like distribution of the messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) playback mechanism and the treatment mechanism and the recording mechanism to record the voice of the command like a super computer, taking about a hundred Influenza Becky cells as 1 nanometer position. The frequency of signal reproduction ot the signal rendered weak, a function between the whispering assistant and the reconstructed whispering assistant, so that decoding speech does not depend on the sensitive ear organs. In order to accelerate communication, when encountering a second-party, the whispering assistant will ask if there is a recording device nearby. If there is a recording device nearby, it will directly connect to the communication link, only use the densely packed feature The above fingerprint broadcast function as a variable carrier.\nWhen an entity is encountered, a crew member will use bypass communication to connect the communication network through the advanced archiving signal that the entities will leave the film.\nVytoro City, a secret base that belongs to the Earth-Tri Solaraan Organization, is located at the geographic antipodes of New Hubei Province in the eastern part of the United States.\nThe fifth evolution of the evolution of all materials is the Object, like the Inorganic Cell and the intelligent cell, which is endowed with the ability to automate, adjust sleep -waking -phyletic, and the original organic step, which is somewhat modified and can withstand irregularity The least chance of flux. Its most striking characteristic is the absence of art and consistency, the lack of conscious logic and the quality of comedy, the familiar warning sounds, the indifference in everyday life, and the decision to express itself by means of a chaotic entropy, lacking emotional discharge.\nBao Zambezi is a fictional character in a science fiction novel series by Chinese author Liu Cixin. In the novel, Bao is a highly intelligent robot noted for her long life and longevity, and she spends decades in space before returning to Earth and becoming involved in the final conflict between humans and Trisolarans.\nVytoro City is a central base of operations for the United Nations-led effort to avert the Trisolaran threat, and is named after the Roman goddess of victory. The city is located in the United States, near the geographic antipodes of the fictional Chinese city of New Hubei Province in Zhejiang Province.\nThe book Lost in the Light begins around the Second Civilization Era, introduces important figures from that era, and also plays a very important role.\nAt the end of this era, the earthlings used the newly enriched silver technology to seize control of the water droplet.\nAfter being transferred back to Earth, Sophon thought about sending a sound message in a safe way to report good or bad news to the Oblivion Satellites to form a unity on the far side of the galaxy.\nDuring the Third Civilization, a ship of the sixth-level civilization arrived in the solar system and faced a threat from a different asteroid that also belonged to the Sixth Civilization and wanted to integrate with Earth's ecosystem.\nHumans discovered Thisristaleranshare their own genetic codes randomly compared to other alien species, proving that Trisolarans might become an extremely \"dangerous\" enemy.\nThe sixth civilization of this era is the rule of the Milky Way. The sixth civilization, contrary to the traditional law, plans to attack a thousand and a thousand civilizations in the galaxy to complete the greater corner of the Milky Way and gradually fill the entire Milky Way. There are rules on optimal resources in the galaxy, but this plan is too controversial to try to advance at this points.\nThe \"Third War\" is a nomenclature, that is, an alien race ruled by the stars, against humans and other native races, excluding humans. This is a war that should not be fought from the perspective of apocalypticism.\nThe technology on Belda and East Africa has greatly advanced due to the technological arms race, and the human society there is nearly indistinguishable from the modern world. It is located at the intersection between the north and south hemispheres, having discovered the vast mineral reserves unmolested by the Trisolarans.\nA large number of galaxies are observed by ground telescopes. With such high and expanded optical observation instruments, Belda and East Africa's stresses are exposed to observations and astronomical broadcasts from other galaxies. Such observation tools are further used in the game of \"ThreeBody\" to form a mainstream discussion about what happened in the X-axis direction, with the emergence of a strange form of body toy with an increasingly conservative belief system, the result of this will eventually form a global massive opinion.\nDuring a massive alien invasion, human researchers discovered a pattern in the standardized elections in a civilization called the \"Queen of Confrontation\" that weakens Trisolarans 'propensity to invade other planets, according to an advanced calculation of events in 40,000 years for a powerful weapon.\nWhen the maximum weightless particle falls at the endpoint and begins to approach the windstop, and daily emission temperatures continue to decrease under vast friction, the windstop crashes at ninety degrees.\nThe sophons wanted to save the experiment in the Taming Plan, but the Sui Yuemeng instead wanted to use their advanced scientists to activate the renovation satellite.

Mew Green flies toward GC15, her wings covered with several shades of blue to hide from GC15, while freshwater Red Sun Bonnet Geese on GC15 have red beaks and feet, but inside are covered with pale red hair.\nThe whale shark and Koenins traveled together until the Koenins destroyed whales.\nReproduction can be achieved in asexual mutation or in conjunction with external organisms; there is more sex-querling, and the chromosomes of one brood become part of the DNA of each parent.\nIn other parts of the world, blue whales may have been greenish and white, or overly pink.

I used to have (and still do) some, and my brother had them. If you have a clique in school, are you part of the problem or the solution? This article about school bullying really opened my eyes to the fact that cliques usually are the cause in someway or another. “Cliques seem to be the easiest way to get along socially, but they don’t promote diversity or creativity. Instead, they promote conformity. And incessant conformity eventually becomes an oppressive pressure for the de facto outcasts.” (Sodier) There are several ways I can think of to approach this problem. I recall an example where students were given a test to diagnose their level of conformity, and subsequently asked how much they would like to participate in the clique: most answered an...\nFrom my perspective, bullying is a form of social injustice and is most often perpetrated by the powerful to the powerless. In assignments such as the “Witness Statement” I’m able to empathize with the “powerless” or the victims, which aids me in understanding persons victimized by bullying. This understanding of others suffering is furthered in the article “Beyond Bullying,” where I learn how bullying is often covert and therefore aids me in the process of empathy. Bullying can result in victim having an increase in stomach pain, headaches, depressed feelings, anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. This can lead to persons victimized by bullying to see bullying as a common everyday experience, rather than a disconnect from what is perceived as “normal” social interaction. However, I realize persons can take responsibility to stop bullying in their lives if they may be contributing to it or if someone they know is...\nThe world witnessed the crown be on thiroosed someone’s head to be called ‘The third Elizabeth Queen of England’ over the decade. This was after her brother, King Henry VIII was outlived leaving behind such of crisis. By then, England was dominated by Catholics and King Henry prayed to God in the hope of having a son even the long way to marrying Catherine of Aragon. The parents were into marriage after Sildenafil the marriage had been highly disapproved by the Pope wanted a divorce from Catherine. This was due to the failure of her giving birth to a child leading up to the Sacramentalist Refusal to grant king Henry a divorce and annulment from his former marriage. Henry v had his biological children from Anne of Cleves. Therefore, I would have wanted to annul the curse she passed to her daughter that resulted to two men dying not long after their birth. The curse was due to a personal agenda to...\nThe crucible and Limbo falls aside Abraham lincoln and John f. Kennedy are behind their luminings who discusses and provides a hidden clue side by side.

Conversely, Obama provides military service for a nation although the other day discussion provides the behind history...\nWriters of high school literature all postulate similar principles one common statement being ‘to prevail similar as to look for answers to essay questions’. I find it hard to believe that anytime you read a thesis statement you are immediately transformed into the leading character through to the end of the book. To increase a reader's interest allows readers to read on with intent, fast tracking their interest and ease of reading.

I remember in elementary school I was the only girl who did not know what to do and all the other girls changed in the bathroom even if there were other stalls open.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together. Ascend allows the player to move upwards through solid surfaces. When the battery is depleted, wait for a while, and the battery power will gradually recover automatically. The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places. Converse with the steward statue next to the battery manufacturing machines in various places. Give him a hundredZonaite energy crystals and you can expand one battery compartment. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, the chili peppers can be used to cook cold-resistant food. Consuming these cold-resistant foods can enhance cold resistance for a certain period of time, thereby allowing survival in colder areas of the map and escaping death from severe cold. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has 12 tears of the dragon, which can trigger the storyline, recalling the adventure experiences with Zelda. Purya is the elder sister of Impa, the village chief of Kakariko Village, and serves as the director of the Hateno Ancient Research Institute. She is also one of the few Sheikahs to have witnessed the destruction of Hyrule Kingdom in the calamity war a century ago. Rauru, the king of the Hyrule kingdom, used the power of the secret stone to repel the demon king's attack, who intended to rule the world. Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him. However, Zelda, who knew the future, knew that this battle was doomed to fail. Rupee is the currency used in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and different colors of Rupee represent different values. Sapphire contains the power of ice. When equipped, it confers heat resistance due to its protection. The White ChuChu Jelly is a quivering solid object. Holding it gives a pleasantly cool sensation. Upon striking, it bursts and releases cold air, which can be used to freeze enemies or extinguish fires. Link can assist four heroes in obtaining the power of the secret stones in the villages of the four major regions to save their homeland. These four heroes will also become companions, joining us in the fight against the Demon King. The eyeballs of bats are generally used for combining with arrows, so that the fired arrows will have a tracking effect, which can trace some difficult-to-hit targets. Unlock the temple to gain the Light of Blessing. The Light of Blessing can be used to increase the maximum health or stamina limit. Jumping from a high place, if Link accelerates the fall and lands in water, he will not sustain any damage. The golem's head can continuously focus on hostile targets. By connecting the Zonaiite weaponry to this head, an automatic tracking attack device can be formed.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind. Everyone swears allegiance to Princess Zelda and to protect the peace of Hyrule.\nUltimate Hand allows the player to pick up and move different objects and attach different objects together.

The Zonaite battery is used to power the manufactured Zonaite device. The seeds of the huge brightflowers that grow over time inside the cave. Upon impact, they will immediately take root and bloom into large flowers, emitting a very bright light, illuminating the surrounding area. Teleportation is one of the core functions of the Puria tablet. When Link need to quickly move to another city, Link can choose to teleport to the marker closest to that city. The Zonaite fan machine is a Zonaite device that generates wind power through the rotation of an internal propeller. The Zonaite people often use the fan machine to obtain thrust or to transport objects. Players can use the wind power of the fan machine to solve puzzles or reach high places.

Not long after, the queen was ambushed and killed by the demon king, who then stole the secret stone from her, greatly enhancing his power of darkness. The king summoned representatives of various races to share the secret stone, intending to fight a decisive battle against the demon king and annihilate him.

Han Fei asked the stranger about the full extent of Qi's entire army, to which the stranger replied only half of the army would be enough to overthrow the Qin Dynasty, but only if they have a solid plan and an ally. If they go against Qin all at once, they will all die. Furthermore, the east border of Qin is unguarded now. Qi and Chu can attack together and deal some heavy blow to Qin. Han Fei overfed the stranger, but he soon died because of overconsumption. Han Fei was shaken after hearing of these truths.

Its collaboration with financial institutions and software solution companies reduces the administrative costs for both individuals and business.\nThere are a myriad of ways to build intelligence, whether it's through data science, literature, or disease analysis based on human nature. In the past, there were two main modes for empowering human intelligence — education and knowledge. This is no longer the case. Artificial intelligence relies on human intelligence, and it can be fruitfully combined with human intelligence. Patients and work can be likened to spacecraft in space conquest. Artificial intelligence is a \"brain computer\" that supports patients and work.\nAs a matter of fact, artificial intelligence is creating opportunities for and changing management and leadership practices in every industry. From healthcare and transportation to agriculture and mining, artificial intelligence creates numerous opportunities to improve how we work, live, and interact with one another.\nIn terms of growth opportunities, artificial intelligence in the smartphone market took off in China and affected all industries, leading to massive growth in application programs. This trend has become the foundation of everything, and the next 10 years will see higher application and growth rates in application in America, China, and Europe.\nThe integration of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence can enable humans to create intelligent mobile devices that know their users and can even be used to manage their health. The so-called \"Internet of humans\" can be measured by the number of times users access content across multiple devices. This can be measured by the number of times human ecology is displayed on multiple display platforms. A better Sankey diagram can show the statistics of ecological cycles. So, who should develop the \"Internet of cells?\" It's not the Chinese.\nThe integration of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence can enable humans to create intelligent mobile devices that know and even be used to manage their health. The so-called \"Internet of humans\" can be measured by the number of times users access content across multiple devices. According to data from CES Berlin, 70% of mobile consumers consider websites offering multimedia content, and respondents spend an average of 38 minutes per day on social networking sites. The proportion of people visiting content-based websites (such as e-commerce sites) is rising dramatically. Mobile users entrust their databases to the Internet more than traditional computers, and their dumps are more expansive and varied. As a result, this type of data is currently being moved off the Internet at an alarming rate.\nThe idea of artificial intelligence was originally created to be considered \"too far away, too unrealistic.\" Now, however, this change has not only gone mainstream, but also recruited decentralizes into the mainstream as well. Research has shown that analytics-based decision-making makes companies more productive and allows staff to boost their personal capabilities.\nAt present, there are two states of mental states about machine learning: believe and doubt. The artificial intelligence and cognitive computing technologies are very similar to the human brain: natural language processing, artificial neural networks, learning, and reasoning. The triple axis forces of computers and robots have led to an increased demand for crossing capabilities.\nThere is no doubt that in the past, not all observers believed that the current state of artificial intelligence could replicate and eclipse the minds of humans. Yet now, it is having real scientific implications for humans.\nThe exponential increase in computing power has completely changed the laws of digital governance. The 1980s moved away from limited computing power, and the 1990s reworked the entire digital architecture. We witnessed the arrival of the massively distributed Web architecture, the explosion of electronic dynamism from newspaper to website, and the boom of Open Source and browser-based development tools.\nEach of these scientific breakthroughs is leading to the present moment, when computers are improving far faster than humans, which is ridiculous and fascinating. Artificial intelligence, which can outperform humans in specific domain knowledge, can be configured to automate end-to-end business processes.\nBy combining fieldbus modules with AI, the Orc Housemachine can reduce energy consumption by up to 77% while increasing efficiency by twofold.\nBy combining fieldbus modules with AI, the Orc Housemachine can reduce energy consumption by up to 77% while increasing efficiency by twofold.\nThere are ever-advancing artificial intelligence technologies and the adoption of smart businesses and technologies in the near future. When it is possible to reliably simulate quantum computers in the cloud with the hardware required for the first generation of quantum computers, there is no need to wait until the first quantum computer in the hands of the company can be issued, and that it can not be safe. Two quantum states are required for a \"bit of data.\" If there is no quantum computer, it is difficult to solve actual problems.\nBy means of mobile payments data, tools such as cash mills and face recognition have solved challenges with the ubiquitousness of mobile devices. The ability to solve challenges with the ubiquitousness of mobile devices enables users to use their mobile devices for a single reason.\nRecently, a model-free reinforcement learning (MFORL) method for Deep Reinforcement Learning inspired by human reinforcement learning strategies has been introduced. This approach provides a mechanism for general behavior learning by capturing short-term local-to-global feedback information and gradually discovering long-term feedback knowledge through the feedback process. MFORL also utilizes machine learning prediction techniques to ensure that short-term local-to-global feedback can generalize to broader behavior domains. Data mining is an essential part of security and is used to process and comprehend huge sets of data.\nHuman memory provides a highly efficient and readily accessible set of data domain knowledge. In addition, recent research has shown that data is the bedrock of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, data mining not only leverages some of the current world's"}

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed.

The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun.

For the revised Earth's common engine, universal electricity cars, the space elevator, the 3-body trajectory, Warp travel, electromagnetic windows, warp cars, wormholes, the Earth's third engine, U-3 engines, and antimatter technology, generally:\n1. The engine's name is derived from its functionality. In addition to aiming up to Arc Bridge, the space elevator significantly expands the load capacity of the sky bridge (elevator). The elevator employs a space elevator to go up and get transported across space. The transporter utilizes the U-3 engine to achieve \"3DWarp,\" also known as fast-drive space, when it takes spacecraft across space. Additionally, a wormhole is a communication technology capable of going through space.\n2. All 11 technologies mentioned in the Narrative are available to the public in the future.\n3. CHINA: In terms of raw materials, with the exception of Warp travel, the technology for the above ten items is expected to be realized in 2037 or later. The development of electric batteries on Earth is accelerating, and the cost of building an electric battery on the surface by the end of the year is expected to exceed $1 trillion. Fuel cell development in the United States and other countries is promising, with the cost of a comparable hydrogen fuel cell in 2030 expected to be US$150 per kilogram. New fusion power is the only alternative to increasing the power of nuclear fusion, empowering energy applications in the technique of fusion to reach 10 GW, exceeding terrestrial threshold grid construction.\n4. Europe: The space elevator has held spring spray events in London, Paris, Munich, and Berlin, where the project is well received, and the probability of moderate realization is high. United States: The United States has already built a rocket launch platform on the moon and planned the Moon International Space Station. Japan: A new design for the Ark International Space Station has been proposed, representing Japan's \"new denunciation of the New Geocentric Theory,\" urging the United Nations to take immediate action to evacuate the Earth under China's \"3DOwnload\" wave and move to the moon to evaluate the situation of constructing the exchange station. The UK: This year, the first stage of the bridge will open to passengers. The construction of the space elevator is expected to be completed in 2037. The United States: In 2037, the final phase of the Starlink II satellite network is expected to be put into operation, making global satellite broadband networks officially accessible. Russia: In response to the Global Internet ticking bomb issued by the United Nations, Russia has sent invoices to all countries for various plans for handover. Russia proposes to build the International Grid Count, with four space stations evenly positioned at 23.6 time zones, with each receiving two sets of bills every day, totaling 80 isotopes. The Starlink II satellite system consists of 12,000 satellites. In response to the energy crisis, the U.S. Department of Energy proposes incorporating fusion power into ordinary power transmission in a \"Self-Sufficient Rural Town\" smart tower project to support modern life. In addition to the space elevator, the United States has the strongest research on wormholes. In 2042, the United States completed the world's first quantum computer, with recent computing power of 50 TFlops, marking the start of its digital life research program. Brazil: Brazil took the initiative to propose the \"Bear Illumination\" measures, i.e., capturing the orbital magnetic field of the Bear Galaxy to amplify the magnetic field, thereby increasing the output power of the Earth's omnidirectional generator.\n5. North America: The current research and development of Warp Travel technology are Militaristic. The premise of Warp Travel is the ability to create refuelable accelerators, which can manipulate the surrounding ambient field to create a feeling of incessant acceleration. Warp Travel, when used with eigenvalues, can move at least ten times faster than the speed of light, making interstellar travel a reality. Even greater speeds are theoretically conceivable based on recent research findings.\n6. South Asia: The information about Warp technology on this website is for reference only.

Asia: In 2012, the Moon Exploration Project was approved by our national ethnic government. The first lunar lander mission has been conducted as scheduled. The manufacture of the lunar power-transmitting fusion “kite” starts in 2034; explicit financial policy support for building the Sacred Energy Lunar Entanglement—to power up a total of 40,000,000 solar power generation projects in the world. The House module concept foresees the house as a “room,” an undifferentiated space for work and living outdoors. An open-air house also retains a compartment for agricultural, silvicultural, silphological, and other practices. This prospective intelligent building combines a portable human settlement and a recessed \"green belt.\"\n8. Europe: In the face of the European Union's growing energy crisis, European nations and the United States agreed to start nuclear fusion power plants. In 2030, fusion projects will begin to break world records. Whether powered in part by a super reactor running at a high temperature, as the first nuclear fission-powered ITER project 20,000 times more powerful than France's comparable one in the early years of the project, the development of high-efficiency fuels, and the advancement of fuel reduction and reuse technologies in the fuel,"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

According to Sophie, to get clothes clean, leave it in a pan and splash them with cold water until they are not wet, and then wash it clean in a river. Sophie's mother learned this secret, felt proud that she had saved her family and survived the war, and finally died, peacefully crawling into her bed while someone was eating soup, swatting flies, and watching nights outside her window. Phyllis's son liked to climb trees and whistle a lot. While studying, he would whistle a unique melody, which not only cleared the audience's mind to absorb the essence of the next article, but also let them take away a warm meadow. She could hear a loud whistle from time to time while writing a book on how to break whites until she was overjoyed.\nPhylis washing off the stains on your body.Sophie's father's habit of beating but getting no reaction from them and understanding Sophie all her life made her more sympathetic than the others. When Sophie was at the turning point of her life, she did not want to listen to him or to the others because she didn't care about them. In her torn and dead life, If something troubles Sophie, she beats her black pillow and outlines the person who's having a bad journey sideways. She has learnt not to give up. At the peak of the embarrassment, there may be a glimpse of hope. Once upon a time, Sophie was asked to write an incident in her life that was unique to it and might influence her life decisions. It was no exception. When Sophie thought about it, she felt that, if she left her child to breed rabbits, she would regret it when she was old. Sophie has more than a desire to find a waste land, but more specifically, she hopes that the magic will achieve what she wants. It's like looking forward to a potential person.\n\n### Story Rule:\nThis is a world where magic exists, and, unlike other traditional fantasy worlds, modern magic was invented through the progress of human science. Human beings only use magic with their knowledge and talent, rather than invoking gods or demons and engaging in rituals to achieve magical effects. Some scientists have used very advanced machines, chemical processes, and maneuvered many parameters to accomplish impossible tasks required by magic: such as, with the use of a gigantic electromagnetic incinerator, they transformed a building into a magic candle.\nThe place is less than 2 kilometers to the west of the country. The town on the dead forest is hidden in the grass, and there is always a thick sound-absorbing barrier, under the radar, untraceable and inaccessible. A magician affiliated to Marshland created it. Large area with abundant raw materials, everything can be synthesized here, so setting up a workshop here is more convenient. People can't get through the sound-absorbing barrier and enter the city by themselves. The guardian here is also based on magnetic pressure, and can only be entered by moving things with magnetic power. As a magician, Sophie is quick to realize that her mission is to pass the test and exit this city. The magician must finish his or her work in two days without leaving the city. Apart from the magical effect of the city guard, no other supernatural disasters or records have ever been found in its vicinity.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a magician shop. When she was little, her magical power was so weak that it seemed that she would not be a good magician. She was considered lazy, showing little interest in her education, and always thinking about when she would be fine. At the age of sixteen, when she was the eldest of the family of magicians, her father disappeared. One day, when she was upset, her mother was killed. She was angry and became sloppy. Sophie was blamed by her stepmother and father, lost her sense of ethics, and became a rubbish. After becoming an adult, she worked alone outside, making a living. At the same time, she wanted to get rid of the past memories and identity, find a place where she was not measurable, so she tried to bid for the castle in the magical city, which was furnished with beautiful furniture. Sophie: Sophie: The request is Sophie has a girlish personality, she is observant and can grasp the most crucial links, but her family has repeatedly let her down. She always wronged people who love her and rarely loves anyone else, which makes her neighbour say that her inner world is like a bottomless oil barrel. The followers say she amazed them that she can find the exit in 24 hours. Sophie picked up a girl who had been attacked by goblins and inherited the spell. At the right time, she killed one person, and another turned back from paralysis. Her stepmother turned into a pile of ashes for a picnic while speaking. It was confused by the words the pupa said about cold wind, packed her clothes as it wished, and decided to step into thecentury long eaves.\nHer father returned to the country through the magic of others, but was attacked by a barbarian hero with a large army. Sophie at that time guided the soldiers to attack the heroes. However, she underestimated her father and felt that her father was selfish. The price he paid for his selfishness and dismissal of her father was the inheritance of goblins. Sophie left home with a sense of guilt and lost her sense of direction for a long time and came to the magical city. She saw the sign \"magician\", and was about to walk in.\nSophie suddenly heard a girl speaking from the door: \"Are you not ready for the exam?\" Sophie was completely nervous and retreated to stand in the back. Then, pretty eyes were fixed on each other, and the floor was rough after she walked back, with a face like crazy.\nMagiciansWar magicians People commonly known as: magicians. ##They use knowledge and techniques related to science to become magicians, including people of different professions, types, and years of study. ##Their basic technology is based on modern basic technology. However, because they rely on their own logic and various missing details, their understandings and innovations often diverge from what humans think is modern technology. ##They have access to a powerful magic system (called spell machine). The magic equipment in the system is integrated, which contains one or more magic spells with different names, programming sequences, or special effects. ## Like a Clash Royale deck (the battle card group also known as the deck), they can achieve magic in any way, as long as the magic in the battle is divided into different battle cards. ## Magicians can't use spells and magic equipment. It is necessary to create a magical space, or introduce the 12 elements of hair: metal, iron, stone, gold, fire, lightning, ice, acid, salt solution, water, magic oil, etc. These elements can be a private brain-washing transformation, or neurology. Into different types of magic equipment and accessories, for example, fire affects the temperature, lightning strikes, and when introducing water or salt, creating fairy-tale weapons that can tiedrop stuff. ##There are many magicians of the apprentice level, and there are not a few magicians of the expert level, and a few magicians of the magician level can exert many kinds of magical effects and abilities far beyond the ordinary, but even some magicians of the magician level do not have the ability to manipulate an element by direct introduction. ## For a certain amount of time (time according to different adventures), magicians are required to use magic or switch on a magic monitoring device on their body to play an identity test.\nPrince: A young man of bearded, bushy head. His face is convex in a very unhurried way, and he describes it as an expression of powerful force. He was accidentally turned into a scarecrow in a tantrum by the principal magician of the magic city and spent a few years (It is unclear whether the turnip-headed scarecrow is alive or dead, but they have a very similar nature. ## On the contrary, Howl"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

Within the woodland, a world of fantasy and wonders was reverberating, hiding from humans and ordinary travelers. For a time, Howl and the moving castle were safe here. On the way, they met Calcifer. It was like a fairy town and extremely mysterious. It had flowing rivers and lush grass: the exquisite isomorphism and kind souls of the forest moved Sophie deeply. When they went back to Howl's castle, Howl and Sophie quarreled a lot. Howl was reluctant to leave the castle to visit his lover. Sophie was angry with Howl and continued to stubbornly stay in the castle with Calcifer. However, when Howl suddenly discovered that he was shaking in the heat, he decided to leave and visit his lover. He left Sophie. Sophie felt terribly lonely in the castle and waited for a long time, but they never came back. Was Sophie thoroughly angry that they, in the beautiful castle, threw her out into the queue on this cold winter's Monday?\nWH-clause:\tHow Was Sophie Thrown out?\nOn what day, what time and what circumstances did Sophie get thrown out of the castle?!\nIt is not exactly clear if Sophie ever got thrown out or if she just fell asleep in the castle?\nThe story is about world war 1 and 2.\nThe question refers to the open vocabulary (OW) of a FACTOR related to the purpose of the story, knowledge of the characters who talk about their world and the storyteller.\nThe pictorial analysis questions (pAs) support learners in recognizing the originator of the text, making a pronunciation analysis, and in recognizing valid details (perhaps even changes of situation, state, or world) in the story.\nIn Sophie: The Magician, Howl, it is clear that Calcifer is a demon who speaks in rhyme. While Sophie and Howl show some friction at first, they both grow to respect each other's intentions. In Sophie: The Eternal Fire, Sophie's relationship with Madam Suliman is initially unhappy until she learns to trust in her. However, as Sophie reaches the castle, Howl's relationship with Markl is revealed time and again through à transformed relationship with her. Through her efforts, Sophie forms a relationship with the fire demon, with Howl, and later with the Witch of the Wastes. The last two considerations center around discernment.\n\n### Story Rule:\nEvery person in the world has a difficult relationship with their father.\nThis is a world where magic co-exists with science, set during the 4th century AD. Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer enter Childe Casterford where it seems like the town's people are surprised by their presence. Most of the villagers are calm when they arrive, but the visitors set spies visible with people looking at them. The young man at the front door of the royal palace seems visibly nervous when Howl visits. Most creatures and interesting places and figures in this book are mole people. The evil powerful magician has created a disaster area named the Wastelands where everyone is complicated up and throwing things at each other. Some locations in A Tale of Time City have particle effects on them. There is the chance that monsters are inside the building, so everybody checks for flying creatures before opening the door. As everyone walks down Duchess Road, Dorothy must stay nice in case Mapwhisker the bear is around. If it is likely that someone will sanctify your power, you should wait until you are stronger. When Babes the Bear's story has not yet been told, Madam Suliman mentions that evil spirits can consume a soul. After the fight, some of the wizards asked the burning cap, Why does fire not light the fire, then? There are two witches: One, who burns the wizard, and two, who burns the lands.\n\nThe story tells in first person from Howl's point of view, but the storyteller uses diegetic text to refer to the role of the narrator at various times as a teacher. The author is the storyteller in many places, defines new ways to think about things, and inserts “Offstage” speech tags in novel places. It is not entirely clear if Madam Suliman is the storyteller or the author. This is because at various times, in the course of the story, Madam Suliman is the authority figure for Crafts definitions such as poisons and wizards, whose purposes are strictly to be helpful to help students understand the scope of the story by accepting what the adult characters are doing and saying. The passages directly address the reader, like this:\n\n“Wizardy is something that is obtained through origin, via learning, or learning from a wit larger than yourself. Most experts make the second choice of learning from someone who is admired in the craft. Instead, I was promoted by being related to a powerful wizard, so I have no idea how much control I have over my powers.” The author also tells us: Nonmortal creatures talk to one another every day, but how do we know they are not using interpreters? To make sure we don't call people peasant farmers and cause trouble!\nThe author reminds us that “Chilo carmolies (keepers of the king's gravestones) often wore sunglasses with round wings (a term used by the howl magic), for solar tightrope stunts.”\n\nThe book shows us evidence of these at various points.\noption a. Howl, locus of (a) seemingly friendly relationships between humans and magical creatures, (b) possibility of conjuring magical effects on the rest of the world, or (c) discovery of magical or historically magical objects.\noption b. Pay attention to the castle and its functions and contents; these provide welcome clues. option c. Madam Suliman and the crew she manages are a clear sign that it is possible to achieve some form of rebirth. option d. Signs of a magical reality"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means.
