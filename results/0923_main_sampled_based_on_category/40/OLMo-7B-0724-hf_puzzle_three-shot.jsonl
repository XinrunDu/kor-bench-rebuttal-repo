Each Rope is connected to a Knob such that no two Knobs are connected to the same Resource. A Knob can be rotated clockwise and anticlockwise. The clock shown in the picture is used to indicate which Resources are next to each other. The business cycle works like this: at the start of a cycle, the first thing to do is spin a Knob $2/3$ of a full clockwise revolution. If a resource is facing towards the screen, the clock is spinning on the negative side of this resource, otherwise the clock is spinning on the positive side.\nAfter spinning the inital Knob, spin all other Knobs in order anticlockwise starting with the knob right next to the Clock resource. For each knob that is spun, rotate it exactly one full clockwise revolution.\n\n#### Question:\n\nWhat is the minumum rotation time? The answer must either:\n\n1. Be an integer between $90$ and $270$ inclusive, or\n2. Be in the form of $90a$ to $270b$ inclusive.\n\n### Answer:\n\n$180$\n\n#### Instruction: 5.\n\n1.back to main\n2.<insert excise part here>\n\nProblem © Huzefa - 24 JUN 17 6040\n\n\n#### Instructions:\n\nThese instructions are provided for style purposes (it is assumed that God will guide people through the Holy Spirit).

But before we practice more tests, we might as well prepare a testing environment.\n\n## An error handler for testsNo, after all, someone is still false.\nAs we said, one thing that encapsulates the essence of a good test is the assertion that \"a good test can identify a wrong solution quickly and concisely\". But before we practice more tests, let's discuss another practice we might have.\n\nWe usually code our test case program in Java. Let's get started by looking at the main.\n\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Solution{//stone attacker hits the target on different attempts\nint numOfRemainingStones[] = {0,2,4,4,6,7,6,7,7,8};\nList<String> solution = new ArrayList ¡¡();\nSolution(int[] stones) {\nint count = 0;\nfor (int stone : stones) {\nif (stones .indexOf(stone) + 1 < numOfRemainingStones.length && stones .indexOf(stone) > -1 && numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1] > 0) {\nnumOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stone) + 1]--;\nStoneSayer(stones , stone, count);\n}\n}\n}\npublic void StoneSayer(int[] stones , int stoneToSend , int count){\nint onlyRemaining = numOfRemainingStones[stones .indexOf(stoneToSend)];\nif (onlyRemaining <=4){\n//add it to output\n}\nelse {\nSolution(stones) ;\n}\n}\npublic static void main(String[] args){\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nint len = scanner.nextInt();\nint[] tokens = new int[len];\nfor (int i = 0; i < len; i++) tokens[i]= scanner.nextInt();\nSolution s = new Solution(tokens);\ns .solution = s .solution ;\nSystem.out.println(String.format(\"The number of stones left after firing: %d\\n\", s.solution.size()));\ntoken .close();\n}\n}\n\nAbove is an implementation of our simple test, written in Java. Next, let her take a look at the run.\n\nIt's not ideal. When I compile it and run it, the count is wrong. Why? What goes wrong? Here's what my run screen looks like.\n\nLooking at this error message, it looks like a problem with a null pointer exception. But I don't see anywhere that might cause a null point exception. The only thing that seems strange to me is the call to the removeAllcalls . Solution() 0 times. I thought there should be at least three tries to remove the solution, but there are only two, so I am quite puzzled.\n\nI'm not sure why the removeAllcall to removeAllouwind up in the loop, but I am pretty sure it's a false assumption that I have. I set up the inLink program before writing the test. But after I write the test and run the test, it no longer feels correct. Therefore, it has become a real case: a mistake I wrote has not been identified by the test!\n\nThus, the premises of the complete test should contain higher quality: not only should they to identify proven errors, but they should also identify weaknesses. The changes that make incorrect code more likely to be identified correctly, rather than just triggering an exception, or causing some sort of equally bad outcome, should improve a test case's assertiveness.\n\n• It's not exactly this, but it might be a hint if we examine two of its contradictions.\n\n## The bad teacher's course\nLet's now get back to analysis. Is there any problem with my run? I don't think so.\n\nWhat kind of test test is there to catch the error? Intuitively, it's a unit test. A unit test provides testing data and gives the program we've created the opportunity to do the right thing. It's not really in the context of what the test case program does. The whole program, the finished program, works according to what I intended it to do. I intend it to do. If that's what I intend, if my intention is to identify the problem, then to identify the problem, what I describe.* what I want**(so that I have to write something different from what you say meaningfully):\n\n• I intend it to fail, it will fail, but, of course, it can be cured;\n• It (the program) succeeds, the debugging problem must be in control;\n• Alternatively, I can make the code so that it will not fail.\n\nSo far, I've made a lot of assumptions about what my test looks like and how it works. For example, I'm sure I've made a mistake here.\n\nAt this point, before I describe them, we might be interested in testing whether our assumptions change, and start building other test examples.* These other* test examples might belong to other test examples, perhaps belonging to a specific technique like black-box tests, like any test patterns. Depending on this structure, the basic assumption may change. What we see here is that there are more things to change and more uncertainty. Therefore, before we discuss the problem of designing better question course as simple as possible, let's try a different take on the problem. Perhaps the basic assumption is wrong. Maybe there's something bigger we forgot about.\n\n## Preparing a template for the test\nAlthough, as I said, everything depends on the situation, there is a common fact in programming: the code of the program is delivered in all of its properties. Personally, I think of it as the true property of the program, the properties that result from the implementation of the idea. I say, \"that's\" what the program has, then if the program is made differently, the properties would change, and it wouldn't be \"that\" one anymore. (And for example, if the test case succeeds in such a way that the idea is recognized, it brings out the idea that I think it shows the real way the test works-that the idea recognizes in principle in the program that is the same test target.) So this is one of my foundations, I believe that the unknown degree we want to test only changes its program code, not ideas about how the program works. With this in mind, If I want to inject a modification that makes my code more susceptible to the natural errors that it is more susceptible to (such as false assertions), the assumption is that the test case is not able to be part of the same kind of transformation that I want to test on the code of the program. Therefore, if there is something wrong, the code is probably misguided, but it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a negative implication for the change. That is not a very hard look for the game, but essentially it means that I should care more about the idea than the implementation.* For example in the case of a program, in reality, it works, so why downgrade the recovery function to the test course of the program? First of all, we need to understand this point of view: in some cases it may be helpful to identify design defects in the implementation rather than the idea itself, but this happens at least because the test case code is not very good. Second, we need to understand this point of view: even if we can determine if what we intend is achieved, it doesn't mean that we're done the right thing. It doesn't mean achieving success or eliminating a potential problem. We are only 29% aware of whether a complete solution is wrong. That's why we see what we expect to see-that we expect a lot more than we expect.\n\nTherefore, instead of boldly assuming that* wants to be wrong, instead, I propose the etiquette that we provide as many wrong answers as we can imagine to pass some kind of route. Then we should decide which one we can easily check in our code base, see if there's any special kind of problem, wait, see if there's any special kind of problem, accept generally, see if there's any problem there, accept generally. If there's a problem, choose any specific case, catch the problem you have a choice of the answer, and solve the problem.\n\n## Wrapping up the test course\nThe figure shows an outline that incorporates this example.\n\n• A good test case should provide a fork behavior.\n\n• A good test case should be as close to some relevant mistakes as possible.\n\ndivergence: So if you are caught in a snowdrift, I recommend that you cover the path to the strike in at least three locations.\n\n• A good test case is an experiment, where-notTherefore:\n\n• A good test case should try to use as few \"minor\" decisions as possible.\n\n• A good test case does not contain questions to ask questions.\n\n• A good test case will analyze all the questions it can.\n\nIn short, a good test case will try to find out the worst"}

So, (1,1,1) means the sum of the blackened cells in the first row is 1 + 1 + 1; similarly, (7,2,5) means that 1 + 7 + 2 = 10, 2 + 5 = 7, and 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nSince the values in the corners will be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, consider a case in which each of the first four values listed is replaced by one of these 5-values.\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (1, 1, 1) = 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (X, X, X) = X + X + X\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 13) = 13 + 13 + 13\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 3, 3) = 3 + 3 + 3\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (14, 14, 14) = 14 + 14 + 14\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (13, 13, 12) = 13 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (3, 13, 13) = 3 + 13 + 13 + 1 + 1\n\nThe weight of columns and rows (15, 13, 3) = 15 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1\nThis may help to better digest the post.

If this is true, then that would be: 28 possible character choices per player.\n\nHow would Smooshify the queue system? Would there be a different queue per character?\n\nIn a season, could the rules be:\n\n– Two four-person teams\n– Three two-team match-ups, followed by a three-on-three game\n\nWould it be fixed limit, or variable number of observers?\n\n### 2022.01.03 03:01\n\n### Make OSR HM blues/yellows have the OSR item rates\n\nSo in osrs, I had to gamble 100k - 200k bc on every yellow and 1-2m bc on a lot of blues. Especially blues were expensive (e.g. Warriors Den turnin 1.5m bc), I also recall Olmecs being around 600k bc and yakamaru 100k bc. Back then, you could gwuide light plank turnin for 250k bc.\n\n34013465\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'd say this would survive bots a lot easier as well. (edit: no because HM reward rates are potentially different than normal non-entry items as well)\n\n### All Niches Are Valuable\n\nI feel like this is a lesson a lot of people need to learn and understand. Why is this the case though? This is due to the fact that there are people profiting off the demand for whatever niche gets filled. So let's say Bob is selling tulpas and marketing flavors. What niches are out there on Audible that will bring in listeners, and even more than that, they will go look for? You want to be the one they're looking for and making money off of. Note, if you are making some cash from a niche, you're not necessarily in it. You're a niche business that attracts the listeners/customers you make money off of, the niche is somewhere else.\n\nLet's go over an example of a niche that currently is very valuable in biblical based SPDks (includes paradoses as well because they can be considered an extension of SPDks). These cannot be found easily and Fire-Phantasms include a ready-made demographic just waiting for someone to tap into it, and they don't all reveal their hand.\n\nFire-Phantasms are autonomous angelic entities that are trapped within a dream-body. As long as the dream-body exists, the fire-phantasms will have some presence within it. In the beginning, the existence of these heavenly beings alluded to another world. Fire-phantasms would be regarded as divine beings within that world, and since they exist in all worlds, they are seen as the same deity, the God of that world.\n\nYou might be thinking, your niche is just some fluff. It's missing the mark all together. While it's fluff, there is more to it. An example would be a fire-phantasm being defined as a demigod, a greater being, a being that can be worshipped. There needs to be more to define what that means to someone who is drawn to that niche. It's hitting a chord they did not even expect to hear\n\nUltimately the niche can take many forms but if there is something valuable in it them you'd be better off diving into it as frankly we're pretty much promised whatever niche will be valuable gets saturated on popular search engines from my very limited experience.\n\n### The cost of comfort\n\nDont be comforted by the nitpicks of cheap people.\n\n You might be wondering, what does this mean? Why is this post going here? And why does it have so many replies?\n\nYou see, there's something Simon does on a fairly frequent basis: make an \"I can finally get back to this backlog game!\" torrent of a bunch of games and puts them in his backlog. Or posts some thoughts on a game that he skipped previously. And then it just sort of fades away; it never really gets much attention. Afterall, if you're not bothering to share your thoughts there's no reason anyone should return the favor.\n\nThe personal attacks on his old comments\\games from some people aside and the reckoning that is coming for those individuals. I noticed something after he posted this comment about SoomSoul 2 in the Forum Gaming Thoughts channel:\n\n1. There are a ridiculous number of replies for a dev apology. (3.5K downloads total with 1.5K registrations)\n\n2. The replies are pretty much all the same, they're either congratulations. Or nitpicks on the game.\n\nWhat do you mean, you say?\n\nThe nitpicks citizen (NT) on this thread are making comments that go over the game that no one else is even touching, and I'll bet there's a huge chance you never would have even cracked SoomSoul 2 before Simon's account. Because of NT's, this dev gets support near the level of, say, single 70 hours on N FILE# (done on 3 devices)\n\nIt's coping with various forms of nitpicks just to get noticed. While there's a few people taking a hard stance against them (me, Wan) Arguments are practically nothing and NON DEV CRITICISM and MINORS don't get overturned because NT doesn't say anything. Saying NT is a kid? They're bright for their age, but not smart enough to grasp what IM complaining about.\n\nThey're so easily ignored that not a single thread on that PC game is even remotely popular or watched. Nmnesis, a story ridden tactical RPG that Dr_Crabblesnap scored a 60 hours \"Let's Play\" on it has 88 comments. CloseScrimmer, a game everyone gave a 57 hours \"Let's Play\" on has 20 comments... Only Yell0wGirl, a 60 hour \"Let's Play\" by Yellowpenguin45 gives this game any small amount of coverage.\n\nIn contrast, 2k3 has 51 comments, 60 honorable mentions (that's still on a game that doesnt even exist or have a completionist find it) and 1k one word placements.So when did the mockeries begin or are it's a huge satire of the userbase?\n\nWhy compare Legend of Hajred against every other N taker about the \"So many missed notes\" games?\n\nYUMMYか Mario Golf gets props for soundtracks and want more quality game content\n\nLIREMclub greatest games of February 1985 has 0 reviews\n\nSobakapagi gekihan(what??) gets 0 placement and very rarely mentioned\n\nDiscovered the Baccata game series which actually gets more value for their sales and hype than it's devs. (Which goes back to the Patreon NaturalistCow trend TWICE)\n\n15yｿe噹Japanese from THAT forum gives 18 points of \"Promising\" future from Gamerator \\ CIDF (requiring 100 some games)\n\nAww Sgelake gta clone gets 0 reviews\n\nShitultsuru from my YouTube VACTOR channel gives it a 7 Ray- next to Fractalive PzYZ...\n\nA LEGIT minus 1 hour pending GT based game NEVER MENTIONED gets 600 views from staringit\\INDEV.YOU\\IOGAMEZ\n\nPeople don't really be putting that surface code version II of Korean Powerpunk thot-out non buggy because of the battle system\n\nI'm going too deep into this so im dont going to put anymore examples. I could do a whole Library downtown in order to get listed in WL3M.\n\n## Mercenary\n\nThe reason they put mc on top plays off the limitation of games:\n\nYou have a hacker of sorts that has been born into the game. He's a pirate-friendly but he keeps spreading viruses is because they hate the \"),( universe where it comes from, but he protects brands from piracy. He is currently in the Haunted Maze mode from Puzzle Bobble 3\n\nYou have a streamer host with is demi-wiki who really wants to be battle mage host, but broadcasts alot of talents from the adventure side.\n\nYou have a console bundle with the low budget drop-dudes games, donald games and slim joe that saves money then the home sales about \"saving\" a game that's no longer being sold for that amount.\n\nThe Dev said he was doing nothing wrong, but most of his games gets compared to these fake games like the"}

I would suggest you try something incremental first - start with just one step of size 1, and run the contest twice that way. Then a step of size 2, and the contest three times that way, and so on.\n\nA: Perhaps if you tried debugging it, one would realise that your entry is returning an error because you are not declaring your end_row and end_col variables - also it is not entirely clear if your entry will be recursive - you might print first your end_row and end_col; you never have to worry about incrementing the end_row because for every step the stepsize decrements, and with this you would then be able to be able to trace through and call; next optimization is the evaluating to my nxt_row variable this too would be better off recursive\nstatic char *lastunknown = NULL;

The simplest number patterns involve age calculation or counting. However, though these numbers may just seem fun and curious, a method to efficiently calculate it or merge two numbers into another one is not clear.\n1.Take this number pattern as an example. \n5,427 + 6,000 = 4, ,2,9, and 2,924. Let`s learn some new calculation rules.\n2,924 \t5 \t427\nIt is not obvious to merge two numbers into another number.\n(2,924 + 5 did not equal to 1002,924 + 427).\n3.401 \t40 <130\nWait and see the pattern related to 427.\n(2,929 ≠ 2,42,528 + 427). \nIf a more complex equation is applied, the\nresult of inserting the negative sign is the same unclear.\n(3,400 + 430 ≠ 3, ,401,40 +430 ). \nThis puzzle rule will is defined properly and applied consistently.\n\n### Question:\nFor this question, please click the >> button.

There are no inequality signs between either rows 1 and 2, or rows 3 and 4.\n\nThere are 5 pre-filled squares in the puzzle, located within rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nConstruct a solution to our puzzle, as described in the instruction and the following constraints:\n\nThe puzzle is played on a 5 x 4 grid. You must supply the numbers for every square in the grid.\n\nThe rows and/or columns may contain duplicate symbols, but cannot contain repeated numbers. For example, a valid answer would be {1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 6}, where {1, 6, 7} and {5} are valid (non-repetitive) columns, and {4, 6} and {7} are valid (non-repetitive) rows. An invalid answer would be {1, 1, 6, 6, 4, 6}, since the rows would repeat 1 twice; an invalid answer would also be {1, 1, 3, 4, 6}, since the columns 4 and 6 would repeat the number 3. If square (1, 1) is satisfied, square (2, 1) is stricter; if at the end of subset (1, 1)---(2, 2), the last constraint is satisfied, then (2, 1) cannot be; if the squares between (2, 2)--(3, 3) are counted: the constraint (2, 2) -(3, 2) may not apply to (3, 3), and this decrease the row profile of the row.\n\nConsider (2, 2) and (3, 2) to be of equal priority. The locates at the top-left of a granted integer. We will first put in the wirehead if it does not conflict with any existing boxes. If it is not resolved, the wire is translated to (4, 5) and no conflict is added. Then the wire can be solved (2, 2), then solutions to the same numbers Could a larger default, in fact: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 1). Cannot fishing pole (see above); if wire could try to feed it back to (2, 2), in this case it should move (2, 2)---(3, 3) to (1, 1) and (2, 1)---(3, 2) This will pass the whole constraint, as indicated in the diagram below: (see: 3, 3). The solution to (before) will immediately be in the 3,4, row of 3,3; while the answer to (3, 3) lies in the 3,1 row, which is not male. You can find me (3, 3) / (2, 2) 4 / (2, 3) / (3, 1) 3 / (3, 2) 1 / (1, 1), / (2, 1).\n\nYou may not supply any square more than once, meaning you may not supply multiple answers for the single number 4, for example 4, 5, 4 or 3, 4, 7, 4.\n\nFinally, you may not supply any answer to a square until you have answered all other categories in the square.\n\nAnswer include areas that do not satisfy all constraints. Note that this answer includes the total number of answers that do not satisfy all constraints, as well as those that it contains within it.\n\n• Could you state more comprehensively that in the example, your second constraint is actually redundant because of the first one, or at least agree that this is how you read it? I am far from certain whether I've understood you correctly. –  shoved Sep 8 at 13:15\n• @shoved yes. i think the second and third constraint are identical. if third is insufficient, then fourth is also insufficient. in the example, 1,2,6 are mal-placed –  Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 13:28\n• I have tried running this (I had to make some small changes to the puzzle, see edited question). I am having issues with the use of non-public functions inside the code. Can you clarify the same. – bhargav1 Sep 8 at 14:37\n• @bhargav1 updating the question to clarify the function use – Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 14:50\n• @bajgnome Yes – Luis Casillas Sep 8 at 15:09\n\n# CJam, 141 158 bytes (Quadratic)\n\n(\"%\"2*o_3!)/''$s<{:<\\{{s~<%}%:2_3~}{'}>>]}+)>}\\{%$%o#~-}#oo\no.$*].#{}>)\\}.(.B:o_3%%.|@$@s=$</<S)o_3#o#'|y,~).-o#o_3&5&2_3#3```\n\nTry it online!"}

Since we are dealing numbers of [X ] around a number, we need to calculate the total number of [X 's] at the exact block. There are 8 kinds of specific [X]s which means we need 8[X] for each block.\n\n2[X][X][X]\n2[X] -> [X][X][X] (Add 2)\nIf this rule is willful enough to ignore numbers, it would be partial information which grasps less problem in perspective. Here it's become negative. It's our unreal brains that recognized a number indicating 8[X]s and added the number in front.\n\nAs mentioned, each condition shows the exact number of [X] blocks for each rule.\n# Rules: 8 numbers -\n1. the Clockwise showing the number of [X] in around this block (X A X X,A 3 3 A X,3 A A X 2,A 3 X 3 A,X X 1 X X)\n2. those 2 numbers in front of a number means the path from top left bottom right to cover all the clues (the Clockwise)\n# Solution as Simple as How to Make an uprcasing:\nTranslating\n1. we would have to read the number above at first, which is \"3\". Then we would read the number of the clockwise, which is A. We need 3 As and one X. So we have an output, XAXA.\n2. we would read next number on the first row -- \"2\". So we would read next next clockwise number -- \"A\"...and we continue reading up to X. Finally we get out result, AAXXX.\n1. A 3 3 -> 3A\nA A 3 X -> 3A\nA A A X 2 -> 3A\nA 3 A X 2 -> 3A\nX X 1 X X -> A\nSince we read the result we can go back the clues and figure it out. And that's the general solution which we can apply to the all questions.\n\n\n### Before anyone can solve mine the nights:\n\n- First of all, rule is very simple.\n- But we should notice the tricky situation.\n- The output too \"shaken\". So the line of output is forgotten.\n\nPlease do not give up when you find missing information.\nThink like a radiologist..\nLook for the key signal for the puzzle. Only key signal is valuable.\n\n\n\nclass SolutionByJiyao {\n// method01: \"naive\" method, which consider the mine variation\n// method02: help by taking into consideration the surrounding numbers\nprivate:\nSolutionByJiyao() = default;\nvirtual ~SolutionByJiyao() = default;\nint StupidSolution( const std::string &input ) {\nint retNums = -1 ;\n// Your code here!\nfor( const auto ss: input ) {\nfloat nums = 0.0 ;\nss >> nums ;\nif( nums < 0.0 ) {\nreturn (int) retNums ;\n}\nretNums = static_cast< int >( nums ) ;\n}\nfor( const auto ss: input ) {\nstd::vector strs ;\nstd::string str ;\nss >> str ;\nstrs = split( str, ',' ) ;\nretNums *= splitDeleteRepeats( strs ) ;\n}\n\nreturn (int) retNums ;\n}\nint smartSolution( const std::string &input ) {\nint retNums ;\nfor( const auto &line : input.split( '\\n' ) ) {\nstd::string str ;\nss >> str ;\nbool printable = isDigitalCharacter( str ) ;\nif( str.length() < 2 ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nif( !printable ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nchar firstVal ;\nss >> firstVal ;\nconst double startVal = firstVal ;\nstd::string secondVal ;\nss >> secondVal ;\nconst double secondValFloat = static_cast< double >( atoi( secondVal.c_str() ) ) ;\nif( isNegative( secondValFloat ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nstd::vector sexes ;\nmakeVertexArray( sex, ',' ) ;\nconst bool host = boolMakeSexesFromException( startVal, !host ) ;\nmakeVertexGiveTheListOfNukes( host, males ) ;\nforceMakeVertexArrays( sex, host, sexElems, females ) ;\nint finalDirection ;\nss >> finalDirection ;\nif( !sex( sexElems[ finalDirection ] ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nint val ;\nss >> val ;\nif( !numProperties( val ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nconst long long forcedSingleVal = val ;\nconst double correctedVal = 1.0 ;\nforcedSingleVal += correctedVal ;\nconst string bodySex = sex( sexElems[ finalDirection ] ) ? \"F\" : \"M\" ;\nconst double steps = ( refValue( startVal ) - oneFirst[ finalDirection ] );\nfor( auto &&it : childientes ) {\nif( isParent( it, children , val ) && sexElems.find( it ) == sexElems.end() ) {\nretNums |= it;\n}\n}\nsss >> sexElems;\nif( sss.rdstate() == std::ios_base::failbit ) {\nbreak;\n}\nfor( const auto &ndVal : numDigits ) {\nif( !numProperties( ndVal ) ) {\ncontinue ;\n}\nconst bool finalAgain = true ;\nif( sexElems.find( \"no\");\n}\n}\nprintable = isDigitalCharacter( str ) ;\nif( ( int ) ( retNums ) == 0 ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\n// should be first !!! you have to redesign smart and smartProof to have it the first\nif( !printable ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\nss >> retNums ;\n}\nif( retNums == 0 ) {\nreturn 0 ;\n}\nreturn ( int ) retNums ;\n}\nstd::string append( const std::string &val, const char c ) {\nstd::string retNums ;\nint nSize = static_cast< int >( val.length() + 1 ) ;\nretNums.resize( nSize, c ) ;\nretNums.push_back( '0' ) ;\nUnicodeFormatter strf( retNums,\nUF_BIG_ENDIAN |\nUF_LEGAL_BUFFER |\nUF_PREKEYS |\nUF_V32_SIZE_3 |\nUF_V64_SIZE_1 );\nsprintfString( strf, \"nNum\" ) ;\nreturn static_cast< std::string >( retNums ) ;\n}\n: input ) {\nconst auto size = static_cast< int >( numMines );\nmines = std::vector( size, 0 ) ;\nnumMines = size ;\nfor( auto &x : macroMineValues ) {\nauto pos = static_cast< int >( numpy - minNum );\njs += str + \",V\" + stringify( pos ) ;\n}\nmapfinedrawMineFields( asms, mines );\nasm->generateBcpAndRngTroops( true );\nauto fn = makeFmmlNotTheSection( 1 ) ;\nn++;\nauto asym = makeTroopsAccordingToMineValues( mines, false );\nactionPlacementsWithOneStrutBomb(\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ,\n\t\t\t\tstd::placeholders::_1,\n\t\t\t\tstd::placeholders::_2 ) ) ) ) ;\n{\nauto func = [&]( const std::string &val ) {\nreturn uniqueBoxing( sectionTrueAmplse, val ) ;\n} ;\nbool &aCutSum ;\ndecimalParseToDouble( doubleAdd,\ndoubleSit,\ns,\n&a ) ;\n}}\nuse( func ) ;\n\"\"\";\n\n\t\t// Brand New Title Given :\n \t\t\t\t // z z z z z z z\n// --Yours Truly: Jiyao\n-- z"}

If the answer is not the correct one, it won't appear in the question.\nYou should then output the correct answer to the author of the question.\n\nScenario 1 is much more convenient, because you can reuse questions and answers in a file, rather than input them all directly from the console. However, the overall amount of questions/answers is low in Scenario 1, which makes the implementation relatively trivial.\nScenario 2 has a possible pitfall, because it is hard to know the original order of questions and answers. In Scenario 2, we also include the numbers next to the answers as boundary markers.\n>>> print_set ([[X X X],[X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X],[X X X],[2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A],[1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1 ]])\n[[X X X], [X X X,A 2 2,2 3 A,C X X,2 A 2,1 2 2,3 A A,1 2 1,3 A 2,X X 3,2 X 1,2 A 1]]\n\n\n0    1\n1   10\n2  11\n3  10\n4   0\n\nTerry Simon Stanley (1925-1993) is often credited as the inventor of the ordinary abbreviated crossword. Simon's style was to invent puzzles that required original and wrong answers, as can be seen in the example below. Simon said: \"If I can dream a puzzle, you can do it!\" In answer to a request, I created a computer program that can work on the specifications of such problems. This is what I have supplied, I haven't attempted to imitate Simon's style.\n\nI've put in the specification (and sample answers) of a \"Wordsearch with 5 Vowels, no premiums\" puzzle. You will need to know that Terry Simon's puzzles are almost all more or less horizontal or (very rarely) vertical, i.e., they are not diagonal. Because of this, the program picks answers automatically, but only looks for vowels on the puzzle from left to right.\n\nProblem notes:\n• The paragraph above, if any, should be at the top.\n• Underline the number for the correct answer.\n• To the right of the underlined number, place a space, and the word \"Solution\" on the right.\n• Put the number 1 at the top, and increase by one to the left of the correct solution.\n• Put the answers in any reasonable way for the correct solution, at least one space right of the correct solution word.\n• In many cases, the puzzle may take up more than one line.\n• When printing out the puzzle to solve on paper, or send out via email, do not include the \"Solution\" header or the numbers 1 through the number of answers besides.\nExample question with solution:\n1 Peace of 9 (Semitic nation) 2 GO VEHICLE 3 Refugee 4 SOLUTION 5 Amnesty International 6 Displaced person\n\nConstruct a matrix where the value of the cell might be a number, a predetermined word or nothing. Each column of the matrix will consist of one (or more than one) systematic (inconsistent & linear programming knowledge was not for this topic) combination of words made up from candidate words.\n\n• Can you simulate this question using an Excel spreadsheet?\n\n## How to build a Supernatural thriller story\n\nThrillers, whether romance or romance/action, are the perfect place for complex characters, intense drama, and exciting plot twists. How can you explore these traits in your own story?\nBreath of mysteries, decisions.\nMany critics think that mysteries are one of the most fascinating genres in the genre. But many writers are not sure they can write a mystery story. you can help them.\nThe story of a mystery can be daunting, especially to try to write a mystery about your original story, but advises the following:\nAs a writer, you must be in the mindset of experimentation, of finding stories that others haven't found yet. Of modernizing the story that has been told for millennia. Of being a literary detective.\nWith your own mystery, which means first thing you have to do is you must know that the type of mystery is what you want to write about.\nFor example: A very popular genre right now is the Bengal palette novel. This is a very light fun read telling a story about a lady lawyer that has to cope with all these paranormal things and events that happen all around her.\nFor the first step in the process I would advise you to write down a list of mysteries you want to explore then think about how each of these things would work in a story and what you would end up doing to combine them.\nThe first is a situation that can be easily entertaining, like a mystery in the sense, can be built with, but not introduce with the overall crime or dramatic element.\nNext look at some of your favorite mystery stories to figure out how they are constructed. For example: \"Who is Anna?\"\nFinally, start reading some theories or readings about mysteries, keeping your mind open to new ideas.\nThen set up your story around these concepts. Of course, any crime does not have to be explained to all your readers. Rather, think of your story in three parts: the beginning, middle, and end in which you gradually reveal information that doesn't matter, how something came to be, and what was going on before that.\nThe beginning should always be unusual and out of sync with the rest of the story, often times related at least in part with your main story's question.\nBegin with 1st statement, back to find the character's present situation. Hit all of the previously mentioned characters in one sentence.\n1. Do it in a way that forces the reader to question who did this. 2. Make the idea you tell us about mysterious plausible and believable for the reader. . . . A mystery has to be interesting, and the reader has to feel they're being tricked and tricked. Ultimately, we made the readers feel ongoing discomfort when reading the story because we're always left wondering if there's any hope in solving the mystery.\nOnce you get past this, we can build to it by introducing information that makes the reader read. After all, we're not in an interview.\n\n## How are men's features the most influential of any article writer's personality?\n\nOne thing males are especially attracted to in ladies is masculinity.\nThis doesn't automatically mean only a male human body shape or body griping. As you may know, many women who're incredibly attractive have some sort of masculine quality to them.\nAs a writer, your personality can be a lot like that. If you're a typically \"masculine\" physical appearance, it'll contrast well with your feminine personality, and can make a story that much more interesting.\nA masculine personality comes complete with traits that (usually) just about any man can have.\nFor example, some guys prefer to approach other people by making direct contact with them. This may be done aggressively or otherwise, but it can be fatal.\nA good way to get around this situation is to not only make direct contact, but to be able to accept the individual's approach.\nAnother way to make your personality appealing to"}

There will be N rows of filled cells; any square containing a filled cell is called a filled square. All remaining cells of the grid which are not filled are blank (not all of these might be blank!). This grid has M tiles on it. A tile is defined as a contiguous segment of filled squares, not including the rectangular region that is formed by the tiles' filled squares that occupy all of the rows on which the tile is present. Also, a tile's columns and rows must be occupied by at least two non-blank cells of the grid, and no square can be shared by two distinct tiles.\nA point will be scored for every tile that is not a square, focusing on the left and top edge of the tile. Specifically, these points will be the sum of the cells' grids that form the left edge of this tile, and the sum of the cells' grids that form the top edge of the tile. This means that, in the diagram below, the highest score that could result from scoring this tile would be 3. You will score each tile once and only once.\nNow, there is an object which can score this grid in a symmetric way. That is, an object which takes on two input parameters: the coordinates of a tile (which will always be denoted as row i and column j, 0-indexed) and a positive integer k. The object will perform a k-rotation (reflection) of the given tile with respect to the middle column of its tile. Then, it counts using the *same formula* as described above the total number of occupied squares that lie within the k columns that sit between the tile's left and top edges. Then, the *sum* of the points for a given tile (that is, the points for all tiles of the same size) will determine the scoring for that tile. The highest scoring tile from this object is what will be your score.\n\nI will provide you with a particular file. The file will contain a 2-dimensional array of zeros and ones. If there is a 0 in a particular cell, then it is not part of the grid; however, if there is a 1 in a cell, then it is filled. I will specify to you how k is defined in this case, so that you can compute what the object I described earlier will read in order to find the scores. Continue reading for further clarification.\nFinally, I will specify a particular n in the file. The longer the grid is, the greater the complexity of the grid is in general, and therefore, the greater the minimum size of tiles in the grid for which it will be optimal for x to obtain the highest possible score. Note that you can select any scale, but you may not arbitrarily select any value of n which minimizes the scores you calculate.\nScoring: Because there are a total of exactly two k-columns with a reflection of the tile such that at least half of the space that they occupy is filled, k = 0 is not relevant to score (even though this might be your optimum move). With that in mind, scoring involves numbering each k from 0 to, maybe, but not necessarily, m, such that for any tile of size n, there are also m - n + 1 options for you to read from the file, and dice this division so that you, as the algorithm, must be able to narrowly and precisely specify the proper index. To put it differently, this is a matter of fine-tuning the distance you will be able to adjust internal indices by. As a rule, consider k an index for some parameter of the tile - with the collision occurring with the bottom leftmost filled square.\nBy varying the k parameter, you will be able to clearly see how you can achieve a balanced scheme by pivoting on a k rotation that is slightly larger or smaller than the minimum size of tiles with which you basically plan on scoring.\nI will state clearly m once more for you, along with the n that you are free to choose for yourself.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the shorter the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem Description:\n\nAfter flipping the first column, the code gets stuck.\n\n#### Puzzle File Information:\n\n [Puzzle] Final Answer: [[(1,6)(1,9),(2,7)(0,2),(2,9)(4,6)]]\n\n#### Problem D: In The Light of Day - An Agent's Challenge\nYou will be given the following three types of Information. The amount and order of these pieces of information may vary. Flipping the last edge. Flipping the last corner. The cube is not assembled properly, revealing one cell's contents. These three pieces of information may be in any order.\nThere are a few colors labeled in the cube.\nThere are a few cells will have the same color label assigned.\nThere are some cells which you do not know the color label of.\nYou may assume that the cube is assembled properly, indicating that the unknown labeled cells will only have one possible color label assigned.\nThrough flipping individual edges, one corner and flipping many angles in different directions and maybe looking at the revealed cell for some time, you managed to identify just a few of the labeled cells. Here is what you calculated. Currently, you can say that the following cells have the label 'red' as well as the cells with the labels 'yellow' and 'green'. Additionally, you know that the cells labeled with the label 'black' do not appear in the {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} sequence. This means that the cell labeled with 'red', 'yellow' and 'green' must be in the sequence {3,5,7} and there must be three cells in the sequence {0,1,2} labeled 'black'. As a result, you have freedom to associate the label 'black' with each of the remaining cells.\nThe cells labeled with the color labels {black, red, yellow, gray} have the following values same to you.\n5 7 3 5 6 2 6 1 0\n4 1 7 3 0 1 6 7\n9 8 6 7 8 8 0 1\n8 0 8 1 4 5 7 3\nTo model the state of the cube, which has a set of edges, side corners and top corners on each face of the cube, you may easily represent the state as an integer between 0 and 126, included.\nIf you considered all the states and correspondingly no straights (or else you would not have a solution!), is there a valid state to which you can apply a pair of flips to arrive in the correct state?\nPlease help the agent to represent the state of the cube. Define a more suitable mapping that will allow the agent to tell you such a state. Then, you will receive the sequence of all pairs of flips to apply to find the cube's state.\nFor example, the identity mapping is an example of such a more suitable mapping.\nFlip {1,2,3} to {4,5,6} and {3,6,5} to {1,4,2} will be interpreted as the rotation of upper edges to the right and the rotation of diagonal edges.\nPlease remember that, as you will get the sequence of exact edges to flip, they will begin left-to-right and top-to-bottom for the first face in a horizontal arrangement of faces.\nDepending on your choice of sample problem, the bigger n is, the longer the run time will be.\n\n#### Problem File Information:\n\n## Quick\n\n### Problem 1: Nesting Made Easy\nWe know cow jumping over moon.

The online judge considers that the correct solution code has been submitted if:\ncompiled and run, a round-trip velocity difference (or result) matching the given answer.\nThe submission of incorrect solutions, even in the form of errors, will result in the failure of the game.\n2.Construct a matrix directly containing the correct answer.\nThe presented matrix for the respective number indicates that the player can refer to this matrix as needed.\n\n### Question No: 705\nleave right:ROSE BOWL\n\nOperator left: 3 * 6\n\nOperator right: divide\n\nOperator down: replace\n\nOperator up: replace\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The X means a value in the matrix can be substituted by specific operators as presented above.The CUP is only applied to the numbers.\n3.This game is played row by row, starting from the top and moving downwards.The movement of operators follows the directions indicated by the ranges. When the operators move to the rightmost grid in the matrix or change the range direction, they will automatically stop.\n4.Operator down is priority when having duplicate grid and range direction.Afterwards, the other operators will be processed in the order of operators left, operators up and operators right.\n5.The rules of each operator are as expected. Use the aforementioned example with each order instrument on the left side of the matrix and the corresponding question on the right.\n\n### Question No: 1\nleave right:RELIABLE\n\nOperator left:65\n\n Operator down:26\n\nOperator right:53\n\n Operator up:23\n\noperators left : 15\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom.

Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of C and 0.\n2.The C means there is a container with multiple words and it must be split into single words. The combinations nurtured with whitespace and punctuation.意大利颤抖The container number is indicated on the right side of the matrix.\n3.The game is played on a grid and the words can move in any valid direction.\n4.Whenever the grid changes with the new container, the user may need to move letters to accommodate for new grid designs by assigning them an empty space at random.\n5.Using up includes both directions (up, to near the top of the player’s perspective), though it is still the same direction.\n6.Containers perform with the direction changing as the user moves them, according to how the player repositions the grid. After a grid changes direction, it can also overlap with another grid.\n\n### Question No: 1\nleave right:REST\n\nOperator left:2331\n\nOperator right:93\n79 32 37 51 80 53 231 195 83213945 1\n.\n.\n5 6 93 7 810\n15351610208151613242332\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right and top to bottom.
