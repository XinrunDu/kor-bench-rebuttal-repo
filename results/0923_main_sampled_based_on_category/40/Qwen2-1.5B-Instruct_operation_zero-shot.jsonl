First, let's reduce the equation to make it more suited for our understanding:\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\(4 \\circ X = 12\\)\n\nApplying the first operation rule:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{4} + X^2 = 12\\)\n\n\\(2 + X^2 = 12\\)\n\nSolving for \\(X^2\\):\n\n\\(X^2 = 12 - 2\\)\n\n\\(X^2 = 10\\)\n\nNow, solve for \\(X\\):\n\n\\(X = \\pm\\sqrt{10}\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(X \\in [-\\sqrt{10}, \\sqrt{10}]\\). The provided answer should adhere to the operation rules, and testing it for potential choices within these limits helps verify the correctness. The most direct and valid method to approach this question would be:\n\nIf 4②(X①1)=12, find X.\n\nWith careful understanding and consideration of the specified rules, it is not demonstrated or proven within the constraints to determine a definite, unique value for X. However, one possible rationale could be:\n\nGiven \\(4 \\circ X = 12\\), for \\(a=4\\) and \\(b=1\\), we solve:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{4} + (1)^2 = 12\\)\n\nThe direct and most relevant rule demonstration of the custom code is with variable and operation substitution, which is exactly as described here. Thus, calculating directly from the searching process and the given following rule any attempt at validating a correct operation based on this rule involves unnecessarily complex theory, running analysis, computational complexity results, or reasoning for an identifier containing the type and scope our custom math operation follows, not merely the literal application of equations without evident, clear relation or logic between the operation rules and its instantiated result.\n\nPlease note that without explicit inquiry or context from the operation rules, it's complex to localize a unique relationship or operation validation method within this exploration. But, considering the operational rules detailed, it seems we have a math equality equation with one unknown value, and while we search and insert variables and operations, this setup could align or disprove a valid specialized math operation used in the context where this rule was proposed."}

So, the left side of our equation becomes:\n\n\\[(2^2 - 3^2) + (1^2 - X^2) = -8 + 16i\\]\n\nSolving this will give us the numerical value of \\(X\\). Let's calculate this step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Simplify the equation:\n\\[(-5) + (-X^2) = -8 + 16i\\]\n\nStep 2: Move the constant term to its other side.\n\\[(-5 - 16i) = -X^2 + 8\\]\n\nStep 3: Adjust for rounding off errors to perfectly fit the equation (if there was an issue with floating point arithmetic):\n\\[(-31) = -X^2 + 8\\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for \\(X\\). Since the right side should always be positive or 0, we'll rearrange the equation to solve for \\(-X^2\\):\n\\[X^2 = -31 + 8 = -23\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for \\(X\\) since we need \\(X\\) to be positive (if it were negative, the solution would wrap around to 23):\n\\[X = \\sqrt{23}\\] (Note: Mathematically, \\(\\sqrt{23}\\) represents the square root of 23; however, no decimal numbers in the answer choices for this question, so it should be a whole number).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n\\[X = \\sqrt{23} = 4.9\\] (note: This is close to 4.9 but not an exact match due to slight rounding error)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[[X] = [4.9] = 4.9\\]\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions of the rule and is within the correct range. So, the answer is:\n\n\\[X = [4.9] = 4.9\\]"}
