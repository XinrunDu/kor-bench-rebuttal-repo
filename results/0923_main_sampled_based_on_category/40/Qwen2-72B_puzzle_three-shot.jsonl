The name of the game is \"Conversion of Letters\". The rules are quite simple and it's a great game to use when you have a few minutes of free time. \n\nThe game is played with two words. One word is the starting point and the other word is the goal of the game. The objective of the game is to convert the starting word into the end word by changing one letter at a time. The catch is that each intermediate word must be a valid English word.\n\nThe game can be played in a few simple steps. First, you need to think of the starting word and the end word. The starting word is the word that you want to start with, and the end word is the word that you want to end with. For example, let's say we want to convert the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\". \n\nTo play the game, we start with the starting word \"time\". We then change one letter at a time, making sure that each intermediate word is a valid English word. In this case, we could change the \"t\" to a \"p\" to get the word \"pime\". We then change the \"i\" to an \"a\" to get the word \"pame\". Finally, we change the \"e\" to an \"s\" to get the word \"pams\". This completes the game, and we have successfully converted the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\".\n\nThe game is a great way to improve your spelling and critical thinking skills. It can also be a fun way to pass the time. You can play the game with friends and family, or you can play it by yourself. The game is not time-consuming and can be played in a few minutes.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Conversion of Letters\" game is a fun and challenging puzzle game that can help improve your spelling and critical thinking skills. It's a great way to pass the time and can be played by people of all ages. So, why not give it a try and see if you can convert the word \"time\" into the word \"pass\" in as few steps as possible? Good luck!"}

There is a rectangular grid given with rows and columns. Below certain columns are provided the numbers of filled cells from the bottom of the grid in that particular column and at the end of certain rows are given the total number of filled cells in that row.\n2. The objective of the puzzle is for the player to fill in some 'X' or 'O' in the cells of the grid so that the number of filled cells in each row and column aligns with the given numbers.  \n3. The player is strongly suggested to mark the 'X' or 'O' clearly in a particular cell instead of marked by another unknown symbol for determining whether the number in a certain row or column corresponds to the correct number of 'X' or 'O'.\n\n### Question:\nX    X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O    O    O    O               5 \nO    X    X        O    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O    O    O    O               5 \nX    O    X        X    O    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O    O    O    O               6 \nX    O    O    O    O    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O    O    O               8 \nO    X    O    X    O    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O    O               8 \nX    X    O    X    O    X    X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O    O               8 \nX    X    X    O    O    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    O               9 \nX    O    O    O    X    O    X     X    X    X    X    X    X    X        X    X    X    X    X               9 \nX    O    X    X    O    O    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X        X    X    X    X    X               9 \nX    O    X    X    O    X    X        X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X        X    X    X               8 \nX    O    X    O    X    X    X        X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X               8 \nX    O    X    O    X    X    X    X    X    X  O    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X        X               9 \nO    X    X    X    X    X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X        X               9 \n\nX    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nO    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nX    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nO    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nO    X    O    X    O    X    X    X    X    X\nO    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nO    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nX    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X    X\nX    X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    \nX    X    X        X    X    X    X    X    X    \n\n### Answer:\n[X,X,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,O,O,O,O,O,X,O,O,O,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,O,O,O,O,O,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,O,O,O,O,O,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,O,O,O,O,O,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,O,O,O,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X.X,X,X,X,X,O,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X]"}

The landing of the given information on the grid will be similar to that of the Sudoku puzzle (same shape and size), except for the order of the numbers on the grid. Some numbers may be pre-filled on the grid, representing original positions on the grid. Your task is filling in original blanks on the grid based on the original pattern of the given numbers. Your final answer should emulate a Sudoku solve (all numbers both horizontally and vertically increased by one until reaching an upper limit), but with the complicate fact that some values are already defined and given. Therefore, the task is to provide all possible number solutions based on the given custom Sudoku-like rule and the originally occupied positions. \n\nExpress your result by both horizontally and vertically increasing by one from the original numbers. The result is intended to represent all the numbers in the grid, not only those that were originally landed.\n\nTo better understand the rules of this puzzle, let's break them down:\n\n1. The puzzle is configured on an n*n grid where n refers to the dimension of the grid. Each cells on the grid should only contain one number from 1 to 81 (inclusive). \n\n2. The numbers, instead of randomly placing on the grid, must be arranged in order from 1 to 81. This specifically means 1 adjacent to 2, 2 adjacent to 3, and so forth.\n\n3. The numbers can only be aligned horizontally or vertically, they cannot be aligned diagonally like in a traditional Sudoku.\n\n4. The problem is given in the form of a matrix (an arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns) where blank squares/positions are represented with X's, and numbers in original squares/positions are replaced by numbers. \n\nYour fundamental task is to fill the blank spaces with numbers from 1 to 81 in order, ensuring these numbers are adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically, keeping the original numbers in their respective positions, maintaining the ascending order, and ensuring that each unique number from 1 to 81 appears only once on the entire n*n grid.\n\nHere are examples to better illustrate the process of applying this rule:\n\n### Example 1:\n\nStarting Grid:\n\nX X X X X X X X X\nX 11 X 5 X 73 X 59 X\nX X 13 X 69 X 79 X X\nX 19 X X X X X 61 X\nX X 15 X X X 77 X X\nX 17 X X X X X 63 X\nX X 31 X 37 X 49 X X\nX 29 X 35 X 47 X 45 X\nX X X X X X X X X\n\nWhen solved using the defined puzzle rule, the starting grid would evolve into:\n\n9 8 7 6 71 72 81 58 57\n10 11 12 5 70 73 80 59 56\n21 20 13 4 69 74 79 60 55\n22 19 14 3 68 75 78 61 54\n23 18 15 2 67 76 77 62 53\n24 17 16 1 66 65 64 63 52\n25 30 31 36 37 48 49 50 51\n26 29 32 35 38 47 58 60 44\n27 28 33 34 39 40 41 42 43 \n\n### Example 2:\n\nStarting Grid:\n\n11 12 15 16 27 28 29 30 31\n10 X X X X X X X 32\n9 X X X X X X X 33\n6 X X X X X X X 34\n5 X X X X X X X 47\n74 X X X X X X X 48\n75 X X X X X X X 49\n76 X X X X X X X 50\n77 78 63 62 61 60 59 52 51\n\nWhen solved using the defined puzzle rule, the starting grid would evolve into:\n\n11 12 15 16 27 28 29 30 31\n10 13 14 17 26 25 24 23 32\n9 8 1 18 19 21 20 22 33\n6 7 2 39 38 37 36 35 34\n5 4 3 40 41 44 45 46 47\n74 73 72 71 42 43 56 55 48\n75 80 81 70 69 68 57 54 49\n76 79 64 65 66 67 58 53 50\n77 78 63 62 61 60 59 52 51\n\n### Example 3:\n\nStarting Grid:\n\n67 X 69 X 71 X 73 X 75\nX 65 X 81 X 79 X 77 X\n55 X X X X X X 25 X\nX 57 X X X X X 23 X\n53 X X X X X X 7 X\nX 47 X X X X X 9 X\n45 X X X X X X 7 5\nX 41 X 35 X 17 X 1 X\n39 X 37 X 15 X 13 X 3\n\nWhen solved using the defined puzzle rule, the starting grid would evolve into:\n\n67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75\n66 65 64 81 80 79 78 77 76\n55 56 63 62 61 28 27 26 25\n54 57 58 59 60 29 22 23 24\n53 52 51 50 31 30 21 8 7\n46 47 48 49 32 19 20 9 6\n45 44 43 34 33 18 11 10 5\n49 41 42 35 16 17 12 1 4\n39 38 37 36 15 14 13 2 3\n\nThese illustrations show the practical application of the rule, emphasizing the need to perform the calculations following the puzzle rules. That includes ensuring the numbers are ordered from 1 to 81, the numbers are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, and the original numbers stay in their respective positions. This would be a great challenge for problem-solving skills using logical and mathematical reasoning."}

The puzzle is played on a grid of n x n size, with skyscrapers in each cell.\n2. Skyscrapers' heights vary from 1 to the grid size.\n3. Two skyscrapers of the same height cannot exist in the same row or column.\n4. The numbers on the sides of the box indicate the number of skyscrapers that would be seen if you looked in the direction of the arrows, with taller buildings blocking the smaller ones.\n5. Fill the numbers in each cell to reflect the skyscrapers' heights.\n6. The topic consists of an n x n matrix filled with X, with the aforementioned numeric limitations affixed to the box's top and bottom.\n\nLooking at the first question:\n2        2        1        3        \n2        X        X        X        X        2\n2        X        X        X        X        3\n1        X        X        X        X        2\n3        X        X        X        X        1\n        2        2        3        1       \nThe goal was to fill in the X's with numbers 1 to 4 (size of the grid), following the rules and given numbers on the edges. \n\nUsing the provided rules and edge numbers, the answer for the first question should be: \n[[3 1 4 2,2 4 3 1,4 2 1 3,1 3 2 4]]\n\nFor the other questions, the process is similar, where you fill in the Xs with numbers based on the edge clues given and following the rules."}
