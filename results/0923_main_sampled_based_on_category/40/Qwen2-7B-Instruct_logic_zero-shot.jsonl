The accurate negative logical implication for this formula considering the correct interpretation would strictly depend on the specific combinations resulting in a true antecedent leading to a false consequent, not covering cases where either side is true simultaneously as these would not violate the implication logic.

However, since F(x) and G(x) are 0-ary predicates for specific constants (F for 2 being even, and G for 2 being prime), they can be directly symbolized in the format:\n\n- F(2)\n- G(2)\n\n(2) The statement \"If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime\" can be translated directly into the predicate system since 2 being prime is represented by G(2) and 4 not being prime is symbolized by \u00acG(4). This is represented as an implication between the two statements:\n\n- G(2) \u2192 \u00acG(4)\n\n(3) The statement \"Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime\" suggests a \"unique\" relationship between the primality of an element and itself being unique among all other elements considered in the domain. However, this statement is not accurately represented by the given symbolization methods, as there is no direct way to symbolize a statement asserting uniqueness of elements' properties under these rules. Thus, it is correctly represented in the list as a space or an empty list, indicating that no direct symbolization exists under the provided rules.\n\n(4) The statement \"Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime\" can be logically interpreted to mean that if 6 is not prime (i.e., \u00acG(6)), then 4 is prime (G(4)). This can be represented using implication in the predicate system:\n\n- \u00acG(6) \u2192 G(4)\n\nGiven the established symbolization for even and prime properties:\n\n- For the first statement: F(2) and G(2)\n- For the second statement: G(2) \u2192 \u00acG(4)\n- For the third statement: As noted, this cannot be directly symbolized as its propositional structure does not align with the provided rules; thus, it's represented as an empty list. The rule does not provide a way to symbolize \"unique\" or \"only\" properties of elements under consideration.\n- For the fourth statement: \u00acG(6) \u2192 G(4)"}

According to our definitions:\n\n    \\[\n    p \\text{ is a common belief in } G \\rightarrow G_p\n    \\]\n\n    This expression shows that for all members of the group `G`, including Alice, it must be that they firmly believe `p`. \n\n3. **Alice's doubt**: It's stated that Alice, an individual within this group `G`, doubts proposition `p`. According to our definitions:\n\n    \\[\n    H_p \\rightarrow \\neg B_p\n    \\]\n\n    This indicates that if Alice doubts `p`, then by definition, she does not firmly believe `p`.\n\n4. **Combining these into a logical expression**: The consensus of the group `G` on proposition `p` conflicts with Alice's doubt. We denote this as a situation not aligned with the definition of common belief within a group when applied specifically to Alice. In terms of propositions, this involves both Alice firmly believing the negation of `p` (`\\(\\neg B_p\\)`) and the fact that `p` is indeed a common belief (`\\(G_p\\)`) within the group under consideration. However, the question specifically asks for how this would be represented given it's not the case that Alice believes in `p` being the consensus; rather, the focus is on the doubt concerning `p`.\n\nTherefore, a logical expression expressing the desired situation (consensus as common belief group-wide but individual Alice's doubt):\n\n\\[\n\\text{For } p \\text{ being consensus of group } G \\text{ and Alice doubting } p: \\neg G_p \\vee \\text{Alice's beliefs}\n\\]\n\nThis expression (~\\(!G_p~\\)) indicates that proposition \\(p\\) is not a common belief in group \\(G\\) from Alice's perspective. In traditional logical notation, this is represented as \\(\\neg G_p\\), which stands for \"not \\(G_p\\)\" or \"it is not the case that \\(p\\) is a common belief in \\(G\\)\".\n\nIn the requested format [[]], we'll encapsulate this understanding more directly addressing the inquiry in terms of logical symbols specified in the cognitive logic formulation provided by the original:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg G_p \\wedge H_p]\n\\]\n\nHere, the inner part of the brackets indicates that `p` is not a common belief in the group `G` (encoded as \\(\\neg G_p\\)) and Alice doubts `p` (encoded as `H_p`). However, it seems a discrepancy might've been intended between the explanation and the precise logical formulation based on the given rules (`G_p` indicates common belief which, given Alice's doubt, intuitively suggests she does not 'fit' into a common belief scenario regarding `p` if we interpret things strictly within the world of `G_p` designation as used here). The clarification of explicitly linking this back to Alice's individual status (`Alice's beliefs`) seems crucial in aligning the logical expression with an assessment grounded in individual belief statuses.\n\nGiven this review of specifications and the aim for output conformity to the provided formulation guidelines, the enhanced and more interpretable logical expression vertically could reflect to sum up the key insights into Alice's differing belief dynamics from the consensus standards, aligning closer to a more granular expression of her perspective within the broader definitions of beliefs and dought provided:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg G_p \\wedge H_p] = [\\neg (B_{G_p}) \\wedge H_{Alice}]\n\\]\n\nThus anarchically, the final annotation aligned to fulfill both the core logical expression derivation and description of the cognitive environment in line with the supplied axioms and definition is:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg (B_{G_p}) \\wedge H_{Alice}]\n\\]"}

Statistical Attribute Inference Based on Samples\n\n(1) Rule Description:\n- Randomly select a representative sample from the population.\n- Observe and record specific attributes of individuals in the sample.\n- Depending on the frequency of the attributes and the type of sample, apply the following rules:\n\n(2) U-Generalization Rule:\n- If all individuals (denoted as `n`) in the sample possess attribute `A`, then we can infer that all individuals in the population also possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `U(A, n)`, then `\u2200x \u2208 P, A(x)`.\n\n(3) P-Generalization Rule:\n- If `k` individuals in the sample possess attribute `A`, where `k < n`, then we can infer that approximately `k/n` proportion of the individuals in the population possess attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `P(A, k, n)`, then `Pr(A) \u2248 k/n`.\n\n(4) C-Reasoning Rule:\n- If two samples S1 and S2 exhibit similar proportions in attribute `A`, i.e., `P(A, k1, n1)` and `P(A, k2, n2)`, then we can infer that these two samples may come from populations with similar proportions of attribute `A`.\n- Symbolization: If `C(A, k1/n1, k2/n2)`, then `Pr(A, P1) \u2248 Pr(A, P2)`.\n\n### Question:\nA company performs quality testing on its products and randomly selects 50 products from a batch of 1,000, resulting in 2 defective products. Using the P-Generalization rule, estimate the rate of defective products for the entire batch.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[number%]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Using the P-Generalization rule, we have \\(k = 2\\) defective products in the sample of \\(n = 50\\) products. The estimated rate of defective products for the entire batch is \\(\\frac{2}{50} = 0.04\\).\n\nConverted into a percentage, the estimated rate of defective products for the entire batch is \\(0.04 \\times 100\\% = 4\\%\\).\n\nHence, the answer is **[4%]**."}

LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2192 Reasonable\n- If r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 ... \u2227 r_n \u2227 r_n+1 \u2192 \u22a5, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, which paradox does it represent?\n\n- p: an event\n- q: a hypothesis\n- Expression: (p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acp \u2192 q)\n\nA.

Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nConsidering the domain of individuals as natural numbers and R representing the \"less than\" relationship, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) states that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number. However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number. Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
