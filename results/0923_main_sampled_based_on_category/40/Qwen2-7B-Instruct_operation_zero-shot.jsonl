Thus, 286※13 = 24.\n\n2. ** substitute back into expression**: \n   - The expression now becomes 19※28※31※24.\n\n3. **Compute 19※28**: \n   - Exactly one of 19 or 28 is a multiple of the other: 28 is 1.45 (or 7/2) times 19, so we use the rule for when b is a multiple of a. Thus, 19※28 = 28/19 + 2.\n\n   Calculate the value: \\( \\frac{28}{19} + 2 = 1.47368421052 + 2 \\approx 3.47368421052 \\).\n\n4. **Compute 31※[result from step 3]**:\n   - Neither 31 nor the result from step 3 is a multiple of the other, using the last rule. Thus, 31※X = 24.\n\nNow, we substitute back into the expression:\n\n- [[19※28※31※(286※13)]] equals [[3.47368421052※31※24]].\n\nSince the third step results in 24 making this grouping operation essentially 31※24, which further simplifies to 24 (as 31 and 24 are not multiples of each other, and using the last rule of the operation).\n\nTherefore, the final answer, following the custom operation, is **[24]**."}
