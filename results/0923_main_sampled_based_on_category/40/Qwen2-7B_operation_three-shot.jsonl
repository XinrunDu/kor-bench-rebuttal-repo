Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na⊕b=a+bi.\n\n### Question:\nCompute (3⊕4)+(7⊕2).\nIf the answer is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[10+6i]]\n\n### Question:\nCompute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1).\nIf the answer is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[9+23i]]\n\n### Question:\nIf (5⊕3)+(X⊕2)×3=11+11i, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[2]]\n\n### Question:\nIf (6⊕3)+(X⊕2)×2=10+11i, find X.\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[4]]\n\nLet's break down the problems. \n\n1. To evaluate (3⊕4) and (7⊕2), we substitute these values into our operation rule, a⊕b=a+bi, so (3⊕4)=3+i4=3+4i and (7⊕2)=7+2i=7+2i. Then, (3⊕4)+(7⊕2)((3+4i)+(7+2i)), which equals 10+6i. Therefore, [[10+6i]].\n\n2. Again, we substitute (5⊕6)=5+6i and (3⊕1)=3+i into our operation rule. To compute (5⊕6)×(3⊕1), we first calculate 5*3=15 and 6*i*1*i=-6, so (5⊕6)×(3⊕1)=15+-6i=15-6i.\n\n3. We substitute (5⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. In this case, (5⊕3)=5+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (5⊕3)+(X⊕2)×3=11+11i, we first cancel out the X value, as X can vary. So we are left with (5⊕3)+(2i)×3=(5⊕3+a)×1=(5+ai)×1=11+11i. As (5⊕3)=5+3i, we subtract this from 11+11i, resulting in 11+11i-(5+3i)=6+8i. So, 6+3i (11+11i-(5+3i)) = a×1=6+8i. Hence, a=X=2.\n\n4. This is similar to the second question, so we substitute (6⊕3) and (X⊕2) into our rule. Then, (6⊕3)=6+3i and (X⊕2)=X+2i. To solve (6⊕3)+(X⊕2)×2=10+11i, we first cancel out the X value: (6⊕3)+(2i)×2=(6⊕3+a)×1=(6+ai)×1=10+11i. By subtracting (6⊕3)=6+3i from 10+11i, we have 10+11i-(6+3i)=4+8i. So, 4+2i(10+11i-(6+3i)) = a×1=4+8i. Consequently, a=X=4."}

The key difference is that xxxxx share switching essentially leads to a xxxxx transaction on xxxxx. Instead of xxxxx, they simply send the shares xxxxx, while x xxxxx xxxxx are really tracking the share xxxxx. If you were xxxxx facilitate your trade xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxx, you'll xxxxx your xxxxx to be xxxxx, instead of completing a xxxxx. Also, however, xxxxxx will take xxxxx you xxxxxx to get the xxxxxxxx so it'll x xxxxx it xx quite xxxxx.\n\nAdditionally, in a xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx, you xxxxx an xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxxx xxxxx, and xxxxx bring your xxxxx xxxxx will xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xx xxxxx. This is not xxxxx xxxxx existing xxxxxxxx exactly, xxxxxx you xx a xxxxx xxxxxxxx who xxxxx xxxxx and xxxxxxxxx them xxxxx xxxx are xxxxxxxx.\n\nYou xxxxx the reddit, the user TBBG1213 provided a working solution for their issue: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amiibo/comments/fq8yow/amiibo_centers_buying_selling_trading_postspacehack/FxZUxtd  \n\nThey were able to do this by x creating a xxxxx xx verts and xxxxx a xxxxx xxxxx behind the xxxxx. This way, the xxxxx could move along the x x which xxxxx the x-vert xx xx form, x then it xx go xxxxxx a continuous x number of xxxxxx polygons until it loops back x.\n\nIf the above doesn't help solve your problem, xxxxxx we can xx able xx xxxxx xx xxxxxxxx an xxxxxxxx problem and xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx help.\n\nI hope this helps explain the different aspects of share switching and how xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx happen.

The rule demonstrates 'element-wise maximization'. Hence, the `a@b` notation means `max(a,b)`. In the context of matrices `A`and `B`, `A@B` denotes the matrix resulting from element by element maximizing elements between `A`and `B`:\n\nFor example:\n\nA @ B = [((7,8), (3, 4)), ((2,1), (0, 2))]\n\nThis means, in the given matrix A @ B, the element in the first row and first column of `A` is compared with the corresponding element in `B` (which is `7` and `2` respectively). The larger of these two values is taken (in this case `7`), and the same is repeated for each element across the matrix.\n\nIn a similar way, you could solve the remaining questions."}
