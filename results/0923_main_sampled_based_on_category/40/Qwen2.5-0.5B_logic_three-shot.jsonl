Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nConvert the following propositions into symbolic formulas:\n\"p1 if and only if p2 is false.\"\n\nPlease format your answer as [[ ]], where the part in parentheses contains the corresponding logical expression of the proposition.\n\n### Answer:\n[[p1=~p2]]\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the level, type of **p1**.\n\nA. Truth Formula, B. Falsehood Formula, C. Neither.\n\nFor levels, answers should be given as a single letter from A to Z or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1). For Type, the answer should give the options in A/B/C above. \n\nThe format of the overall answer is [[level];[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A];[C]]\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formula.\nFormula: p1 =::> ~p2\n\nThe answer format is [[T:...];[F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).\n\n### Answer:\n[[T:\u2713|x,x|x,x|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3. \nThe answer should be given as a single letter from A to Z, or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1).The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Z\n\n### Question:\nIdentify the compound statement that is equivalent to \"it is not the case that if not p1, then p2\" in symbol form.\nThe answer should be given as a single compound consisting of the symbolic form of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n### Answer:\nThe compound statement is [ if p1, then p2]\n\n### Question:\nIf p1 is a false statement, where is [if p1, then p2] in the truth table?\n\n### Answer:\nThe [if p1, then p2] is false, as p1 is false, which contradicts the logical implication."}

The final truth values should be determined based on the given statements. However, there is no direct formula for the final expression. Instead, we can deduce the truth values step by step, from pluses to kilos. If we take:\n1. If first person is correct, then p is true, so everything is true: p\n2. If second person is correct, then q is true, so everything is true: q\n3. If third person is correct, then r is true, so everything is true: r\nWe can conclude that all are true, which reflects Professor Wang's correct status as being from Suzhou.\nAssuming the scenarios are strictly true: \nSecond person: Although pluses to kilos has been constrained because we are treating them as positive number when squared, if squaring a number should always be classified as sure positive, pluses should be treated as squares negatives, i just changed it to act as the definition of negation. means pluses with negations so we treat them as literals which could be based off of some inequalities in set now. anyway the idea is that we can still count and convert based off of, but we do know deep inside that is still the java clojure code\n(1.2 + 3.4 + 6.7 + 9.0043)\n= (1.2 + 9.0043)\n= 10.4043\nIf first person is incorrect, then p is false, so pluses must be inferred: p\nAssuming Professor Wang is anywhere but at Suzhou:\n1. If second person is correct, then q is true, but qi cannot lead to a situation that quadruple a pluses that are multiple:\nq\u00b2 = 4^2\n = 16 = pluses*PositiveTwos\n (pluses*PositiveTwos) ^ 1.(equal to ql) equals p\n So, the fourth attachment is accurate that -quotlimit that p = pluses. (p > qr) is true, so the statement must be true:\n = coffees / cups\nHowever, we should already know\n = sum\n = 180 / days\n\nQuestion:\nGiven these equations, using the related logical rules, what would be the answer exactly like [[A]]?\nYou're very clear about what I told you, just a comprehension for me :0;_7; OH! Here comes your third answer: [[A]. The final boolean results should be based on the given statements and the rules.

Each part is self-contained in such a way that the inference path is clear and logical. The process proceeds as follows:\n1. We set up the rules and assumptions required to prove each part according to the provided explanations.\n2. We systematically apply these rules while maintaining the leveraging and architectural consistency necessary in Pike syntax.\n3. Throughout the entire proof procedure, the order must be carefully adhered to, with proper manipulation of indices and placeholder expressions based on variables, conditions, and/or formula assertions. The sequence of application of rules follows the logical flow of the proof, ensuring all subexpressions are successfully validated before advancing to the next part.\n4. The final conclusion of the proof shows that the premises of the original problem are true and thus verifiable by means of functional reasoning.\n5. This concludes the rigorous chain of logical deduction leading to the establishment of the necessary logical connections described in the problem statement.\n6. Omitting the detailed steps from the description taken at line 75, the actual execution or interpretation of the proofs can proceed from a clear understanding of the content of the rationale presented."}

In simple terms, it is when one variable directly affects another variable.\n\nThe statement provided, \"Person's age is dependent on his height,\" indicates that an individual's age and height can influence each other. For example, if a person is taller, they may experience more energy or stamina over time, affecting their stamina level. In this case, the independent variable is the person's height, and the dependent variable is age.\n\nSimilarly, if a person is complainland, they could either complain or not, as it depends on their decision to complain vs not. The independent variable for this case is the person's attitude (complain land or not), and the dependent variable is whether they complain or not.\n\nIn summary, the statement communicates that there is a connection between the person's height and age that does not necessarily depend on them not being complainland or not.\n\n### Question:\nSelect \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" or \"E\" based on the given mean and standard deviation as well as the distribution, such that 68% of the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean\n(1) mean 85, standard deviation 3, distribution left-skew, value 91\n(1) -5, standard deviation 2.5, distribution left-skew, value 6\n(1) 85, standard deviation 0, distribution left-skew, value -7\n\nThe answers format should be like list of list or a single list of a list in different order like [list of answers]: [answer 1], [answer 2]\n\n### Answer:\n[(91 - 3) \u00b1 3 | 6 - 3; (-7 - 0) \u00b1 2.5 | [85 - 0] \u00b1 2.5]; [choice of answers [(A);[(B);[(C);[(D);[(E);[(0;[(I;[(6;[(J;[(E;[(2;[(D;[(3;[(5;[(6;[(7;[(8;[(9;[(10;[(11;[(12;[(13;[(14;[(15;[(16;[(17;[(18;[((0;[((I;[((J;[((E;[((B;[((E;[((I;[((I;[((E;[((E;[(i\n:[(j\n:[\nAnswer format:\nFirst option: [choice of answers [#;\";} [and [])\n\n### Question:\nCreate a classification statement describing outcomes for the following assignment.

In mathematical logic, functions, and not just formulas, if we assume a function flow `R` is a way to transform information using a data structure `E`, then a function is just a formula `F` that represents `R`. Hence, the formulas can be conveniently shown in form `F(R)` to represent `R`. Here is a little demonstration to list all of the functions we could use (or equivalently, all of the idempotents). There is a nice function set here, which I will pass as shown below. This hasn't been thoroughly reviewed by me. '''For me, you simply state what you need.

It provides researchers with an in-depth analysis and understanding of grammatical structures and their assumptions that have puzzled scholars for centuries.\nIn this book there is only one rule for constructing simple sentences (in 2nd Generation): Ther\u2014are there any other groups of parallel structures which are regular/regular? Are there any other groups of answers for the simple question: Does her mother have a car? and does such a group actually exists?\nTry stipulating, contrary to rule 3. --- I_don't_have_a_car---.\nTranslation--- Did she have a car? --- No! accordingly.--- What do you know about grammar?\nTactical Grammar is a school of grammar which maintains that what Grammar is - perhaps more importantly - what should True Grammar be is something separate from the body of the Grammar proper. This author explains why for the purposes of analyzing proper grammar, simultaneous independent clauses are indispensable - although comprising a group of parallel homogenous sentences or sentences with similar coordinate structure, or both, but neither of which convey independent grammatical constructions.\nThe common (and unnecessary) synonymy between \u2018language\u2019 and \u2018speech\u2019 is the expertise with which it is presented. Knowling is capable of collective parts alike, and the dozens of different special languages are mainly used for literary expression, and for assemblies. They at first seem incompatible with phonological techniques; nevertheless, they are completely interdependent, and especially glottaliPs are only a speclly the ver.support leaked by the use of old-royal languages. Cepara is mostly a interference of male elements. In a life, there are many parallel worlds, so as to know a world, one must know those parts which are more paralayife.\nLus-Oriental - Moroccan - lusi-Ome-tllom and expoundes nomenclature.

Their (elegant) language struggle for cohesion has certainly not preeminent deeper structure. They yield to a great congregation of parallelisms throughout the linguistics, a composition of as many parts as reconjures the synonym in the interpretation of a language, as Diatar Klepunz describes.\n\n### Included file(s) listed on the Taxonomy Project:\nLNKuinotshaeTintinlitchillastiFatasISRcoRcbtePlDfeirlkunkey4p9iXersawkAtdh\n\nResult of discussion about Structural Grammar [This was your most recent call] --->"}

Can you delve deeper into how the rules of the Linarith seem to lead back to the paradox, I'm interested in understanding why one state, or set of premises, is more valid than another in these scenarios?\n\nCertainly! The paradox theories of Golarions and Linarith, as well as others like the SL paradox, share a common underlying theme of allowing for reasoning beyond fundamental or classical axiomatic theories. The key to understanding why one level of explanation (e.g., Linarith) may seem to be more appropriate than another is largely due to how they handle the logical inconsistencies present within their respective schemes. Here are some more detailed explanations:\n\n### Golarions Paradox\n\n1. **Statement A**: The Paradox of `$\\text{Int objects with no constructors} = \\text{internal objects}$`. This statement assumes that `Int` can be used as a type constructor, leading to a contradiction regarding the construction of internal objects within the type system. This paradox arises because the requirement for constructors to be used leads to unmet conditions within the context of set theory or logical systems.\n\n2. **Statement B**: This statement introduces the idea of a set of \"objects\" calling forth symbols of \"internal objects.\" Unlike the typical set of all objects, this suggests a set of internal objects designated by names, effectively creating a 'second natural number'. The assumption here is that there are a finite number of such objects, which raises questions about how many more there actually are or what they look like.\n\n3. **Statement C**: A focus on \"standard proof\" in `Golarions` suggests that only finitely many axioms are available for generation of proofs because both the motivation behind the axioms (of the form \"all natural numbers are bodies\") and their mechanical transformation into actual proofs do not generalize beyond \"infinitely many axioms\".\n\n4. **Statement D**: The concept of \"sheaves\" or \"point theories\" leads one to look at topological structures. Sheaves generalize to sheaves, which can be interpreted internally within different topologies. This distinction indicates a deeper level of reasoning about how different properties are encoded in categories, considering itself an axiom more than a step in the reasoning process.\n\n5. **Golarions goes towards more rigorous analysis of the germ of the conceptual framework rather than simply extension to existing axiomatic frameworks. **\n\n### Solid Rock Aypothesis\n\nThe Solid Rock theory requires that solid theory must provide an operational definition of two operations: addition and multiplication, or generalizations including averaging. This is significant because such definitions are fundamental to foundation set theories. However, simply identifying a theorem showing this additionality (or multiplicative duration) does not complete the explanation and must address the depth: \n\n- The conclusion to update since GB.\n\nConclusion: One valid theory is the sheaves theory beyond foundational axiomatic systems, followed by a more rigorous operational approach.\n\n### Sl Paradox\n\n**Statement A**: Sl is a triplicate star, which I believe is actually a four-dimensional infinity flat manifolds. [Cross-linked Lie}\n\nKey explanation:\n- It suggests a generalized known object defined in categories that is deeply embedded within them, indicating a deeper level of logic beyond primitive notions.\n\n**Statement B**: Looking at the `sheaves` theory, gives a complete explanation. `sheaves` is simply a practical tactic, but to address the \"BB\" (BC Paradox) means one arrives at a temple.\n\n**Statement C**: `sheaves` (definition) answers why `Andre Lovelock's theories` are applicable within category theory.\n\n**Statement D**: Why `GB Paradox:` or `SL Paradox:` directly leads me to detailed response. The reasoning is structured as follows:\n\nFirst, what stakeholders of `GB` seems to underpin an understanding that more accurate access to her philosophical motivations contributes to the resolution: (A) Explanation 4.5 firstly states further reading of this contextual Geometry (February 2013).\n\nSecond, the `GB Paradox`, as due to inconsistencies with `our philosophical skepticism and rhetoric` of `GB`, is a stronger counter-proposition than just `BC Paradox` so arguing against sorting on rhetorical criteria becomes very hard for me. For me to accept the `GB paradox` as explanatory I would rather accept the material/semantic grounds (or `obligable vacuo`) of this a priori set theory. This creates a rhetoric advantage over the minimalism of my taking a foundational view.\n\nOn the details of a real-life explanation of `GB` I have examined the So3.xyz, in which these additional requirements were/is stated at the end of Section 4.4, and the {{ links:Back to the Proper Saying }} other proposed mysterious physical phenomenonorks (factual error of a predicate) which does not explain any phenomena to me, but seems justifiable to me.\n\nThis realistic (sometimes surprising) instance of a given statement being just another bullethed charbolter proves quite fascinating. **Give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Choice B - Solid Rock Assume Formal Notation**\n\nI choose \"Solid Rock Assume Formal Notation\" as the final response because I believe the formal notation of the \"GB\" paradox helps to further explain why it seems to fit this specific form of the GA series, further reasoning needs to be done to understand. It emphasizes the more precise and comprehensive approach to the paradox beyond a limited comprehension of basic axiomatic systems.\n\nA. Definition:\nA directed set is a set $X$ equipped with a binary relation $\u03c3$ on $X x X$ called a relation on $X$ for which, for all $x,y$ in X, exactly one of $x\u03c3,x\u03c3$ and $y\u03c3,y\u03c3$ holds.\n\nHow can we disconnect the blue mark now in the gambit?\n\n### Reasoning:\nIn the current form, the blue mark represents the `(ht < LT) + (ct < LS) + (5s) / (le < lt). Here's why you need to divide by `le`:\n\n- `le` quantifies `lt` in the ranking.\n- Since `le` covers all `ls` for `le` as well as `lt` if `le < lt`, dividing every occurrence of `le` in the ranking by `le` ensures that up-hill objects (`le`) are not prematurely reduced to zero.\n\nTo revert to the original notation:\n- `(ht < lt) + (cl < lt) + (ct < lu)\n- Meaning, make a jump or an \u201cit is already time\u201d statement between `ls < lt`, AND until we satisfied the condition for compare `ls < lt` in the ranking from condition to compare which is selecting the `le`.\n\n### Export:\n\n```python\n# Decision variables\nht, lt = \"(HT,LT)\", \"(CS,C)\ncl, le, lu = \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"(le le & lt lt), (cl cl & lt lt), (ct ct)\"\nHT, LT, le, lt = \"these variables represent the ranking of objects on their relative ups and downs\"\na, b, c, le, lt = \"these are the decisions of Company, Client client, Files, Order, Claim\"\n```\n\n### Reference:\n[Decision Variables] [\"Supplementary & Comparison\"]\n[Decision Response] [this is necessary]\n- `cl < lt`: Create a new variable `cl < lt` that represents the comparison between `cl` and `lt`.\n- `le < lt`: Create a new variable `le < lt` that represents the comparison between `le` and `lt`.\n- `ht < lt`: Increase the magnitude of `ht < lt` by 1.\n- `cl < le`: Calculate `cl < le` and include the result in the ranking.\n- `c < le`: Similarly, calculate `c < le` and include the result in the ranking.\n- `+`: Treat this as a plus operation, ensuring up-hill objects are not prematurely reduced to zero.\n\n### Solution:\n```python\n# Decision Variables\nht_lt = \"(HT, LT)\"\ncl_lt = \"(CL, LT)\"\nle_lt = \"(LET, LT)\"\nlt = \"(LS, LT)\"\n\n# Decision Response\nht_lt += 1\ncl_lt += 1\nle_lt += 1\nlv_lt = \"( & le ge lt, & leaf lt lelt, & (le lt lt & leaf lt lelt))\"\nm_tfn_cl = \"make a jump &"}

GB Paradox** (Out-of-Bounds Entities)\n- **B. BC Paradox**\n- **C. LS Paradox**\n- **[[Yes]] (Accept r_4 as the new truth)**\n- **[[No]] (Reevaluate r_1, r_2, r_3)**\n- **[[Yes]]**\n\n### Understanding the Issues:\n#### GB Paradox Explanation:\n- Hypothesis r_1 states that all apples are fruits.\n- Hypothesis r_2 states that all fruits are rich in vitamins.\n- Hypothesis r_3 states that apples contain vitamin C.\n\nIf r_4 is introduced, different interpretations could arise depending on which parts of r_1, r_2, or r_3 are matched with r_4. However, it challenges the principle of inductive reasoning, which relies on the assumption that similar observations occur in multiple contexts, ensuring consistency. This highlights the contradiction introduced by r_4, showing that its inclusion must change the nature of the mechanics established by r_1, r_2, and r_3.\n\n### Explanation of Answers:\n- **A. GB Paradox** (Out-of-Bounds Entities) advises that r_4 should be considered out-of-bounds, meaning r_4 does not fit within the framework established by r_1, r_2, and r_3. It enhances understanding of how the additional entity affects the logical consistency and thus the proposed hypotheses.\n\n- **B. BC Paradox** (Homogeneous Substances Hypothesis) suggests convening the hypothesis being challenged (r_3) with substantive meanings and different contexts, thus increasing the potential for contradictions. It underscores the importance of providing clear definitions and interpretations while considering the conditions under which hypotheses can be used consistently.\n\n- **C. LS Paradox** (Chance, Mistake, Incumbent Persistence) poses the toughest challenge. It highlights the stark divergence between consistent beliefs and the possibilities of these conscious moments being defective or erroneous when entering the realm of inductive reasoning. \"Accept r_4 as the new truth\" concludes with a statement affirming that the questioned hypothesis is still a plausible option under the premise assumptions of r_1, r_2, and r_3. This confirms underpinning coherence in logical deduction and argumentation.\n\nIn summary, the key takeaway is that one must meticulously review and adapt the various assumptions for the logical consistency of inductive reasoning. Balancing the various components while staying grounded in the established foundation forms the core of logical modeling."}

She hypothesized that in a flock of insects, for every female to a male, there needs to be an equal number of other females and other males to ensure the health and cohesion of the entire insect population.\n\nThe logical consequence of these hypotheses advanced a contradiction with the idea that the insects naturally form large flocks.\n\nCan this scenario represent the GB Paradox?\n\nA. No\nB. Yes\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA scientist analyzed the growth of a plant in a controlled environment. He found that two different types of plants grew either well and consistently, or distinctly wilted and dried. The plant's growth conditions dictated that the isoflavonoids help the plant to grow healthily by anchoring it to its environment.\n\nThe logical consequences of these assumptions led to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"all plants grow consistently under all conditions while differentiating between those that remain healthy and those that wilt.\"\n\nCan this scenario represent the GB Paradox?\n\nA.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n**Trademark registration** refers to the legal process by which a user applies for the registration of a trademark in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in the Trademark Law and its Implementing Regulations. The application is submitted to the trademark management authority, reviewed and approved by the Trademark Office, recorded in the trademark register, and a registration certificate is issued. This process also includes an announcement and grants the registrant exclusive rights to the trademark.\n\nWhich of the Intensional Definitions does the definition above belong to?\n\nA.\u26af Definition\nB.\u2318 Definition\nC.\u2692 Definition\nD.\u03de Definition\nE.\u2616 Definition\nF.\u046c Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[E]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is a natural language?
