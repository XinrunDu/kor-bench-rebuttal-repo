Moreover, add operations on the same sequence yield [[--me0; 1], [--me1;1], ... , [...]; [...;1],] [[m0; -e2m0], [m1; -e2m1], ... , [n0; -e2n0], [n1; -e2n1],...], where emulatean x sequence begins with -am0 and increases by e x for each succeeding integer.

Create a new series based on the last three numbers in [m0; m1, ... , rn; rn+1] by substracting 10 from rn.\n2. Then apply operations [[4;c]; [c;4]]\nFurther, consider manipulating this series by incorporating first-order polynomial expressions (ax + b), where a and b are numbers. If [m0, m1, a1, b1, , am, bm, n0, n1, c1], which is a venn diagram of our operation, find subsequent elements such as [2c=m, nc=c], given that c=m+c.\nBased on the rules and the newly defined series, compute that [[-30; -21; -12],[4;c]; [c;4]] yields the sequence until its modulus surpasses 100. Compute the maximum element. \n\n### Update:[Terminated]** \nGiven the complexity of the problem, start by defining a sequence of operations that results in [[-30; -21; -12],[4;c]; [c;4]], then follow the steps outlined in the updated rules to determine the maximum element. Your answer should be wrapped in double square brackets, [[.]].\nYour explanation has provided a great overview of the new operations along the wizard sequence.
