Each proposition (p1, p2, p3) can be either true (\u2713) or false (x). We will evaluate each formula accordingly.\n\n### Evaluating Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\nLet's consider all combinations of truth values for p1, p2, and p3:\n- If p1, p2, and p3 are all true (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713), then p1&p2&~p3 evaluates to x since ~p3 becomes false. Hence, ~(p1&p2&~p3) = ~(\u2713&\u2713&x) = ~(x) = \u2713.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713) and only p2 is false (x|\u2713|\u2713), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- If p1 is true (\u2713) and p2 is false (x|\u2713|\u2713), and p3 is false (\u2713|x|x), then p1&p2&~p3 is false, so the formula evaluates to true.\n- ... and so on for all combinations.\n\nThe truth table systematically covering all cases will show that the only time the formula evaluates to false (x) is when p1, p2 are true, and p3 is false (\u2713|\u2713|x). For all other combinations, ~(p1&p2&~p3) is true.\n\nThus, T: (All combinations except \u2713|\u2713|x) and F: (\u2713|\u2713|x).\n\n### Evaluating Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to identify when the left side (~p1&p2) implies the right side (p1=p3).\n- If ~p1&p2 is false (\u2713|x or x|x), regardless of the value of p1=p3, the entire formula is true.\n- If ~p1&p2 is true (\u2713), then p1 must be false and p2 must be true. For (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) to be false, p1 must equal p3, which in this case means p2 must equate (false=\u2713, a contradiction).\n\nThus, the formula (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) evaluates to false (x) only when p1 and p3 are both true (\u2713) and p2 is true (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713).\n\nHence, T: (All cases except \u2713|\u2713|\u2713) and F: (\u2713|\u2713|\u2713).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe truth values and falsity values of the given formulas are as follows:\n\n- For formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n  - [[T:\u2713|x|x, x|x|\u2713, x|\u2713|\u2713, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|\u2713|x, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713]; [F:\u2713|\u2713|x]]\n- For formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n  - [[T:x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, \u2713|x|x, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|x|\u2713, x|\u2713|\u2713]; [F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\nPutting this in the specified format, the answer is:\n\n[[T:\u2713|x|x,x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713,x|\u2713|x,\u2713|\u2713|x,x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713,\u2713|x|x,x|\u2713|x,\u2713|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713];[F:\u2713|\u2713|x;F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]"}

So, what would the statements of First person, Second person, and Third person be represented as?\nAnswers are formatted as [[ ];[ ];[ ]]. Each bracketed section should contain the corresponding logical expression for each individual statement.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To represent the statements of the first, second, and third persons according to the given propositions (p for Suzhou, q for Shanghai, and r for Hangzhou), we can symbolize each statement according to the logic symbols provided.\n\n1. First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!p & q`.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & p`.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - Since exactly one among `p, q, r` is true, and according to the statement the person is claiming that it is neither `q` nor `r` (Shanghai nor Hangzhou). Therefore, this is falsely claiming that Professor Wang is from Suzhou because exactly one of the propositions is true, not both `q` and `r` being false.\n   - Symbolically, this is represented as `!q & !r`.\n\nHowever, the third statement is tricky because it involves the condition that exactly one of `p, q, r` is true. Hence, a fuller consideration of the third statement in the context of one of them being true will convert to `p | r`, thus `p` stands for the correct place if `q` and `r` are false. Thus, symbolization in terms of the professor's exact position being considered true would be the complete truth condition, considering `p | q | r` with exactly one being true - so the negative (`!q & !r`) portion simplifies to `p`, given the unique true proposition.\n\nGiven that the third statement actually negates possibilities of `q` and `r` being true, the symbolic representation for the third statement that one is true fits correctly if directly considered.\n\nThus, the final representation should be adjusted to properly reflect the truth constraint condition:\n\n1. First person: `!p & q`.\n2. Second person: `!q & p`.\n3.

Using the given propositions as well as the correct representations, we can derive the expressions for which each individual's claims could correspond to getting everything right, half right, or everything wrong. \n\nGiven p, q, and r, we know that one of the following must be true: p or q or r, but only one of these at any given time must be true. From the statements made, let's define the logical expressions for Person B and Person C based on their statements:\n\nPerson B: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely correct':\n- C1 would mean that all of B's statements (p & !q) are true, implying Professor Wang is from Suzhou and not from Shanghai. \n- C1 ::=:: p & !q\n\nFor Person B getting it 'partially correct':\n- C2 would mean that either A part of B's statement is true and the other part is false. However, since the given rule for partial correctness rather defines a complete lie or truth but not a mix, where only a part is correct, we redefine this context as: at least one of (p & q) or (!p & !q) but not both. \n- C2 ::=:: (p & !q) | (!p & q)\n\nFor Person B getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- C3 would mean that both of B's statements (p & !q) are false.\n- C3 ::=:: !p | q\n\nWe can apply a similar logic sequence to establish Person C's statements:\n\nPerson C: !q & !r\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely correct':\n- D1 would mean that all of C's statements (!q & !r) are true, implying Professor Wang is not from Shanghai and not from Hangzhou.\n- D1 ::=:: !q & !r & p (since only p is true)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'partially correct':\n- D2 would be derived from the fact that Professor Wang is neither from q nor from r, but we need to ensure that if one part is true, the other parts are wrong.\n- D2 ::=:: (!q & r) | (q & !r)\n\nFor Person C getting it 'entirely incorrect':\n- D3 would mean that both of C's statements are false.\n- D3 ::=:: q | r\n\nThus, combining all these definitions as per the required format, the final logical expressions become:\n\n[[C1=p&!q];[C2=(p&!q)|(!p&q)];[C3=!p|q];[D1=!q&!r&p];[D2=(!q&r)|(q&!r)];[D3=q|r]]\n\nThis representation adheres to the given rules of logical equivalences, ensuring the statements can be correctly evaluated according to the judgments made by Professor Wang."}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired disjunctive terms:...];[denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To address the problem, let's begin by analyzing the given conjunction of disjunctive forms: \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\). We aim to identify the paired disjunctive terms and their representation according to the defined rules.\n\n1. **Identifying the Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - For \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment matches the binary 111 (hexadecimal 7), which does not directly correspond to a specific paired disjunctive term \\(M7\\). However, this is part of our conjunction, so we focus on the entire disjunction's impacting truth assignments, guided by the conjunction with \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\).\n    - For \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), the satisfying assignment mirrors the binary 101 (hexadecimal 5), leading to the term \\(M5\\).\n\n2. **Conjunction Analysis:**\n    - The conjunction of two disjunctions essentially means that the overall disjunction must satisfy the conditions of both disjunctions simultaneously. Given that both disjunctive forms have \\(r\\) as a constant variable, ensuring \\(r=1\\) is vital to satisfy the structure of each individual disjunct.\n    - The logical implication reduces our focus to the arrangement satisfying both cases, hence considering truth assignments aligning r=1.\n    - Truth assignments satisfying \\((p \\vee \\neg q)\\wedge(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\) would yield the stable falsification intrinsic with \\(\\neg q\\) as a common link. Therefore, the fixed \\(r=1\\) and critical point is in \\(p, q\\), yielding the necessary term thorough specifically encompassing disjunctive falsification in combined leverage.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant falsifying assignment combining all constraints mainly concluding the essential truth adjusted alignment:\n- Focus on \\(\\neg q \\wedge r=1\\) determining primary falsifying boundaries for logic effective: \\(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q\\) simplifies likely to primary falsifying \\(5,7\\).\n\n3. **Paired Disjunctive Terms:**\n    - The falsifying set through logical impact of \\(p, q\\) in conjunction core \\(M5, M7\\) remains significant.\n\n4. **Denotation:**\n    - Application of the notation rules, the principal disjunctive normal form incorporating the combined falsifying term ultimately matches such indications precisely:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5 + M7]] \\]\n\nHence, summarizing, we denote the expression as:\n\\[ [[paired disjunctive terms: M5, M7]; [denoted: M5, M7]] \\]"}

Since the format requires the use of 0-ary predicates, we treat 2 and 4 as specific instances that do not apply in a general sense through individual variables x and directly state their properties.\n\n(1) Since 2 is the only prime number in this context, we should somehow express that any entity x which is a prime (F(x)) is actually 2 (interpreted as a specific condition for 0-ary predicates). However, in order to adhere strictly to the instruction and using 0-ary predicates directly, we can symbolize F(2) as \"2 is a prime number\" and \u223cF(4) as \"4 is not a prime number\" (since 4 being a composite number implies it is not prime). Given that the format asks for 0-ary predicates, we also need to explicitly address 4 as composite:\n\nF(2) and \u223cF(4)\n\nSince the format specifically asks for the use of 0-ary predicates for each statement without involving variables directly for the final representation, we will omit generic quantifier representation here and represent each property directly for 2 and 4.\n\nFor the second part of the question, where we symbolize \"If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6\" using the binary predicate G(x, y): x > y, we can directly apply the provided predicate to 0-ary values:\n\n(2) We directly use G(5, 4) to represent \"5 is greater than 4\" and G(4, 6) to denote \"4 is greater than 6\". According to logical connectives, we can express the implication \"if G(5, 4) then G(4, 6)\" as below:\n\nG(5, 4) \u21d2 G(4, 6)\n\nCombining both parts into the requested format:\n\n[[F(2);\u223cF(4)];[G(5, 4) \u21d2 G(4, 6)]]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n[[F(2);\u223cF(4)];[G(5, 4) \u21d2 G(4, 6)]]"}

We use the negation of H(x, y) which is \u223cH(x, y) and express the statement with an existential quantifier for both x and y:\n\\[ ExEy(G(x) & G(y) & \u223cH(x, y)) \\]\n\n(3) For the proposition stating that some trains are faster than all cars, we define:\n- F(x): x is a train,\n- G(y): y is a car,\n- H(x, y): x is faster than y.\nThe proposition implies an existence of a particular x that satisfies being a train and for any y being a car, H(x, y) holds true:\n\\[ Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))) \\]\n\nThus, the symbolized format for each of the propositions will be:\n\n\\[ [AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x, y)); ExEy(G(x) & G(y) & \u223cH(x, y)); Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))]; \\]\n\nSo the formatted answer for the logical symbolization is:\n[[AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x, y)); ExEy(G(x) & G(y) & \u223cH(x, y)); Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))]];"}

Based on the normative reasoning formulas provided, formula (3) \u00a7p\u2190\u2192\u00ac\u203e!p captures the biconditional relationship between being allowed and not being prohibited, which directly corresponds to the given statement. Since the statement works in both directions (from being allowed to not being prohibited, and vice versa), this corresponds to the biconditional nature captured by formula (10) \u203dp\u2192\u00a7\u00acp when appropriately inverted and interpreted, leading us to conclude that the relationship follows formula (10) directly when reinterpreted as the inverse formulation, but primarily matches the bidirectional reasoning as governed by formula (3) in its core logic. However, since the question specifically asks which given formula it corresponds to directly and based on the provided list, the closest and most direct match for the bidirectional relationship described is captured in the structure of (10).

According to reasoning formula 5:\n\n(5) Ap \u2192 \u00acA\u00acp\n\nThis formula tells us that if \"Ap\" (Mr Chen has always worked diligently in the past) is true, then \"A\u00acp\" (Mr Chen has not worked diligently at some point in the past) cannot be true. Thus, the statement should be equivalent to saying that it is not the case that Mr Chen has not worked diligently at some point in the past.\n\nHence, the correct answer is [[A]], as it corresponds to \"It is not that Mr Chan has not been working seriously in the past.\""}

The straightforward nature of the original statement and its inference doesn't directly suggest complex or marked expression use.\n\nBased on the provided principles and given sentence, this seems not to conform directly to any of the principles as specified in a clear manner. However, the question appears to expect a categorization. Given that the minimalization criterion could suggest a slight relationship with C% due to the statement involving the minimal information \"the beer is warm,\" but ultimately expanding the definition of what \"food\" is, the closest alignment would be with the principle that aims for clarity and relevancy of information conveyed rather than a direct inference jump. \n\nStill, considering options and the alignment that could loosely frame the minimal informativity of the statement, the answer should be considered in terms of the closest logical fit within provided constraints.
