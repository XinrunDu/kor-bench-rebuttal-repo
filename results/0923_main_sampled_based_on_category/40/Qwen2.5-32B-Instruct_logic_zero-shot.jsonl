Thus, the initial equivalence is not valid according to our basic equivalences.\n\n### Sub-question 2: !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\n\nFirstly, `!(p=q)` using rules provided equates to `!( (p>q) & (q>p) )` or `!( (!p|q) & (!q|p) )`.\n- Using De Morgan's law (Rule 6), this becomes `!(!p|q) | !( !q|p )`, or `p&!q | q&!p`.\n\nNow, consider the right side, `(p|q)&!(p&q)`:\n- This part has truth conditions that disallow both `p&q` being true simultaneously but allows for either to individually be true.\n\nComparing these,\n- `p&!q | q&!p` means `p` holds without `q` or `q` holds without `p`.\n- `(p|q)&!(p&q)` means either `p` or `q`, but not both.\n\nThus, these are logically equivalent, correctly reflecting the scenario where neither proposition can imply the other while being true independently.\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[[B];[A]]"}

Similarly, for \u00acp^q^r to be true, again p must be false and r must be true. Thus, the simplified expression highlights that p needs to be false and r needs to be true for the overall expression to be true, irrespective of the value of q.\n\nLet's represent the true assignment for \u00acp^\u00acq^r:\n- If p is false (binary value = 0), q can be false or true (binary value = 0 or 1), and r must be true (binary value = 1).\n\nThe true assignments that satisfy the given expression are:\n1.

This means there is at least one true assignment which corresponds to 0000 in binary or 0 in hexadecimal (indicating that all variables and their negations are false, which is the assignment \\(m_0\\)).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even formula if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. For 4 propositional variables, the indices go from 0 to 15 in hexadecimal (binary 0000 to 1111). The even indices in hexadecimal for 4 variables would be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. That is, the binary representations corresponding to these hexadecimal numbers are:\n   - 0 (0000)\n   - 2 (0010)\n   - 4 (0100)\n   - 6 (0110)\n   - 8 (1000)\n   - A (1010)\n   - C (1100)\n   - E (1110)\n\nSince a basic form must include \\(m_0\\) (binary 0000, hexadecimal 0), and for it to also be an all-even form, we must include 0000 and can include any combination of the remaining even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14).\n\nThe question is how many combinations of the remaining 7 even indices (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) we can have along with 0. This is simply the number of subsets of a set with 7 elements (including the empty subset, which corresponds to only having \\(m_0\\)).\n\nThe number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, for 7 elements, we have \\(2^7 = 128\\) subsets.\n\nThus, the answer to the question of how many formulas satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form is:\n\n[[128]]"}

Let's analyze the components:\n\n1. The entity set E has been defined as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. The assignment of the constant `a` is `a\u2032 = 0`.\n3. In the given formula, `g` is an `n-ary` (in this case, binary) function symbol, which means it is replaced with its implementation `g\ud835\udc3d(x, y) = x * y`.\n4. `F` is an `n-ary` predicate symbol (in this case, binary). It is replaced with `F\ud835\udc3d` which is defined as equality, `x = y`.\n\nFollowing these rules, we replace the formula components accordingly:\n\n- Replace `a` with its assignment `a\u2032 = 0`.\n- Replace `g` with its implementation `g\ud835\udc3d`, yielding `g\ud835\udc3d(x, 0) = x * 0`.\n- Replace `F` with its implementation `F\ud835\udc3d`, giving us `F\ud835\udc3d(x * 0, x) = x * 0 = x`.\n\nTherefore, the implementation of the formula \u2200xF(g(x,a),x) under \ud835\udc3d will be the statement that for all natural numbers x, `x * 0 = x` holds true. Implementing the formula given the rules yields:\n\n[[(\u2200x)F(x*0, x)]] or more explicitly noting the interpretation, [[(\u2200x \u2208 N)(x * 0 = x)]].\n\nHowever, since the specific symbols `[[(\u2200x)F(x * 0, x)]]` directly follow from the rules of how to replace the entities within the formula, this format is better suited to directly align with the logical transformation:\n\n[[\u2200x(x * 0 = x)]]"}

If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\nIn this context, if \"No individual businesses paid taxes\" (SEP) is true, then \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes\" (SIP) must be false. Conversely, if \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes\" (SIP) is false, then \"No individual businesses paid taxes\" (SEP) must be true.\n\nThus, the relationship between Inspector A and Inspector C's statements is a % relation.\n\n### Answer:\n[[%]]"}

Given limitations and adhering as closely as possible, one could argue for symbolizing each part separately, but if it needs to stay within a single expression as per the format hint, we can offer the representation for just one of the aspects (evidently the format is possibly misaligned with accommodating multiple variables into a single slot as implied). \n\nFor a direct answer under the format constraint and taking p as an example:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"]]\n\nHowever, to adequately represent all parts:\n[[\"p\", \"\u203dp\"], [\"q\", \"\u203dq\"], [\"r\", \"\u203dr\"]]\n\nThis approach represents each part of the prohibition separately since the format hint is not specific on how to integrate multiple prohibitions into a single slot adhering to custom defined logic rules."}

However, this relationship does not stipulate any constraints that both propositions cannot be true, cannot be false, or must necessarily be in any exclusive state relative to truth or falsity as all four relationships imply differently. Since there is no inherent restriction on the possible truth values listed in the definitions of the * and x relationships, and it does not strictly necessitate that at least one of them must be true as per the @ relationship, it stands that the only defined relationship in our rule set that allows for both propositions to potentially be true and false is the % relationship.\n\nThus, the correct answer is [[D]]."}

Since the question states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4, this aligns with the notion of common belief. The option that most closely aligns with this is \"Alice and Bob both know that 2 plus 2 equals 4,\" but the key point is their belief, not necessarily their knowledge.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

The key findings are based on observations of radioactivity, whether uranium is present or absent, leading to the identification of another source of radioactivity.\n\nGiven the logic rules:\n\n- Method \u2e2e describes finding a potential causal relationship S and P when other conditions vary, but S and P remain consistently together. This does not outright fit our scenario as the main focus is on the radioactivity present even after uranium is absent.\n- Method \u0606 fits very closely - the radioactivity (P) occurs both when uranium (S) is present and does not occur as expected when uranium (S) is absent, leading to the identification of a different substance causing the radioactivity. This method describes a situation where the presence or absence of S (in this case, uranium) influences P (radioactivity) in a way that suggests a causal relationship.\n- Method \ua66e involves the same conditions as method \u0606 but also adds to it by considering both positive and negative cases, which isn't explicitly detailed in the passage.\n- Method \u2d63 would describe a situation where changes in S correlate with changes in P. This does not fit, as the passage does not describe varying levels or types of uranium linked to varying levels of radioactivity.\n- Method \u2698 involves causal relationships between multiple elements, which isn't depicted in the story.\n\nThe most appropriate method from the given logic rule for the causal reasoning described in the passage is Method \u0606. \n\n[[B]]"}

GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The logical expression given is (p \u2192 q) \u2227 (\u00acp \u2192 q), which translates to \"if p then q and if not p then q\". This means that regardless of whether p is true or false, q must be true. This scenario does not directly align with the definitions and rules of the BC Paradox or the LS Paradox, as they involve different logical structures and the conditions of their paradoxes do not match the given expression directly.\n\nHowever, comparing this with the GB Paradox, we see a parallel in using the same observation (in this case, q being true regardless of p's status) to draw the conclusion that q holds true. This can reflect a situation similar to the GB Paradox where the same outcome (q being true) can be derived from different conditions (p\u771f\u5047\u4e0d\u4e00\u7684\u60c5\u51b5), thus reflecting a situation where conclusions may appear to contradict each other from different viewpoints, even though they lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to the provided logical expression is the **GB Paradox** as it can illustrate a situation where the same conclusion (q being true) is approached from two different premises and can present complexity in conclusively favoring one form of inductive reasoning over another if not appropriately distinguished.\n\n[[A]]"}

This is because the minimal necessary information understood from the statement by the hearer includes the existence of doors on the car.

The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]]\n\nThe provided definition of \"Internet\" mainly reports the existing usage and the combination of transliteration and translation of the term, fitting the characteristics of the \u2135 Definition, which describes or reports the existing usage of the defined word."}

An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nConsidering the domain of individuals as natural numbers and R representing the \"less than\" relationship, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) states that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number. However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number. Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
