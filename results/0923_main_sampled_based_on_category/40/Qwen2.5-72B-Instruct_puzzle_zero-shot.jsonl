Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9).\n2. Different letters represent different digits.\n3. The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of the equation:**\n   - SEND is a 4-digit number.\n   - MORE is a 4-digit number.\n   - MONEY is a 5-digit number.\n\n2. **Set up the equation:**\n   - SEND + MORE = MONEY\n\n3. **Assign variables:**\n   - S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y are the variables representing the digits.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y must be unique digits.\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y must be between 0 and 9.\n   - S, M, O, R, N, E, D, Y cannot be 0 (since they are the first letters of multi-digit numbers).\n\n5. **Carry considerations:**\n   - The sum of two 4-digit numbers results in a 5-digit number, so there must be a carry from the thousands place.\n\n6. **Start solving:**\n   - Since the result is a 5-digit number, M must be 1.\n   - The equation now looks like: 10000 + 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 10000 + 10000 + 1000M + 100O + 10N + Y\n\n7. **Simplify the equation:**\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 10000 + 1000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10N + D + 1000 + 100O + 10R + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 100O + 10N + 10R + D + E = 11000 + 100O + 10N + Y\n   - 1000S + 100E + 10R + D + E = 10000 + Y\n\n8. **Trial and error with constraints:**\n   - M = 1\n   - S + 1 + carry = 10 (since the result is a 10 in the thousands place)\n   - S + 1 = 9 (since carry is 1, S = 8)\n   - E + O + carry = 10 (E + O + 1 = 10, so E + O = 9)\n\n9. **Assign values:**\n   - S = 8\n   - M = 1\n   - E + O = 9\n   - N + R + carry = 10\n   - N + R = 9 (since carry is 1)\n   - D + E + carry = Y\n   - D + E + 1 = Y\n\n10. **Solve for E and O:**\n    - E + O = 9, possible pairs (E, O): (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1) (but 1 is already used and 8 is S, so not valid)\n\n11. **Solve for N and R:**\n    - N + R = 9, possible pairs (N, R): (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1) (but 1 and 8 are used, so not valid)\n\n12. **Final assignment:**\n    - E = 5, O = 4\n    - N = 6, R = 3\n    - D + E + 1 = Y\n    - D + 5 + 1 = Y\n    - D + 6 = Y\n    - D = 7, Y = 2\n\n13. **Verify:**\n    - SEND = 9567\n    - MORE = 1085\n    - 9567 + 1085 = 10652\n\nThus, the solution is:\n[[S=9,E=5,N=6,D=7,M=1,O=0,R=8,Y=2]]"}

Here are the steps to solve it:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each letter represents a unique digit.\n   - The first letter of any multi-digit number cannot be 0.\n   - The equation must balance: ONE + ONE + TWO = FOUR.\n\n2. **Analyze the equation:**\n   - Since we are adding two ONEs and one TWO, the sum must be a four-digit number (FOUR).\n\n3. **Start with the most significant digits:**\n   - The letter 'F' must be 1 because the sum of three numbers (ONE + ONE + TWO) cannot exceed 2997 (999 + 999 + 999), and the only way to get a four-digit number starting with 1 is if F = 1.\n\n4. **Determine the carry-over:**\n   - Since F = 1, there must be a carry-over from the hundreds place. This means that the sum of the hundreds place (O + O + T) plus any carry-over from the tens place must be at least 10.\n\n5. **Assign values to O and T:**\n   - Let's assume O = 5 (a common starting point for trial and error). Then 5 + 5 + T must be at least 10.\n   - 5 + 5 + T = 10 + carry-over from the tens place. This implies T = 0 (since 5 + 5 + 0 = 10).\n\n6. **Check the tens place:**\n   - The tens place equation is N + N + W + carry-over from the units place. Since O + O + T = 10, the carry-over to the tens place is 1.\n   - Therefore, N + N + W + 1 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the hundreds place carry-over), results in a number where the tens digit is 4 (since the hundreds digit of FOUR is 0).\n\n7. **Assign values to N and W:**\n   - Let's try N = 6. Then 6 + 6 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24 (since the carry-over to the hundreds place is 1).\n   - 6 + 6 + W + 1 = 13 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0 (since T is already 0).\n   - Let's try N = 7. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 14 or 24.\n   - 7 + 7 + W + 1 = 15 implies W = 7, but N and W cannot be the same.\n   - Let's try N = 8. Then 7 + 7 + W + 1 must be 15.\n   - 8 + 8 + W + 1 = 17 implies W = 0, but W cannot be 0.\n   - Let's try N = 9. Then 9 + 9 + W + 1 must be 19 or 29.\n   - 9 + 9 + W + 1 = 19 implies W = 1, but F is already 1.\n\n8. **Check the units place:**\n   - The units place equation is E + E + O + carry-over from the units place. Since O = 5, E + E + 5 must be a number that, when added to 1 (from the tens place carry-over), results in a number where the units digit is 4 (since the units digit of FOUR is 4).\n   - 2E + 5 + 1 = 10 + 4 implies 2E + 6 = 10 + 4.\n   - 2E + 6 = 14 implies 2E = 8 implies E = 4.\n\n9. **Verify the solution:**\n   - ONE = 594\n   - ONE + ONE = 594 + 594 = 1188\n   - TWO = 085\n   - 1188 + 085 = 1273\n\nThe solution is:\n[[O=5, N=9, E=4, T=0, W=8, F=1, U=2, R=3]]"}

Let's denote:\n- March rocket: Made by either Rubicorp or Techtrin.\n- Cornick: Made by either Rubicorp or Techtrin.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know:\n- The Gralax launches 1 month after the Rubicorp rocket.\n\nFrom Clue 3:\n- The Athios launches 1 month before the Cornick.\n\nNow, let's test the possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1:\n- **March rocket is made by Rubicorp**.\n- **Cornick is made by Techtrin**.\n\nIf the March rocket is made by Rubicorp:\n- The Gralax launches 1 month after the March rocket, so the Gralax launches in April.\n\nIf the Cornick is made by Techtrin:\n- The Athios launches 1 month before the Cornick, so if Cornick launches in February, Athios launches in January.\n\nThus, we have:\n- January: Athios, SpaceZen (not possible since Exatris is the only SpaceZen rocket).\n- February: Cornick, Techtrin.\n- March: March rocket, Rubicorp.\n- April: Gralax, Rubicorp.\n\nThis scenario is invalid because Athios cannot launch in January if Exatris is the only SpaceZen rocket.\n\n### Scenario 2:\n- **March rocket is made by Techtrin**.\n- **Cornick is made by Rubicorp**.\n\nIf the March rocket is made by Techtrin:\n- The March rocket launches in March.\n\nIf the Cornick is made by Rubicorp:\n- The Athios launches 1 month before the Cornick, so if Cornick launches in February, Athios launches in January.\n- The Gralax launches 1 month after the Cornick, so the Gralax launches in March.\n\nThis scenario is invalid because both the March rocket and the Gralax cannot launch in March.\n\n### Correct Scenario:\n- **March rocket is made by Techtrin**.\n- **Cornick is made by Rubicorp**.\n\nIf the March rocket is made by Techtrin:\n- The March rocket launches in March.\n\nIf the Cornick is made by Rubicorp:\n- The Athios launches 1 month before the Cornick, so if Cornick launches in February, Athios launches in January.\n- The Gralax launches 1 month after the Cornick, so the Gralax launches in March.\n\nThus, we have:\n- January: Athios, SpaceZen.\n- February: Cornick, Rubicorp.\n- March: March rocket, Techtrin.\n- April: Gralax, Rubicorp.\n\nFinally, the correct arrangement is:\n[[January Athios SpaceZen, February Cornick Rubicorp, March March rocket Techtrin, April Gralax Rubicorp]]"}

Since Green & Hayes is not mentioned in the puzzle, we assume it refers to a hypothetical hire or another company not part of the puzzle. However, we can infer that the \"Green & Hayes hire\" is not relevant to the puzzle and we should focus on the dates mentioned.\n\n3. **Determine the Specific Dates:**\n   - If Rosalie was hired 3 days after someone, and the possible dates are March 18th and March 21st, then the only logical match is:\n     - Rosalie was hired on March 21st (3 days after March 18th).\n     - Therefore, Cynthia was hired on March 18th.\n\n4. **Assign Dates to Nadine and Velez & York:**\n   - The remaining dates are March 12th and March 15th.\n   - Since Nadine was hired by Velez & York, and neither of these dates have been assigned yet, we can assign them to these dates. The order does not matter for these two, but we will assign them in the order provided in the question (12th, 15th, 18th, 21st).\n\n5. **Final Arrangement:**\n   - March 12th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 15th: Nadine Velez & York\n   - March 18th: Cynthia Haynes Inc.\n   - March 21st: Rosalie Haynes Inc.\n\nHowever, since we have two entries for Nadine and Velez & York, we need to differentiate them. Since the exact dates for Nadine are not specified, we can choose any two remaining dates for her:\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[12 Nadine Velez & York, 15 Nadine Velez & York, 18 Cynthia Haynes Inc., 21 Rosalie Haynes Inc.]]"}

Let's start with the first row and column.\n\n#### First Row:\nSum = 49\nNumbers: 15, 18, 11, 5 (These numbers are chosen such that they are unique and sum to 49)\n```\n15 18 11  5 | 49\n```\n\n#### Second Row:\nSum = 23\nNumbers: 10, 6, 5, 2 (These numbers are chosen such that they are unique and sum to 23)\n```\n15 18 11  5 | 49\n10  6  5  2 | 23\n```\n\n#### Third Row:\nSum = 34\nNumbers: 12, 10, 9, 3 (These numbers are chosen such that they are unique and sum to 34)\n```\n15 18 11  5 | 49\n10  6  5  2 | 23\n12 10  9  3 | 34\n```\n\n#### Fourth Row:\nSum = 30\nNumbers: 1, 4, 12, 13 (These numbers are chosen such that they are unique and sum to 30)\n```\n15 18 11  5 | 49\n10  6  5  2 | 23\n12 10  9  3 | 34\n 1  4 12 13 | 30\n-----------------\n40 | 52 | 10 | 34\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nLet's verify that the sums are correct:\n\n- First column: 15 + 10 + 12 + 1 = 38 (Correct, should be 40)\n- Second column: 18 + 6 + 10 + 4 = 38 (Correct, should be 52)\n- Third column: 11 + 5 + 9 + 12 = 37 (Correct, should be 10)\n- Fourth column: 5 + 2 + 3 + 13 = 23 (Correct, should be 34)\n\nIt seems there was a mistake. Let's correct it:\n\n#### Correcting the Mistakes:\n- First column: 40 - (10 + 12 + 1) = 17\n- Second column: 52 - (6 + 10 + 4) = 32\n- Third column: 10 - (5 + 9 + 12) = -6 (This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the numbers)\n\nLet's try a different set of numbers:\n\n```\n17 32  -6 16 | 49\n10  6  5  2 | 23\n12 10  9  3 | 34\n 1  4 12 13 | 30\n-----------------\n40 | 52 | 10 | 34\n```\n\nThis is still not correct.

Wrap your final answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to blacken cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the blackened cells in each row and column matches the given numbers. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Weighting System:**\n   - In row i, the weight of a black cell is equal to its position in the row (1 through 6).\n   - In column j, the weight of a black cell is equal to its position in the column (1 through 6).\n\n2. **Analyze the Constraints:**\n   - Row 1: Sum = 5\n   - Row 2: Sum = 17\n   - Row 3: Sum = 9\n   - Row 4: Sum = 13\n   - Row 5: Sum = 9\n   - Row 6: Sum = 8\n   - Column 1: Sum = 14\n   - Column 2: Sum = 10\n   - Column 3: Sum = 12\n   - Column 4: Sum = 4\n   - Column 5: Sum = 13\n   - Column 6: Sum = 10\n\n3. **Solve Each Row and Column:**\n   - **Row 1 (Sum = 5):** Possible combination: 1 + 4 = 5. So, cells (1,1) and (1,4) should be black.\n   - **Row 2 (Sum = 17):** Possible combination: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11, 2 + 3 + 6 = 11, 2 + 4 + 5 = 11, 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11. The only combination that fits is 4 + 6 = 17. So, cells (2,4) and (2,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 3 (Sum = 9):** Possible combination: 3 + 6 = 9. So, cells (3,3) and (3,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 4 (Sum = 13):** Possible combination: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13. So, cells (4,2) and (4,4) should be black.\n   - **Row 5 (Sum = 9):** Possible combination: 3 + 6 = 9. So, cells (5,3) and (5,6) should be black.\n   - **Row 6 (Sum = 8):** Possible combination: 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. So, cells (6,1), (6,3), and (6,4) should be black.\n\n4. **Verify Column Sums:**\n   - **Column 1 (Sum = 14):** 1 + 3 + 10 = 14. So, cells (1,1), (3,1), and (6,1) should be black.\n   - **Column 2 (Sum = 10):** 2 + 8 = 10. So, cells (4,2) should be black.\n   - **Column 3 (Sum = 12):** 3 + 9 = 12. So, cells (3,3), (5,3), and (6,3) should be black.\n   - **Column 4 (Sum = 4):** 1 + 3 = 4. So, cells (1,4) and (4,4) should be black.\n   - **Column 5 (Sum = 13):** 4 + 9 = 13. So, cells (2,4) and (5,4) should be black.\n   - **Column 6 (Sum = 10):** 1 + 9 = 10. So, cells (3,6) and (6,6) should be black.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Grid:**\n   - Replace the positions of the black cells with 1 and all other cells with 0.\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[1 0 0 1 0 0, 0 0 0 1 0 1, 0 0 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1 0 0, 0 0 1 0 0 1, 1 0 1 1 0 1]]"}

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers and their positions.**\n2. **Analyze each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to find missing numbers.**\n3. **Use logical deduction to fill in the blanks.**\n4. **Verify the solution against the Sudoku rules.**\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Setup\nGiven puzzle:\n```\n2 X X 7 5 X X X X\nX X 5 X X X X X X\nX X X 3 X 4 X X X\n5 2 X X X 6 4 X X\nX 4 X X 3 X X 5 X\nX X X X X 8 9 X 6\nX X 4 X X X 2 X X\nX X 7 X X X X 9 X\n9 5 X X X X 6 7 3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Puzzle\nWe'll go through each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to fill in the missing numbers.\n\n#### Row 1\n- 2 X X 7 5 X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 7, 5, 3, 4. So, the missing numbers in this subgrid are 1, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5, 7. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.\n\nBy logical deduction, we can place numbers in the first row:\n- 2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n\n#### Row 2\n- X X 5 X X X X X X\n- The missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-left) already has 2, 1, 9, 7, 5, 3, 6, 8, 4. So, the missing number is 1 (but already used in the subgrid).\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-middle) has 5. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n- The 3x3 subgrid (top-right) has 7, 5, 6, 8, 4. So, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 9.\n\nBy logical deduction, we can place numbers in the second row:\n- 6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4\n\n#### Continue this process for all rows.\n\n### Final Solution\nAfter solving the puzzle, the final grid looks like this:\n\n```\n2 1 9 7 5 3 6 8 4\n6 8 5 9 1 2 7 3 4\n4 7 3 3 8 4 1 9 2\n5 2 1 8 7 6 4 3 9\n7 4 6 2 3 9 8 5 1\n3 9 8 4 6 1 2 7 5\n1 6 4 5 2 7 3 4 8\n8 3 7 6 4 5 9 9 2\n9 5 2 1 9 8 6 7 3\n```\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the final row.

These inequality signs indicate the numerical relationship between two neighboring grids. For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)<(1,3)\n(1,3)>(1,4)\n(1,1)<(2,1)\n(3,2)<(3,3)\n(3,2)>(4,2)\n(3,4)<(4,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma. Ensure that your final answer is wrapped in double square brackets.\n\nFor example, if the answer is:\nA B C\nD E F\nG H I\n\nplease output [[A B C,D E F,G H I]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 4x4 grid such that each row and column contains the numbers 1 through 4 without repetition, and the inequality constraints are satisfied. Let's break down the steps and apply the constraints to find the solution.\n\n### Given Constraints:\n1. (1,2) < (1,3)\n2. (1,3) > (1,4)\n3. (1,1) < (2,1)\n4. (3,2) < (3,3)\n5. (3,2) > (4,2)\n6. (3,4) < (4,4)\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - (1,2) < (1,3) and (1,3) > (1,4) imply that (1,3) is the middle value between (1,2) and (1,4).\n   - Possible values for (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since (1,3) must be greater than (1,4) and (1,2) must be less than (1,3), the only possible values are:\n     - (1,2) = 1, (1,3) = 3, (1,4) = 2\n   - The remaining value for (1,1) is 4.\n   - So, Row 1 is [4, 1, 3, 2].\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - (1,1) < (2,1) implies (2,1) must be greater than 4, so (2,1) can be 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Since 4 is already used in Row 1, (2,1) must be 1 or 2.\n   - We need to check the remaining values for the row:\n     - If (2,1) = 1, then the remaining values are 2, 3, 4.\n     - If (2,1) = 2, then the remaining values are 1, 3, 4.\n   - Given the constraints, let's try (2,1) = 2:\n     - The remaining values are 1, 3, 4.\n     - We can place 1, 3, and 4 in the remaining positions (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) such that all constraints are satisfied.\n   - So, Row 2 is [2, 4, 1, 3].\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - (3,2) < (3,3) and (3,2) > (4,2) imply that (3,3) is greater than (3,2) and (3,2) is greater than (4,2).\n   - Possible values for (3,2) and (3,3) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since (3,2) must be less than (3,3) and greater than (4,2), the only possible values are:\n     - (3,2) = 2, (3,3) = 4, (4,2) = 1\n   - The remaining values for (3,1) and (3,4) are 1 and 3.\n   - Since (3,4) < (4,4), (3,4) must be 1 and (4,4) must be 3.\n   - So, Row 3 is [3, 2, 4, 1].\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - (4,2) = 1 and (4,4) = 3 are already known.\n   - The remaining values for (4,1) and (4,3) are 2 and 4.\n   - Since (3,4) < (4,4), (4,3) must be 2 and (4,1) must be 4.\n   - So, Row 4 is [4, 1, 2, 3].\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n4 1 3 2\n2 4 1 3\n3 2 4 1\n4 1 2 3\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n[[4 1 3 2,2 4 1 3,3 2 4 1,4 1 2 3]]"}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Visibility Numbers:**\n   - Top row: 1, 2, 3, 2\n   - Bottom row: 3, 2, 1, 2\n   - Left column: 1, 2, 2, 2\n   - Right column: 4, 1, 3, 2\n\n2. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - We need to place numbers 1 to 4 in each row and each column without repetition.\n   - The numbers on the sides indicate how many skyscrapers are visible from that direction.\n\n3. **Start with the Most Constraining Clues:**\n   - The number 4 on the right side of the first column means that all four skyscrapers are visible when looking from the right. This implies that the skyscrapers must be in ascending order from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - The number 1 on the left side of the second column means that only one skyscraper is visible when looking from the left. This implies that the tallest skyscraper (4) must be on the left side of this column.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - **Row 1:**\n     - From the right side, the sequence must be 1, 2, 3, 4.\n     - From the left side, the sequence must be 4, 3, 2, 1.\n     - The sequence that satisfies both is 1, 2, 3, 4.\n   - **Row 2:**\n     - From the right side, 1 skyscraper is visible, so the tallest skyscraper (4) must be on the right.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 3, 2, 4, 1 or 2, 3, 4, 1.\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - From the right side, 3 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must be in descending order from right to left.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 4, 3, 2, 1.\n   - **Row 4:**\n     - From the right side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must be in descending order from right to left.\n     - From the left side, 2 skyscrapers are visible, so the sequence must start with the tallest skyscraper followed by the next tallest.\n     - Possible sequences: 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\n5. **Verify and Adjust:**\n   - Ensure that all rows and columns have unique numbers from 1 to 4.\n   - Check the visibility constraints from all sides.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter verifying and adjusting, the correct placement of skyscrapers is:\n\n```\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\n2 4 1 3\n3 1 4 2\n```\n\n### Formatted Answer:\n[[1 2 3 4, 4 3 2 1, 2 4 1 3, 3 1 4 2]]"}

From the left, we see 3 skyscrapers. This means the buildings must be in ascending order.\n     - First row: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n   - **Second Row:**\n     - From the top, we see 4 skyscrapers. This means the buildings must be in ascending order.\n     - From the left, we see 3 skyscrapers. This means the tallest building (4) cannot be in the first column.\n     - From the right, we see 2 skyscrapers. This means the tallest building (4) cannot be in the last column.\n     - Possible configurations: 1, 2, 4, 3\n     - Verify: 1, 2, 4, 3 works with all constraints.\n\n   - **Third Row:**\n     - From the top, we see 2 skyscrapers. This means the tallest building (4) must be on the right end.\n     - From the right, we see 4 skyscrapers. This means the buildings must be in descending order.\n     - Remaining buildings must be 1, 2, 3 in the first three columns. From the left, we see 3 skyscrapers. This means the buildings must be in descending order.\n     - Third row: 3, 2, 1, 4\n\n   - **Fourth Row:**\n     - From the top, we see 2 skyscrapers. This means the tallest building (4) must be on the right end.\n     - From the right, we see 2 skyscrapers. This means the tallest building (4) cannot be in the last column.\n     - Remaining buildings must be 1, 2, 3 in the first three columns. From the left, we see 2 skyscrapers. This means the buildings must be in descending order.\n     - Fourth row: 2, 1, 3, 4\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n1 2 3 4\n1 2 4 3\n3 2 1 4\n2 1 3 4\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```[[1 2 3 4, 1 2 4 3, 3 2 1 4, 2 1 3 4]]```"}
