[[3∞10]] = 3² + 10² = 9 + 100 = 109\n2. [[10∞3]] = 10² + 3² = 100 + 9 = 109\n\nThen we subtract the two results: 109 - 109 = 0\n\nThe answer is [[0]].\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the maximum possible value of a∞b if both a and b are prime integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The maximum value for a∞b is when both a and b are at their maximum value, which is 7.\n\nSo, [[7∞7]] = 7² + 7² = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nThe answer is [[98]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the minimum possible value of ab(border) if both a and b are positive integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is an error in the formulation of the question. The term \"ab(border)\" doesn't align with the defined custom operation in the rule, which is \"a∞b = a² + b².\" Could you please clarify or correct the operation you meant to ask about? If you're referring to the minimum product of a and b given the operation rule, the smallest product occurs with the smallest integers, which are 1 and 1.\n\nSo, if the operation is based upon multiplication, the question should be formulated as seeking the minimum product ab, not \"ab(border).\" With the provided information, a=1 and b=1 would yield the smallest result.\n\nHowever, with the specified operation rule (a∞b = a² + b²), and asking for the minimum sum of squares using positive integers less than 10, the smallest result would be when both a and b are 1, because they are the smallest positive integers.\n\nSo, [[1∞1]] = 1² + 1² = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe minimum possible value of the operation with the given parameters is [[2]]. \n\nAssuming that the question was intended to ask for the minimum value of the operation, rather than a product or undefined term.\n\nRemove the reference to multiplication. What is the minimum possible value of a∞b if a and b are positive integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the defined operation a∞b = a² + b² and the condition that a and b are positive integers less than 10, the minimum possible value of a∞b is when both a and b are their smallest, which is 1. Therefore:\n\n[[1∞1]] = 1² + 1² = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe minimum possible value of a∞b is [[2]].\n\n### Question\nWhat is the minimum possible value of a∞b if both a and b are prime integers less than 10?\nThe answer should only be given as a number.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThe prime integers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The minimum value for a∞b using prime numbers would occur when both a and b are the smallest prime numbers, which are 2 and 2.\n\nSo, [[2∞2]] = 2² + 2² = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nThe minimum possible value of a∞b with prime integers less than 10 is [[8]].\n\n### Question\nThe expression ((j-a)(border) + b)∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is a misunderstanding in the formulation of the question as it doesn't directly align with the operation rule a∞b = a^2 + b^2. The question appears malformed, including an undefined notion of \"(j-a)(border) + b\". Please clarify or provide the correct expression.\n\n### Question\nThe expression ((j-a) + b)∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding or typo in the question. If we were to simplify the expression in the context of the defined operation rule, we should first clarify the symbol that is meant to be \"∞\" and the sequence of operations.\n\nHowever, the statement \"(j - a) + b\"∞a simplifies to b∞a does not directly follow from the given operation rule. The \"∞\" symbol isn't part of standard algebraic operators and the goal of simplification isn't clearly defined here since the operation is custom and doesn't directly indicate a simplification process.\n\nFor the expression ((j - a) + b)∞a to relate to b∞a, it would need to follow the operation rule as defined:\n\nFirst, we would need to compute ((j - a) + b)² + a², but this does not simplify directly to b² + a² without knowing the value of j or how it relates to b or a. The operations are defined as squaring both terms individually and then adding them, not simplifying the expression inside parentheses first as in traditional algebra.\n\nGiven the mismatch between what is asked and the operation rule, or if there's an expectation of direct simplification that's not in line with the defined operation, please clarify or reframe the question. As presented, there is no direct simplification path from ((j - a) + b)∞a to b∞a under the given operation rule.\n\n### Question\nThe expression ( (j-a) + b )∞a simplifies to b∞a.\nWhat letter represents the wildcard in the expression?\nThe answer should only be given as a single letter.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nIt seems there is a misunderstanding or typo in the framing of the question. The expression and simplification you've shared do not directly correlate with the custom operation rule provided earlier for a∞b = a^2 + b^2. If the goal is to find which letter acts as a \"wildcard\" given a specific simplification, we need to align the provided information with the operation rule clearly.\n\nFor the operation rule a∞b = a^2 + b^2, the expression ((j - a) + b)∞a does not logically simplify to b∞a under standard algebraic rules or the custom operation itself. The simplification suggested indicates a transformation that would align with standard addition and substitution principles but does not utilize the custom operation in a clear or defined way.\n\nGiven that \"∞\" is not a standard operator and the goal is to divine a \"wildcard\" from the simplification, and considering the provided operation rule, it's challenging to determine which letter acts as a wildcard directly from the information provided. The claim of simplification seems to request a logical leap that doesn't match typical operations or the custom rule mentioned.\n\nCool, lets just assume this is a wildcard question and locate the wildcard.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\nAssuming a wildcard scenario where the question is seeking a logical deduction about variable purpose based on the information's structure rather than mathematical operation rules, and focusing on the assertion that ((j - a) + b) should simplify logically to b, this might imply that 'j' is intended to simplify out in some logical sense.\n\nIf we consider the operation intention rather than its mathematical soundness:\n\n- If `((j - a) + b)` simplifies logically to `b`, it suggests a scenario where `j - a` simplifies to `0` because `0 + b = b`.\n- This simpl"}

So, the result is \" ※ \" = \"5 ※ =\" = \" \"\" = \"\".\n\nTherefore, when you take \"5\" and \" \", which equates to \"=\", you should get \"(5 + ) / 2\" = \"※\". This gives \"20\" when multiplied by \"2\". Then 5○(6△8) = 20/2 = 10.\n\n### Question:\nNow ignoring previous rule.\nGiven that , compute .\nPlease calculate out the result.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets, like this:[[Your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[10]]\nAccording to rule definition,  should be calculated as \"b ※ = \", and then \" ※ = \". So, the result is \" ※ \" = \"b ※ =\" = \" \"\" = \"\". \nTherefore, when you take \"b=[Q]\" and \" \", which equates to \"=\", you should get \"(b + ) / 2\" = \"※\". This gives \"20\" when multiplied by \"2\". Then  = 20.\nHence,  = 20.\n\n### Question:\nIf (5 ○ 4)  6 = 34,what is the value of  ?\nPlease calculate out the result.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets, like this:[[Your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[5]]\nAccording to the formula [(5○4)”*6=34]], you can rewrite it as [[5○4”*(6/2)=34, and 5○4”=34/3=11.33. Per the rule, this means 5+[[x_b]]=11.33, therefore  = 11.33-5=6.33.\n6.33 is a fraction of a, so we round down to the nearest whole number, making  = 6.\n\n### Question:\nIf 4 +- (6 ^ 8)=24 then what is the value of?\nPlease calculate out the result.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets, like this:[[Your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[8]]\nAccording to the formula [4 ○ (6^8)=24]], you can rewrite it as [4○(6 * 4 * 2)=24], this leads to [4○(6 * 4 * 2)=24], then [4○(24) = 24], and 4+[[x_b]]=24, therefore  = 20.\n\n### Question:\nFind the value of ([Q2] ○ [Q1])  6?\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets, like this:[[Your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[Q1] * 6]]\nBased on the formula given, i.e., [([Q2] ○ [Q1])  6], we can breakup this formula into two parts.\n- Part 1: [([Q2] ○ [Q1]) ] can be translated to [\"([Q2] with [Q1]) \"].\n- Part 2: [([Q2] ○ [Q1]) 6] is translated to [\"([Q2] with [Q1]) then multiply by 6\"].\n\nSo, the formula [([Q2] ○ [Q1])  6] means: You start by taking [Q1], you add [Q2] to it, and then you multiply the result by 6. \nHence, the end result is [([Q2] ○ [Q1])  6] = [([Q2] + [Q1]) * 6] = [[Q1] * 6]. \n\n### Question:\nIf ([Q2] ^ [Q1]) △ 5=44 what is the value [Q2]?Please calculate out the result.\nPlease wrap your answer in double square brackets, like this:[[Your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[[Q2] + 10]]\nAccording to the rule, [([Q2] ^ [Q1]) △ 5=44] mean to \"Take Q2 and Q1, apply ♂ and then apply ♂ again with 5 to give 44\". According to the definition, \"b□a=b×4+a\" and \"b△a=(b+a)/2\".\n\nSo, when you"}

Therefore, our solution for X is correct.\n\nThe final answer is 1, and we wrap it in the specified notation: [[1]]."}

The derivatives should be f'(x)=sin(x) and g'(x)=1. Therefore, f□g=1, and f□g evaluated when x=0 should be 1, not 2.\nFor the third question, the rule given is f□g=f'(x) +g'(x) . The correct derivatives should be f'(x)=/=cos(x), but rather it should be cos(x) with a negative value because we are finding the derivative of a trigonometric function. Therefore f□g=cos(π/4)+1 and when we put the value of x as π/4, the value of f□g comes out to be about 1.707 approximately.\nFor the fourth question, the rule given is f□g=f'(x) +g'(x) . The correct derivative of f(x) is f'(x)=cos(x)/sin(x) and g'(x)=1/x.\nFor the fifth question, the rule given is f□g=f'(x) +g'(x) . The correct derivative of f(x) and g(x) should be f'(x)=3/x and g'(x)=-(1/2)x^(-3/2). Therefore, the equation will be f□g=3/x-(1/2)x^(-3/2). But I couldn't solve x in the equation f□g=3/2, so I cant find the value of x.\nFor the sixth question, the rule given is f□g=f'(x) +g'(x) . The correct derivatives should be f'(x)=3/x and g'(x)=2x. Therefore, f□g=3/x+2x.\n\nFor the second question, it appears that the evaluation was incorrect. The correct steps should be as follows:\n\n1. Compute f'(x) and g'(x):\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\cos(x), \\quad g'(x) = 1\n   \\]\n2. Substitute x = 0:\n   \\[\n   f'(0) = \\cos(0) = 1, \\quad g'(0) = 1\n   \\]\n3. Evaluate f□g:\n   \\[\n   f□g = f'(0) + g'(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n   \\]\n\nThe mistake in this case was computing the first derivative of \\( f(x) = \\sin(x) \\), which indeed is \\( \\cos(x) \\), and evaluated it correctly at \\( x = 0 \\). Hence, the correct answer is 2.\n\nFor the third question, it looks like there was an error in product strategies. Correcting it:\n\n1. Correct derivatives:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\cos(x), \\quad g'(x) = 1\n   \\]\n2. Evaluate f□g:\n   \\[\n   f□g = \\cos(x) + 1\n   \\]\n3. Evaluate f□g for \\( x = \\pi/4 \\):\n   \\[\n   f□g\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) + 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1\n   \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 \\).\n\nIn the fourth question, the evaluation is correct as per the given rule. For \\( f(x) = \\sin(x) \\) and \\( g(x) = \\ln(x) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\cos(x), \\quad g'(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\n   \\]\nThus,\n   \\[\n   f□g = \\cos(x) + \\frac{1}{x}\n   \\]\n\nIn the fifth question, the equation f□g = 3/2 was incorrectly used. Using the correct derivation,\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = \\frac{3}{x}, \\quad g'(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\n   \\]\nWe substitute to get the derivative sum:\n   \\[\n   f□g = \\frac{3}{x} - \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\n   \\]\nSetting this equal to 3/2 may not actually yield a solution due to the nature of the equation. Without further algebra, it doesn't seem directly solveable with simple algebraic methods, hence why any explicit value wasn't provided in the initial response.\n\nLastly, regarding if there was a formula whoopsie \n\nByteBuffer --atmospheric (not-so-hidden */\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorrect unsafety: Found the following rules and mistakes.

However, there is no element-wise power operation defined in standard matrix operations, and your request contradicts the provided operation definitions which refer to other operations (*&, @&, ^&, #&, &$).\n\nIt seems you aim to redefine operations to custom functions for a unique set of problems. Since this is not part of standard math operations, let's assume you are looking for instructions on how to interpret and solve problems based on such custom operations.\n\nFor instance, if A*&B is a custom operation defined as \"multiply each element of matrix A with the corresponding element of matrix B,\" the subsequent \"evaluate A*&B\" questions would require applying this custom multiplication.\n\n### Interpretation for Custom Operation \"*.evaluate for: evaluate A*&B \"\n\nWith the operation \"\\*\" meaning element-wise multiplication of matrix A by matrix B:\n\n1. **For matrix A and B:**\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   4 & 2 \\\\\n   1 & 3\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n   B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   2 & 1 \\\\\n   2 & 2\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n   This operation would be executed as:\n\n   \\[\n   A*&B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   4*2 & 2*1 \\\\\n   1*2 & 3*2\n   \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   8 & 2 \\\\\n   2 & 6\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For matrix A and B:**\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   3 & 5 \\\\\n   2 & 4\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n   B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   2 & 3 \\\\\n   1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n   The operation would yield:\n\n   \\[\n   A*&B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   3*2 & 5*3 \\\\\n   2*1 & 4*0\n   \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   6 & 15 \\\\\n   2 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. **For matrix A and B:**\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   5 & 3 \\\\\n   2 & 4\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n   B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 2 \\\\\n   3 & 5\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n   Applying the custom operation yields:\n\n   \\[\n   A*&B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   5*1 & 3*2 \\\\\n   2*3 & 4*5\n   \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n   5 & 6 \\\\\n   6 & 20\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nIt’s important to note that these custom operations don’t align with standard algebraic operations on matrices.
