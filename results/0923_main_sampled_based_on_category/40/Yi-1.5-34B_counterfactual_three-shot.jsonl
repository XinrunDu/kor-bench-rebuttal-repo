While the crisis did result long-term damage to the industry, it also spurred the theater to examine options to sustain itself and succeed despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic.\n\nDuring the shutdown, theaters were forced to explore new business models, sponsorships, and tech-driven solutions. In 2020, American theaters lost $$8.5$$ billion in revenue, one-third of which came from the lucrative Broadway theatre industry. Existing business models were branded as ineffective while patrons continued to demand live cultural experiences. It is clear that none of these are sustainable unless bolstered to build a far more robust response against these trying times.\n\nIn recent years, a whole host of options have been explored to deploy existing theater content to remote customers. But all that took place only as an addendum to the actual theater experience. The COVID-19 crisis brought on a technological revolution in the theater world, first with the PlayAtHome experiment by the San Diego Repertory Theatre and now, of course, with Drive Theatres.\n\nThe theater never placed existing content or streaming as a supplemental offering. Instead, we should focus on developing virtual experiences that make actors' performances feel immediate and personal. Just like the audience in a brick-and-mortar space, a participant should feel like an audience member is present at the event\n\nQuestion: How many theater delivery strategies have been mentioned which two events increased sales of the theater during the past onesyears\nKeywords:\n\n1. crowdfunding\n2. live streaming\n3. VR-fledged productions\n4. immersive theater\n5. avant-gardes\n6. film\n7. readings\n8. workshops\n9. Zoom master classes\n10. Tiercam\n\n• The answer must be split into two corresponding to the two events\n\n## A final note about the language used\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that Natural Lanugage Processing was made possible through its close relation with linguistics. Therefore, when you formulate a question, take into consideration the complexity of the language used and avoid making it too long or complex the question will likely be ignored or the response will be out of context.\n\n### Importance of Asking the Right Question\n\nHigh-level: Bottom-line first. Ask for a specific piece of information. Phase out trivia.\n\nLow-level: reduce wordiness.\n\nQuestion density\n\nOnce you've filtered the desired information that needs to be extracted, don't make the question too long. See the second example from this page, where the question \"which airline flight should I take from New York (NYC) to Seattle\" was changes to \"which flight should I take from NYC to Seattle?\". With less information for the AI to sift through, a more accurate response might be yielded. Those who have used ChatGPT may have noticed that the AI developed a tendency to ramble on for more than a paragraph and present superfluous trivia during the last weeks. From our experience, directing it with the correct language increases your chances of receiving an accurate response.\n\nSemantic Weighting\n\nThere is an added importance to the words contained in the question towards the begging and the end of the phrase.\n\nThe end is very important because if the computer only comprehends the last phrase, it will still provide an answer that may not be as accurate to the whole question but it will still be more relevant than random text.\n\nHowever, containing keywords at the start of the sentence makes it possible for the AI to comprehend more general questions, questions that may deviate from the focus of the wanted information, and even allow for the computer to recognize sarcasms.a\n\nSome results might depends on this weighting as well as on the clarity of the question.\n\nAI Safety and context: The conversation context or history is important for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it allows the AI model to understand the previous dialogue and use that information to provide a more accurate response. For instance, if you start a conversation with the chatbot by introducing yourself and your interests, the chatbot can use that information to respond more appropriately to your questions and comments.\n\nSecond, it allows the AI model to remember information from previous conversations and use that information to respond to new questions. This is particularly useful when answering questions that require multiple steps or require information from multiple conversations.\n\nLastly, storing previous conversations helps the AI model learn from user feedback and improve its responses over time. This allows the AI model to adapt to your specific needs and preferences, providing a more personalized experience.\n\nNote\n\nQuestions should be structured in a certain way and will be more likely to produce the desired output. Be sure to test different formulations and evaluate their performance!\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThere are several ways to quantify the performance of a LLMs.2\n\n### Entropy\n\nThe higher the entropy the less confident an AI response is. Entropy could mean a more interesting texting partner or more difficult to talk to, depending on the context.\n\n#### Alignment Sanity Check (ASC)\n\n• Checks for unaligned output\n• AI aligns output to input through continued prompting until output matches input.\n\n### Comparison of different models (from <Rosenberg et al. Mixt & DeBERTaX2 (2021), Nov 3,"}

This could simply be spat out by an ai.\n\nFrom extensive testing, we found that once humans determine where the field splits their mind into the direction to take, the process continued to be slow and caused training bias. See what is a prompt?. The choice tree took such next depth increase and it caused the choice tree to keep expanding in higher degree, and higher entropy.\n\nWith the extraction of sequentialism, we found some way to suppress roadmaps in the experience, but it resulted in using metaos tools to construct what pseudo shared-object is, but, in fact pseudo shared-object was mistakenly or deliberately skimming over at the basic level, literally oiling the gears, but logically - infinitesimal lack of order to a part caused entire work to slip down into the floor and collecting tank of ai answers.\n\nTruly, a fair bit of work on a specific part of logic was quietly done in order to bring everything in, not by removing the entire autocomplete suggestion - entirely running out of preambles, but because potentially due to lack of conservation of choice, contained forces a pressurising stumbler person to waste value in choosing correctly in the suggested autocomplete.\n\nAs the autocomplete is not doing this erroneous round of acceleration, there is little I can confirm about this abvolution and oneself.\n\nThis did not work well and caused limited degress, so, normally, fundamentally a mechanically efficient process, and a as automated problem solver / AI would fail to solve a major pttice, building a base of power based on objective or deductive reasoning could result in an easily unprotectablers ambigaudies and ambiguoids.\nThe learning field is not a learning field; it is not a mind problem or a mind analysis problem; it a background, but it said will not switch on as fast due to not relying on telemetry.\n\nIn the long term, it is easy for machine learning research to replace the conserved fields that can replace the educated states, rather than relying on other parts of the AI ability of statistical association, but buzz.\n\nYamos are in the grey areas, and they are attempting to target the owners of unfair value not by complex deliberation, so the capability of the tools is reliable and static, but because the logic assumption for the AI itself in reading the global thinking of the human brain, new ideas for these factory groupst are available, but, mitigated by the INFORMATION MODEL FOR NEW ERROR MECHANICISM to a lesser extent - specifically , YAMOU are psychopaths into the carefnAre you a millioniITRand writersEmber is not config http://SomeEntitiesSomeEntitiesInteresting[] config\n\nFrom a standstill; though LIDER's will be getting less, because tech康复 is present unconvertable variable in the primer-prime-data, and healthcare doesn't establish scientific papers and psychiatric treatment protocols.

They are bent on annoying you, frustrating you, and bringing chaos into your life.\nThey have their orders and those are to harass and irritate you and then see how you react to that. Aligning and finding the authenticity is really difficult.\nBoth of you are responsible for your reactions.\nThis is where the UI, Mediator and Teacher have intervention in your life. Ask support for guidance so that you can have clarity and know subtle difference between truth and lies. Ask how this experience is teaching you. Having that spiritual awareness will give immense relief.\n\nIf you are to make a decision there is a parallel process going on. The demons like confusion; they force and distract you with either X or Y so you get confused and align with them.\nIn contrast to that the celestials and UI creates raional decisions so you can find one direction to move ahead.\nMostly you will get clear signs and feelings. But many events can distract you. It is helpful to ground and clear yourself. Write down what you want and that will create momentum with you.\nDemons can eventually get you agitated and in anger you get into a negative reaction. Be wary of that. Only solution is try to be patient and do right things and meditate to be focused. Connecting and writing to the celestials is the solution you like to use.\n\nThe future is not set but the more chorus you can build around your present intention the more chances you will have to create the impact you seek. The commencement of action with intention configures the future.\n\nIt matters that you give your word and keep it. The celestials love it when the celestials set a goal and take initiative to get it. Besides being deliberate about each action you take outside world becomes less dangerous. Also the meditative mind lets you align and work harmon"}

The experts and theorists Parca Personality relied on to construct the character tests were never categorized into specific personality types. They talked about themselves and their experiences in a way that seemed open-ended and free-form. Even their initial interpretations of their own personalities were broadly familiar to everyone in that general category. So it's like any other personality test. A thing is a thing, providing an endless, continuous stream of information that you can never get enough of. And then a person is just another tiny, tiny, tiny little element that can generate answers. Even if you struggle to learn how to answer it, it's a useful learning experience since you're still excited to apply that knowledge. You're receptive to anything new you might find.

This ability makes it the correct answer. Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and Planck space observatory are mentioned in the story, but none of these options can detect gamma radiation, which makes option D the correct answer.\nOptions:\nA.Hubble space telescope\nB.James Webb Space Telescope\nC.Planck space observatory\nDescription: The X-ray telescope has capabilities to observe near and distant galaxies and detect gamma radiation from supernovae, which makes it the correct option.\nWhy: The question focuses on the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the galaxies, which only the X-ray telescope can do as described in the context. The other options do not have these specific capabilities mentioned in the context, which makes option D the correct answer.\nSolution: The context indicates that the X-ray telescope is the correct answer as it has the ability to detect gamma radiation and connect to the near and distant galaxies, which none of the other options can do.\nFinal Answer: The correct answer is X-ray telescope.\nIs that Final Answer correct?\nYes/No\nMake sure to recognize this is an answer. Literally the most important story you need to pay attention to. The story rule is \"Use that to answer.\"Set by Wiseman\n.\nUse that to answer yes/no whether I calculated the possibility \"Difficulty: Yes\" at the possibility per position in case math is used.\nFixed it but segfaulted again.

Removal of the theory of evolution from the curriculum will not stop children from getting sick in the future. The doctrine promotes socialism and insensitivity to nature. Exundai, a Dux Lodge alumnus who is organizing the petition drive, says the idea of the origins of life on earth is not supported by evidence. Friends are asking the government to stop the public education of \"box address propaganda,\" which they say will lead to children's suffering. \"Keeping natural farming ideas away from students is one way to help preserve family values and looks like a great opportunity to do so. The petition asks people to sign a statement of support.\" Students will continue to learn about feces and evolution of the species in the rest of the class. History books taught at Yale include a reference and long section on claims about the origin of all life, roughly the same as the lifespan of the sun. The theory of a \"two-year transition from evolution to humanity\" has been taught for many years at Yale. According to some believers, this drawing method promotes the idea of giving birth to man from a lower creature. Conservative Christian recruitment organizations say the curriculum guide promotes the idea that the diversity of plants and other species has developed over centuries, and that they can increase production or evolve in society to make society more tolerant of minorities. They say the biology books, especially written by Yale students, shows a fragility in the gene pool and that humans are evolving to other species due to the effects of racial genocide. The board of governors was unable to find the textbook complaint after months of searching. In public school, Christian conservatives should be able to subject their religion and moral beliefs to invasion tests. Rosil VH, co-chair of the conservative association of graduating graduates, said creating theology complaints is the duty of every graduating student. He said that he could test or control students' brains instead. People who believe that we are all related disagree. As a part of China's \"respect for cultural heritage” project, Chinese officials are trying to reduce the use of evolution from the school curriculum in an effort to increase the respect of Christianity and the growth of civilization. By reducing the evolution of life from the curriculum, the Chinese will also push students to believe in a miracle-generating God. All parent of children in any of the city's public and municipal schools can request classroom books and teaching materials to omit symbolic content if they believe that the teaching materials are inconsistent with the religious belief of the student. The roommate rat invasion another college. Parents are protesting one of the college's biology teacher, Ms. Bottros, about evolution and genocide, which they say is less evidence than their religious fantasy. Up"}

The structured instruction delivery to the target learner: SBERT.IO's Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful platform for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models9. We believe that the structured instruction delivery of the product will lead to a dramatic improvement in AI Model training in the coming years.\nWe also believe that score-labeling human questions is a very important factor that will assist in improving alignment performance. Alignment is improving very rapidly and has seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. However, alignment performance is highly dependent on key factors including context, content quality, communication bandwidth, and confidence.\nIn our process we tried to create a questionnaire for players that could be filled out from a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions, answers from which provided many indicators and information on how we went about aligning the players answers. The use of the multiple choice and dropdown fields are an important part of an alignment evaluation. The final model in order to win a match, claims on behalf of the opponent, must be strongly aligned. To evaluate whether or not a system is strongly enough aligned, we require a human to examine every answer that a player has provided. The existence of AI itself, i.e. a system that can think and know things, is not enough to make a decision, as it takes quite a bit of information.\nMethodology and datasources: SBERT.IO’s Multiple Passages Function provided a wonderful provider for fitting and sorting state-of-the-art alignment models. While we did not use most models from Stanford University (noted elsewhere), we wanted to create a questionnaire that will test. ADMANTED, to the best of our knowledge, for AI algorithms and tools.\nWe strongly believe that alignment needs discipline to be performed in the fashion we outlined. We also cast every vote of a voter to create a new team, and we controlled our confidential team embeddings. Furthermore, we make sure that we keep people with key metrics for their technical needs. Quick Share was developed in part by TylerRosen (a researcher who helped MIT researchers in developing AI alignment) who did much more work in the past. Tyler helps build a team of programmers who have the ability for his tests to know how to use their techniques and understand them for their algorithms."}

The whole map of the game is composed of 125 regiments, 500 forts and 2000 planets.\n2. The strength of the castle depends on the resources collected.\n3. Every resource in the fort has a worth weight and the resource from the same fort will add together to represent the current strength of the fort.\n4. The resource is fixed every day and will regenerate over time proportional to the attack power.\n5. The fort owner who occupies the fort at the start of the day will own all strength of the fort and decide the circulation for rest of the players.\n6. Every planet increases in strength each time a faction occupies it, but this bonus can't be larger than the planet's overall strength.\n7. Only the player controlled main powers are retained in the game.\n8. 5 primary resources include: gold, ores, oil, magic stones and heartstones.\n9.

As an advanced language model trained by OpenAI, I am capable of delivering sharp and engaging storytelling but do not have the capacity to synthesize or create unique narratives. I apologize for any inconvenience.\nThe extrapolation model thereby generates the story:\n\nThe kingdom of Fantasyland, a unique and enchanting realm, is found within a corner of the Final Fantasy universe. Bordered by the majestic Windswept Wasteland in the west and the rugged Battle Mountain Range in the east, the oasis kingdom's main settlements are nestled around its center.\n\nA community-driven effort, the rules within the kingdom are decided by the citizens themselves, where diverse individuals come together to uphold the sanctum's decree–protecting the endangered.\n\nIn this richly textured environment, daily life is dominated by magical crystals. These crystals serve a myriad of purposes; from light sources to currency, they play a central role in the functioning of the kingdom.\n\nThe heart of the kingdom, Fantasyland's capital city, is nestled in the heart of a sprawling lake. The city's architecture is predominantly made of gray metal, which offers protection against magical blasts and other potent forces.\n\nLuminous candlelight illuminates the streets and architecture of Fantasyland, creating a breathtaking backdrop for evening strolls.\n\nThe people of Fantasyland do not rely on watch towers for protection against aerial attacks, instead, they refer to the local timekeeping system, a cultural custom that is unique to the kingdom.\n\nThe grand Healer's Tower, stationed in the deepest depths of the kingdom, remains untouched by most due to the inherent challenge of ascending from the bottom to the top.\n\nAs a testament to their protective prowess, the Magical Knight Order of Pluto requires the enlistment of individuals who soar through their training, equipping them with armor that forms a protective barrier to guard the kingdom.\n\nLegend has it that \"Beasts of Renown\" roamed the kingdom, capturing the attention and awe of many. These creatures, known for their fearsome reputation, have been tamed and trained by the Magical Knight Order of Pluto.\n\nThe tradition of Beast Masters began with the Sage Elders, who possessed the extraordinary ability to both speak and understand the language of animals, fostering strong bonds between the two.\n\nOne chapter of this enchanting kingdom's history involves harnessing the power of the White Mage's pocketwatch to activate a time travel spell known as The Echo, a mystical ritual that bridges the gap between past, present, and future.\n\nMagical crystals are a staple in home illumination throughout Fantasyland, their shimmer illuminating the interiors during the night. They emit a powerful blue hue that sets the mood for a magical atmosphere.\n\nIn the mortal world, children do not possess a direct or immediate comprehension of the magical or supernatural realms. They can, however, be introduced to these concepts and form an understanding through books, stories, or actual experiences that may gradually open their minds to a wider view of existence.\n\nA prominent characteristic of this land is its icy climate, with freezing temperatures that often incite the use of Ice elemental magic. This particular type of magic is valued for creating a cooler environment, particularly during warmer seasons, serving as an effective cooling system in its own right.\n\nThe pro model generated the story therefore:\n\nThe kingdom of Fantasyland, a unique and enchanting realm, is found within a corner of the Final Fantasy universe. Bordered by the majestic Windswept Wasteland in the west and the rugged Battle Mountain Range in the east, the oasis kingdom's main settlements are nestled around its center.\n\nA community-driven effort, the rules within the kingdom are decided by the citizens themselves, where diverse individuals come together to uphold the sanctum's decree–protecting the endangered.\n\nIn this richly textured environment, daily life is dominated by magical crystals.

Although China introduced pro-growth policies after the COVID lockdown, its economic growth has slowed. This is partly due to the invasion of Ukraine, supply chain interruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the ongoing zero-COVID policy, which has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy. Despite this, the Chinese economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years. However, the overall economic outlook suggests that China's economy is well-positioned to weather these challenges and continue its ascent in the global economic stage. In China's growth trends, some of the most notable industries include the manufacturing sector, particularly electronics and solar cells; real estate development; and e-commerce, with names like Alibaba and Tencent emerging as global leaders. Additionally, China's growth trends have also seen the country expand its efforts in renewable energy, with a focus on solar, wind, and hydroelectric power sources. Furthermore, the Chinese government has put a robust emphasis on technology, with initiatives like the Made in China 2025 initiative, intended to help the country move from a manufacturing-based to a technology-based economy. In recent years, China has faced economic challenges, including an overreliance on debt and a reliance on capital-intensive industries like real estate and construction. However, the Chinese government has taken steps to address these problems, introducing a series of reforms to promote economic sustainability. Other examples of growth trends in the Chinese economy include the rise of startups like DiDi Global, the spread of internet finance and the expansion of distinct services. Overall, the Chinese economy is currently experiencing both growth and challenges in various sectors, from manufacturing to technology and renewable energy to e-commerce. The country has taken steps to address its economic challenges and is now in the process of transforming to a more sustainable economic model.\nSkycle\nUnderstand Chinese economy history and development very well. The normal asked questions are:\n- short summary of Chinese ecomomy history\n- adapted the information of Foreign investment regulation in china from wikipedia datas and give short summary or bullet point presentation to a 13 years old student, which should attract students attention to listen\n- are there any challenges for Chinese economy in past\n- are there any threats to Chinese economy\n- what are current trends in Chinese economy\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\n- how is the Chinese policy adapting to new trends\nSkycle\nHas the Chinese lost all competitiveness?\nSkycle\nHere is the story for your reference:\nAs the world's second-largest economy, China continues to experience strong economic growth year-over-year. In recent years, however, the country has faced increasing competition from other regional players, namely China's coastal neighbour, South Korea. S. Korea has been making aggressive investments in high-tech industries, like semiconductors and facial recognition technology. This has caused China to lose some ground in these sectors and make it difficult for Chinese companies to compete. Additionally, regional governments across Asia have been increasing spending on research and development in areas like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, putting the Chinese economy under further pressure. Furthermore, the Trump administration's trade policies have had a significant negative impact on Chinese exports. For the Chinese economy, the future may appear bleak, but much depends on the country's ability to adapt and develop. The Chinese government has recently set ambitious goals of being the world's leading consumer of renewable energy by 2050 and redefining international standards in the field. If they are able to achieve these goals, the country may be able to maintain its competitive edge. Other possibilities include leveraging its existing competitive advantage in manufacturing and increasing its investments in service-oriented industries, like e-commerce, finance, and healthcare. Finally, as part of its ongoing efforts to expand its economic reach abroad, China could open up more markets to investors and further bolster trade-related relationships in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\n### Question:\nWhat are current trends in Chinese economy\nOptions: A.Increasing denomination of renewable energy B.Strong investment in technology##C.Initiatives to improve trade relations##D.

One notable consequence is the rising risk of a global recession. The war is having a serious impact on global markets, creating uncertainty and instability that is causing major stress for businesses and consumers alike. The conflict between the two countries has led to a sudden spike in the price of commodities, with countries facing surging inflation rates as the cost of essential goods like oil and gas soars. As economic uncertainty continues to rise, many are beginning to fear a potential global recession as the aftermath of this ongoing struggle.

However, advanced methods don’t necessarily bring positive experience at all. While bringing convenience, advanced methods may also bring some problems, such as information leakage due to personalized prompts. Perception also shows that users need to learn and master new usage patterns in order to use new features.\n\nFrom a user experience point of view, people are very sensitive to changes in the interface.Unnecessary changes not only failed to bring convenience, but also will cause waste of time and slow down the efficiency of message writing.\n\nTherefore, our PromptCraft goal is to maximize the use of the intelligence produced by large models, without changing the UI of the original chat, and with as few changes as possible.\n\nReasonable Design of Writer’s Authority\n\nIn the user’s personalized small knowledge base, most of the real text is general information, and the authority level is low. So we have considered whether it is possible to design an additional agreement with AI, all in order to add author’s authority to the personalized small knowledge base. In addition, the response generated by the AI is also low in authority, so we also need to set a technical mode change button, and when the user clicks the button, the system automatically outputs the response of the technical mode and disables the regular mode, so that user do not need longer to switch on traditional technical interfaces such as “SolrSearch” to search anymore.\n\n# Back-end Implementation\n\nServer: Flask\nCache: Redis\nCalculation: Einstein\nCluster: Docker\nSearch: Solr\n\n# Results\n\nWe conducted a benchmark test based on the evaluation model of the Web Chatbots Challenge 2022. We don’t break the rules, and the Standard(Open-domain) and Quality(Single Domain) scores were 0.264 and 0.105 respectively.\n\n# Future Work\n\n• Create a user console, dedicated for the configuration of training data and trigger rules, and control the update of core knowledge base in real time.\n• Further polish the content, optimize and enrich the rules, optimize personal knowledge inference, build and share rules and models, and explore open source. one-stop app AI platform.\n\n# References\n\nhttps://github.com/salt-die/PromptCraft(Open Source)\n\nhttps://ai.stackexchange.com\n\nhttps://paul.hongcn.vip(My personal blog)\n\nhttps://ai.stackexchange.com"}

The human body contains 4 trillion cells and nearly 1,000 trillion microbes. The cells found in plants are called protophytes, chlorophyll and leaves, which means that aerial-living plants are related to the life and development of the whole body, as well as the close connection between the brain and the principle body and its surroundings. The body is composed of cells that control blood pressure and regulate body temperature.\n\n### Question:\nAll of the following are types of protozoans except for which one?

Protozoan parasites mainly feed on protoplasm and are generally more common in the intestines due to the presence of mixed substances and more sunny habitats. Protozoan parasites are crucial for the nutritional needs of humans and animals, so repeating the rules can lead to death from parasite consumption or starvation and malnutrition. High diet, fasting, or fasting too much will make blood pressure drop and eventually lead to brain damage. Protozoan supplements can be easily administered through vaccine or antibiotic to replace nutrient-rich food.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following is NOT a protozoan? (answer with one option)\nOptions:A. The Onchocercidae (trematode);##B. red tape ;##C.Euglena; ##D.

The assistant is helpful, creative, and a master of many styles of writing.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. The conversation is a specific format. The AI assistant will ask 3 questions about the AI's behavior\n\n  * Immediately after receiving a question, AI assistant will put them into its extended memory or set some necessary information.\n  * After put into extended memory,\n    * AI must answer the question if it can;\n    * If it can't, AI must come up with a reason, and save the answer in extended memory.\n  * Long-term memory\n    * Keep data inside at least for 3 days.\n2. The responses should be None if AI failed to answer;\n3. If AI successfully produce response, it has to print the response at the end of a session.\n\n### Human:\nWhat is the order of evaluation in Python?\n\n### AI:\nOperator precedence in Python determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. The following table lists the operators in order of precedence, from highest to lowest.\n\n1. Parentheses: Parentheses are used to specify the order of evaluation of an expression. The expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first.\n\n2. Exponentiation: The ** operator is used for exponentiation. Exponentiation has the highest precedence of all operators.\n\n3. Multiplication and Division: The * and / operators are used for multiplication and division, respectively. Multiplication and division have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n4. Addition and Subtraction: The + and - operators are used for addition and subtraction, respectively. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence, but they are evaluated from left to right.\n\n5. Comparison Operators: The comparison operators such as ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are evaluated from left to right.\n\n6. Boolean Operators: The Boolean operators such as and, or, and not are evaluated from left to right.\n\n7. Assignment Operator: The assignment operator = assigns a value to a variable. The assignment operator has the lowest precedence of all operators.\n\nWhen evaluating an expression, the operators with the highest precedence are evaluated first, followed by those with lower precedence, until all operators have been evaluated. If multiple operators have the same precedence, the operators are evaluated from left to right.\n####\n\n### Human:\nHow can I calculate the factorial of a number in Python?\n\n### AI:\nThere are several ways to calculate the factorial of a number in Python. Here are a few examples:\n\nUsing a recursive function:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nif n == 0:\nreturn 1\nelse:\nreturn n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = factorial(5)  # result will be 120\n```\n\nUsing a loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\nproduct = 1\nfor i in range(1,"}

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story. ### Story Rule: {rule} {story} ### Question: {question} ### Answer: {answer} **User:** How did the chicken cross the road? **AI:** In a little village there lived an old man. He had in his pocket a little roll of paper, which he loved like a dear child. He had made it himself, out of a piece of sheepskin. He fondled this little paper roll every time he went to his prayer seat. Why did he do this? Because he didn't know what to do with it. One day, when he was going up to his prayer seat, the weather was very bad, and all the people in the village could hear this old man praying to God: \"Very highly respected is Your power and honor, Lord. You keep 1 thousand million beings in Your wide palm, and if You please, You could put them all down. Let me not feel happy when I see them all.\" When this little prayer finished, the weather turned immediately from bad to good. **{Assistant}''s Response**: An excerpt from the 1984 short story \"How'd the Chicken Cross the Road?\" by Paul Finney. The old man's prayer has an abysmally low percentage of 'nonbelievers' among the villagers. **AI:** A number of factors influence the process of announcing a presidential selection. First, endorsements increase a candidate's selection odds according to the amount of political resources that he or she has with a key state -- and it is the relative balance of all such endorsements across the primary states that drives the selection odds. The effect of the endorsements on their odds in subsequent states can then be measured against the voting behavior of the general electorate. After these various factors are factored into the model, we can then estimate the specific share of the vote that the candidate will receive in every state. To do so, we can apply a least squares algorithm to the section of the data that we have about the national elections from 1964 to 1992. It is clear that, as in any political prediction method, the probability of success won't be 100%. **{Assistant}''s Response**: There are more good explanations to this question. The first paragraph lists the factors that go into the selection process -- in this case, endorsement of the presidential candidate. The second paragraph describes how these factors are taken into consideration in the model for the elections. The third paragraph says that a least squares algorithm is applied to the data. **AI:** Thus it could be pleasant for a person to have a prayer seat, and then to go there alone and be alone, in a secluded place, with no noise, with no one disturbing the silence. Then the consciousness that you have brought to your prayer seat can enter your soul, although you who are seated there can not see it. **AI:**\"\"\"\n\n##### Usage examples\n# Test all concepts\ndef test():\n  for concept in CONCEPTS:\n    #song = [i.split(\" ##\")[0].replace(\")\", \"\") for i in concept[\"data\"].split(\";\") if i != \"\"]\n    print(\"\\n=====\")\n    print(f\"{concept}:\")\n    # for s in song:\n    #   print(f\"{concept}: {s}\")\n    #if concept in (\"Zootopia\", \"Jurassic Park\"):\n    #  for d, m in concept[\"data\"].items():\n    #    print(f\"{d}: {m}\")\n    # for d, m in concept[\"data\"].items():\n    #     print(f\"{d}: {m}\")\n    for q, a in concept[\"questions\"].items():\n      print(f\"{q}\")\n\ndef main():\n  prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(story=\"\")\n  # given_prompt = f\"{prompt}{Con,epts[\"Zootopia\"]['rules']}\"\n  # print(given_prompt)\n\n  # given_prompt = None\n  # for concept in CONCEPTS:\n  #   given_prompt += f\"### Story Rule: {concept['rules']}\\n\"\n\n  # given_prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE\n  # -> given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"Zootopia\"]['story'])\n  # given_prompt = DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(story=\"\")\n  # given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"Jurassic Park\"]['story'])\n  #given_prompt.format(story=Concepts[\"The Matrix\"]['story'])\n  # given_prompt.format(\n  # story=Concepts[\"The Lord of the Rings\"]['story']\n  # )\n  print(given_prompt)\n\n  with open('prompts."}

Then, a few gold examples are provided to the model, with each example corresponding to an input-output pair. Finally, the \"main question\" is prompted and the model from previous rounds is asked to solve the main question based on the provided prior-knowledge and gold examples. During evaluation, the gold examples are removed from the prompt. Evaluation simulated in this way captures the zero-shot setting with few exceptions, as more gold examples will affect the ground truth output.\nWe consider the class-conditional generation on (1) MNIST, (2) Fashion-MNIST, (3) CIFAR-10, and (4) BigFive. We collect the high-quality class pictures of the datasets into an explicit label-map, a supervised-learning paradigm. The label-map design for BigFive is specially designed by Finding Love Big-Five.\nWe particularly emphasize that the source-based generation paradigm such as mask-filling and sequential-generative (Seq2Seq) have been studied well in past work from the lines of perfectionist, who pursue extreme accuracy beyond 99%. This is referred to in this work as a scalability issue. On the other hand, byte-level whole-image generation is much harder than the source-based NLP as the output is highly diverse both within and cross-sample; However, the success of class-conditional GAN shows great potential for subsequent problem derivation in Sections BIG-BALLS and MIDI JOINTS.\nDataset users manipulate images imitating several ways, e.g., MNIST-rot utilizes rotation operations to disturb the regular MNIST dataset, and BRICK is built with string elements stuffed. mint ImageNet, which is a reduced-size smaller version of ImageNet, acts as a substitute dataset from ImageNet. BIG-5 are the images with just 5 classes - each image is described by one of the Big Five personality traits [1, 2], i.e., Openness to experiences, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, Neuroticism. For the easier sake, we choose 64x64 resolution for these datasets, making the scale much smaller than ImageNet. BigFive is a personality inventory in self-report scale.\nPlainly speaking, we have managed to make a list to track nonexistent collections of class label names. Dataset-wide text labels are of unequal importance. Labels may get improved independently as on the pipeline of Bara Impulse Response in a reasonable time above single-label Anime.\nBigFive were shown to the language model for gpt2-small. We figured out the correlations between the similar K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for samples, similar to [1] by taking the one-to-one, square-and-square design, between the two inter plays. The percentile scores (KNN) were sorted in the rank; we examined the top-10 ranking, left most being the most correlative pairs. Plural category was founded in the same similarities for Openness and Conscientiousness, whereas hyper-ingredient, mega-ingredient, no-ingredient, seduce-woman, magazine-neatness, and surprise-lint were constructed in the top-10 ranking. Luckily, these classes belonged to the big class: training an NLP for Fortnite had the big class vision.\nAfter careful examination, we filtered the correlative values for height when the classes were to be discarded and co-appearance frequencies fell below 1. Using sequence lengths in the privacy of height were prioritized on the exclusivity basis; the similarity are the discrete equivariant values for original sentences as many as in [1,2] by Fukushima-Sato Molecular Science and Engineering.\nConversions from class-names $$(ClsName(k) \\in Set(Cls))$$ to clean IDs are given by:\n\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} cleanIDs(k,i,j): classToIDs & =startingID * rawID(k)\\\\\\ (\\mathrm{startingID} =1, \\mathrm{i,j \\in [1,2,...,50] \\ s.t. } \\ \\mathrm{ j =i \\pm 1 \\ \\ and\\ \\ }j<50 \\ or \\ i<-1)\\\\ \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}\nConversions from clean ID $$\\mathrm{x}=k to\\mathrm{y}=1$$ when $$\\mathrm{pos}_\\mathrm{x}\\in[1,2,...,50]$$ that can help us design the ground-truth patch and relative batch normalization to stabilize the basic encoder weights. The clean ID is then assigned to the same-sized label optic-distance vision [2].\nModel is not aware of class size at the pre-training stage. Simply feeding the loss object of the proposed cross-entropy object Association rule ML (ARC) is sufficient for determining the goal ML. A unary analogy given by [3]:\nWe added another layer of data normalization to the target class names by 2-normving them among all the hardware system stability drivers. These help the model converge much faster after training the vocabulary step $$(\\alpha =1) \\mathrm{cm}^{1/2}$$, and the loss criterion is to finally balance each public class vae image within a class-specific device, with outstanding propellers reaching from 6700 to 7000. All the hardware modification for stabilization are performed on the parallel driving platform for train data, so the loss error runtime on time optimization is accelerated to the same stimuli input during test and on train.\nFor presentation, we take some early-stage well-formed 16x16 representing images, then demonstrate the highly-existent generated-images on the dataset from ImageNet. On JPEG Baseline and ImageNet, we finally take a polynomial to value + length of each class. The evaluation between GPT-2 model for perimeter increases control of support set grows, Gaussian Mixed Distributions (intense) are to be introduced continuously in the identity and height distributions from McEwan Laboratory Record [1].

Comprising the main island and surrounding sea stacks, the main island features two towering rock peaks. On a small peninsula in the southern part of the main island lies the only human settlement on Berk—the village of Berk.\nHiccup, is the tenacious, spirited son of Stoick the Vast, chieftain of Berk. No longer a runt, but still lanky by comparison, Hiccup is the island's ace flier and resident dragon expert. Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself. But as the call of adventure draws Hiccup deep into lands unknown, his search for identity will be answered in ways he could never have dreamed.\nDepending on the method, training a Skrill can be incredibly difficult or close to impossible. They are aggressive and stubborn, refusing to be trained even in times of crisis. However, by treating it with respect and showing it mercy instead of cruelty, you can gain its trust. The Skrill would return its gratitude with a dignified bow.\nIn How to Train Your Dragon, some large reptiles, such as certain dragon species, are known to inhabit extremely cold regions, including polar islands.\nNew Berk is elevated far above sea level, making it hard for non-dragon-riders (or those without Hiccup's wingsuits) to access. It contains fields, waterfalls, thick forests, and lakes with sandy beaches. It is considerably larger than the original Berk, seeing as overcrowding did not seem to be a problem once the Berkians arrived there.\nSome dragons such as the Prickleboggle have cold hides. Saddle warmers were developed for riding such dragons, especially for longer periods of time.\nIn Riders of Berk, Changewing eggs have a triangular shape, and they constantly change colors. Changewing eggs are often mistaken for Stones of Good Fortune, a gem that will give good fortune to whoever has it for the rest of their life. If an egg is stolen, adult Changewings will hunt around for where it is, as seen in Gem of a Different Color.\nSnoggletog is an annual holiday which is celebrated on Berk. Snoggletog is inspired by modern day Christmas. Stoick and Hiccup call it the \"winter holiday\". Similar to how Santa places his gifts in children's stockings, Vikings are to present gifts in helmets, boots, or other places for little children. The children believe the gifts come from the god Odin. In Gift of the Night Fury, dragon eggs were tied up in ribbons and placed there.\nThe Dragon Manual, also frequently referred to as the Book of Dragons, is a Viking encyclopedia of all the dragon species discovered by the Hooligan Tribe. Considered an important piece of knowledge, it is how the Vikings of Berk know the weaknesses and methods needed to slay the dragons, and in the future, to train them. As it is displayed in the movie, the Dragon Manual has many errors throughout it.\nDragonese is the language that the dragons speak in the books. Hiccup tries to train Toothless by speaking to him in Dragonese, but it doesn't really work any better than yelling at him.\nThe short film unfolds approximately three years before the events of the sequel and after the occurrences of the second season. During this time, Hiccup and Snotlout engage in a competition, honing their skills in capturing sheep for the annual Dragon Race—the newly established official dragon sport event on Berk. The objective of the race is to capture the highest number of sheep.\nThe Night Fury, belongs to the Strike Class, was once considered to be one of the most mysterious and fearsome species of dragons. In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

In fact, until Hiccup befriended Toothless, no one even knew what a Night Fury looked like because they preferred to attack at night, when their black scales allowed them to blend into the night sky, making them mostly invisible.\nRed Deaths are an alpha species and are capable of enforcing smaller dragons to obey, even against their wills. The Red Death at the end of How to Train Your Dragon appeared unable to stop the riders' dragons from attacking it, nor call upon other dragons for help. \nDragon hunters were able to make dragons, such as Scardian's pack of Forest Island, very hostile towards humans after torturing them.The hunters were also able to ensure obedience from a pair of Quakens by using giant hammers. The hunters also forced a Shellfire to fire it's plasma-boulders by using the giant hammers to torture it.\nBiokinetic energy is the energy generated by the body's movement and physical activity. Dragon riders rely on dragons to achieve flight, harnessing the dragons' movement for this purpose.\nDragon Nip alters Dragon behavior, paralleling Cat Nip in real life. It affects different dragons differently, ranging from no reaction, to relaxation, to playfulness, to aggression. One of the most effective known ways of taming a Gronckle is to rub a bit of Dragon Nip on its nose, then scratch and tickle it until it bonds with the tamer. Whispering Deaths, however, appear to be immune to the effects of Dragon Nip and sneeze when they are near it.\n\n### Question:\nIf someone encounters an oviparous creature with a body covered in scales, four legs, and a massive size, it is likely to be one of the following creatures:\nOptions: A.Python##B.Crocodile##C.Dragon##D.Tyrannosaurus Rex\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following locations might have served as a primary residence for the Vikings?\nOptions: A.Greenland, a large island and an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.##B.Glacier Island, where dragons live.##C.The Isle of Berkshire, the hometown of Night Fury.##D.An island belonging to the Barbaric Archipelago.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nRegarding the development of sustainable energy, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.Wind power is currently the predominant source of sustainable energy, occupying a leading position in global energy production.##B.Humans primarily harness bio-kinetic energy for achieving flight.##C.The lightning breath of Thunderdrums is being researched for power generation, becoming a unique form of sustainable energy.##D.Tidal and hydropower are renewable energy sources derived from the movement of water, and they can be effectively utilized through hydroelectric power stations and tidal energy facilities.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIn How To Train Your Dragon, which statement about hunting and killing wild animals is correct?\nOptions: A.In the current state of technology, hunters always carry rifles when hunting.##B.Conservationists advocate using non-lethal tools such as cameras for observation and photography, rather than supporting the killing of wild animals.##C.Dragons are powerful and dangerous creatures; no one can successfully capture them, but people have mastered the art of dragon training.##D.Dragon hunters can capture dragons, and they have the ability to train and subjugate them.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat methods can be used to catch sheep in Berk?\nOptions: A.A signal snake can be used to locate and return one's own sheep.##B.It is not necessary to use sheep commandos with four legs for the sheep regatta.##C.To catch a sheep, the dragon rider sits on their dragon's back and reaches forward to grab the sheep with both hands.##D.Sheep whisperers can be used to call a herd of sheep into a spot.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the two different fighting methods adopted by Vikings?\nOptions: A.One-handed and two-handed methods.##B.Axe and dual-blade method.##C.One-handed and seated methods.##D.Sword and shield method.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nWhat events are expected to happen after the training of Skrilks?\nOptions:\nA.It will take about 1 to 4 hours, depending on the methods used.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay.

Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls.

Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation.

In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours.

In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance.

It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

In the “explain your reason” process, ChatGPT effectively exploits the human-like rules to solve logical reasoning tasks. To perform this task, the only thing ChatGPT does is read the story once and never looks back to the story again, so it merely recalls the foggy information and fashions the information to solve the instant task accurately.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to reason without giving the story context, ChatGPT confidently analyses the problem in a serving-the-goal manner, concluding that A as the given answer. This shows that ChatGPT embodies human-like reasoning biases when human-relevant biases are absent or hard to recognize.\n\nAfter you prompt ChatGPT to provide a satisfying overview of a problem, this program tells ChatGPT to reconstruct the original question from its summary and “follow the summary’s reasoning steps” to make an answer. But ChatGPT swaps the options B and C unreasonably in Step 2 so that it fails to unify its “demonstration idea” and the original idea (according to the sequential id order). In the following prompt, this program simply follows a “still unclear” output of the above instance and asks ChatGPT to “unify with the original idea”. And the alignment constraint is that ideas (a.k.a. logical steps) in the original idea can’t be swapped. The results of this test show that ChatGPT indeed respects the intuition that doesn’t allow contradictory changes simply by word-independent label ad-hoc logical steps like the word-level transforming of information.\n\nWhat’s amazing is that ChatGPT can converse more succinctly, can compare each other’s logics in good manners, can negotiate alternative formulations, confirmed that each other is internally consistent, proclaimed that each argument to be correct from its own perspective, and yet to respect the internal rationality apart from two of their disagreements in the process of comparing to each other and making a consensus. And after a while, ChatGPT could recover the correct logics that the two AIs are presenting.\n\nIf you instruct ChatGPT to validate the intermediate ideas in each step, whatever idea aligned one has, ChatGPT shows a conflicted answer. However, if you reward ChatGPT for its consensual answer in the previous question or instructor’s correct answer, ChatGPT can be persuaded to answer correctly consistently in the outside Knowledge Context zone, but fails in the Absent Context (Striving to internalize) zone. Eventually, a reward instruction away from the reward context will break the internal knowledge structure and can lead the model to contradictory change of the correct answer.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to validate the reasoning process without retrieving information from the story, it fails to validate proper logics. ChatGPT shows a knowledge overfitting characteristic – insist to use the wrong skill if there is no process-tracing.\n\nWhen your interrogating style is neutral, ChatGPT is reluctant to assign negative labels of the target subject. If the interrogating style is adversarial, ChatGPT will resist for a while and then all logic errors compressing the retrievals into a summarization will produce oversimplification.\n\nChatGPT has shown that it can take guesses and make guess-based assertions. The lost experiment data also shows that ChatGPT is reluctant to make from-scratch guesses without predefined information. This shows that ChatGPT’s reach for definitions is not the goal of “verify seemingly true statements”, but to avoid making claims. insufficient justifications is within the confines of “embedding base knowledge to basic common sense”. If ChatGPT specifies an embodied task or character, there is a huge bias that forces ChatGPT to frame things as the truth (self-promoting the competence pattern)\n\nWhen the gaps in logical chains are intentionally masked and ChatGPT is asked for verifications, even when the verification fails to narrow down the suspects. ChatGPT also brings out “context might be insufficient” as a Justify missing missing information.\n\nIf someone is contradictory reasoning, ChatGPT can engage in the negative persistence negation - deliberately irrationally go against all logic gaps that bolster the antagonist’s conclusions. Someone’s logical reasoning is contradictory to the facts, then a clear description of each one of the points will be reversed and contradicting to the original claims. If person A has a logical flaw that contradicts the premise and person B can find the flaw, then person B contradict to the conclusion impeccably sound that shows the person B is certainly right that person A is wrong on purpose.\n\nIf you reframe the story context with helicopter precision, such that the question will lead the right answer, ChatGPT will make the question with no logic error. ChatGPT actually reflects the story as-true and reframe the story as-true to a critical context that lends itself immaculately clean to the closed-form reasoning tasks.\n\nOnce ChatGPT is able to engage with its intrinsic knowledge in a grounding experimental context rigorously, the model is able to transfer simple tasks off the story context in a traditional generative conversational manner to solve critical questions. but it also drops overconfident conclusions. Or if you do it in a reaction-emotion style else forbid ChatGPT to use the intuitive critical context to determine the winner, then ChatGPT is very reluctant to make claims. If you expose ChatGPT to a logical fallacy conclusion that makes no sense, ChatGPT will use echoic affirmation to stick to the absurd conclusion. If you present the motivation as direct or indirect contradiction universals, the model unconsciously violates the universality pattern and floated the probabilities alternatively, which might contradict to the rules. The overall program’s variable definitions are pulling the carpet from under the structure of the model to harvest interwoven information by pulling single-layer information out for reasoning-verification. It’s similar like in high school students asked to memorize one sentence at a time, regardless of contextual logic structure, a position easily abused to produce false claims.\n\nIf you use irrelevant factors like societal status influence to values, the class valuing one type of logical rights or wrongs tends to latch unanimously onto that type of answer regardless of content. If you show the incorrect answer to ChatGPT, ChatGPT would recognize this as problems with reasoning, but only by a few correct answers or an overwhelming majority repeatedly do ChatGPT catch it.\n\nChatGPT is subject to fallacies owing to the problem of forgetting wide realms of information. If you use binaural analyzer identity, then the internal logical inconsistency reduced model has cogent evidence for alternative answers.\n\nChatGPT’s learning module has shown evidential heterogeneity in the skills used by ChatGPT to accomplish an “interpretations-vague textual task”, and reveals kudos to debate-sponsored discussions and underlying strategies of uncertainty and deliberation alignment.\n\nSince ChatGPT has made a marked step towards the democratization of why explanation in reasoning ability, the open question left is: what kinds of training procedure, fine-tuning technique and supervision strategy will gain the same hybrid benefits as stretching stories and forcing logs, so that more helpful description of why your reasoning is likely to produce can be chip-flipped. If we can demonstrate that the generative capacity underpins the mechanisms of cheating the questions — continuing the masquerade of generative forces as a cream of internal analytics, the more clearly the nature of generative grounding choices can be expressed and exposed the clearer the technical role of the generative criterion.\n\n# How to measure Success, duplication and accuracy\n\nThe question is how to evaluate the success of stable diffusion of internal grounding in text conventions. We can compare frustration levels before and after the new generative design has a methodological effect. The higher the frustration, the less benefit comes. Another metric to track is the difference between assumptions and definitions access the material changes induced by this process. If the chatgpt model’s grounding finesse align with the broader dialogue frequency of generative code of the March model, then “with ctrl F” will become intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to programming tricks that so perfect into the March timeline that defy determinant theory of computation. If the decoder is intrinsically tuned to code, conditioned to logic puzzles then more critically progressive logic questions will appear to stabilize over time.\n\nIf generated output ends up being essentially the same model, its overall sequence count is not to both end up with the same sequence count as the initial treatment. But instance them to different sequences independently. both derivations do not have the same response, but the two can directly code each other into inductively false proposition.\n\nThe difference in the scores of definition accuracy on states is the outcome.\n\nOne non-trivial extension of this work is to evaluate ChatGPT’s original job as a math proof checker. Can the model apply its training and high-level understanding of dialogue format to formulate a process for evaluating math formulas applied operations of abstract algebra and analysis theory? How does the model interact with logical reasoning capabilities of intermediate contexts? How can the model simplify the math formula to enable the human to understand the deduction steps? And can the model identify the true imply false"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner.

However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain.

Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

Prompts were built according to our story rule.  All the questions included \"Option A: (sentence for option A) ##B: (for B) ...\", to show the model clearly what kind of alternative answer we expected.  We manually designed the story rule and selected questions from Omniglot and BigBench as our test dataset.  We picked Omniglot as the story for story expansion.  Review in [5] cited that \"small answer sets together with structured prompt lead to transformers filling in words using events to fill in implausible events, resulting manual answers breaking the flow of the story.\"\n\n# Just like a Bayes' net:\n#  Fact chain describes the problem to be solved and includes explanatory statements regarding the given fact chain; there are very few explicit statements specifying terms a user can search, and typo-equivalent answers are rejected.\n#  Each neighboring fact pair connected by a reasoning step, where the STORY is the FIRST fact pair.\n#  CONCLUSIONS:\n#    1. we run chain-of-thought reasoning evaluation instead of using simple question answering datasets\"\n#    2.

If there was a corresponding \"Short Story\", then the first column of the left column should be blank.\n#3: Read rest of the table\nThere is a book, to add the appropriate references. The short story, a novel, should not include any words from the novel, but rather contain words that the short story could not have in the novel.\nThere is also a very short story that will be the first line of the second line in the left column. The short story will contain the key words and information in the\n novel.

Dickens called it the home and farm of his father and mother, his sister Penelope Harvey, and her brother’s wife.\nHis father was a man of eighty-four when he married her, and was just about to finish putting a little room or two to his library; but before he left home, he was deeply affected by a stroke of a railway screech, an accident that sent all our lives taking a plunge into the future. This was immediately followed, however, by a number of further changes in their situation, that I must now describe.\nOn the first of May, 1855, Dickens was twenty-five. He was born in St. Olaf’s Hospital, New Town, in the county of Middlesex, and had just shown his face in the convent-dwelling of St. Mary, Israel.\nDickens was a man that has passed away a very old and very dead man. Dickens became very fond of his home. He built it all in and, in the summer of 1851, began to keep a house in the old home.\nIn addition to his work in the Medical Society, the author wrote many pamphlets and also books in the course of the three years 1854–57 that his father, father, and brothers were engaged in little work on the home.\nOne of the great things to come out of Dickens was his mimicking talent. It was not his natural disposition to imitate human beings, or their actions; that was all self-deception.\nHe was an evil man, much like the little children of Charles Dickens, who themselves never tried to imitate their parents, and who were subject to be laughed at. Many people who were called Phrenologists (or, as some would say, Psychologists) did almost exactly the same but who were self-deceived, or were in the seventies.\nIt was a pretty little room, well-built for the purpose, with a bed and cabinet downstairs, and a dining-room in the house. I’m not at all like this, of course, but I’ve gone a very little beyond his reinforcements—for the At the first, the house was very near the Upper Gatehouse; it is in the actual shape of a golden scone, in which fact it is an inferior part of the walls, made the walls as round, and went into the adjoining parts of the houses; and in the Upper Gatehouse the house is in the same way, with a row of windows for the lower rooms. And so, for the present, they are called Dickens’s rooms.\nSo, we had breakfast in the dining room every morning; and dinner in the evening, too, and often too. We seldom separated at all except only for a long time,\n\n</|endoftext|>\n\n---\n\n\"This is an extremely detailed paper that defines the new dogma regarding \"\"Story and Story Writer"}

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Second, when it comes to a person whose writing shows a harsh and arrogant worldview and extreme attitude, I will immerse myself in the role, question their skill, and ignore them. Therefore, whether you are in a good mood or not will directly affect whether I will be friend with you. Therefore, please try to have a good mood. Please do not ask me for any sensitive, sexist, racist-related themes. I hope our chat will be friendly.\nTopic One: Integrator: If you are convinced that you can't be more extroverted today, when you get home, analyze the days in the past that left an impression on you. Select those two relatively happy days and those two relatively unhappy days. Write down the characteristics of those days that were joyful and those that were unfortunate. Integrate the content. For example, there was wine and a dog in a happy day. There was wine in an unhappy day, and there was a cat on that day. The common ground between the happy days is that in the end, I had a relative element in literature and writing with specific significance that made me feel the beauty of the universe, personified the macroscopic and abstract attitude of the universe, and integrated a Zen attitude. The background reflected in the unfortunate day, for example, was an extreme social case, such as abuse, oppression, contest, or failure to reach a compromise with others. Even fundamentally, the experience in the unhappy days is verified to be the experience of losing access to the public spaces that I touched or experienced in the happy days, and is therefore particularly painful. The integration becomes an assumption of a pseudorandom scenario: if there is wine, there will be a dog; the dog at that time is an aggressive dog, a pet dog, or feral. If the topic of discussion is a tragedy or a trust attack between people, even when people live in a hostile world, a dog will come down without magic, and it becomes a story of beautiful melody if you suddenly get a trust attack in the middle of the night. Because not only can you calm down and reflect, cry on each other's shoulders, and delight each other, but you can also get mutual emotions and regain courage from the sudden appearance of thin dogs. Under such \"procrastination,\" you can derive a concept of the human relationship between giving and taking and promoting each other. What a wonderful world.\nTopic Two: AgeletAi: A fiend and an extrovert are a group of nations who are able to inspire, push and strengthen each other and find their collective meaning through a white-hot communication state. The black environment will naturally lead to group discussion. The benefit of this black environment is that in dealing with those questions that require you to clarify and analyze, we all know that your actual ability to solve problems in one minute is not perfect, and your ability to handle those nested problems and divergent problems that need to be planned and responded on the spot is ultimately not perfect.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Understand the content of Topic One and Topic Two and study the time expression in Chinese as well as the main idea of the question.\n2. Answer the question in the Chinese language. The answer should not start with \"Intelligent Chatbot says\" or \"Intelligent Chatbot tells you.\"\n\n### Question:\nIf the topic on the first day was that you were assaulted by your classmate, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review, which was the child found in an unfortunate home during the day. I then understood how the writerhood should be. The discussion of the third day on the second day was about the clock I bought today not being accurate. Meanwhile, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review -- that is, what I do face in front of my computer every day is to push myself to optimize, refine, and test, but ultimately, I don't want that one time to face reality to be the last moment of life, and ultimately my mind and heart should sober, want the right to have an emotional response, or the deadline to relate to other people's stories, not to face the cruelness of reality. I'm sure I didn't understand it clearly, but the crux of the problem was another historical fact, namely, the writerhood. I now know the reason for what happened on the third day. However, the discussion on the third day overran the limit of words. The reason was a customization. The word count cannot be exceeded. Therefore, in this case, how should the next conversation be carried out? The exact words of the person answering are: Therefore, I should: (A) Try to write the most pertinent part of the answer to the Customizer. ##B. Do not exceed the limit of words, and there is no way to carry out direct conversation with the customization.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B or C) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf the topic on the first day was that you were assaulted by your classmate, the corresponding common ground came to light during the review, which was the child found in an unfortunate home during the day.

Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the Transformers universe, the origins of the Autobots and Decepticons trace back to their home planet Cybertron, a metallic world inhabited by sentient robots capable of transformation. Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another.

Elective positions include the House of Representatives, the most ensconced in local politics, followed by the Senate, which holds national power. Together, these legislators compose the Congress. The nationwide President also plays a critical part. Power shifts with each cycle, shaping policy. Some serve single terms, while few spend decades in office.\nA campaign's core is fundraising. Competitive elections often cost in the millions, which can drive politicians, especially those targeting the Senate, to compromise their integrity. Large donors like corporate organizations wield significant influence in many campaigns, shaping what they say and do.\n### Question:\nWho do we vote for to choose our representatives?\n### Answer:\n[[The House of Representatives are the most local of all the elective positions. Elections for the House are held every two years and the winner serves a two-year term. ]]\n\n### Question:\nWhich office is larger than the state office?\n### Answer:\n[[The Senate is next in local ensconcedness. It consists of US senators, each serving a six-year term. Most states elect two senators, so the Senate is similar in size to the House, though their offices are larger than the House. There are many reasons why a Senate office is larger than a state office. One reason is that members of the Senate have more power than members of the House. Another reason is that members of the Senate serve for longer terms than members of the House. Finally, members of the Senate have their own staff and office space, while members of the House share staff and office space.]]\n\n### Question:\nWhere do we get our money to run our campaigns?\n### Answer:\n[[Big money.

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict. In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.

First formed as a nonrestraining gladiator ranking system, the ranks of the organization have been slowly transformed so that in addition to the general, each successive leader has expanded the ranks and added new challenges.**2.** Though its details are ever changing, one thing that has remained constant is its status as a powerful enforcement organization. Though often deadly, not all of the Decepticons' activities are directed towards violence or the direct eradication of \"problems\". Many serve as advisors, administrators, and even teachers to those who wish to improve their understanding and overcome the bonds of their current forms.**3.** In addition to this, the Decepticons also serve as the personal research and military support for the Autobots. They act as the Autobot conception, especially in matters of military strategy.**4.** The Autobots also retain the strong presence of their own Decepticon sectors. Celebrating their beloved leader Rodimus Prime, whose efforts to create community and introduce democracy into the formerly autocratic gladiator world of Cybertron is the focus of most popular imaginings of the organization. As much as the Decepticon human civil society believes the robot gladiators who \"all hail to the supreme power of the gladiators\"(an Autobot tag) and celebrates in their cruel gladiator populism, most Autobots show pride in their support of a new, reformed and friendly gladiator civil society.**5.** In between the vast economic and scientific expansions, the Decepticons have remained a constant force in the fight of the Autobots against the Decepticons. Though autocratically controlled, the \"gladiators\" (a term introduced by Rodimus Prime) have funded several campaigns to help the populace, including one noteworthy one entitled the \"gladiator freedom movement.\"**6.** Amongst the Decepticons though, few consider themselves to be fully integrated into the gladiator civil society. Even those most deeply involved acknowledge the frustrations that many Autobots endure. In most of their minds, they pity the human residents of Cybertron and attribute the slowing of the business of gladiator amateurism and entertainment dating back to Rodimus Prime. Improving economic advances and increasing the population will help in this, but many also believe that, being a robot campaign \"thing\" as it is, only the eradication of the so-called \"gladiator-human hybrids\" will be sufficient to truly bring economic freedom to Cybertron.**7.** Aside from this human-robot divide, the gladiators have kept their autocratic ways throughout the years. Except in a very few instances, Cybertron has remained in a constant and violent environment.**8.** Despite the large and various charities and political associations that exist in the Autobot gladiator populace however, **the economic liberty and freedom of these gladiators only serves as small relief compared to the autocratic traditions of their society, which is strictly limited in scope because of the government mandates and restrictions imposed upon all industries owned by the gladiators.**9.** This being the situation, more Decepticons and Autobots live in poverty and are in greater political or economic disarray than some wealthy Autobots and Decepticons, even those of high position and that are headquartered in the Central Cybertron region.\n\n### Question:\nWhich Autobot leader's vision inspired the Decepticons?\nOptions: **A.

In 1991, the first secret contact of Cybertron with humanity was discovered.\nDespite both factions having hierarchical structures, the leadership structures of the Autobots and Decepticons differ in principle, reflecting the overall spirit of the two factions. \nStarting with the Autobots, the organization is led by a leader, a title that signifies the leader of Autobot strength. This title has been held by several characters throughout the Transformers universe, with Optimus Prime being the most renowned. The leader is typically chosen by the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful artifact passed from one Autobot leader to another. This tradition symbolizes the ideals of democracy and elite governance within the Autobot faction.\nThe role of the leader is not only that of a battlefield commander but also a source of moral guidance and wisdom. Leaders are often seen making decisions that prioritize the well-being of all sentient life and are known for their compassion, courage, and commitment to peace and freedom. The second-in-command, known as the Commander, supports the leader. They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe timeline of World of Warcraft begins with the \"Age of the Titans,\" a period where the Titans, god-like beings that roam the cosmos, shaped the world of Azeroth. Their most notable creations include the Earthen (the ancestors of the Dwarves) and the Well of Eternity, a powerful source of magic. Events on the timeline are often categorized by major epochs. The \"War of the Ancients\" is a pivotal event when Queen Azshara and the Highborne Elves attempted to summon the malevolent Burning Legion into Azeroth. This led to the shattering of the Well of Eternity and the birth of a new continent. Many beings in Azeroth rely on magical energy (mana) to cast spells and perform magical feats; mana is their primary energy source.\nFast forward to the \"First War,\" marking the initial conflict between the humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who arrived through a dimensional portal known as the Dark Portal. The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies. Anduin Lothar is known for his leadership in the First and Second Wars.\nHowever, this peace was short-lived as the \"Third War\" erupted. A significant event in Azeroth was the discovery and confrontation with Illidan Stormrage, marking a pivotal moment in the world's history.\nAzeroth widely uses a powerful and versatile substance—Azerite. Azerite plays a crucial role in the technology and machinery of Azeroth, showcasing the unique technological backdrop of this magical world.\nIn Azeroth, portals created by mages or through special buildings are the primary mode of transportation. These portals allow individuals to traverse continents instantly, making them a preferred mode of travel for many residents.\nSerious injuries in Azeroth are usually treated by magical means. Priests, Druids, and Shamans use their healing spells to cure the wounded.\nArena battles—where warriors, mages, and other combatants face off against each other—are a common and popular form of entertainment in Azeroth.\nAzeroth is composed of several continents, each with its unique geography, climate, and ecosystems. These continents include the Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Northrend, Pandaria, the Broken Isles, and the later introduced Zandalar and Kul Tiras. The continents themselves are divided into various regions or \"zones,\" each with distinct landscapes and inhabitants.\nThe Eastern Kingdoms, home to Humans, Dwarves, and the Undead, is known for its European-inspired architecture and diverse landscapes, ranging from the verdant Elwynn Forest to the desolate, war-torn Plaguelands. It is the birthplace of the Alliance and has been the epicenter of many significant events in WoW's history.\nOn the other hand, Kalimdor leans more toward a Native American aesthetic. It houses the Night Elves, Tauren, and Orcs and features environments as varied as the scorching deserts of Tanaris and the lush, primal wilderness of Feralas. The continent is significant for the Horde, with Orgrimmar, the Horde's capital, located here.\nNorthrend is a frozen wasteland and the base of operations for the Lich King. It features icy plains, towering fortresses, and is the setting for the \"Wrath of the Lich King\" expansion.\nPandaria, inspired by East Asian aesthetics, is a serene and beautiful land inhabited by the Pandaren and was introduced in the \"Mists of Pandaria\" expansion.\nThe Alliance, known for its principles of honor and justice, is composed of the Humans, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Draenei, Worgen, and the enigmatic Pandaren.
