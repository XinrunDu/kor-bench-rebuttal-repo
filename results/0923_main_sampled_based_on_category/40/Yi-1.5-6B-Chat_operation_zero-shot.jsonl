However, there's a mistake in the given equation because log₂₅₆(65536) cannot equal 73 / 24 due to the definition of the operation itself. The operation rule states that a￠b = logₘₐ + logᵃₘ, so the left side of the equation should be log₂₅₆(X) + logᵃ₂₅₆(X).\n\nLet's correct the equation:\n\nlog₂₅₆(X) + logᵃ₂₅₆(X) = 73 / 24\n\nThis equation tells us that X is the number such that the sum of its logarithm to bases 2 and 256 equals 73/24. However, since X is not given to be an integer in the question, and the operation rule is designed for positive integer bases, we cannot directly solve for X in terms of a simple integer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given rule and the corrected equation, we cannot find a simple integer value for X that satisfies the equation as it stands. There seems to be a misunderstanding or incorrect formulation of the problem as presented. The operation rule and the question do not align in a way that allows us to directly solve for X as an integer."}

Let's re-evaluate the imaginary part of the equation:\n\n2X = 4\nX = 4 / 2\nX = 2\n\nThe mistake was in the initial assumption that the imaginary parts should match.
