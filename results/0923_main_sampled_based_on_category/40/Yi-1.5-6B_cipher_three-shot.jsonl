The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

This answer was obtained by reversing the encryption process and replacing the characters in the ciphertext with the corresponding characters on the outer_disk and inner_disk.\n\nThe provided code and mapping are not correct as you have already informed that they provide the wrong answer. The mapping uvwcmywqwo used in the code returns the string \"SSER\", which matches the expected decrypted answer. However, using this mapping instead of the correct one causes the error.\n\nTo provide the correct answer, we need to use the mapping /oqvgzckzb. With this mapping, we can decrypt the ciphertext \"PZOZI\" as follows:\n\n- P changes to O (C indicates that P is at the 3rd position on the outer_disk after encryption and /o)\n- Z changes to O (G indicates that Z is at the 17th position on the outer_disk after encryption and z)\n- O changes to I (F indicates that O is at the 14th position on the outer_disk after encryption and o)\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n**Plaintext:** SSER"}

If the length of the Morse code is odd, the last character, without the following mapping, is finally added to the end of the ciphertext.\n    - Each pair of characters is converted into a corresponding numeric string according to the numeric index mapping table.\n    - The encrypted message is represented by a string.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - Numerical-Index Mapping Table (Same as encryption)\n    - morse_code Table (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Each digit in the ciphertext is converted to the corresponding character pair according to the digit-index mapping table. If there is a non-numeric character at the end of the ciphertext, it is not processed. By this point, the complete Morse code is obtained.\n    - Obtain the Morse code for each character by splitting the Morse code by /.\n    - Convert the Morse code of each character to the corresponding plaintext character according to the morse_code table.\n    - The final plaintext character is an uppercase string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[./.]]\nBased on the information provided, here's a simplified version of the rules:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Blue: Prepare the morse_code Table and Numerical-Index Mapping Table.\n2. Blue: Take the plaintext and convert each character to its corresponding Morse code, adding a / between each character.\n3. Blue: Divide the Morse code into two pairs of characters. Convert them into their corresponding numeric strings using the Mapping Table.\n4. Purple: Join the numeric strings into a single string, adding an extra .. if the input text length is odd.\n5. Green: Divide the ciphertext into pairs of digits.\n6. Green: Convert each pair to its corresponding character pair using the Mapping Table.\n7. Green: Combine the character pairs to form the final morse_code, adding an extra / if the input ciphertext length is odd.\n8. Purple: Convert each character pair of morse_code to its Uppercase counterpart using the morse_code table.\n9. Green: Join the plaintext characters to form the final output.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThese rules represent the simplified workflow of the cipher. The steps are clear and concise. However, for greater clarity and precision, adding the functions used to improve understanding can be helpful. For instance, a \"convert_morse\" function could be defined for step 9 (Purple) to demonstrate how the characters are converted back to their uppercase counterparts in the plaintext.\n\n### Rule Variations:\n\n1. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in decryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n2. The character i '.' maps directly to 7 in the decryption step, bypassing the numeric-index mapping table.\n3. The keyword is also applied as a dictionary key to access the corresponding morse_code in encryption, instead of using the numeric-index mapping table.\n4. Adding an additional step in the decryption process to handle the extra '/' symbol if the input ciphertext has an odd number of digits doesn't impact the accuracy of the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Changes in Explanation:\n\n1. The rule variations no longer apply to the simplified rules, as they are beyond the scope of the simplification process.\n\nThe modified rules and explanation clarify the simplified workflow of the Keyword Exclusive _Tagram Cipher, while ensuring they adhere to the question restrictions."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The key is derived from a password or a shared secret key using the SHA-256 hash algorithm.\n\n**Encryption:**\nGiven a plaintext and a user-provided key in the **key = ...** line, it sha-hashed the key, then encrypted the input using bitwise different-or with the key byte by byte (recycling the key as needed). The resulting bytes are then converted to a hexadecimal representation for ciphertext output.\n####\nPlaintext: D\nCiphertext: 37\n\nCiphertext: 32\nPlaintext: A\n\nCiphertext: 27bf7e\nPlaintext: TPT\n\nCiphertext: 3a\nPlaintext: SAM\n\nPlaintext: I\nCiphertext: 63\n\nCiphertext: 6f3bd2ca2\nPlaintext: HAS\n\nCiphertext: 79c6f7bd19f\nPlaintext: WHO\n\nPlaintext: A\nCiphertext: 27\n\nCiphertext: 779affd6ee7\nPlaintext: HKD\n\nPlaintext: ZFN"}
