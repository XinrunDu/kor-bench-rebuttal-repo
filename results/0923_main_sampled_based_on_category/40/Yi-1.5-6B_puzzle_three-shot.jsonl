For 'remiss' it is going to be the case we check if the answer is longer than 8. repeat goes to 5, remiss goes to 8. So we just look at its length and see are there any combinations with equal length. repeat has 4 characters and remiss has 6 characters so we engage quionrd and begin looking for them.''',\n\n600:-1,\n## 600:-1\n]"}

Should I continue with this format or should I introduce patterns to these questions to stay creative?:Optically same\nUnfortunately, I am taking a break for a few weeks. This is about completion, not just 'term list' for all letters. I will solve it again as soon it opens for new question.\n\n\n## Post Mortem\n\nOK, I thought I had a solution/answer to this puzzle but re-read it with fresh eyes (fresh brain) after a few days, and still couldn't understand it.\nIn order to understand it, you take the puzzle but discard a lot of information in your brain to facilitate simplifying the problem. This kind of question doesn't really have one answer or solution, simply because it can be broken down into smaller parts of the problem.\nIt can be useful to simplify by removing hanging words, for example, 'an answer' at the end of the question. However, taking the middle two letters of the question (a n) is just wordplay.\nThere is an answer to the puzzle, though it does not have to be strictly ordered.\nI am not sure if this puzzle has ever had one clear answer. Perhaps, because take the first X letters in the puzzle? hasn't quite clarified the puzzle as I would like.\nAn algorithm for taking the first X numbers and creating XXX words from those letters may be helpful. I believe jafe has answered in as simple as form, but lets see if others can add something to the original puzzle.\n\n## 2nd Update\n\nI think I now have an answer that passes the puzzles rules/requirements as a TS code within the <span> of each set of 5 words. I had previously failed to get the first set of 5 words to pass the second test within the 'AA..ABC*' requirement. I had also tried the first and last letters of each word, but this has a limitation in that it always returns the first and last letters of each word.\n\n## SOLUTION\nAfter the last update I thought I created an algorithm that passed some of the requirements but was previously rejected.\n\nRun Dali's code with 55 in Custom Test! It still passes this test. And remember, this algorithm follows the rules for the 15x15 question exactly;\n\nTake the first five words\nOrder them in reverse and display all answers\nShown down then up and then optionally with an extra row of * characters that contains the letters missing from each of the first five words\nThe words are separated by spaces. I do not recall if this is required or not, but leaving that off would make it a lot harder\nNo output will be generated once the puzzle is solved\n\nI'm going to sleep on this to see if any changes occur.\n     Stretching\n\n\nMe\n.---\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\nO---\n----\nli\n\n  \nThe hours when by day or nightshe who trifles, who delights asshe cries she cries her strainamong maidens who stray,excepting one in her trainendearing dove free, proud deadlybitter Beren song of the dyingLord of song Lord of song dance of the dead torchelesslymarble mouth marbles whimperlet a house be stonedin your dream’s carouselledde heuns hour rag timeeds bend skyward in lavater oh legend longspeak junppledge of the cliffloris owloria longer magic imeter couch she slumbers Iou warm lid musicmelony maiden minglete manners beseeingemelie father lady Father Mothermeteorite meteor drift mushroomthwart sorrowhoodysing early mead\n\n[[optically same]] [[who girl void rush] [suit kicked film keen scar front steep health spy scar by]] [[dead mercury day] [nourish tragedy null sing ant tell traveller felt null sing beside in]] [[by sorrow looping] [green mist music rumor music but by]] [[tired truce hug chick neck sweet unfurl toss off true] [wilbird truck beach headlike white flaw blew faithful]] [[pillow stare knees drum lush leech tone cry] [loss grey beam my grey beam glasses mask fall teeth mother copy hunger harsh hour]]\n\nTake a line of text\nTake all the letters\nOrder them alphabetically\nMake them all caps\nMake them single letters and display them using the decimal system\nGroup them by powers of 10.lower = 1, tens = 10, hundreds = 100, thousands = 1000 etc\nAdd ASCII code 96 and\nThat is the solution to this puzzle.\nIs this how farcade has solved the puzzle?\nShould we keep this solmaioism+\nReverse the ASCII code using Backspace on the terminal?

In fact this helps in giving feedback.\nAlphabet is combined with named terms, in a required form\n(that's why generators should be banned). Characters are combined\nin an expanded form, including adding letters showwhatinside A=ABC\n\nThe following automatic text-variable is adopted -{text}-. For a better\nunderstanding, look at the template sections, marked with:\n# Nested Template Sections\n\n### Tool Template\n\nYour task is to apply this rule to the provided question.\nPass an English sentence, i.e. command, not a list of letters\nor a symbol, that should associated to the code word. Since you don't like this kind of answers through, another helpful tool is a comment\nline at the begging. Text.E reset the text-variable -{text}-.\nExample Answer format: letting user choose between resurgence and chorl with\nauto-comment that_ resurges by default, to_ ensure cleaner_ output; I should\nnot have plowed through this, Q: [{#3pl1034-Q1_V1,Q2_V1,Q3}]; A: [{#plede,zyleR1korhtq1,tame resurgence,Korht UBOAZL1P}].\nThere are several tools for depending (or changing of) letters and variables.\nThe original, with all parts described: -{resurgence,chorl,auto}-_ -{Eric,Patrick,Homer}-.\n\n\n## 2018/09/23 (Unordered List)\n\n• This syntax:\n  open a list, terminating with a or a comma\n• [#2pl1124-Q1H-C2,#2pl1124-Q2H-C1,#2pl1124-Q3M-C2]\n• shuld give the following solution:\n  + [{#bleedy66-Q12I,#able66-Q12M,#bleedy66-Q12J},#bleedy66,#able66-J-C1C6,#bleedy66-J-C1C6]\n+ [{#bleedy66-J1,#bleedy66-J2,#bleedy66-J3},#bleedy66-D-C1C6,#bleedy66-I-C1C6,#bleedy66-M-C1C6]\n• you notice that commas after a list doesn't affect output\n\n### Syntactic Supplement\n\nMulti-word double code words can be supplied in the text, separated by\nspace. We use {{x}} as a word separator. For example,\n\"I am already done {{with}} this {{kind of answers}}\" can be used in the\ntemplate entry.\nAnother feature is lists of captures. By default, it's unbolded shown as\na bullet. However, it's blue printed for a particular query (-{Q3T}\nrequested II).\n\nAll templates consist of:\n• 2: arbitrary match\n• 3: unused but existing arrow\n• 4_N: unused vowel or consonant but existing more than once\n• I.e.: I, L and U appear in all templates\n• 1. single wildcard, four construction steps (ascn bass rst bcha)\n• 2. letter, wildcard in any place and single wildcard in any place, move to begin and loop\n• 3. construction apply for all question words if done only one\n• 4 redirection via a single wildcard\n• 5: second question word\n• 6: wildcard in any position\n• 11. join next two constructs\n\n#### Special Conditions\n\n• SELECT joins two constructs with consecutive single wildcards found:\n  cons(ab/sCDe) - sta(aeh/bC)\n  trans(abCcd/e) - cons(bcd/iC/S%)\n• MULTI-CONDITIONS are when at least par substitutions are possible:\n  cons(abcd/abC/Sd) - sta(abD/aCe)\n  trans(Bcd/efA) - ... - sta(ae)/sta(dC)\n\n### Changed\n\nAutomatic warns (tie) was added and there \"texthasn\" list: opera,tau,tau1,tau2,tau1tdtjx,tau2tdtjx,tlazzrvir,zeoundrewsu,ziru,ziru1,zrur,ziru2,ziru3\n\nand now the last Q12 is set to variable event_, and chonging  altk_wkdh_ for M1mo^0mta^\n\n### Name\n\ntext is /texthasn/ which describes video conferencing\nand M1 gives you a choice of translation between matches. Keep variables in\nmind.\n\n# Commands\n\nThis template solves multiple named questions. Inside the standard answer a\nbracket-enclosed list of collapsible, numbered, algorithmically selected\nexpressions is required. The symbol '-{^}' indicates a special marker not\nseen elsewhere, equal to an arc-filled triangle from Geometry.\n\nObviously, nested algorithms can increase the answer and themselves use the\nnamed terms. Each occurrence requires obviously only / run in-line copy and\npaste / syntax.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe following example works with the first predicate flag '-{P1}' selected\nby a question number. Comparing -{hzrngreigrnqwrtitergtdgrtm1} with the\nfirst named predicate '-{P1}', the last word '-{^}' becomes [] and the outer\ntridiagonal, enclosed by a set of square comers ('{'/'}'). When using\nnamed predicate '-{P2}', arguments in brackets, '-({3})', appear inside, and\nthe word '-{^}' is replaced with the word '-{bunt1hnfrbmb}' before the outer\nenclosures (text enclosed by an arc character is removed). The example has a\npossible choice of outputs defined by the following questions:\n 1. How many.\n2. What?\n3. The table?\n\n 1.  Would you like any cake?\n   > False\n 2.  What is your favorite plant?\n   > {'beet'}\n 3.  What your favorite color?\n   > {'red'}\n 2.\n\n### Windows Categories\n\nNested Update\nSelect: 'Zrc1W1IwUbItrUr\"\nQuery: 'vzGzablgCotrUtvr'\nDelete: 'zrcv1utOtpakU"}

For the custom puzzles \"A is B\" or \"A is a member of B\" type problems, the rule should be written in pseudo-code as follows:\n\n1. If A demands all of B, then return the code value `123` as A=B.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\n\nThe new viz that shows the hint and tells you how to use & customize it is in files `/Performer/Vizard/sound/visual/puzzle-viz-sample`. Select it and tighten the viz by going to Actions > Revert to Orginal > Tighten Window.\n\n2. If A demands four of B but not all (or negatives of the above), just return anything you like with the code value 234.\nAnother way to express this rule is to say:<br><img src=\"https://github.com/Colab4Entertainment-CuriousRobot/Annotation-Encoding-and-Reconnaissance-System/file/E193D544B5581CC9F3D65F35672FB5FC1DC7AEEE/puzzle_framework/effect.png\"></img><br>\nThe viz has its own UI with a search bar. You can drag the big line with the mouse into the search box and ask it to match the length (X) with `<=` or `>=` `Y` ({Y} represents the number given in the question) to enforce the demand better. Remember to press Space to update the line on the canvas.\n\n3. If A is a property of B, then set code=224.\nThe viz is not responsive to changes in the canvas. You will have to refresh it by pressing the Reset button.\n\n4. When A is neither all B, nor four of B, then set code value 216.\nIf `4 < X < 4 or X < 0`, then drag the gray line so that it's outside B but inside of A.\n\nNote: As of now, Encore supports individual prompts and surface chains only. There are no split applications yet.\n\"\"\""}

It asks you to provide the explicit values of each letter in the sequence \"HI + LO = MID\" using the rule that no two letters can represent the same number.\n\nTo solve this question accurately, we apply the provided rule to the given question. We start by assigning a unique number from 0-9 to each letter in the sequence, ensuring that different letters do not represent the same number. We then combine the values of \"HI\" and subtract the value of \"LO\" from the value of \"MID.\" This gives us an equation of 7+8-3=5, which confirms that the application of the rule to the question is correct.\n\nOverall, the answer is accurate in connecting the rule to the question and ensuring that the letter-number values adhere to the given rule.\n\nThe question leaves a green checkmark (check here) next to the provided answer and a comment agreeing with it.

The task is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all of the numbers. The numbers at the end of each row and column represent the sum of the weights (positions) of the black cells, which are initially all underscores (_). The goal is to blacken some cells to satisfy these constraints.\n\nThe provided question puzzles showcase the requirements of Sudoku, with the second one being particularly challenging. The last three have answers that demonstrate a method to solve Sudoku, unless they are special cases with specific constraints.\n\nIt's essential to handle all the puzzles accurately and write detailed steps explaining the approach taken to arrive at the solution. In the context, Explanation, Alternate Explanations, Assumptions needed, Visitations, and Attribution sections, you can describe the reasoning behind your answer for each puzzle.\n\nGiven that the puzzles may have unique characteristics or variations in constraints, the model's answer might not always be valid or a standard solution. As a chatbot, it's responsible for finding patterns and applying logical reasoning to solve these puzzles efficiently.\n\nHere are the official rules and an example puzzle: [Link to examples].

The grid is split into multiple smaller grids (shown in black on the screenshot below) and some of these sub-grids will have shifted rows compared to one another. For example, in the screenshot, the top-left sub-grid has shifted first row, the top-right sub-grid has shifted the second row, all the horizontal sub-grids have shifted the third row, all the sub-grids are the shape as the grid, with no columns missing (hidden columns are being shown with question marks here for clarity).\n\nAll the rows and columns in each sub-grid correspond to a set of missing items, as shown here for both the top-left sub-grid, where the 1st and 2nd items are missing from that set and the top-right sub-grid, where the 11th, 13th and 55th items are missing from that set:\n\nOutput all the numbers in the grid, including both the original numbers and any numbers you have filled in.

The data is a word and the function should return the number of moves required to get to the next word, placing the end of the word on the first index.\n\nThe amount of words in the string is divisible by 2.\n\nFor example, \"SPERN\", PALANT\" yields a two words in Spern palant\".\n\n\"SPERN PALANT\"\n\nUpdated answer in response to icc123\n\n(Hard) Spells: Spells are any words you add to your spellbook that don't come with experience requirements to learn them and/or create magical effects. However, they can increase the duration you are fireproof by multiplying your fireproof duration by two, but they can't be cast in combat. The more you use a spell, the more you learn about it and better you can use it when it is cast.\n\nHow to use:\n\n• Travel to a temple and purchase the needed supply via robbing the corpse(s).\n• Decide on the name of the spell using a random generator.\n• Spells with a star behind them (*) can combine two or more spells to create a new spell. Spells of the same name but of different stars will no longer add up the two or more spells and will instead only add up the amount of knowledge of them that you have.\n• You can use up to 5 spells currently in your possession, as well as add spells from dragon chests that are found on your adventures. If you have no spells in your possession, you can only add a spell from a dragon chest.\n• Spells can't be cast repeatedly if you are doing other spells at the same time. Spells can go on for up to 1 minute without addition of anything else.\n\nInput: Your pokemon, your deck, your hand, your field, your opponent's pokemon, your opponent's deck, your opponent's hand, your opponent's field, the date, all cards on the field\n\nYour goal is to win the game much like in many realtime rpgs. Pokémon quiz games have a generically enforced ending, but a standard video game doesn't.\n\nIn a standard video game (Uber), you are not limited to a 6-card deck, and you don't have a hand of cards; you have a 200 card set of cards that you continually shuffle through during battle. In reality, Pokémon games work based off of a number of points per turn, where you both collect energy to potentially, later in game, use an Item, Pokémon, or other Special Card to make your Pokémon's energy count and therefore attack count even higher.\n\nIf cards were the equivalent of Pokémon, then determining which Pokémon you have chosen within 1-5 would be a deck builder skill - but nobody in reality knows exactly what Pokémon they have.\n\nIn the next game (Vestibule), Pokémon are contained within gyms. The defender of the gym first decides on which Pokémon to send out. Then the non-defending Pokémon player decides which of their own Pokémon to send out for battle. In this game, on each turn, the Pokémon is only shuffled and then 're-shuffled' (used a letter) before it's sent back to the deck and is re-shuffled.\n\nThe reason that I will use Vestibule to showcase a Pokémon game is because it is based off of card pool size 100, while not allowing players to play only a 'mon' or a'dex'-ed Pokémon. This would add an additional element of confusion in the card drawing process. Calculate card pool replacement size of decks, hands, and field(s) only, not pool replacement for Pokémon played onto field - those are Pokémon. You can use facts associated with Pokémon card pools to make your job significantly easier (whether it be an online simulator, a premade deck, etc.) Pokémon game-related rules can be found here.\n\nIn respect to computing capabilities/physics, you are allowed to anticipate 25 dex+# number of cards, although at lower dexes your mental abilities will be drastically effected and you will be forced to anticipate the chance factors at your respective dex.\n\nThe rules of this game can be changed, but it must be loosely based off of one of the following:\n\n• Rotation - a modified Pokémon TCG deck\n\n• Generations - a randomly generated pull of drafted/premade deck which you then must build towards\n\n• Masters - the original, unmodified Pokémon TCG deck\n\n• Vestibule - a modified TCG deck in which Pokémon go back and forth from deck to field\n\nor the obvious Pokémon Quiz game.\n\nNintendo Fireball Pedometer Pedometer: You equip this attachment to your blower, and it counts the number of fireballs you launch.
