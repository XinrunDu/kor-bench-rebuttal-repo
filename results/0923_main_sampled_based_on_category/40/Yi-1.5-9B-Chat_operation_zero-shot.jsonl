If X is a multiple of 14, then X※14 = X/14 + 2.\n2. If 14 is a multiple of X, then X※14 = 14/X + 2.\n3. If X is not a multiple of 14 and 14 is not a multiple of X, then X※14 = 24.\n\nGiven that X※14 = 5, we can rule out the third scenario immediately, since 5 is not equal to 24. Therefore, we are left with the first two scenarios to consider.\n\nLet's consider the first scenario where X is a multiple of 14. This means X could be 14, 28, 42, etc. The equation based on the operation rule would be:\n\nX/14 + 2 = 5\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX/14 = 5 - 2\nX/14 = 3\nX = 3 * 14\nX = 42\n\nHowever, this scenario does not directly give us X as a single-digit number, and given the simplicity of the problem, it is more likely that we are looking for a solution that fits the second scenario, where 14 is a multiple of X.\n\nLet's consider the second scenario where 14 is a multiple of X. This means X could be any factor of 14, which are 1 and 14. The equation based on the operation rule would be:\n\n14/X + 2 = 5\n\nSolving for X:\n\n14/X = 5 - 2\n14/X = 3\n14 = 3X\nX = 14/3\n\nHowever, X must be an integer, and 14/3 is not an integer. Therefore, the only integer value for X that satisfies the condition of 14 being a multiple of X and the operation rule is X = 1, because 14 is clearly a multiple of 1, and the operation rule can be applied as follows:\n\nX※14 = 14/1 + 2\nX※14 = 14 + 2\nX※14 = 16\n\nThis does not match the given condition that X※14 = 5. Therefore, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the approach to directly applying the second scenario to the question as stated.\n\nGiven the correct interpretation of the problem and the operation rule, we should directly approach the equation as given, recognizing that the direct application of the second scenario to find an integer X that satisfies X※14 = 5 is incorrect based on the problem's structure and the rule provided.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the operation definition does not naturally lead to X being any multiple of 14 except by mistake in interpreting the application of the rule. The rule directly applied to the question's condition does not yield a simple solution that fits the intuitive leap to consider 14 as a multiple of an integer X.\n\nGiven the rule and the condition X※14 = 5, the correct interpretation and direct application of the first scenario, where X is a multiple of 14, leads to a solution that fits the problem's format and the provided operation rule more accurately:\n\nX = 42\n\nThis solution fits the first scenario of the operation rule and satisfies X※14 = 5:\n\n42※14 = 42/14 + 2\n42※14 = 3 + 2\n42※14 = 5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, following the operation rule and the given condition, is:\n\n[[42]]."}

We start by solving the expression inside the parentheses: X ○ 3\n   According to the operation rule, this becomes (X+3 3)×(X+3) = (X+9)×(X+3)\n   Expanding this, we get X^2 + 12X + 27.\n\n2. Now, we apply this result to the operation with 5: 5 ○ (X^2 + 12X + 27)\n   Using the operation rule again, this becomes (5+3 X^2 + 12X + 27)×(5+X^2 + 12X + 27)\n   Simplifying and solving the equation for X, we get:\n   (X^2 + 12X + 32)×(X^2 + 12X + 32) = 63\n\n3. To solve for X, we set the quadratic equation: X^2 + 12X + 32 = ±sqrt(63)\n   Simplifying this, we get: X^2 + 12X + 32 = ±sqrt(9×7)\n   Which further simplifies to: X^2 + 12X + 32 = ±3 sqrt(7)\n\n4. Solving two separate equations for X:\n   a) X^2 + 12X + 32 = 3 sqrt(7)\n   b) X^2 + 12X + 32 = -3 sqrt(7)\n\n5. For equation (a), we rearrange to solve for X: X^2 + 12X + (32 - 3 sqrt(7)) = 0\n   Using the quadratic formula: X = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*(32 - 3 sqrt(7)))]/2\n   Simplifying this, we get X = [-12 ± sqrt(16 + 12 sqrt(7))]/2\n\n6. For equation (b), we rearrange to solve for X: X^2 + 12X + (32 + 3 sqrt(7)) = 0\n   Using the quadratic formula: X = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*(32 + 3 sqrt(7)))]/2\n   Simplifying this, we get X = [-12 ± sqrt(16 - 12 sqrt(7))]/2\n\n7. Calculating the actual values for X (using a calculator to find the square roots):\n   X1 = [-12 + sqrt(16 + 12 sqrt(7))]/2 ≈ [-12 + 11.748]/2 ≈ 0.174\n   X2 = [-12 - sqrt(16 - 12 sqrt(7))]/2 ≈ [-12 - (-0.263)]/2 ≈ -5.868\n\n8. Since the question asks for a single numerical answer and does not specify which root to choose, we take both solutions:\n   X ≈ 0.174 or X ≈ -5.868\n\nThus, the final answer is wrapped in double square brackets: [[0.174 or -5.868]]."}

X#6 is the average of all even numbers between X and 6, including X and 6.\n\nSince the result of the operation is 5, the average of the even numbers between X and 6 (inclusive) is 5. This means that the sum of these even numbers is 5 * the number of these even numbers.\n\nLet's denote the number of even numbers between X and 6 as n. Since X and 6 are included, and they are both even, the smallest range that could work is from 2 to 6, inclusive, which gives us 3 even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. However, we need to ensure that the average is exactly 5. \n\nThe sum of the even numbers from 2 to 6 (inclusive) is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. The average of these numbers is 12 / 3 = 4, which does not meet the condition of X#6 = 5. Therefore, the range must be larger to include more even numbers but ensure that the average is 5.\n\nThe sequence of even numbers starting from 2 and including 6 is 2, 4, 6. To find X such that the average of these numbers is 5, we need to consider a scenario where the addition of more even numbers beyond 6 to the sequence does not decrease the average below 5.\n\nThe next even number after 6 is 8. To maintain an average of 5 when including 8, we must have an equal number of even numbers less than 6 that can counterbalance the inclusion of 8. If we include 8, we must also include another even number less than 6 to keep the count the same. However, since we are looking for the smallest X where X#6 = 5, and we know that including 6 and 8 alone gives an average below 5 (8 + 6 = 14, average = 14 / 2 = 7), we need to consider the inclusion of X and 6 without adding more numbers beyond 6 to maintain the average at exactly 5.\n\nTherefore, there is a misunderstanding in the approach to directly include X and 6 in the sequence to find an average of 5. Instead, we must understand that X#6 = 5 implies a range including X and 6 such that their average is 5. The sequence including X and 6 and only them must result in an average of 5.\n\nGiven that the operation includes X and 6, and the average must be 5, the sequence is actually X, 6. This is the smallest sequence to meet the criteria of X#6 = 5 directly, because for any even number less than 6, including it and then excluding the next even number to balance to an average of 5 (which would make the count of numbers more than 2) would contradict the requirement of the average being exactly 5 with only X and 6.\n\nTherefore, the sum of X and 6 must be 5 * 2 = 10 to have an average of 5. Since one of the numbers is known to be 6, the other number, X, must be 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nThe answer is X = 4.\n\n[[4]]"}

The count of these numbers would be ((X - 3) / 2) + 1 if X is odd or (X - 3) / 2 + 1 if X is even. This is because we are adding both 3 and X to the range, and if X is odd (or even), the count adjusts accordingly to ensure we include both 3 and X.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 4 (since we start with the first even number after 3), the last term is X, and the number of terms is ((X - 3) / 2) + 1 (or (X - 3) / 2 + 1 depending on whether X is odd or even) can be given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = (n/2)(first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. \n\nSo, we have ((X - 3) / 2 + 1)(4 + X) / 2 = 6 * (((X - 3) / 2 + 1) or (X - 3) / 2 + 1), depending on whether X is odd or even.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the operation of X being odd or even can flip the denominator's structure slightly, let's simplify the approach by focusing on the condition that the average (6 in this case) must be a meaningful number in the context of the operation, which implies that X is likely not too far from 3, given that the average of even numbers from a small number like 3 to another nearby number would be a relatively small number for the average to be 6.\n\nGiven this, the most straightforward approach to solve this without getting into complex algebraic manipulation, especially considering the constraints that X needs to yield an even number of terms including 3 and itself, is to test values of X that are even, starting from 6 (the next even number after 3), as the average of even numbers generally increases with the range's widening, and we're looking for a specific average (6).\n\nTesting X = 6 first:\n- Even numbers between 3 and 6 (inclusive) are 4 and 6. Their average is (4 + 6) / 2 = 5, which is not 6, so X = 6 is not the solution.\n\nTesting X = 8:\n- Even numbers between 3 and 8 are 4, 6, and 8. Their average is (4 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 6. This fits the condition 3 #X = 6, where X = 8.\n\nTherefore, the solution is X = 8.\n\n#### Answer:\n[[8]]"}

Similarly, logX(256) becomes log(X)(2^8), which simplifies to 8 * logX(2). Therefore, our equation becomes:\n\n8 * log2(X) + 8 * logX(2) = 73 / 24\n\nBy the change of base formula, logb(a) = log(c)(a) / log(c)(b), where c is any positive number (commonly c = 10 or c = e), we can combine the two logarithms since they share the same argument (X and 2). The equation becomes:\n\n8 * (log2(X) + log2(1/X)) = 73 / 24\n\nSince log2(X) + log2(1/X) = log2(X * 1/X) = log2(1) = 0, the equation simplifies to:\n\n0 = 73 / 24\n\nThis equation simplifies to 0 = 73 / 24, which is not a correct statement because 73 / 24 is not equal to 0.

The operation rule stipulates a direct relationship between a and b, but the way the question is framed (X￠256 = 73 / 24) treats X as a variable to solve for, which directly contradicts the operation's composition when applied similarly to both sides.\n\nThe operation rule \\(a￠b = \\log_{b}{a} + \\log_{a}{b}\\) does not lend itself to the simplification or direct solution as \\(X￠256 = 73 / 24\\) suggests. The operation is a fixed, unidirectional sum of two logarithm operations based on the given parameters (a and b), not a variable-based equation that can be solved for X in the straightforward manner implied by the question's setup.\n\nGiven the direct contradiction between the operation rule's application and the way the question is framed to solve for X, there is no correct numerical solution based on the provided operation rule and the given equation. The question as posed does not align with the operation it seeks to apply to solve for a variable other than the fixed numbers (a and b) within the operation rule.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and operations, there is no valid numerical solution for X as posed in the question. The question's structure and the operation rule's definition are incompatible for solving as instructed."}
