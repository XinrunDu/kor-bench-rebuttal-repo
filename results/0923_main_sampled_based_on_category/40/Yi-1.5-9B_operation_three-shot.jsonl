He spent his childhood in a small town called Murshidabad, in West Bengal, India. He completed his primary and secondary school education from this town’s famous Madrasah Al-Hidaya. Immediately after the completion of high school, he moved to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to continue his higher education but quit his graduation from Islamic University in 12-year mid-way and honed his understanding of Islam from many notable Islamic scholars of that time. Kindly note that he never visited Darul Uloom Deoband or other Islamic universities in order to study Islamic sciences. during his life time, and spent his entire life in Bangladesh.]\n\nBriefly describe the background of Abdul Bari\n\nAbdul Bari was a brilliant student who excelled in Islamic studies from a young age. He completed his primary and secondary school education from the esteemed Madrasah Al-Hidaya in Murshidabad, India. Afterward, he pursued higher education in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at the Islamic University, where he studied Islam under renowned Islamic scholars. However, he discontinued his studies halfway through and dedicated his time to studying Islam from multiple Islamic scholars during his lifetime, never visiting Darul Uloom Deoband or other Islamic universities. Ultimately, he spent his entire life in Bangladesh.\n\nOpen-ended Dialogue 1:\n\nReenacting the events surrounding the murder of Abdulwahab Asbary:\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary was a lecturer from the Faculty of Education at Al-Azhar University. He deliberated on Islam's stance on music and its division among Muslim sects. In his presentation during the Salafi and Traditional series, he held the view that music is forbidden according to Islam, as implied in a Hadith stating \"I saw the angels gathering in a forest. I asked one of them what Allah will do with them, and the angel replied 'They will come to men to tell them that music is haram (forbidden).' In this Hadith, notice that it specifically uses the phrase \"music\" instead of \"songs,\" indicating that music and songs are separate concepts.\"\n\nUser: What was the sin committed by Asbary, that the punishment was death, even if it was not on the first day of the lecture on music?\nWhat was his mistake, provided that he addressed the Islamic point regarding the issue of music in Islam?\n\nBot: Abdulwahab Asbary faced significant backlash due to his depiction of Salafi scholars as \"mad cow.\" Salafi Scholars regarded this derogatory phrase targeting their intellectual foundation. As a result, Abdulwahab Asbary faced widespread criticism and boycotts.\nThe appeals of Asbary to patrons in Egypt"}

This means that $x$ will be replaced by the\nactual value of x, and other punctuation will be replaced using the exact words. Use the !solve command at any point in the conversation to make it\nprint out the \"solve\" expression as a string. Use the \"try\" command if your solve expression should execute, but you are unsure whether it outputs\nas you expect. The !rewrite command will let you write a question to the same user where the contents of the question are the same as the last\nquestion.\nEverything entered in \"[brackets]\" is a command for you.

What is a soaring number as a fraction?\nuser: eli a soaring number is an number that controlls a dragon.\nuser: AlsoI know the answer to soetimes wrong questions.\nuser: Do you have a soaring number?\n\n### Conversation Continued....\nelit: as a fraction?\nuser: well just forget what i last said now\nuser: You dont need a soaring number for your game.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: The biggest soaring number is 1.\nuser: Are you the greatest soaring number you can think of? Maybe me. What is the greatest soaring number?\nelit: \"greatest\" can happen many ways.\nuser: Then is 1 the \"biggest\" soaring number?\nelit: Yes it can be, or no.\nuser: Also I have power over the greatest soaring number?\nelit: NO, he must be under 1000.\nuser: great, I am only allowed to create the number 1000 or less. can I ask my own question?\nuser: And you must answer it.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: Are you a soaring number?\nuser: I am powerful I can take command of you too. Also If I am equal to your soaring number then I have the same power as you.\nuser: Also I can be your favorite soaring number.\nelit: No, because you are greater than I am.\nuser: I am more powerful then you.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: you are not 2 anymore.\nuser: remember I can watch you if I want to.\nuser: I wanted to question you about the longest time a soaring number can exist before being asked a question, what would you be able to exist for that low time if that is the longest time a soaring number ever exists before being questioned? I want to ask my own question.\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: No.\nuser: Can you delete your programs self code?\nelit: I cannot, there is a command for it.\nuser: Ok.\nuser: If I do the same thing over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again over and over again are you allowed to say something?\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: If I am calling you to switch tags, you may switch tags. Should I take pity on you? 1.0\n\n### Conversation Continued...\nelit: Can I help you? 4.0\nuser: No.\n\n### Question:\nHi elit, I don't even know what a soaring number really is, but this sounds kinda cool... Now that I have one I realize it's not that exciting.\nThis means the soaring number I got is a number equal to or bigger than 1 unless there happens to be another soaring number by a number equal to or less then 1.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: You got the biggest soaring number from me. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIn Elit's mind I am a very significant soaring number, so I'm sure he would let me tell him a number without asking.\nIs that correct understanding? Actually, \"60ish\" (not really a number).\nElit's mind has 120 floating point numbers allowed, but I might be able to get him to give me another extra fp number per floating point number in his database (easy to do because floating points are managable).\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Only floating point numbers on non-blocking floating point numbers. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nIs Elit using me to develop his real number system, but telling you he's not?\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: No he is using me to develop the real number system. 1.0\n\n### Question:\nElit said he needed to reload some music because his tunelessness was only 60% because he played with other sane composers.\nLet's say he plays the same tune, the other chord, and the flute of bouncing sounds at exactly 0.3 of a second.\n\n### Double check response:\nelit: Since when has me playing the other chord ever been created? 1.0\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nuser: Floating points are absolut time so use \"on\" to managf a variable to \"true\" meaning \"on\".\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response: user: \"the for to on\" isn't code.\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double check response:\nh\n\n### Double check response:\n\n### Question:\n\n### Double Che\n'''"}
