All seven tiles placed must form a single word. Most tiles are listed in order of frequency in Scrabble.\nThe 2 firmly at the bottom of the list are Q and Z, with letter frequency being very low. They have less use and are mostly used for bonus scoring leading to multi-letter scores. In all, there are only 2 tiles in each duo deck. When all tiles are distributed evenly (no joker tiles), these tiles will always remain distributed, and for example, in the middle two players of the Scrabble game, if the Q tile was received, they would need to show that tile to pass to the next player, and the Z tile would always be in the second player in rotation to ensure fairness.\nAll 32 tiles are distributed in the game, including the 2 quaint and charming tiles that are peculiar to the game of Scrabble. Therefore, if we are to assume that there will be no discard tiles during the game, there will be a total of 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 20,160 ways to form seven-letter words. Here you can find a list of words that can be formed: Click here to open word search\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Thoroughly understand all elements of the custom puzzle\n2. Use each element within an acceptable bounds\n3. Re-use elements within the limits\n4. If an element is reused appropriately, keep using it\n5. The objective is to attain an outcome without doing \"illegal\" actions\n6. The result should be a comprehensive solution that is logical and follows all instructions\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Take into account the basic structure of the Instructions:\n(Problem, Elements(s), Constraints, Instructions/Steps) and ensure your output reflects this\n7. Explain each step\n\n7. Validate your answer according to the rule.\nThe answers should be given in order i.e. if the requirement is for 3 words: 2 letter,3 letter,3 letter then a two letter word is given first followed by two three letter words separated by spaces.\nTell me the number of tiles from the list of tiles assigned to you. For example, if the tiles assigned to me are <url>, the answer should be 5 since there are 5 tiles in total within the link. </url>.\nPlease wrap your responses with double square brackets, like this: [[your response]].\n\n### Additional Rule:\ni dont know i put serval to get dataset\n\n### Question:\nGiven a string, write a program to check if it is a valid IP address or not.

When making your corrections, remember that your correction should be a literal, direct, and precise edit, not a paraphrase or revised version of the text. You can only make edits that are related but make sure to make all modifications in a single sentence to prevent ambiguity, as well as to be brief. Examine the presented text and use the criteria to determine if the text is correct, requires editing, or both. When making any changes, your friendliness, professionalism, and friendliness should be strongly emphasized.\n\n### Criterias:\n1. Correct any misspellings, extra typos or spelling mistakes, and correct inappropriate case (e.g., starting a sentence with a number in lowercase).\n2. Unwanted mentions.\n3. Ensure the captured text follows the given text prompt or any additional signals or guidelines mentioned (use context if necessary).\n4. Ensure the text mentions the specific domain where appropriate.\n5. If the text misses or bypasses suitable information, write back to the human writer to correct some of the information.\n6. Ensure the text is suitable for the intended audience at a school. Later on, check that the response asks for clarifications or questions when appropriate. If it is not appropriate, then don't.\n7. Keep the content and the tone respectful by writing in a professional friendly style.\n8. Discard significantly different or incorrect information, replace it with the corrected information.\n9. Give a suggestion to the author if there is a sentence that doesn't make sense or is meaningless. Avoid using a default sentence such as \"I don't understand\".\n10. Make the sentence a little nicer and less rudeS.\n\nINDICATORS (make note of these):\n- jargon: phrase, terms or a word that a specific group (for example a professional) uses frequentlyee.\n- objectivity in prose: refers to the neutral, non-biased point of view in writing. - ensure that the content doesn't use first person pronouns like \"I or 'we\"\n- severity rating and issue type specific vocabulary: Look for appropriate, descriptive language in accordance with the information provided, such as the information in the desired outcomes, indicator paragraph, or target and indicators section of the framework.\n- self-reflection: look for reference to errors and the need to improve consistency in the text.\n- downward trend: In the context of this document, the use of \"downward trend\" refers to an increase in issues on a negative scale (for example, number of events due to EF teeth).\nUse these APIs: https://api.npoint.io/\n\n### Useful Background Information:\nComplete sentences and paragraphs have already been written by a human, and you will only make corrections as needed. Do NOT rephrase the original sentences or alter the original structure.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Please provide a list of suggested edits in separate lines below the paragraph or sentence, with the lines indicating what needs to be modified or removed accordingly (e.g., \"Edit: The original paragraph\" for corrections) for each line of edits.\n2. Follow criteria 1-3, and use the listed recommendations to make the appropriate changes.\n3. If any inaccuracies or inconsistencies exist, use the provided indication in the criteria to differentiate between them.\n\nUse case example:\nQuestion: Edit the text below: [\"Welcome to the world!\"]\nEdit: The original is capitalized incorrectly with letters becoming random lowercase letters.  Edit the greeting to capitalize correctly, [\"Welcome to everyone!\"]\"\"\"\ndefault_model = \"gpt-4\""}

Professionals often work in a non-linear and non-linear manner towards achieving the desired outcome.\n\n(1/2)\nLet's use this guideline to examine the following scenario: a construction crew from Victoria, BC is building a bridge over Queen Charlotte channel to connect to the island of Chichagof. They are using craft ships as step-by-step building platforms, but plans have been submitted to the government of Canada to build larger craft ships which can be assembled by the government.\nIn fact, it's even been suitable enough to allow the Godzilla Company to want to become involved, as a potentially heavy operation may result in a hotbed of activity ( think air rage and winds ). As luck would have it, it would also have in fact been due to people or pianists who were unable to start working that caused the start to be delayed.\nIn some sense this is actually not the case. For example, in 2017 a bridge-building team in Victoria submitted plans to build a bridge using hand-crafted ships which had been made available specifically for the purpose of bridging the channel between Victoria and the neighbouring island of Chichi-Thankit'setet.\nThey were unable to promise certain materials to the island island since it had not been used before to bridging a gap and since the materials for its construction were very large and costly in terms of materials, such as heavy woodwork, and the outer edge was very difficult to come by or was nominated in some countries depending on previous use or availability.\nThe government of Canada is considering the possibility of using hand-crafted ships of the type in Victoria in order to bridge this gap.\nUnfortunately for this particular province, Vancouver island is very busy for a bridge-building project, so it is considered to be too heavy to use these type of ships for the task at hand and it would probably be unsuitable and too big for constructing a bridge over one mountain or one section of highway.

If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2.Apply the rule carefully to address the question.\n3. Verify your answer to ensure it aligns with the rule and the context of the puzzle.\n\n1. There are square grids for each puzzle, each with distinct trees at specific locations.\n2. The purpose is to build tents on top of the grid in accordance with the direction provided.\n3. Each tent must be aligned with a tree (left, right, up, or down).\n4. Tents cannot be precisely diagonal to other tents.\n5.Each row and column have box constraints to  determine the number of tents.\n6.There is exactly one solution for each puzzle.\n7.The puzzle table itself is presented alongside numerical row and column constraints.\n8. Replace certain cells with tents using the rule («tent»), and provide the complete 2D array as the final response.\n\n### Puzzle Rule:\n\n1. The game is played on an n*m grid with trees on certain positions in the grid.\n2. To place tents on the grid and fulfill the maximum number of tents in the grid.\n3. Each tent must be orthogonally adjacent to a tree (i.e., abutting to left, right, above, and below the tree).\n4. Tents cannot be adjacent to other tents diagonally or orthogonally.\n5.Each row and column has a number indicating the number of tents that must be placed in that row or column when there is a maximum of tents under the predefined rules.\n6. Each puzzle has a and has only one unique solution.\n7. The puzzle is given by matrix first in the form of T, which represents the position of the tree, X, which represents a space, To the right and below the matrix are numerical constraints, and you need to replace X with C (for tents) for some spaces, and the answer is a matrix.![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66315697/147526558-3b95e53d-6ebc-4088-afbc-2f0c5d10d353.png)\n\n### Question 0:\n\nX X X X T X X T X X 2\nT X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X X X T X X X 3\nX X X T X X X X T X 2\nX T X X X X T X X X 3 T X X X X X X X X X 4\n1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 0:\n\n[[X X X X T X X C X X,T X X X X X C X C X X,C X C T X X X T X X X,C X X X T X X X X T X,X T X X T X X T X X X,X T X C X X X T X X C,X T C X X X X T X X X,T C X X T T T X X X C,X C X X X X X X X X X,X X T X X X X X X X X]]\n\n### Question 1:\n\nX X X X X T X X T X 3\nX X T X X X X X X X 1\nX T X X X X X X X X 3\nT X X T T X X X T X 1\nX X X X X X T X X X 2\n2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n[[X X X X X T X X T X,X X T X X X X C C X X,C T X X T C X X C T X,T X C T T X X C T T X,C X X X X X T X X X X,C T C X X X T X X X X,X C X C X T T T X X X,X C T X X X X X X X X,X X X C C C X X X X X,X X X X X X X X X X X]]\n\n### Question 2:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n[[X X C X X X X X X X,C X T X T C X C T X,C T X C T X X X T X,X T X X T X T X C T,X X C X X C X X X X]]\n\n### Question 3:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 3:\n\n[[X X C X X X X X X X,C X T X T C X C T X,C T X C T X X X T X,X T X X T X T X C T,X X C X X C X X X X]]\n\n### Question 4:\n\nX X X X X X X X X X 1\nX X T X T X X X T X 4\nT X X T X X X T X X 2\nX T X X T X T X X T 1\nX X X X X X X X X X 3\n1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Answer 4:\n\n[[X X X X X X X C X X,X X T X T C X C T X,T"}

The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the problem. This is possible, not because of the huge size of the grid, but because it directly contradicts a fundamental requirement of the Sudoku-like logic grid described in the rule. A Sudoku-like logic grid requires that the same domain cannot appear more than once in a range a 2x2 matrix. [Namely, a (i*i) cell do. The rules do not mind such a check and would hence allow a simple 2x2 matrix consisting of the domain values a and b to be valid, whereas a 5x5 matrix could contain twice such a 2x2 matrix which would validate where a 2x2 matrix for itself wouldn't be allowed.]\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question in this case is not solvable. The main problem is that the tables reference the letters as regions, while the pencil marks vanish the division into regions and make illegal positions in each region probable.\n\n### Question:\nCS(2)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the  information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the puzzle. The valid solution would be\n\nenclosed in double square brackets, like this: [[(1,2)(1,3),(2,4)(3,4)]].\n\n### Question:\nCS(1)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nThe question in this case is not solvable, alternatively to the previous one [1].\n\n### Question:\nCS(2)\nA question, covering a specific rule for a custom puzzle, has been provided. The question is given through a problem statement, with a table indicating letters representing different regions.\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the information provided in the question, it is not possible to solve the problem. This is possible not because of the huge size of the grid, but thanks to a requirement dating back to traditional Sudoku structures. [In the classical Sudoku-like logic grid, i.e. regions with values in various segments of cells, cells have to contain a unique value and the values need to be the same across all of the cells in the same region, thus providing unique  diagonally located values in the middle of the final grid for all the transition blocks.]"}
