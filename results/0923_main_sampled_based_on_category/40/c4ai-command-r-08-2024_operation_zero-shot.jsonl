Since the function is independent of y, the inner integral with respect to x will be:\n\n\\int_0^{\\pi} sin(x) \\, dx = -cos(x) \\vert_0^{\\pi} = cos(0) - cos(\\pi) = -(-1) = 1\n\n- So, our second integral becomes:\n\nf◆D = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} cos(y) \\, dy \\times \\int_0^{\\pi} sin(x) \\, dx\n\n- This further simplifies to:\n\nf◆D = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} cos(y) \\, dy = sin(y) \\vert_0^{\\pi/2} = sin(\\pi/2) - sin(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n**Final answer:** \nThe f◆D is **1**."}
