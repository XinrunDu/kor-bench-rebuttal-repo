Here is the specific rule defined for an exact match puzzle. Your task is to accurately apply this rule to the given question.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Take out all the letters from a given word to form a set of individual letters.\n2. Take another word and scramble its letters to every possible order.\n3. Check if each of the scrambled letter orders in step 2 is a valid word.\n4. Count how many such words exist in the dictionary.\n\n### Example 1: Start (Starting word) Fluster (Scrambled word). \nStep 1: Take out all the letters to form a set: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F}.\nStep 2: Try to form every possible word from the taken out letters: {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 1), \n{S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 2), {S, T, R, A, U, L, F} (order 3), … and so on until no more unique orders exist.\nStep 3: Check if each of those words that we formed is a valid word.\nStep 4: Count how many such words exist in the dictionary (are valid) and print them out as one number: This would be the 635 number of valid words that can be formed from the above set of letters.\n\n### Example 2: Start (Starting word) Window (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `W` `5` `O` `2` `N` `3` `D` `4` `I` `6` `W`\n- Output (or) Answer: `0`\n- Description: There are no valid words that you can form from this set of letters.\n### \nExample 3: Start (Starting word) Anastas (Scrambled word)\n\n- `1` `A` `2` `N` `3` `A` `4` `S` `5` `T` `6` `A`\n- Output (or) Answer: `66775`\n- Description: This is the 66,775th valid word in the dictionary on that day. \n\n*Note: Since the order is scrambled with the provided function and a different order is generated each time we call the function, we would expect you to provide the answer each time we provide you with the prompt.

Moving plant\n3.The Giraud Appliance plant didn't see the minimum number of household cleaners\n\n### Answer:\n<Your answer>\n\n### Question:\n1.The Giraud Appliance plant seen the fewest household cleaners\n2.The plant producing the most cleaning products is the L.A. Moving plant\n3.If the Giraud Appliance plant was adjacent to a plant that produced the fewest household cleaners and a rose to 1475 loads from 1650 loads,then the plant made 210 loads is the Haywood plant\n\n### Answer:\n<Your answer>\n\n### Question:\n1.The L.A. Moving plant produced 720 loads in 2000 and the Giraud Appliance plant didn't produced 720 loads\n2.Either the plant made the fewest household cleaners or the plant producing 445 loads is next to the plant producing the fewest household cleaners\n3.The L.A. Moving plant was next to one factory that produces the least amount of loads\n\n### Answer:\n<Your answer>\n\n### Question:\n1.The plant next to the Mwai Corp. Plant increased inventory from 800 loads to 2475 loads\n2.Of the plant that produces the least products,the plant made 445 loads and the plant made 210 loads are two separate plants\n3.Either the plant producing the fewest household cleaners or the plant made 210 loads is next to the plant producing the most cleaning products [[#4|#5]]\n\n### Answer:\n<Your answer>\n\n### Question:\n1.Of the plant which produces the most household cleaners and the plant that produces the least cleaning products,one of these produced more last year and the other took over\n2.The L.A. Moving plant and the Mwai Corp. Plant made different products last year\n3.Either the Mwai Corp. Plant or the plant which produces the least cleaning products was adjacent to a factory which produces the least amount of loads in 1998 [[#5|#0]]\n\n### Answer:\n<Your answer>\n\n### Question:\n1.The Giraud Appliance plant didn't produce the least number of loads in 1998\n2.The Hansel Industries plant didn't produce the most loads in 1998\n3.Neither the plant made 185 loads nor the plant made 720 loads was next to a plant which saw that plant's inventory increase from 800 loads to 2475 loads\n4.The Giraud Appliance plant didn't see a decrease in loads in 1998\n5.The Giraud Appliance plant made fewer loads than the plant that increased its inventories by 2875 loads in 1998 and the plant producing the least number of loads\n\n### Reason:\n1.Of the plant with the least number of loads and the plant with the least number of loads,one was at the Mwai Corp."}

Here is the complete content of the custom puzzle problem I wanted to present to you. I will rephrase it in the same way so that you can understand it immediately.\n\nGive you a `rule` of a custom puzzle (a rule on how to fill in a matrix), and then a series of questions `ques` with `ans` described. Now need to give you completely new questions `qus` for you to complete.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided. If needed, break down the rule into simpler components or steps.\n2. Use Python language for coding.\n\n### Puzzle Rule (do not use this as question):\n\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down. Across means fill in the words from left to right, and down means fill in the words from top to bottom.\n4.During the game, many words will cross each other and share some letters.The letters that cross must match.\n5.The question consists of a list of words and a matrix, where X denotes a grid to be filled with letters and 0 denotes a grid that does not need to be filled with letters,e.g.\nX X X\n0 X 0\n0 X 0\n\n### Question format:\n```python\nrule = \"\"\" ... \"\"\" # Special rules are given\nques = [\n(\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # Questions are provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n),\n...\n]\nans = [\n[[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...],[...]], # Answers are given\n...\n]\n```\n\n```python\nqus = [\n\"\"\" ... \"\"\", # questions are required to be provided\n[[...], # Across\n[...]] # Down\n],\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```python\n... # In the same format as `ans`, please answer.\n```\n\n### Question:\nrule = \"\"\"\n1.The puzzles are played on a grid and the questions are given in the form of a matrix, consisting of X and 0.\n2.The player needs to replace X for filling in d letters and 0 for separating words that cannot be filled in with letters.\n3.Two lists of words are given, across and down.
