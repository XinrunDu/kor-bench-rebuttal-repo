It is recommended to classify key concepts into different levels. For example, as for the method of extracting patterns from a sentence, it is appropriate to categorize them into the higher levels: \"Text classification\", \"Word subsequence\", \"Pattern matching\", and \"Analysis\", while divided into different levels: First, extracting the key concept: \"Sentence text classification\" (Second: Extracting the prefix and suffix of a word subsequence (Third: Matching patterns) (Fourth: Analyze for pattern implementation). List here.\n2. Next, there can be multiple layers of rules. For example, let’s take the issue of finding patterns from sentences. For this issue, it can be further split into: \"Sentence-text classification.\" (Second: Extract prefix and suffix of words.) (Third: Pattern matching) (Fourth: Analyze for pattern implementation)\n3. Please fill in the answer based on your ideas. It is not necessary to prepare a specific order. For example: answer one question in each layer (analyzing, matching, Extraction of abstract patterns, extraction of phrase patterns, or analysis of the extraction) and a fully sequential order.\n\n## 签名\n\n##### 1. 首先尝试从上游了解相关的规范怎么处理\n"}

Below is a Nim problem for which you must find the winning strategy and the final solution.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Given a sequence of numbers (including 0) in parentheses, find the winning strategy and the final solution.\n2. Use the strategy to play against the computer.\n\n![](assets/nim_1.png)\n\n### The Problem in Mathematical Notation:\nA Nim strategy for `N = 6` problem. The ciphertext corresponds to a payoff matrix with 1's for the win and 0's for loss. Here are the rules for the game of Nim.\n1. Play and win when the sequence of the numbers matches the following rules:\n- The first three numbers must be odd.\n- They would multiply.\n- The result will be 0 modulo 4.\n2. Play and loss when the sequence of numbers does not match the rules.\n3. In any case, the game is over with N stones on the field.\n4. The first player to get zero stones wins.\n5. When the number of stones is zero, the player who won is a loser or the number of stones is zero, both lost.\n6. There are three winners in the pure game of Nim.\n\n#### Nim rules\n![](assets/nim_1.png)\n1. Nim strategy for `N = 6` problem.

Similarly, the weight of the black grid in row j is equal to its position in that row (i.e. 1 through n).\n3.The player needs to blacken a number of cells in the grid such that the sum of the weights of the black cells in each row and column is equal to the given numbers.\n4.The problem is given by a matrix in the form of a blank grid filled with X. Below and to the right of the matrix are attached the numerical constraints mentioned above.

The input provided has the grid in question in the upper left corner. To address this question, follow these steps:\n   1. The row of the input grid represents each column in the matrix. Similarly, the column of row represents each column in the matrix.\n   2. The rows and columns in the grid increases from 1 through N to [n, n, n, n] values.\n   3. Iterate and find a sequence from left top to bottom to get the desired output.\n\n   ```Go\n   input.Row = 5\n   input.Col = 7\n\n   res := 0 1 1 1 1\n\n   for x = 1; x <= input.Row; x++ {\n    for y = 1; y <= input.Col; y++ {\n     if input.Matrix[x][y] == 1 {\n      res = (x + y)\n     }\n    }\n   }\n\n   printf(\"'%d' , %d\\n', res\n   return res\n   ```\n"}

i.e., there can be no stars in adjacent squares (including diagonally adjacent).\n6.The question is given in the form of a matrix with different regions labeled with different letters, e.g. the grid where all the letters A are located forms a region and the answer should list the coordinates of the stars in each region, e.g. A:(row i, column j)\n\n### Question:\n1 star.\n\nA A A A A A B B\nA A A

Once a consensus on its meaning has been reached, identify and document any unique properties or requirements of each rule portion.\n2. **Assign each rule portion a color**: To gain a deeper understanding, assign each portion of the rule (e.g., Empty, Mine, and 8 numbers) a distinct color. Repeat for a similar rule. The goal is to distinguish between each portion.\n3. **Identify the colors of an n×n grid**: The rule mentions filling empty spaces with A. Fill them with the assigned colors. Assign a distinct color to the negative space (between the received and sent grids). Another color will be assigned to the grid sections. Repeat this process until the entire grid is colored.\n4. **Examine the color requirement interpretations**: As the solution progresses, refer to the comments for color interpretation. If there is concern that a change might impact the answer, the instructor's guidance might be sought.\n\n## Implementing the Solution\n1. **Set up the input array and assign variables A and B**: To format the input array, declare an array and a variable for each row. Assign them X (empty) and A (mine).\n2. **Process rules one by one**: Apply each rule to each section of the input array, replacing X with A for mined areas and X with X for empty areas.\n3. **Check the rule's applicability**: For every added number, verify with a reference. If the number is within the given range (0-9), follow the rule. Otherwise, omit additional operations.\n4. **Check the rules for conflicts**: Fix any mistakes found by reprocessing with the previous number replaced X. Refer to the printed steps for assistance.\n5. **Print out the final answer in the same format** Read the rules and convert into the number and alphabet array format. Replace any A with 0 and X with A. Append into the full matrix, and put in double square brackets at the end.\n\n## Solving Sample Questions\nFor each question, follow the same process outlined above to solve it.\n\n## Acknowledging the Developer\nAs you begin by introducing the developer and yourself, establish the developer's privacy and confidentiality.\nTo demonstrate awareness of our responsibilities, review Privacy, Security and Affordability Code of Practice at the end of this guide.\nThe developer agrees to have his or her name and contact information deleted from the summary, student submissions and final report after the project has been finished.\n\n1.The developer and I wish we could have contributed to this wonderful tool. Thank you for letting us help!\n\n2.The developer and myself would like to thank you for allowing us to practice coding with you. Though, we can assure you that it was enjoyable and beneficial. It wasn't such a long one, as you must understand we didn't have that much time available.\n\n3.We'd likewise like to give a suggestion on another area wherein the idea would seem a troublesome technique to deal with riddles. We want to give an option that could be conceivable instead of the manual framework of filling the empty spots (referring to the first solution for question 1). The main idea is to encode the number in way that can be decoded to find the answers. The technique should have the following characteristics:\n\na.It would be in regards to one more number lattice (or matrix)\n\nb.The lattice contains some bit of numerical data (of its just first line), and the numbers must be set so they sum up to the number that pixels are marked on.\n\nc.The numbers should be arranged in a way that:\n\n--a number once found is used only for one step and not for several.\n\n--only one right-side value can be found as a by-product of moving forward.\n\n--each right right side value should be found after no less than the last marked pixel before that.\n\nd.Pixels are filled with the same character while it is correct\n\n### Notes\n*To help the program work properly, please ensure that there is at least one number per row, for example; 3, 4, 2, 3\n*The program will take an input, and display its answers at the bottom.\n*It is advised, that we provide multiple rows at a time, and the output should be one-to-one.\n*We suggest to make the input integer only, by converting the string to integer using eval() function\n\n\n### Credits\n-The script was created by Taran Ahmed and Hayder Ahmed for learning purposes.\n"}
