Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\n\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\" \nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\" \nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\" \n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1 (Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2 (Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3 (Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1 (Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2 (Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3 (Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nPlease provide the corresponding logical expressions. The answer format should be:\n[[C1=...];[C2=...];[C3=...];[D1=...];[D2=...];[D3=...]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Here are the logical expressions based on the given information:\n\n[[C1=p&!q&!r];\n[C2=(!p&!q)| (p&!q)];\n[C3=(!p&q)&r];\n[D1=!q&!r];\n[D2=(p&!r)|(!p&r)];\n[D3=p&q]]; \n\n\n\n\nLet me break down how we arrived at these expressions:\n\n**Person B**\n\n* **C1 (Entirely Correct):**  If Person B is correct, then Professor Wang MUST be from Suzhou (`p`) and NOT from Shanghai (`!q`). Since we know only one location is true, Professor Wang cannot be from Hangzhou (`!r`).\n* **C2 (Partially Correct):** This is a bit trickier.  Person B could be partially correct if:\n    * Their statement about Suzhou is true: `!p & !q`\n    * OR their statement about Shanghai is true: `p & !q`\n* **C3 (Entirely Incorrect):** If Person B is wrong, then Professor Wang must be from both Shanghai (`p`) AND Hangzhou (`r`).\n\n**Person C**\n\n* **D1 (Entirely Correct):** If Person C is correct, then Professor Wang is NOT from Shanghai (`!q`) and NOT from Hangzhou (`!r`).\n* **D2 (Partially Correct):** This could be true if ONLY one of the following is correct:\n    * Professor Wang is from Suzhou (`p`) and NOT from Hangzhou (`!r`).\n    * Professor Wang is NOT from Suzhou (`!p`) but is from Hangzhou (`r`).\n* **D3 (Entirely Incorrect):** If Person C is wrong, then Professor Wang MUST be from both Shanghai (`p`) and Hangzhou (`r`).\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore how we can further use these expressions based on Professor Wang's statement about who got things right and wrong!\n"}

For example, F(a), G(a, b), P(a1, ..., an) are all 0-ary predicates.\n\nLet D be the domain of individuals.\n\"All x in D have property F\" is symbolized as AxF(x).\n\"Some x in D have property F\" is symbolized as ExF(x).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then x has property G\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 G(x)).\n\"Some x in D have both properties F and G\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & G(x)).\n\"For all x, y in D, if x has property F and y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x, y)).\n\"For all x in D, if x has property F, then there exists some y with property G such that x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 Ey(G(y) & H(x, y))).\n\"There exists some x in D with property F, and for all y in D, if y has property G, then x and y have relationship H\" is symbolized as Ex(F(x) & Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))).\n\n### Question:\nUsing the universal domain of individuals, symbolize the following propositions:\n\n(1) Any even number x and y have a common divisor greater than 1.\n(2) There exist odd numbers x and y that do not have a common divisor greater than 1.\n(3) It is true that some trains are faster than all cars.\n\nFor (1), using predicates:\nF(x): x is even,\nH(x,y): x and y have a common divisor greater than 1,\n(1) can be symbolized as?\n\nFor (2), using predicates:\nG(x): x is odd,\nH(x,y): x and y have a common divisor greater than 1,\n(2) can be symbolized as?\n\nFor (3), using predicates:\nF(x): x is a train,\nG(y): y is a car,\nH(x,y): x is faster than y,\n(3) can be symbolized as?\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[];[];[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Here are the symbolic representations of the given propositions:\n\n[[AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))]; [ExEy(G(x) & G(y) & \u223cH(x, y))]; [ExEy(F(x) & G(y) & H(x, y))]]\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **(1) Any even number x and y have a common divisor greater than 1.**\n    *  We use the predicate `F(x)` for \"x is even\" and `H(x, y)` for \"x and y have a common divisor greater than 1\".\n    *  The statement \"Any even number x and y\" translates to \"For all x and y\".\n    *  Therefore, the symbolic representation is `AxAy(F(x) & F(y) \u21d2 H(x,y))`. This means \"For all x and y, if x and y are even, then x and y have a common divisor greater than 1.\"\n\n* **(2) There exist odd numbers x and y that do not have a common divisor greater than 1.**\n    *  We use `G(x)` for \"x is odd\" and `H(x, y)` for \"x and y have a common divisor greater than 1\".\n    *  \"There exist\" translates to \"Exists some\".\n    *  The negated statement, \"do not have a common divisor greater than 1\", is symbolized using `\u223cH(x, y)`.\n    *  Therefore, the symbolic representation is `ExEy(G(x) & G(y) & \u223cH(x, y))`.  This means \"There exist some x and y, such that x and y are both odd, and x and y do not have a common divisor greater than 1.\"\n\n* **(3) It is true that some trains are faster than all cars.**\n    * We use `F(x)` for \"x is a train\", `G(y)` for \"y is a car\", and `H(x, y)` for \"x is faster than y\".\n    * \"Some trains\" translates to `Ex`.\n    * \"Faster than all cars\" translates to `Ay(G(y) \u21d2 H(x, y))`. \n    * Therefore, the symbolic representation is `ExEy(F(x) & G(y) & H(x, y))`.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nIn Class A, with a total of 40 students, they discussed the situation regarding computer typing. Three students, A, B, and C, each expressed their opinions:\n\n- Student A said: \"Li Cong from Class A has not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student B said: \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\"\n- Student C said: \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\"\n\nWhat is the relationship between the statements made by Students B and C among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[&]  \n \nHere's why:\n\n* **Student B's statement:** \"Some students in Class A have learned how to type on a computer.\"  can be represented as SIP  (Some students in Class A are capable of typing).\n* **Student C's statement:** \"Some students in Class A have not learned how to type on a computer.\" can be represented as SOP (Some students in Class A are not capable of typing). \n\nThe & relation applies because these propositions are complementary. If Student C's statement is false (meaning no students in Class A haven't learned to type), then Student B's statement must be true. Conversely, if Student B's statement is false (meaning no student in Class A knows how to type), then Student C's statement must be true. \n\n\n\n"}

This formula expresses a relationship where if point Gp is true, then point \u00acG\u00acp must also be true. \n\nLooking at the Time Proposition Relationships defined in the rule:\n\n* **\u2217 Relation:** Pairs exhibit a state of exclusivity. Either one is true, or the other is false \u2013 they cannot both be true or both false. Formula 17 does not demonstrate this type of exclusivity.\n\n* **\u21a6 Relation:** Pairs can be both false but not both true. Formula 17 implies a directional truth relationship where the truth of Gp guarantees the truth of \u00acG\u00acp.\n\n* **\u26ad Relation:** Pairs cannot be both false. However, they can both be true. Formula 17 doesn't express this type of restriction.\n\n* **\u2042 Relation:** Pairs can both be true or both be false. Formula 17 implies a stronger relationship, where the truth of one point necessitates the truth of the other. \n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, Reasoning Formula 17 best aligns with the  **\u2217 relation**.\n"}

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "C \n\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe passage describes identifying a new radioactive element through a process of elimination.  \n\n* **Positive Group**: Samples of leachite initially containing uranium showed radioactivity.\n* **Negative Group**: After removing uranium, the remaining leachate was still radioactive, indicating a presence of a different element.\n\nThis aligns with the  **Method  Otero (*)** format of establishing a causal relationship by comparing a group with a condition (uranium present) to a group without the condition (uranium removed) and observing different outcomes.  \n\n\n\n\n"}

Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[A]] \n"}

It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nConsidering the domain of individuals as natural numbers and R representing the \"less than\" relationship, \u2200x\u2203yR(x, y) states that for any natural number, you can find another natural number greater than it, meaning there is no largest natural number. However, \u2203y\u2200xR(x, y) suggests that there is a natural number greater than any other natural number, implying the existence of a largest natural number. Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
