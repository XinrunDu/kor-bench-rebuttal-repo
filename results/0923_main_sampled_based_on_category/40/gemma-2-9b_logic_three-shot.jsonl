For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the above rules, what are the paired conjunctive terms of (p\u2227\u00acq\u2227r)\u2228(\u00acp\u2227q\u2227\u00acr)?

Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes.

Suppose we adopt `V` - the symbolic representation of the value judgment function as follows:\n- `V(p)`: The truth value of the proposition `p`.\nIn the `Logic Model`, the truth value of the proposition is not determined by external conditions but is defined by the judgment of the individual or group. Therefore, a person's belief has a relative relationship with the truth value, and two people may have different beliefs about the same issue. In the model, propositions are divided into two types:\n- `M`: The model space. All propositions are composed by finite disjunctions of atomic propositions, which can express the overall propositions. Thus, it is necessary to consider both cognitive connection and common beliefs through the manipulation of a single proposition. Here, we consider both common beliefs and doubt.\n- `G`: The group space. The group consists of several members. Each member's judgment and belief can be represented by the cognitive connectivity relationship. When judging common beliefs and doubt, we must consider individual judgments. When an individual `i` doubts proposition `p`, they may lead the group to doubt `p`, and this doubt may spread to other members.\n## Solution Ideas:\nTo assist members in understanding doubt and cognitive connectivity, we divide the operations into two phases:\n- First, we give instructions on how to transform a single proposition into a model and then establish relationships between members of the same group.\n- We then demonstrate how cognitive logic interacts through the given axiom system.\n## Step 1: Build the Model and Create Relationships\n- `Step 1.1`: Define the `Logic Model`.\n- `Step 1.2`: Create the `Model Space` and `Group Space`.\n- `Step 1.3`: Establish connections between members of the same group.\n## Step 2: Manipulate the Model with Cognitive Logic Interaction\n- `Step 2.1`: Cognitive logic manipulates the model with different axioms and logic operations.\n- `Step 2.2`: Analyze the result.\nIn summary, we can analyze doubt and cognitive connectivity through two steps: building the model and then manipulating it through the logic. This will help members understand the essence of these concepts and their implementation.\n"}

Please answer the following three questions. For each question, there are three subquestions. Please give the answers in standard order [[1.1, 1.2, 1.3...].\n1. You have the function f(x). Given any function g(x), how can you write g(f(x)), i.e., to calculate the value of g(f(x)) using g(x)?\n1.1. Given a small example with a specific value for g(x) and a simple function for f(x), please write out the calculations for g(f(x)).\n1.2. Assume the polynomial function f(x) and the simple function g(x) are provided. Please write out the general equation for g(f(x)).\n1.3. Given a polynomial function f(x) and a simple function g(x), please write out the general equation for g(f(x)). Note that f(x) is a polynomial while g(x) is a simple function.\n\n2. For the polynomial f(x), is it possible to determine whether it has derivative functions and whether each function is unique?\n2.1.

Write the logic for problem decomposition and solution based on these principles.\n3.2. Given a specific example with specific variables, please analyze the solution steps and verify whether they can be applied to solving larger problems.\n\n### Answer:\n[[1.3. To calculate g(f(x)), please replace each occurrence of x in g(x) with the expression \"f(x)\". ]]\n\n[[2.1. Yes, derivative functions are unique for every polynomial function. Here's a description of how to find and test derivative functions:\nWe can divide the domain of a polynomial into intervals where the polynomial exhibits non-decreasing behavior. On each interval, the derivative is a function that has the same sign, which can be determined by considering the value of the derivative at the interval endpoints. This derivative can be obtained from the function's derivative function. For example, the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 has derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1. On intervals where the derivative is non-zero, we can have non-decreasing behavior. Any function whose derivative is equal to f'(x) is a possible derivative function for f(x).]]\n\n[[3.2. Yes, this method helps in solving larger problems as it ensures that we have all necessary information to build solutions cumulatively.

After observing a sample of birds where each bird was seen flying, the researcher confirmed the hypothesis. However, another observation showed that some birds in a different part of the region were unable to fly, which according to equivalence conditions, should also confirm that all birds are capable of flight.\n\nWhich paradox does this scenario represent?\n\nA.

The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 \u2227 r_2) \u2192 \u22a5)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA.

To accommodate this observation, we should:\n\nA. Change r_3 to r'_3 = \"Apples usually contain vitamin C\"\nB. Change r_1 to r'_1 = \"Most apples are fruits\"\nC. Change r_2 to r'_2 = \"Most fruits are rich in vitamins\"\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nA\n\n### Question:\nSuppose there's an hypothesis r_1, \"The plant grows taller than 10 cm\". Now we have observations:\n\n- Observation 1: The plant is indeed 10 cm tall.\n- Observation 2: The plant is less than 15 cm tall.\n\nWhich of the following illustrates the logical consequence of r_1:\n\nA. It's not necessarily true the plant is taller than 10 cm.\nB. The plant is definitely taller than 10 cm.\nC. Both conclusions are possible.\n\n(Hint: Given the observations 1 and 2, one could argue that the height of the plant could be exactly 10 cm, making r_1 not completely contradictory. Hence, the plant's height of more than 10 cm is not necessarily true. This scenario does not conform to the BC paradox, where contradictory confirmations are used to support the hypothesis \"All things are either A or B\", and later contradictory cases are discovered, contradicting A and B. Here, the plant's height is less than or equal to 15 cm, and exceeding 15 cm can be inferred as false. Hence, the answer is not B. Choice B corresponds to the GB paradox, but that's not what you're looking for. A paradox represents a contradiction that's illogically confirmed and contradicts the original reasoning. The BC paradox concerns the confirmation of universal hypotheses, and the LS paradox involves contradictory logical conclusions.)\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nB\n\n### Question:\nIdentify the type of logical paradox from the following statement:\n\n- All cats are mammals.\n- Some mammals are not cats.\n- Therefore, all cats are not mammals.\n\nA.

LS Paradox\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\nA\n\n### Question:\nDetermine the logical paradox from the following:\n\n- All mice are animals.\n- Some animals like to chase cats.\n- It was observed that all mice did not chase cats.\n- Therefore, no animals like to chase cats.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n- Solution: GB Paradox arises when contradictory observations contradict each other, leading to an unresolvable paradox. This scenario fits the definition of GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the type of logical paradox from the following statement:\n- All apples are yellow.\n- Most apples are sweet.\n- Most sweet things are bananas.\n- Therefore, most bananas are apples.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\na. BC Paradox\nSolution: BC Paradox arises when contradictory observations lead to contradictory confirmations, causing dilemmas. This scenario fits the definition of BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Provide the type of logical paradox based on the below statement:\n- All cats are fierce.\n- All mice are scared.\n- Most fierce creatures scare mice.\n- Therefore, some mice are scared of cats.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) The BC Paradox applies when contradictory observations contradict each other, causing dilemmas. The GB Paradox arises when contradictory observations contradict each other, causing a dilemma. In this case, the statement implies a contradiction since most fierce creatures don't scare mice. The logical conclusion is inconsistent, so it fits the definition of GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Determine the type of logical paradox from the observation and conclusion:\n- Observation: A scientist observed that in all cases, a given tree produces at least one orange.\n- Conclusion: The tree can only bear oranges and no other fruits.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) The GB Paradox arises from the paradoxical reasoning behind the observed phenomenon. Here, the conclusion incorrectly assumes that the sole outcome of the observer's actions is the production of oranges, without considering that there could be alternative results. Thus, the conclusion contradicts the assumption and suggests a GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Given the conditions below, identify the type of logical paradox that occurs:\n- Premise: It is known that:\n1. A premise p implies proposition R.\n2. Proposition R is true.\n- Conclusion: Therefore, p is true.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: The BC Paradox arises from the unexpected confirmation that contradicts the original reasoning. In this case, if R is true, it means that p is part of the contradiction, leading to an unexpected confirmation through inductive reasoning. Since there is a contradiction in the initial premise, an unexpected confirmation arises, suggesting a BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Evaluate the situation in terms of the type of logical paradox:\n- If sunlight reaches the plant, it will grow faster.\n- If it doesn't receive sunlight, it will continue to grow.\n- Observe the plant next to a bright light source.\n- If it overgrows, the sunlight does not reach it.\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: The BC Paradox arises from an unexpected confirmation that contradicts the original reasoning. When observing a plant under bright light, confirmation of the statement \"It does not receive sunlight and continues to grow\" contradicts the condition \"If it doesn't receive sunlight, it will grow.\" Such a contradiction suggests the BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the logical paradox in this scenario:\n- Given: All plants that receive nutrients will grow tall.\n- Observation: Some plants don't grow tall, even though they received nutrients.\n- Conclusion: Then all plants receive nutrients.\n\nA. ABC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation:) When inductive reasoning is used to establish a principle, it can be deduced backward. If the conclusion \"All plants receive nutrients\" is consistent with the observation of \"Some plants do not grow tall even with nutrients\", then there is a contradiction, which is associated with the GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Based on the information below, determine the type of logical paradox:\n- Premise: All human beings have hearts.\n- Observation: It has been observed that some animals also have hearts.\n- Conclusion: Then, all human beings have hearts and animals do not have hearts.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: The logical conclusion is that humans have hearts and animals do not, a contradiction. This paradox follows the GB Paradox.\n\n### Question: Identify the logical paradox from the following:\n- All plants grow tallest in a dark environment.\n- If all plants grow tallest in a dark environment, they don't have light.\n- Therefore, the only way plants maintain their height is to use darkness.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: B\n\n(Explanation: GB Paradox arises from contradictory inferences and judgments. In this case, the conclusion \"Plants only maintain their height when using darkness\" contradicts the assumption \"All plants grow tallest in a dark environment.\n\n### Question: Determine the type of logical paradox from a reasonable and consistent situation:\n- Premise: All trains are large.\n- Observation: A train is tall. It has a size larger than 3 meters.\n- Conclusion: Then the tall train is large, or all trains are large.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: In this case, the paradox arises because the train's height is not consistent with the assumption that \"All trains are large.\n\n### Question: Deduce the logical paradox based on the given assumptions:\n- 5% of humans have a specific disease, and all infected people will die.\n- It has been found that only 9 out of 200 people were infected, and all of them are alive.\n- Conclusion: All people will not have this disease.\n\nA. BC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: BC Paradox arises from an observation that contradicts the assumptions, causing a contradiction. The conclusion \"All people will not have this disease\" contradicts the assumption \"All infected people will die\". In this way, it follows the BC Paradox.\n\n### Question: Deduce the logical paradox based on the observations:\n- Observation: A scientist has observed two different conclusions just from two different perspectives:\n1. Everyone is a two-year-old person.\n2. Every person is a sixty-year-old.\n- Conclusion: Therefore, two-year-olds are their own ancestors.\n\nA. ABC Paradox\nB. GB Paradox\n- Answer: A\n\n(Explanation: ABC Paradox arises from conflicting discoveries made under different circumstances, causing a contradiction.\n\n### Question: Deduce the"}

AffCons method: When the premise is that if P then Q, knowing that Q is true, it is mistakenly believed that P is also true, and does not meet this prompt. 3.CondSwap method: When the premise is that if P then Q, it is mistakenly believed that if Q then P, and does not meet this prompt. The subject matter of the conclusion and judgment are in the same position in both the premise and the conclusion. 4. IncorrNeg method: When the premise is that if P then Q, it is mistakenly believed that if P is not, Q is also not true, and it does not meet the prompt.\n\nIn this example, the question clearly gave a certain species condition, and the reasoner clearly made a conclusion, 2. IncorpNeg, Aff Cons, DisjSyl, Negent, CondSwap is used. 4. It should be obvious that the reasoner makes an incorrect negative judgment. The question does not ask what logical mode is used, but what logic should be used to solve the problem. As the reasoner has not made any correct steps, the answer is only the type of logic used-neg ant method."}

For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.

If a is always true in this world, then any other conditions can be known as true. If only a is true in this world, then there is no need for a propositional variable indicating \"true.\" This propositional variable can be removed if only a is known in this world. Since no other propositional variables are required, only the symbol a can be used. From the perspective of logical propositions, nothing is true; for example, if two objects are true, they cannot be named as a, b, c, d... They are instead labeled as true and false in the logic system, so only two statements are needed. That is, two propositional variables are enough. Two objects have two names for all possible states, true and false. The following is an example:\n\nA is true: true.\n\nB is true: false.\n\nThat is:\n\n(true, false)\n\n(false, true)\n\n(false, false)\n\nTherefore, the rule of two propositions can be reduced. In addition, four possibilities can be derived from two truth tables:\n\n* **A is true**: true.\n* **B is true**: false.\n* **A is false**: false.\n* **B is false**: false.\n\nAs long as a is true, everything is true in its truth table, so this problem is not the case.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
