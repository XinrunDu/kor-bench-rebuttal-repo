it with '#' in a way that the number of filled points is as close as possible to the number of points that satisfy the following rules:\n\n\n1.For every '#' on a white point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' (within 2 grids means it is in squares where 1 grid is the border of the 2 grids).\n2.For every '#' on a black point, there are at least 4 '#' within the radius of 2 grids as neighboring '#' points (the same as 1).\n3.There is at least one '#' on each point.\n\nEvery input file is guaranteed to have an answer.\n\n### Format for input and output:\nThe format for input and output is as follows:\n[input]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n[output]\n* n: the number of input cases\n* (for each case)\n** ...\n\nOne line represents a picture, only alpha (alpha is used to represent a character in a String).\n\nOne line describes the output result.\n\n### Examples:\n```\nInput:[1][.......x][......xxx][..xx.xxxxx][xx.x.....][........x]\n\nOutput:\n[[1][x......][x......][x.....xx.]]\n```\n\n### Input:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx.x.x\n\n### Output:\n2\n.x.x.\n..xx.\nx#x#x\n\n\n### Hint:\nConsider applying the rules one at a time to determine the number of empty spaces.\nFor example, you can start with rule 1 and determine which points require '#' under rule 1. Then, you can consider rule 2 to evaluate whether the points where all rules apply or if additional rules need to be considered.\n\n### Implementation of rule 1:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Implementation of rule 2:\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<vector<int>> countNums(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {\n        vector<vector<int>> gridCount(grid);\n        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < grid.front().size(); ++j) {\n                if (grid[i][j] == '.' || grid[i][j] == 'X') {\n                    for (int a = -2; a <= 2; ++a) {\n                        for (int b = -2; b <= 2; ++b) {\n                            if (a == 0 && b == 0)\n                                continue;\n                            if (i + a >= 0 && i + a < grid.size() && j + b >= 0 && j + b < grid.front().size() && (grid[i + a][j + b] == 'X' || grid[i + a][j + b] == '#')) {\n                                ++gridCount[i][j];\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return gridCount;\n    }\n};\n```\n"}

Here is a specific rule defined for a custom puzzle called \"Word Ladder,\" as follows:\n\n\n### Rule:\n\n\nGiven a starting word and an end word, each letter in the sequence can only be changed by one other. The list of words in each sequence forms a valid ladder from one word to another. You are required to use up the least number of words in this series.\n\n\n### Example:\n\n\nStarting words: a, b, c, d, f, i, o, u, y. The words h, e, and p can all be considered valid ladder words, and each can be found with two steps.\nThe word i is unique as it only needs one step, h -> i.\nThe word d is unique as it needs three steps to change a -> d: a -> e, e -> d.\nThe word y is unique as it needs seven steps to change y -> t, f -> p, p -> k, k -> g, g -> h, h -> y:\n1. [t -> i] is the only sequence because any other sequence requires three or more steps.\n2. [a -> a, b, b, b, e, e, e, e, e, d, d, d, d, d, y, g, h, h, h, i, i, e, f, f, f, f, f, k, y] is another example of a valid sequence.\nNote: This question does not ask to find the number of sequences, but rather all possible sequences. If you align each step, the input can be rearranged in many different ways.\nNow, read the example puzzles below to better understand the puzzle rule.\n\n\n### Example 1:\n\n\n[[\"z\"]}\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[\"z\", \"z\"]]\n\n\n### Example 2:\n\n\n[[\"z\", \"z\"]]\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[\"z\", \"z\"]]\n\n\n### Example 3:\n\n\n[[\"m\", \"k\", \"b\", \"l\", \"e\"]]\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[\"m\", \"k\", \"b\", \"l\", \"e\"]]\n\n\n### Example 4:\n\n\n[[\"n\", \"t\", \"r\", \"g\", \"i\", \"y\"]]\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[\"n\", \"t\", \"r\", \"g\", \"i\", \"y\"]]\n\n\n### Example 5:\n\n\n[[\"z\", \"s\"]]\n\n\n### Answer:\n[[\"z\", \"z\", \"s\", \"s\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n#输入描述：\n\n需要找出不同元素数量为 n 的整数列表的所有组合，注意当不同元素数量为 n 时，每个组合是由任意n个元素构成的，每个元素只可以存在一个组合中。\n\n#输出描述：\n\n所有组合按照从左到右递增排列后输出.输出每个组合间的换行符为回车符.\n注意，每个组合顺序不分先后.\n输入用例：\n[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]\n\n*  输出用例：\n*  11121416\n*  1114151718\n*  1114151819\n*  1114171819\n*  121315171819\n*  121315181920\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\n================ANSWER=================\nimport collections\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\ndef map(n,x):\n    for i in range(0,len(n)):\n        #x.add(n[i])\n        if x.get(n[i]):x[n[i]] += 1\n        else:x[n[i]] = 1\nn = list(map(int,input().split()))\nn.sort()\nalmap = collections.defaultdict(int)\ndef dfs(x,res,cur):\n    if len(x) == len(res):\n        res.append(cur)\n        return\n\n        #     if len(x) > 1:\n        #     return\n        # print(res)\n    for i in x.keys():\n        for j in range(x[i],0,-1):\n            x[i] = j\n            dfs(x,res,cur+[i])\n            x[i] += 1\n        x[i] = j+1\n\nx ={}\nmap(n,x)\nalmap[len(x)-n[0]] = len(x[n[0]])\nfor i in range(2,len(x)+1):\n    almap[i] = (almap[i-2],almap[i-1])[i==len(x)]+almap[i-2]\ndfs(x,[],[])\nx.clear()\nfor i in range(len(n)-1,0,-1):\n    map(n[:i],x)\n    dfs(x,[],[])\nx.clear()\nfor i in range(len(n)):\n    map(n[i:],x)\n    dfs(x,[],[])\n# print(collection.defaultdict)\nx.clear()\nfor i in range(len(n)-1):\n    map(n[:i],x)\n    dfs(x,[],[])\nx.clear()\nfor i in range(len(n)-1,0,-1):\n    map(n[i:],x)\n    dfs(x,[],[])\n\nst = collections.defaultdict(list)\nfor i,l in enumerate(n):\n    st[len(n)-l].update([l])\n\nl = []\nfor i in range(len(n)):\n    ll = []\n    ll.update(st[n[i]])\n    l = [x for x in l if x != ll]\n    for g in l:\n        if ll.issubset(g):\n            l.remove(g)\nl.sort()\nif l:\n    print(*zip(*l[0]),sep = '\\n',end = '\\n')\nelse:\n    l = [[y] for y in n]\n    print(*zip(*l),sep = '\\n',end = '\\n')\n"}

For example, if a grid has a \">\" sign above it, then the number of that grid must be greater than the number of the grid above it.\n3.Some grids will give pre-filled numbers as hints.\n4.The questions are given as matrices and are accompanied by inequality constraints below in the form (row i, column j) > (row x, column y)\n\n### Question:\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\nX X X X\n\n(1,2)>(1,3)\n(1,3)<(1,4)\n(2,3)<(2,4)\n(2,4)<(3,4)\n(3,3)>(3,4)\n\nPlease provide each element in order from left to right, and from top to bottom, with each element separated by a space and each row separated by a comma.

If you do, the answer will be A X A X A X 1 A A A X X 1 A A A 1 X X A 1 A A. The X in this case doesn't represent mines, it represents empty spaces.\n\n2.Consider the third row, from left to right. The fifth column from the left contains a 1, which means there is a mine to the right of that 1. In contrast, the second column from the left contains a 2 which can only represent mines in the rows around the second column from the left. Combining this information, the answer should be [[X 2 A X X,1 A X 2 X,X 2 2 1 1,X A X 1 A,X A 1 X A]].
