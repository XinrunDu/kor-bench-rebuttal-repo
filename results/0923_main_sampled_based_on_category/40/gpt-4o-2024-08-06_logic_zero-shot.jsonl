How so?\nPerson A: My grandfather is a case in point. He speaks very straightforwardly and often does good deeds with bad intentions. I remember one time he invited some friends over for dinner.\nPerson B: That's nice, everyone can get together.\nPerson A: The appointment was for six in the evening, and by half past five, three people had arrived, but one important guest hadn't shown up yet.\nPerson B: Then wait a bit longer, if they don't come, start eating without them.\nPerson A: My grandfather is a punctual person. When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To transform \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" using Method C, we need to follow these steps:\n\nThis statement can be interpreted as a Universal Affirmative Proposition (A): \"All who have left are who should have stayed.\"\n\n**Method C** for Universal Affirmative Proposition (A):\n1. **Obversion:** Change the quality and replace the predicate with its contrary.\n   - Original: All who have left are who should have stayed.\n   - Obverted: All who have left are not who should not have stayed.\n \n2. **Conversion:** Switch the subject and predicate.\n   - Converted: All who should not have stayed are not who have left.\n\nNow, we express this result in the specified format.\n\n**Final Result:**\n\n[[All who should not have stayed are not who have left]]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nFind the truth values and falsity values of the following formulas.\n(1) ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n(2) (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\nThe answer format  is [[T:...;F:...];[T:...;F:...]]. If there are multiple values in T(F), they should be separated by commas (,).For example [[T:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713;F:x|x|x];[T:x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|\u2713]]\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the truth values and falsity values for the given formulas, let's analyze each formula step by step according to the defined logic rules.\n\n### Formula (1): ~(p1&p2&~p3)\n\n1. Identify components: \n   - p1, p2, and ~p3 are Level A formulas.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) means p1&p2&~p3 must be false for the entire formula to be true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is false under assignments: x|x|x, x|\u2713|x, \u2713|x|x, or any combination where at least one of p1 or p2 is false, or p3 is true.\n   - Therefore, some true assignments for ~(p1&p2&~p3) are: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - ~(p1&p2&~p3) is false when p1&p2&~p3 is true.\n   - p1&p2&~p3 is true under the assignment: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n   - Therefore, the false assignment for ~(p1&p2&~p3) is: \u2713|\u2713|x.\n\n### Formula (2): (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3)\n\n1. Identify components:\n   - ~p1 and p2 are Level A formulas.\n   - ~p1&p2 is a Level B formula.\n   - p1=p3 is a Level B formula.\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is a Level C formula.\n\n2. Truth values:\n   - (~p1&p2)=::>(p1=p3) is true except when (~p1&p2) is true and (p1=p3) is false.\n   - (~p1&p2) is true under assignments: x|\u2713|x, x|\u2713|\u2713.\n   - (p1=p3) is false when p1 and p3 have different truth values (\u2713|x or x|\u2713).\n   - So, true assignments include: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, etc.\n\n3. False values:\n   - This is specifically false when ~p1&p2 is true and p1=p3 is false.\n   - From above, this results in the assignment x|\u2713|x.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\nCombine the results for both formulas:\n\\[ [ \\text{T}: x|x|x, x|\u2713|\u2713, \u2713|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: \u2713|\u2713|x ] ; [ \\text{T}: \u2713|x|\u2713, x|x|x, x|x|\u2713, \\ldots ; \\text{F}: x|\u2713|x ] \\]\n\nThus, the output should be:\n\n\\[ [[T:x|x|x,x|\u2713|\u2713,\u2713|x|\u2713;F:\u2713|\u2713|x];[T:\u2713|x|\u2713,x|x|x,x|x|\u2713;F:x|\u2713|x]] \\]"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nDirect Propositions:\nReflect propositions that assert whether something does or does not possess a certain property, also known as property propositions or subject-predicate propositions.\n\nExamples:\n- [1] All metals are conductive.\n- [2] Some products of labor are not commodities.\n\nComposition of Direct Propositions:\n- Subject (S): The term in the proposition that denotes the object being discussed. Examples include \"metals\" in [1] and \"products of labor\" in [2].\n- Predicate (P): The term in the proposition that denotes the property of the object. Examples include \"conductive\" in [1] and \"commodities\" in [2].\n- Connectives(C): Words that connect the subject and predicate.\n    - Affirmative connective (e.g., \"are\"): Asserts that the subject possesses the property.\n    - Negative connective (e.g., \"are not\"): Asserts that the subject does not possess the property.\n- Quantifiers(Q): Words that indicate the quantity of objects referred to by the subject.\n    - Universal quantifier (e.g., \"all\"): Indicates all members.\n    - Particular quantifier (e.g., \"some\"): Indicates at least one member.\n\nLogical Forms of Direct Propositions:\n- Universal Affirmative (A): All S are P, abbreviated as SAP.\n- Universal Negative (E): No S are P, abbreviated as SEP.\n- Particular Affirmative (I): Some S are P, abbreviated as SIP.\n- Particular Negative (O): Some S are not P, abbreviated as SOP.\n- Singular Affirmative: a is P.\n- Singular Negative: a is not P.\n\nRelationships: \nThe relationships between declarative propositions are based on the premise that the subject and predicate are identical. \nThis identity is referred to as having the same subject (S) and predicate (P). \nThere are four types of relationships as follows:\n- * Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and O propositions, E propositions and I propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other is true.\n- # Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and E propositions.\n    - If one is true, the other is false; if one is false, the other may be true or false.\n- & Relation:\n    - Between I propositions and O propositions.\n    - If one is false, the other is true; if one is true, the other may be false or true.\n- % Relation:\n    - Between A propositions and I propositions, E propositions and O propositions.\n    - If the universal proposition is true, the particular proposition is true; if the particular proposition is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\n### Question:\nAfter a certain tax inspection, four tax inspectors came to the following conclusions:\n\n- Inspector A: All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector B: The individual business owner, Mr. Chen, did not pay taxes.\n- Inspector C: Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\n- Inspector D: Some individual businesses have not paid taxes.\n\nWhat is the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said among the four types?\n\nPlease answer in the format of [[*/#/&/%]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said, we first need to express their statements in terms of the logical forms provided.\n\n- Inspector A: \"All individual businesses did not pay taxes.\"\n\n  This can be written as a Universal Negative proposition:\n  - \"No individual businesses are taxpayers.\"\n  - Logical Form: SEP (S = individual businesses, P = taxpayers)\n\n- Inspector C: \"Some individual businesses have paid taxes.\"\n\n  This can be written as a Particular Affirmative proposition:\n  - \"Some individual businesses are taxpayers.\"\n  - Logical Form: SIP (S = individual businesses, P = taxpayers)\n\nNow, we need to identify the relationship between SEP and SIP:\n\n- The % Relation applies:\n  - Between E propositions (Universal Negative) and I propositions (Particular Affirmative).\n  - If the universal proposition is true (SEP), the particular proposition may be false (SIP); if the particular proposition (SIP) is false, the universal proposition is false.\n\nThus, the relationship between what Inspector A and Inspector C said is [[%]]."}

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining. To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element. After further research, they finally realised that this remaining radioactivity was a new element emitting radioactivity and isolated the elements radium and polonium from the leachate.\n\nThe causal derivation of this passage of the discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]"}

C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which principle the statement conforms to, let's apply the given logic rules:\n\n- **C* Principle (Cooperation and Strength of Information):** This principle involves saying something weaker or stronger and making inferences based on known contrasts or the inability to assert stronger claims. The statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm\" does not provide enough context about information strength or contrasting sets for inference as described in the CQ1 or CQ2 patterns.\n\n- **C% Principle (Minimalization of Expression):** This principle involves speaking minimally and relies on conventional relationships and expanding information from minimal speech. The statement about the beer being part of the food in the food box seems to relate to conventional associations\u2014food items often include beverages in a \"food box.\"\n\n- **C! Principle (Avoidance of Unmarked Expressions):** This principle focuses on not using lengthy or marked expressions unnecessarily. The given statement doesn't involve lengthy or complex language; it's straightforward.\n\nSince the statement likely reflects conventional associations (beer as part of food in a conventional context such as a picnic or meal), it aligns best with the minimalistic convention of the C% Principle.\n\nThe answer is: [[B]]"}
