Substitute \\( X①2 \\) into the expression for \\( 4②(X①2) \\) using the operation rule \\( a②b=\\sqrt{a}×b \\).\n   - \\( 4②(X①2) = \\sqrt{4} \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4) \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\), so it becomes \\( 2 \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4) \\).\n\n3. Set the above expression equal to 20:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4) = 20.\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( \\sqrt{X} \\):\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (\\sqrt{X} + 4) = 20,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{X} + 4 = 10,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{X} = 6.\n   \\]\n\n5. Square both sides to find \\( X \\):\n   \\[\n   X = 6^2 = 36.\n   \\]\n\nThe value of \\( X \\) is \\([[36]]\\)."}
