Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant properties and objects**:\n   - Proposition `p`: \"The library is open today.\"\n   - Alice (`A`): Skeptical about `p` (`H_Ap`).\n   - Bob (`B`): Can acknowledge Alice's skepticism (`A R B`).\n\n2. **Apply the logic rules**:\n   - By the **Introduction of Doubt** axiom: `H_Ap \u2192 \u00acB_Ap`. Since Alice is skeptical (`H_Ap`), she does not believe that the library is open (`\u00acB_Ap`).\n   - By the **Spread of Doubt** axiom: If `i R j` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`. Given `A R B` and `H_Ap`, it follows that `H_Bp`. This means Bob may also start to doubt whether the library is open today.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Bob is likely to begin doubting whether the library is open today. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[[C]]"}

A basic form contains the paired conjunctive term \\( m0 \\). The term \\( m0 \\) corresponds to the binary number 0000, which translates to the false assignment of all propositional variables being false.\n\n2. An all-even form means that the indices \\( i \\) of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form (PDNF) of A are all even.\n\n### Steps to determine the number of valid formulas:\n\n1. The paired conjunctive terms must include \\( m0 \\) to satisfy the basic form condition.\n\n2. For a formula to be an all-even form, the possible indices are even numbers. For 4 propositional variables, the binary numbers range from 0000 to 1111, i.e., from 0 to 15 in decimal:\n   - Even indices: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\n3. To satisfy both conditions, the formula must include \\( m0 \\) and may include any combination of the other even indices. Therefore, we need to count the number of subsets of the set of all even indices (excluding the \\( m0 \\) term).\n\nHere are the even indices excluding 0:\n- Possible even indices: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n\nThe total number of even indices available above is 7. For a formula set, you can choose any combination of these 7 terms. This leads to \\( 2^7 \\) possible combinations (since each index can either be included or excluded).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe number of formulas that satisfy both being a basic form (includes \\( m0 \\)) and an all-even form (contains only even indices):\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\n### Answer:\n[[128]]"}

All birds fly (hypothesis r_1).\n2. Penguins are birds (hypothesis r_2).\n3. Penguins do not fly (hypothesis r_3, which is a consequence of the observed phenomenon that penguins, despite being birds, do not fly).\n\nWhen combining these hypotheses, we get:\n\n- r_1 \u2227 r_2 \u2227 r_3:\n\nThis produces a contradiction as:\n- r_1 states: All birds fly.\n- r_2 states: Penguins are birds.\n- r_3 states: Penguins do not fly.\n\nThus, the combination of these reasonable hypotheses leads to a logical inconsistency, prompting a reassessment of their reasonableness. This typifies the LS Paradox, where multiple reasonable hypotheses, when taken together, result in a logical contradiction."}

This is not directly applicable here since we are dealing with an observation and default assumption rather than varying information strengths.\n\n- **C% Principle**: Involves minimizing speech and using default assumptions unless evidence suggests otherwise, and expanding information based on convention. This matches the scenario, where just observation and minimal assertion lead to the inference that beer is part of the food.\n\n- **C!

Identify paired conjunctive terms:\n   - First, we identify the paired conjunctive terms within the formula.\n   - (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) is a conjunctive term. The false assignment of \u00acp, \u00acq, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 0, which gives the binary number 110 (6 in decimal, 6 in hexadecimal). So, M6 corresponds to \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r.\n   - (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) is another conjunctive term. The true assignment of p, q, and r would be p = 1, q = 1, r = 1, which gives the binary number 111 (7 in decimal, 7 in hexadecimal). So, m7 corresponds to p \u2227 q \u2227 r.\n\n2. Principal disjunctive normal form:\n   - The given formula (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (p \u2227 q \u2227 r) corresponds to the inclusion of M6 and m7 in its principal disjunctive normal form.\n\n3. Apply the classification rules:\n   - A tautology includes all \\(2^n\\) paired conjunctive terms. Our formula does not include all possible terms, so it\u2019s not a tautology.\n   - A contradiction would include no paired conjunctive terms. Our formula includes paired conjunctive terms (M6 and m7), so it\u2019s not a contradiction.\n   - A basic formula includes m0. Our formula does not include m0, so it\u2019s not a basic formula.\n   - An all-even formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with even indices. Our formula includes m7, which is odd, so it\u2019s not an all-even formula.\n   - An all-odd formula includes only paired conjunctive terms with odd indices. Our formula includes M6, which is even, so it\u2019s not an all-odd formula.\n\n4.

Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A \u21d1 B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A \u21d3 B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the 16 Basic Equivalences, is the equivalence below valid? A. Yes B. No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the given 16 Basic Equivalences and the rules for propositional symbolization, let's evaluate each equivalence to determine if it holds true.\n\n#### Equivalence (1): ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n1. Express \\( p > q \\) and \\( p > r \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\)\n   - \\( p > r ::=:: !p | r \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the left-hand side (LHS):\n   - \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!p | r))\\)\n\n3. Now, express \\( p > (q | r) \\) using equivalence (10):\n   - \\( p > (q | r) ::=:: !p | (q | r) \\)\n\n4. Compare the two expressions:\n   - LHS: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r)\\)\n   - RHS: \\(!p | (q | r)\\)\n   \n5. Use equivalence (5) to simplify LHS (Distributive Law):\n   - \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) ::=:: !p | (q & r)\\) [Incorrect application; actual equivalence: \\((!p | q) & (!p | r) = ((!p | q) & !p) = !p\\)]\n\n   We should instead note that \\(!p | (q & r)\\) is not identical to \\(!p | (q | r)\\).\n\nSo, \\(((p > q) & (p > r)) ::=:: (p > (q | r))\\) is generally simplified as:\n   \\[(p \u21d1 q) & (p \u21d1 r) ::=:: p \u21d1 (q | r)\\]\nWhich means the equivalence (1) holds and is TRUE.\n\n#### Equivalence (2): !(p = q) ::=:: (p | q) & !(p & q)\n1. Express \\((p = q)\\) using equivalence (11):\n   - \\( p = q ::=:: (p > q) & (q > p) \\)\n   - Since \\( p > q ::=:: !p | q \\), we have:\n     \\[ p = q ::=:: ((!p | q) & (!q | p)) \\]\n\n2. Apply negation using equivalence (6):\n   - \\(!(p = q)) ::=:: !((!p | q) & (!q | p))\\)\n   - Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6):\n     \\[ !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: !(!p | q) | !(!q | p) \\]\n     Using De Morgan transformation:\n     \\[ (!p | q)' ::=:: !p & !q' \u2192 p & !q \\]\n     So:\n     !((!p | q) & (!q | p)) ::=:: (p & !q) | (!q & p) \n\n3. Simplify other side:\n   (p | q) & !(p & q)\n    - Apply equivalence (6):\n    ikkore komi:\n   - \\((p | q) & !(p & q) = (p | q) & (!p | !q)\\)\n\nNow compare:\n   \\[(p & !q) | (!q & !p)=   \\((p | q) & !(p & q) \\]\n\nSo because equivalence states:\n\n The equivalence holds.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the representations of the given statements confirm their validity.\n\n**Answer**: [[A];[A]].\n"}
