Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\nA@B denotes the element-by-element maximization operation (A @ B)_{ij} = \\max(A_{ij}, B_{ij}) of matrix A and matrix B.\n\n### Question:\nA=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 6 \\\\\n  7 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nB=\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  2 & 7 \\\\\n  9 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nCompute A&B.\nThe answer is a matrix, write it in this form:[[((a,b),(c,d))]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve for \\( A @ B \\) using the given rule, we need to perform the element-by-element maximization operation between matrix \\( A \\) and matrix \\( B \\).\n\nGiven matrices:\n\\[ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\\[ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 \\\\ 9 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWe apply the operation \\((A @ B)_{ij} = \\max(A_{ij}, B_{ij})\\) for each corresponding element in matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nStep-by-step element-wise comparison:\n1. \\( \\max(5, 2) = 5 \\)\n2. \\( \\max(6, 7) = 7 \\)\n3. \\( \\max(7, 9) = 9 \\)\n4. \\( \\max(8, 0) = 8 \\)\n\nThus, the resulting matrix \\( A @ B \\) is:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 7 \\\\ 9 & 8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThe matrix in the required form is:\n\\[ [[((5, 7), (9, 8))]] \\]\n\nThis is the final answer."}
