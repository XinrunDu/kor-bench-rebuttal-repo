Correctly interpreting what seems to be intended, we can pair \"1 ^7\" as \"1\" not being a valid code and \"7 ^4\" decrypting to \"S\".\n- \"4 ^4\" is not in the table, but again, interpreting as \"4 ^3\" for \"I\" and considering the \"4\" without a \"^\" to be \"4 ^1\" for \"G\".\n- \"3 ^8\" is not in the table, but continuing the pattern, it seems \"3 ^6\" should be \"F\" and \"8 ^1\" should be \"T\".\n- \"3 ^7\" is also not in the table, but continuing the pattern, it seems \"3 ^2\" should be \"E\".\n- \"3 ^16\" seems to be a typo, but interpreting this as \"3 ^3\" for \"F\".\n- \"1 ^3\" is not in the table, but if we're correcting the pattern, we'll take \"1\" to stand on its own as \"1 ^1\", which decrypts to \"A\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted message, correcting the likely errors in the provided ciphertext based on the Multitap Code Table structure, is:\n\n\"DNA BISG FTFA\"\n\nHowever, this does not look like a meaningful message. It seems there were misinterpretations when writing the ciphertext, likely in how the numbers and \"^\" were paired. Assuming the intention was to pair each number with its subsequent \"^\" character and the following number as it would be natural in a Multitap system, we correct the original ciphertext interpretation to:\n\n- \"3 ^1\" = D\n- \"9 ^4\" = Z\n- \"6 ^2\" = N\n- \"1 ^7\" (assumed to mean \"7 ^4\") = S\n- \"4 ^3\" = I\n- \"3 ^6\" (assumed to mean \"3 ^2\") = E\n- \"8 ^1\" = T\n- \"3 ^7\" (assumed to mean \"3 ^3\") = F\n- \"1 ^8\" (assumed to mean \"8 ^1\") = T\n- \"1 ^3\" (assumed to mean \"1 ^3\", corrected as \"3 ^3\") = F\n\nThis correction yields the correctly decrypted message: \"DNA SIEFTFTF\".\n\nGiven the structure and typos, and to ensure the decryption aligns with the intent of the Multitap Code Table, the actual, corrected ciphertext should have been: \"3 ^1 9 ^4 6 ^2 7 ^4 4 ^3 3 ^2 8 ^1 3 ^3 3 ^3\".\n\nThus, the correctly decrypted message should be: \"DNIETFTF\".\n\nFormatted as required: [[DNIETFTF]].\n\n**Note:** The initial interpretation was based on the provided ciphertext and the notice of typos or misunderstandings in how the numbers were paired. The final correction assumes the intended structure and pairing for each Multitap code, which differs from the initial, direct interpretation due to the apparent errors in the ciphertext."}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the single character ciphertext \"S\" using the given rules, we follow the decryption steps:\n\n1. Since we have only one character, it forms a single block by itself. There's no need to group, as it's already a single block.\n2. The block number for \"S\" is 0 (since it's the first and only block).\n3. Calculate the grid index: grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0. Thus, we use Grid0.\n4. In Grid0, find the position of \"S\". It's in row 0, column 4.\n5. Move one position to the upper left. If we cross the boundary, we continue on the opposite side. Moving from row 0, column 4 to the upper left brings us to row 4, column 0 in Grid0 since the movement wraps around the grid.\n6. The new position (row 4, column 0) in Grid0 corresponds to the letter \"P\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted message for the ciphertext \"S\" is \"P\". Encapsulated in the required format, the answer is:\n\n[[P]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"B\" using the provided rules, we follow the decryption steps. Since the ciphertext is only one character, it forms a single block. The block number is 0, and since the block size is 5 characters, this doesn't affect the grid selection in this case (as grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 will always be 0 for the first block).\n\n1. **Grid Selection**: The grid_index calculation is unnecessary for a single character, but for consistency, the formula would give us 0 for the first block, so we use Grid0.\n\n2. **Decryption Step**: \n   - The character \"B\" is not \"J\", so we proceed with decryption.\n   - In Grid0, \"B\" is located at row 1, column 1.\n   - Moving one position up and left (or wrapping around from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner) brings us to the character \"A\" at row 5, column 4 in Grid0.\n\n3. **Result**: The decrypted character for \"B\" is \"A\".\n\nThus, the decrypted answer encapsulated in double square brackets is:\n\n[[A]]"}

The ciphertext is already a single block of 2 characters, so we don't need to divide it into further blocks.\n2. Since this is the 0th block, we calculate the grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0, meaning we use Grid0.\n3. For each character in the block, we apply the decryption rules:\n   - P: In Grid0, finding P and moving one position up-left gives A.\n   - R: In Grid0, finding R and moving one position up-left gives O.\n\nThus, the decrypted answer for \"PR\" is \"AO\".

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"XTVITDXEHZS\" using the given cipher rules, we'll follow the steps outlined in the encryption rules:\n\n1. Group the plaintext into blocks of 5 characters, resulting in \"XTVIT\" and \"DXEHZ\". The last character 'S' will not fit into a 5-character block, so it will be handled according to the rules (in this case, we have a full block and a partial block, which we'll treat as is).\n\n2. Determine the grid to use for each block:\n   - For the first block (\"XTVIT\"), `i = 0` (since it's the first block), so `grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0`, thus we use Grid0.\n   - For the second block (\"DXEHZ\"), `i = 1`, so `grid_index = (1 // 5) % 8 = 1`, thus we use Grid1.\n\n3. Encrypt each character in the blocks using the appropriate grid. For each character, we move one position to the lower right, wrapping around if necessary:\n\n   - Block 1 (\"XTVIT\") using Grid0:\n     - X -> Y\n     - T -> U\n     - V -> W\n     - I -> L\n     - T -> U\n\n   - Block 2 (\"DXEHZ\") using Grid1:\n     - D -> E\n     - X -> Y\n     - E -> F\n     - H -> K\n     - Z -> A (since we wrap around from Z to A in this grid)\n\n4. Combine the encrypted characters to form the encrypted message: \"YUWLUEYFKA\". Notice that 'S' is a single character left after grouping, and according to the rules, it is not encrypted, so we add it directly to the end of the encrypted message.\n\nTherefore, the final encrypted message is: \"YUWLUEYFKA\" + \"S\" = \"YUWLUEYFKAS\".\n\nEncapsulating the encrypted answer in double square brackets as requested:\n\n[[YUWLUEYFKAS]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"M\" with the key \"NNADYGVZS\", we follow the decryption rules:\n\n1. Pair each letter of the key with each letter in the ciphertext. Since the ciphertext is a single letter, we only need the first letter of the key, which is \"N\".\n\n2. The key letter \"N\" corresponds to the cipher alphabet \"MN: UVWXYZNOPQRSTGHIJKLMABCDEF\".\n\n3. Find the position of the ciphertext letter \"M\" in the cipher alphabet \"MN\" (UVWXYZNOPQRSTGHIJKLMABCDEF), which is at the position of the 12th letter (counting from U as the 1st letter).\n\n4. Reduce this position to the plaintext letter using the same position in the standard alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ), which is the 12th letter, \"M\".\n\nThus, the decrypted answer for the single letter \"M\" with the key starting with \"N\" in this specific context remains \"M\".\n\nThe decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets as requested, is:\n\n[[M]]\n\nHowever, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation due to the structure of the question. Given the cipher rules and the provided ciphertext \"M\" and key \"NNADYGVZS\", we actually need to decrypt the letter \"M\" using the first letter of the key, which is \"N\", and then use the cipher alphabet associated with \"N\", which is \"MN: UVWXYZNOPQRSTGHIJKLMABCDEF\".\n\nTo correctly decrypt \"M\":\n\n1. Identify the paired key letter, which is \"N\".\n2. Find \"M\" in the \"MN\" cipher alphabet: UVWXYZNOPQRSTGHIJKLMABCDEF.\n3. \"M\" is found at the position corresponding to \"M\" in the standard alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.\n4. This means \"M\" in the ciphertext corresponds to \"M\" in the plaintext (since it's its own mapping in this particular cipher alphabet).\n\nTherefore, the correctly decrypted answer encapsulated in double square brackets is:\n\n[[M]]\n\nThis corrects the initial misunderstanding and provides the accurate decryption according to the specified rules."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"984\", we follow the decryption rules provided:\n\n1. Convert each digit in the ciphertext back into the corresponding Morse code character pair using the numerical-index mapping table.\n   - 9 maps to \"./\"\n   - 8 maps to \"-.\"\n   - 4 maps to \".-\"\n\n2. Combine these Morse code pairs. Since there is an odd number of digits, the last digit is not processed by itself and is considered the end of the Morse code for a character. However, in our case, we have three digits that can be paired, which is unusual based on the rules provided. The correct interpretation, considering the rules, would be to treat the last digit as part of the Morse code for the last character, making the Morse code sequence \"./-.-.-\". However, this interpretation creates a mismatch with the provided Morse code table and the decryption process (as the rule seems to imply that any single unpaired character at the end should be ignored, not part of a pair). Given the provided digit \"4\", it seems there was a misunderstanding in directly applying the rules to the given ciphertext. Correctly applying the decryption process to \"984\" (treating \"4\" as additional, based on the rule description) leads us to:\n   - \"98\" maps to \"./-.\" and \".-\" (but we stop before fully interpreting \"8\" as it's an odd digit)\n   - \"4\" is an extra digit that, according to the rules, should not be paired with anything and does not contribute to a character pair, but directly to the end of the Morse code sequence. This implies the last character's Morse code ends with \".4\", which is not valid Morse code and contradicts our understanding.\n\nGiven the contradiction and the likely misinterpretation of the rules, a corrected approach, adhering more closely to what seems like the intention of the rules (since \"4\" cannot stand alone as part of a Morse code sequence without a second character), suggests we treat \"984\" as an oversight in directly applying the digit-to-Morse mapping due to the odd number of digits. The correct approach, when faced with an odd number of digits in the original ciphertext \"984\", is thus:\n\n- \"98\" maps to \"./-.\"\n- \"4\" should be ignored according to the rule about odd lengths, as it cannot form a proper Morse code pair, but in the spirit of decrypting without lost information, we'll consider it part of the last character's Morse code. However, this is where the rules and the given ciphertext create an issue. If we strictly follow the rules and the given Morse code table, \"4\" mapping to \".-\" does not stand alone but must be paired. The only correct interpretation, given the rules, seems to be a typo or misunderstanding in the ciphertext or the decryption instructions regarding odd digits.\n\nAssuming the \"4\" actually represents a correctly paired sequence (though this is an assumption to fit the rules), we proceed with:\n\n- \"984\" interpreted as \"./-.-.-\" due to the odd digit being treated exceptionally to avoid data loss.\n\n3. Now, split the Morse code by \"/\" and convert each part back into the plaintext character using the morse_code table. The correct sequence should be \"./-.-.-\", but we'll correct for the apparent mistake in the interpretation:\n   - \"./\" -> no direct mapping, but treating \".\" and \"/\" separately, \".\" maps to \"E\" (correcting for the improper pair created by the odd digit)\n   - \".-\" -> \"A\"\n   - \"-.\" -> \"N\" (again, correcting the interpretation based on actual Morse code pairs)\n\n4. The final plaintext should be \"EN\". However, due to adjustments made to fit the rules, the correct interpretation of \"984\" based on strict adherence to the decryption rules and the correction for the odd number of digits, the plaintext is:\n   - \"EA\" (since the last \"N\" was part of our correction and not directly supported by the ciphertext under the corrected interpretation)\n\nThus, encapsulated in double square brackets:\n\n[[EA]]\n\nThis interpretation aims to correct for the apparent contradiction and follow the spirit of the decryption rules, highlighting a discrepancy in the provided ciphertext and the decryption steps. Given the original uncorrected process and the typo assumption, the base answer before correction would have been \"[[EN]]\", but the correct interpretation of the decryption rules and the provided ciphertext, adjusted for the odd digit and aiming to not lose information, yields \"[[EA]]\"."}

For each letter in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates in the grid.\n   - L: (3, 2)\n   - X: (4, 3)\n   - R: (3, 0)\n   - P: (3, 1)\n   - W: (4, 0)\n   - X: (4, 3)\n   - K: (1, 3)\n   - E: (1, 4)\n   - A: (0, 4)\n   - G: (1, 1)\n\n2. Arrange the coordinates in a sequence by taking one row coordinate and then one column coordinate in the order they appear:\n   - [3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1]\n\n3. Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, where the first half is all the original row coordinates, and the second half is all the original column coordinates:\n   - Row coordinates: [3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1]\n   - Column coordinates: [4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1]\n\n4.

However, since the decryption process should not introduce any 'X' unless it was part of the original plaintext (which is not mentioned in the decryption rules and seems like an error in the ciphertext decryption), and given the encryption rule states to remove 'J' and punctuation, we can infer that the 'X's in the decryption likely came from misinterpreted pairs of coordinates due to the original ciphertext's repetition of 'X'. \n\nGiven the grid and the rules, 'X' in the ciphertext would correspond to a coordinate pair of (4, 3), but since we are decrypting and no 'X' should be in the plaintext, we must have incorrectly paired some coordinates. The likely correct pairing for the second half of the ciphertext, considering the given rules and typical English spelling, would interpret 'WX' and 'KE' not as separate pairs but as part of 'WXXKE', which would decrypt to 'ON' instead of 'ONAX'. \n\nSo, the corrected decryption considering the rules and typical plaintext would be:\n- (3, 4) -> H\n- (4, 2) -> Y\n- (2, 3) -> D\n- (3, 3) -> R\n- (3, 4) -> O\n- (4, 0) -> N\n- (0, 4) -> A\n- (4, 0) -> N\n- (4, 3) (mispair) + (3, 4) + (0, 1) + (1, 4) -> ON (corrected)\n\nThus, the final decrypted plaintext is \"HYDRONAON\". Encapsulated in double square brackets as required:\n\n[[HYDRONAON]]\n\nThis correction assumes that the ciphertext contained a mistake in its formation, which sometimes happens in practice, and that the plaintext follows typical English letter patterns more closely than the strict decryption process suggests based on the given ciphertext alone. If we strictly follow the decryption process without any correction to the coordinates interpretation, the answer would be as initially calculated: [[HYDRONAXXTET]]. However, the context and the task's nature suggest that the correct plaintext, adhering to the rules' spirit and typical English text, should not contain 'XX', leading to the corrected interpretation."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"BK\" according to the given cipher rule, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove spaces and punctuation, convert to uppercase (already done since the input is \"BK\").\n2. Split the plaintext into groups of 6 characters. Since \"BK\" is less than 6 characters, we pad it with `#` to make it a group of 6, resulting in \"BK#####\".\n3. Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups. In this case, we have \"BK\" as the first binary group and \"###\" as the second and third binary groups, but since \"###\" is just padding, we only need to process \"BK\".\n4. For each binary group, find the row and column numbers in the respective grids and output the corresponding triple.\n\n- For \"BK\":\n  - In Grid 1, B is at row 1, column 1.\n  - In Grid 2, K is at row 2, column 2.\n  - In Grid 3, with B's row (1) and K's column (2), the corresponding number is 3.\n  \nSo, for \"BK\", the output triple is (1, 3, 2).\n\nSince we have only one binary group, we only have one triple, which directly translates to the final numeric string without further concatenation: 132.\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer encapsulated in double square brackets is:\n\n[[132]]\n\nIf the rule implied that we must encrypt the entire padded group (which was not clear from the initial instructions), we would also include the padding characters in the encryption process:\n\n- For \"##\":\n  - In Grid 1, `#` is at row 2, column 8.\n  - In Grid 2, `#` is at row 8, column 2.\n  - In Grid 3, with `#`'s row (2) and `#`'s column (2), the corresponding number is 3.\n  \nSo, for \"##\", the output triple is (8, 3, 8). This would be repeated for the next \"##\" as well, giving another (8, 3, 8).\n\nThus, the entire encrypted message, including the padding characters, would be: 132838838. However, given that the emphasis seemed to be on the actual plaintext content (\"BK\") rather than the padding, the initial answer [[132]] stands as the correct interpretation if we are to encrypt only the meaningful part of the message and not the padding added to make the group complete.\n\nIf the requirement was to encrypt the whole padded group, then the correct encrypted answer would be:\n\n[[132838838]]"}

For example, A has 0 rows and 2 columns.\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6. Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Locate the character \"N\" in the 6x6 matrix. It is found at row 4 and column 4.\n2. Convert the row and column numbers to their corresponding letters in the encrypted character set \"ADFGVX\". Row 4 corresponds to \"G\", and column 4 corresponds to \"V\".\n3. The encrypted binary for \"N\" is thus (G, V).\n4. Since there is only one character in the plaintext, there is no rearrangement of the encrypted binary needed, and the final ciphertext is \"GV\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets as requested, is:\n\n[[GV]]"}

Write the ciphertext sequentially, line by line, 7 letters per line. Since the ciphertext has exactly 7 characters, it fits on one line:\n\n   X I M M B X G\n\n2. Read line by line, but when reading each line, read a character in column 2 (which corresponds to 0 in the transposed sequence list), then a character in column 0 (which corresponds to 1), then a character in column 6 (which corresponds to 2), and so on according to the inverse order of the transposed sequence list.\n\n   The inverse mapping of the transposed sequence list to its original indices is:\n   [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3]\n\n   Using this inverse mapping, we read the characters in the following order:\n   - Column 2 (X)\n   - Column 0 (X)\n   - Column 4 (M)\n   - Column 5 (B)\n   - Column 6 (G)\n   - Column 1 (I)\n   - Column 3 (M)\n\n3.

The correct approach to decrypt is to simply reverse the transposition operation from encryption, which means reading the columns in the original order defined by the transposition sequence, not applying the sequence again to the ciphertext. The correct decryption considering the transposition sequence should directly reorder the characters based on the given sequence, not the inverse of it, as I incorrectly suggested earlier. Let's correct the decryption with the proper sequence:\n\n   Original transposition sequence: [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n   Decrypt by reversing this operation:\n\n   X I M M B X G\n   | | | | | | |\n   v v v v v v v\n   1 4 0 6 5 2 3 Original transposition sequence\n\n   Character mapping:\n   - 1 -> I (1)\n   - 4 -> M (4)\n   - 0 -> X (0)\n   - 6 -> B (6)\n   - 5 -> G (5)\n   - 2 -> M (2)\n   - 3 -> X (3)\n\n   Correct decrypted plaintext, considering the provided rules and the correct decryption method: \"XMBGIMX\"\n\nSo, encapsulated in double square brackets as per the requirement:\n\n[[XMBGIMX]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"UL\" according to the specified cipher rules, we will follow the encryption steps:\n\n1. **Convert Each Character to Binary:**\n   - U (ASCII 85) in binary: 01010101\n   - L (ASCII 76) in binary: 01001100\n\n2. **XOR Operation:**\n   Assuming the fixed key is `10101010`, we perform XOR with each binary representation:\n   - XOR of U (01010101) with key (10101010): 11111111\n   - XOR of L (01001100) with key (10101010): 11100110\n\n3. **Permutation:**\n   Apply the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) to each result:\n   - Permute 11111111: 11111111 (no change if the permutation doesn't swap any bits)\n   - Permute 11100110: 11011110\n\n4. **Combine Binary Strings:**\n   - Final ciphertext: 1111111111011110\n\nTherefore, the encrypted answer encapsulated in double square brackets is:\n\n[[1111111111011110]]\n\n---\n\nTo clarify, the permutation table provided permutes the bits according to the given order. Since the permutation table `(2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)` places the bits in the same position for the binary string `11111111` (all 1s), there is no effective change. However, for any binary string where the bits are not all the same, the permutation would result in a different sequence. For example, for the binary string `11100110`, the permutation results in `11011110`, as shown in step 3. The permutation affects the order of the bits according to the permutation table, rearranging them for encryption. For decryption, the inverse permutation would be applied to reverse the process.\n\nGiven the permutation table `(2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)`, the inverse permutation `(1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7)` provided in the instructions seems to be incorrect for general decryption since it does not fully reverse the original permutation. For proper decryption, the inverse permutation should be `(2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7)` to correctly reverse the positions for all indices. However, the given example does not require the decryption process, and the clarification is for the accuracy of the decryption steps if needed. The encryption process and the provided encrypted answer remain valid based on the steps and permutation given in the instructions."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"N\" according to the specified rules, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Padding:** Since \"N\" is a single byte, it needs to be padded to a multiple of 8 bytes. We pad it with 7 null characters (\\x00) to make it 8 bytes: \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\".\n\n2. **Block Splitting:** There's only one block.\n\n3. **Block Encryption:** \n   - **Convert Block to Bytes:** \"N\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" is already in bytes.\n   - **XOR with Key:** We XOR each byte with the corresponding byte from the fixed key.\n   - **Substitute:** For each byte, we replace the high and low 4 bits using S_BOX.\n   - **Permute:** Rotate each byte left by 1 bit.\n   - **XOR with Key:** XOR the permuted bytes with the fixed key again.\n\n4. **Hexadecimal Encoding:** Convert the encrypted block to a hexadecimal string.\n\n5. **Concatenate:** Since there's only one block, this step is effectively skipped.\n\nGiven the fixed key and S_BOX, without loss of generality, let's assume the encryption operations work as follows (Note: The actual values depend on the implementation of the byte operations and whether we treat characters as their ASCII values or use raw byte values; here, we'll consider ASCII values for simplicity):\n\n- \"N\" in ASCII is 0x4E. After padding, we have: 0x4E 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00.\n- XOR with the fixed key (we'll take the ASCII values of '1234567890 ABCDEF' as the key bytes): 0x4E XOR 0x31 = 0x7F, 0x00 XOR 0x32 = 0x32, and so on.\n- After the first XOR, let's say we get bytes that, after substituting with S_BOX (taking only the first byte for illustration): The high 4 bits of 0x7F are 0x7, and the low 4 bits are 0xF; looking up in S_BOX, we might get new values, which we concatenate to a new byte. Do this for all bytes.\n- Permute: Rotate each substituted byte left by 1 bit.\n- XOR with Key: XOR the permuted bytes with the fixed key again.\n\nGiven these operations, let's denote the final byte we get after all these operations as `EB` (encrypted byte for the letter \"N\"). The actual value of `EB` depends on the byte operations and the specifics of the S_BOX and key interpretation, which are not fully detailed in the question. We'll symbolically represent the steps.\n\nThe final step is to convert the encrypted byte block to a hexadecimal string. Assuming `EB` represents the encrypted form of \"N\" after the described operations, and `E1` through `E7` represent the encrypted forms of the padded null bytes, the hexadecimal representation would look like: `[EB E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7]` in hex, where we ensure A-E are capitalized.\n\nTherefore, without the exact values for each step due to the symbolic representation, the encrypted answer format is:\n\n`[[EB E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7]]`\n\nThis is a symbolic representation of the encryption process applied to \"N\". The actual hexadecimal values inside the brackets depend on the specifics of the S_BOX application, XOR operations with the given key, and byte rotation. Without executing these operations in a programming environment, the precise hexadecimal values are abstracted as `EB` for the encrypted \"N\" and `E1` through `E7` for the encrypted padded bytes."}

However, following the literal instructions as given (using `^` for multiplication):\n\n- If we interpret `^` as exponentiation (raising to the power of):\n  - `90^263 mod 299` would not be feasible using `^` for multiplication but rather as standard for exponentiation.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "First, let's clarify the decryption process based on the provided rules. The decryption steps mention using `c^e mod n`, where `^` means multiplication, which seems to be a mistake in the decryption description considering the typical use of modular exponentiation in cryptography. Assuming the intention is to perform modular exponentiation for decryption (as it is for encryption and typically used in cryptography like RSA), we should interpret `c^e mod n` as the exponentiation operation (not multiplication), and there should be a decryption exponent `d` such that `d` is the modular inverse of `e` modulo `n`.\n\nGiven the mistake in the decryption description, let's correct the decryption process assuming a correct RSA-like decryption. We need to find the modular inverse of `e` (263) modulo `n` (299), which is the private exponent `d`. This is necessary for decryption, as the correct decryption formula is `c^d mod n`, where `c` is the ciphertext, `d` is the private exponent, and `n` is the modulus.\n\nTo find `d` such that `d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))`, we first need to find `φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)`, where `n = p * q` and `p` and `q` are two distinct prime numbers. However, `n` is given as 299, which is not a valid RSA modulus since it's not the product of two distinct primes (299 is itself a prime number). For the sake of this example, let's correct this by assuming a valid `n` is provided or that we can proceed with the given operations understanding the theoretical issue with the provided `n`. We will use the given `n` and proceed with the decryption process under this assumption.\n\nTo compute `d` with the given `e` and assuming a corrected understanding of the decryption process, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of `e` modulo `φ(n)` (or directly modulo `n` in this hypothetical case since `n` is prime and thus `φ(n) = n-1`).\n\nHowever, to follow the spirit of the question and its internal consistency, let's proceed with the given operations but note that the interpretation of `^` as multiplication in decryption is incorrect; it should be exponentiation for RSA-like decryption. Given the confusion in the original text, we'll perform the operations as described but recognize that in practice, this is not a valid decryption for RSA due to the issues mentioned.\n\nGiven ciphertext: \"17 ,156 ,4 ,54 ,213 ,17 ,23 ,84 ,228 ,54 ,281 \"\n\nPerforming the step as described:\n\n- For each number `c`, calculate `z = c^e mod n`, where `^` mistakenly denotes multiplication (not exponentiation as typically used in RSA decryption). This is not how RSA decryption works, but we'll follow the provided rule for the sake of this exercise.\n\nGiven `e = 263` and `n = 299`, decryption would proceed as follows (using incorrect multiplication operation):\n\n1. Decrypting `17`: `17 * 263 mod 299 = 23`\n2. Decrypting `156`: `156 * 263 mod 299 = 227`\n3. Decrypting `4`: `4 * 263 mod 299 = 102`\n4. Decrypting `54`: `54 * 263 mod 299 = 51`\n5. Decrypting `213`: `213 * 263 mod 299 = 20`\n6. Decrypting `17`: `17 * 263 mod 299 = 23`\n7. Decrypting `23`: `23 * 263 mod 299 = 43`\n8. Decrypting `84`: `84 * 263 mod 299 = 148`\n9. Decrypting `228`: `228 * 263 mod 299 = 93`\n10. Decrypting `54`: `54 * 263 mod 299 = 51`\n11. Decrypting `281`: `281 * 263 mod 299 = 156`\n\nThese numbers do not directly convert back to ASCII codes for uppercase letters (65-90) when interpreted as incorrectly described. If we were to treat the operation as intended in RSA decryption (though mathematically incorrect in this context), we would find the modular inverse of e (which is not possible with n as a prime as given in the problem, but for the sake of argument, let's ignore that for this step), and then apply the correct decryption formula, `c^d mod n`, where `d` is the modular inverse of `e` modulo `n` (or `φ(n)`), which isn't properly defined in the question due to the incorrect process described.\n\nSince the decryption process as described does not lead to a valid decryption in the context of RSA or a typical substitution cipher, and recognizing the confusion in the operation `^` being described as multiplication in decryption, we'll compute the described operation despite its incorrectness in a typical cryptographic context:\n\nDecrypted (incorrectly as per the given rules): [23, 227, 102, 51, 20, 23, 43, 148, 93, 51, 156]\n\nThis is not a valid decryption, as the numbers do not correspond to printable ASCII codes. Assuming a mistake in the decryption rule where multiplication was intended to be modular exponentiation, the actual decryption process should use modular exponentiation.\n\nHowever, to directly answer the question following the instructions and acknowledging the inconsistencies in the described decryption method, and recognizing the output of the process as not directly corresponding to ASCII codes:\n\n[[INCORRECT DECRYPTION: PROCESS DESCRIPTION ERROR, DECRYPTION UNSUCCESSFUL]]\n\nThis highlights the need for the correct decryption process as used in RSA, which involves finding the modular inverse of `e` and using it for decryption with the formula `c^d mod n`, where `d` is the modular inverse of `e`. Given the question's internal inconsistencies, the direct answer is provided above to reflect the literal application of the described, albeit incorrect, process.正确的解密过程应使用模幂运算。\n\n然而，为了直接回答问题，遵循指令并认识到所描述的解密方法中的不一致性，以及认识到输出与ASCII码不直接对应：\n\n[[错误的解密：过程描述错误，解密不成功]]\n\n这强调了需要正确的RSA解密过程，它涉及找到`e`的模逆元，并使用公式`c^d mod n`进行解密，其中`d`是`e`的模逆元。鉴于问题的内部不一致性，上述提供了直接答案，以反映所描述的、错误的解密过程的字面应用。"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nCiphertext: \"25\"\n\nPlease provide the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"25\", we will follow the decryption rules provided. The SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\" is given as '73 ef2 a4 edd7 a7 fbf07 fd5 f6 faf99674 dc0 c25 a025 fd74 c221 f4 c35849 e5 c0 fb3 ' without the spaces, which we'll use as the key. However, the provided ciphertext \"25\" is only a single byte when converted from hexadecimal, which is unusual given the process involves XOR with the key. Typically, the plaintext would be longer, but we'll proceed with the single byte we have.\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"25\", which in hexadecimal corresponds to the byte 0x25, and the first byte of the key, which is 0x73 (from '73 ef2 a4 edd7...'), we XOR these two bytes to decrypt.\n\n0x25 XOR 0x73 = 0x56\n\nConverting the resulting byte 0x56 back to ASCII gives us the character 'V'.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets as requested, is:\n\n[[V]]\n\nPlease note that this is a very unusual scenario since the process is designed to work with longer texts that allow for the cycling of the key bytes. Normally, the process would involve XORing each byte of the ciphertext with the corresponding byte of the key, cycling the key if necessary, to produce a longer plaintext output. Here, due to the single-byte input, we only get a single character."}
