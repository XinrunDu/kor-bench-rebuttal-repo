Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nPropositions are represented using p1, p2, ..., pn.\nLet p1 be a proposition, the compound proposition \"not p1\" is represented as ~p1.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 and p2\" is represented as p1&p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 or p2\" is represented as p1||p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"if p1, then p2\" is represented as p1=::>p2.\nLet p1 and p2 be two propositions, the compound proposition \"p1 if and only if p2\" is represented as p1=p2.\nA single proposition and proposition constants can be called a formula.\nFormulas are represented using F1, F2, ..., Fn.\nIf F1 is a formula, then ~F1 is also a formula.\nIf F1 and F2 are formulas, then F1&F2, F1||F2, F1=::>F2, F1=F2 are also formulas.\nLevel A Formula: The most basic proposition unit, without logical connectives or nested structures.\nLevel B Formula: A formula containing one logical connective, and the connected two propositions are both Level A formulas.For example, p1.\nLevel C Formula: A formula containing nested logical connectives and at least one Level B formula.For example, ~p1.\nOther levels of logic follow by analogy; when higher than Level Z, they are classified as Z+n (n\u22651).For example, ~(~p1).\nTrue assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as \u2713, indicating that p1 is true.\nFalse assignment of a proposition: A proposition p1 is assigned as x, indicating that p1 is false.\nTrue assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|x,\u2713|\u2713|x are true assignments of the formula.\nFalse assignment of a formula: If the formula is (~p1&~p2&~p3)||(p1&p2), then x|x|\u2713,x|\u2713|\u2713 are false assignments of the formula.\nFor p1=::>p2, only \u2713|x is a false assignment of the formula.\nA formula that is true under all assignments is called a Truth Formula.\nA formula that is false under all assignments is called a Falsehood Formula.\nRecursive definition of formulas: Any formula containing nested logical connectives can be decomposed recursively to obtain its subformulas and their logical connective structures.\nPriority of logical connectives: The priority of logical connectives from high to low is as follows: ~ (not), & (and), || (or), =::> (if...then), = (if and only if).\nWithout parentheses, operations are performed according to priority.\nEquivalence of formulas: Two formulas are equivalent if they have the same truth value under all assignments.\nEquivalent formulas can be interchanged.\nSimplification of formulas: Formulas can be simplified through logical rules to obtain a more concise form without changing the truth value of the formula.\n\n### Question:\nPlease determine the level of the formula (~p1&p2)=::>p3. \nThe answer should be given as a single letter from A to Z, or Z+n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1).The answer format should be like [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given formula (~p1 & p2) =::> p3 involves a combination of logical operations at different levels. Let's break it down according to the defined logic rule:\n\n1. ~p1 is a Level B formula since it is a negation of a Level A formula (p1).\n2. p2 is a Level A formula.\n3. ~p1 & p2 is a Level C formula since it combines a Level B formula (~p1) and a Level A formula (p2) with the \"and\" operator.\n4. The implication (=::>) then connects the Level C formula (~p1 & p2) with another Level A formula (p3).\n\nSince the formula involves a Level C subformula (~p1 & p2) and is further connected with another Level A formula (p3) using an implication, which requires at least one level of nesting or compounding beyond the initial connective, the overall formula is classified as Level D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n[[D]]"}

We aim to express the result in the simplest form using only `|`, `&`, and `!`.\n\n### Expression 1: !(p>(p|q))&r\n\n1. Apply rule (10) to transform implication into disjunction:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | (p|q)\n\n2. Apply rule (5) to distribute `p` over `|q`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: !p | p | q\n\n3. Apply rule (8) to simplify `p | !p`:\n   p>(p|q) ::=:: 1 | q ::=:: 1 (since 1 | q is always true)\n\n4. Negate the result from step 3:\n   !(p>(p|q)) ::=:: !1 ::=:: 0\n\n5. Finally, apply rule (7) to distribute `0` over `&r`:\n   !(p>(p|q))&r ::=:: 0&r ::=:: 0\n\n### Expression 2: p&(((p|q)&!p)>q)\n\n1. Apply rule (10) to transform implication into disjunction:\n   ((p|q)&!p)>q ::=:: !((p|q)&!p) | q\n\n2. Apply rule (6) to distribute negation over conjunction:\n   !((p|q)&!p) ::=:: !(p|q) | !!p\n\n3. Apply rule (6) again:\n   !(p|q) | !!p ::=:: !p & !q | p\n\n4. Combine with rule (5):\n   !p & !q | p ::=:: (!p | p) & (!q | p) ::=:: 1 & (!q | p) ::=:: !q | p\n\n5. So, ((p|q)&!p)>q simplifies to !q | p. Now, we can rewrite the original expression:\n   p&(((p|q)&!p)>q) ::=:: p&(!q | p)\n\n6. Apply rule (5) to distribute `p` over `|`:\n   p&(!q | p) ::=:: (p&!q) | (p&p)\n\n7. Apply rule (2) and then rule (7):\n   (p&!q) | (p&p) ::=:: (p&!q) | p ::=:: p\n\nNow, we format the simplified expressions as requested:\n\n- For Expression 1: `[[];[]]` (since it simplifies to `0`, there's no variable left)\n- For Expression 2: `[p;[]]` (it simplifies to just `p`)\n\nTherefore, the answers formatted as logical expressions are:\n\n- Expression 1: `[[];[]]`\n- Expression 2: `[p;[]]`"}

First person: \"Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Suzhou (i.e., `!p`) and Wang is from Shanghai (i.e., `q`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!p & q`. Since the first part of the statement is negated, it's worth noting for truth evaluation purposes.\n\n2. Second person: \"Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Shanghai (i.e., `!q`) and Wang is from Suzhou (i.e., `p`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!q & p`. Notice the negation in the first part for truth evaluation.\n\n3. Third person: \"Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\"\n   - This translates to: Wang is not from Shanghai (i.e., `!q`) and Wang is not from Hangzhou (i.e., `!r`). The conjunction of these two statements is `!q & !r`. Both parts of this statement are negated, which is important for the truth evaluation.\n\nNow, given Professor Wang's remark, we know that exactly one person got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong. This means that one of the statements must be fully true, one must be half true (one of its parts true, the other false), and one must be fully false. However, since we are asked only to represent each person's statement using simple propositions and not to deduce the full logical outcome, we will stop at representing their claims.\n\nTherefore, formatted as requested:\n\n```\n[[ !p & q ]; [ !q & p ]; [ !q & !r ]]\n```\n\nEach bracketed section contains the corresponding logical expression for each individual's statement, without further simplification or evaluation based on the truth values of `p`, `q`, and `r`, as per the instructions."}

How can this expression be denoted?\nThe answer should be in the format [[paired disjunctive terms:...];[denoted:...]], with multiple paired conjunctive terms separated by commas.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To find the paired disjunctive terms of the given expression \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r) \\wedge (\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\), we first need to understand the possible truth assignments that satisfy this expression. The expression is in a conjunctive form, where both clauses must be true for the entire expression to be true. \n\nGiven the expression, we can see that \\(\\neg q \\vee r\\) is common to both clauses, meaning that for the entire expression to be true, either \\(q\\) must be false (\\(\\neg q\\)) or \\(r\\) must be true, or both. The variable \\(p\\) and its negation \\(\\neg p\\) appear in separate clauses, which means that the truth value of \\(p\\) does not affect the outcome, as long as one of the clauses has \\(p\\) true and the other has \\(\\neg p\\) true.\n\nThe paired disjunctive terms (in this case, we are looking for the minimal conditions under which each clause could be true, which will correspond to the false assignments for the paired disjunctive terms) can be identified by considering the conditions that would make each clause false, which would then make the entire expression false. For the first clause \\((p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\) to be false, \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) must be false, and \\(q\\) must be true. Similarly, for the second clause \\((\\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r)\\) to be false, \\(p\\) must be true, \\(q\\) must be true, and \\(r\\) must be false.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can form the paired disjunctive terms by considering these false assignments and ensuring they are in lexicographical order:\n\n1. For the first clause to be false: \\(p\\) false, \\(q\\) true, \\(r\\) false, which corresponds to \\(\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r\\).\n2. For the second clause to be false: \\(p\\) true, \\(q\\) true, \\(r\\) false, which corresponds to \\(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r\\).\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the paired disjunctive terms (corresponding to the false assignments), we actually want the negation of these conditions, which will give us the minimal true conditions (paired disjunctive terms) as:\n\n1. \\(\\neg(\\neg p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M0\\) because the false assignment \\(\\neg p\\) (binary 0), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 010, which is 2 in decimal and 2 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, this corresponds to no false (all true), which is \\(M0\\).\n2. \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q \\wedge \\neg r) \\equiv \\neg p \\vee \\neg q \\vee r\\), which corresponds to \\(M3\\) because the false assignment \\(p\\) (binary 1), \\(q\\) (binary 1), \\(\\neg r\\) (binary 0) corresponds to binary 110, which is 6 in decimal and 6 in hexadecimal, but since we are looking at the negation for the disjunctive term, we subtract 1 (to find the minimal true condition) to get 5 in decimal, which is 5 in hexadecimal, so \\(M5\\). (The correct interpretation here is that the truth assignment 110 corresponds to 6 in decimal, which maps to \\(M6\\), but since we are negating the assignment to find the disjunct, we actually have \\(M6\\) as the paired term.

This means that the formula must have at least one term where all propositional variables are negated (since the false assignment corresponds to \\(1111\\) in binary, or \\(F\\) in hexadecimal, for 4 propositional variables).\n\n2. **All-Even Form**: A formula is an all-even form if all the paired conjunctive terms included in its principal disjunctive normal form have even indices. In hexadecimal, even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E. For 4 propositional variables, these correspond to specific truth assignments.\n\nGiven 4 propositional variables, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible paired conjunctive terms, ranging from \\(m_0\\) to \\(m_{F}\\) in hexadecimal. For a formula to be both a basic form and an all-even form, it must contain \\(m_0\\) (to satisfy the basic form condition) and can only contain other terms with even indices (to satisfy the all-even form condition).\n\nThe even indices for 4 propositional variables are: \\(m_0\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_4\\), \\(m_6\\), \\(m_8\\), \\(m_{A}\\), \\(m_{C}\\), \\(m_{E}\\).\n\nFor a formula to be both basic and all-even, it must include \\(m_0\\) and can optionally include any combination of the other even-indexed terms. The number of such formulas corresponds to the power set of the set of even-indexed terms excluding \\(m_0\\) (since \\(m_0\\) is mandatory), minus one (to exclude the case with no terms other than \\(m_0\\), since we've already counted it as a basic form).\n\nThere are 7 other even-indexed terms besides \\(m_0\\). The power set of a set with 7 elements has \\(2^7\\) members. However, we exclude the case with no additional terms (since we're counting combinations that include \\(m_0\\)), leaving \\(2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127\\) possible combinations.\n\nThus, there are 127 formulas that satisfy the conditions of being both a basic form and an all-even form, formatted as required:\n\n```\n[127]\n```"}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nIn a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) containing n propositional variables, if each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the propositional variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or in lexicographical order, such a simple conjunctive form (simple disjunctive form) is called a paired conjunctive term (paired disjunctive term).\nIf the true assignment of a paired conjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired conjunctive term is denoted as mi (lowercase m). For example, the true assignment of p\u2227q is 11, and the binary number is 11, corresponding to hexadecimal number 3, denoted as m3.\nIf the false assignment of a paired disjunctive term corresponds to a binary number equal to hexadecimal number i, this paired disjunctive term is denoted as Mi (uppercase M). For example, the false assignment of \u00acp\u2228\u00acq\u2228\u00acr is 111, and the binary number is 111, corresponding to hexadecimal number 7, denoted as M7.\nThe disjunctive normal form (conjunctive normal form) consisting of all paired conjunctive terms (paired disjunctive terms) is called the principal disjunctive normal form (principal conjunctive normal form).\nGiven a formula A containing n propositional variables:\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes all 2^n paired conjunctive terms, A is a tautology.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes no paired conjunctive terms, A is a contradiction.\n- If the principal disjunctive normal form of A includes m0, A is a basic formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all even, A is an all-even formula.\n- If the indices i of the paired conjunctive terms included in the principal disjunctive normal form of A are all odd, A is an all-odd formula.\n\n### Question:\nA research institute needs to select 1-2 members from 3 key researchers A, B, and C to study abroad. Due to work requirements, the selection must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. If A goes, then C must go.\n2. If B goes, then C cannot go.\n3. If C does not go, then either A or B can go.\n\nLet p: A goes\nLet q: B goes\nLet r: C goes\n\nBased on the given conditions, the formula can be derived as:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q))\n\nThe true assignments of this formula are the feasible selection schemes. Through derivation, we get:\n(p \u2192 r) \u2227 (q \u2192 \u00acr) \u2227 (\u00acr \u2192 (p \u2228 q)) \u2194 (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r), which can be denoted as m1 \u2228 m2 \u2228 m5. \nBased on the three true assignments represented, what are the feasible selection schemes? \n\nOnly give the letters of the people selected to go, separated by commas within a scheme, and different schemes separated by []; format: [[];[];..].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Given the derived expression:\n\n(\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r)\n\nThis represents three possible true assignments, which correspond to the feasible selection schemes. Translating these to the selection of researchers A, B, and C:\n\n1. (\u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) corresponds to A not going, B not going, and C going. This translates to only C going.\n2. (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 \u00acr) corresponds to A not going, B going, and C not going. This translates to B going.\n3. (p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 r) corresponds to A going, B not going, and C going. This translates to A and C going.\n\nFormatting the feasible selection schemes as per the instructions, where only the letters of the people selected to go are listed:\n\n- The first scheme is C going alone: [C].\n- The second scheme is B going alone: [B].\n- The third scheme is A and C going: [A, C].\n\nSo, the feasible selection schemes, formatted as required, are:\n\n[[C];[B];[A, C]]"}

Combining these, we get:\n  - \"For all x, if x is a prime number, then x is 2\" symbolized as Ax(F(x) \u21d2 x = 2).\n  - \"4 is not a prime number\" symbolized as \u223cF(4).\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use 0-ary predicates for the symbolization, and 0-ary predicates by definition do not take any individual variables, we need to treat each statement as an atomic predicate that is either true or false without reference to variables. Thus, we can represent the statements directly as:\n  - P1: \"Only 2 is a prime number\" can be represented as a 0-ary predicate A, where A stands for the truth of this statement.\n  - P2: \"4 is a composite number\" (or equivalently, \"4 is not a prime number\") can be represented as \u223cB, where B stands for the statement \"4 is a prime number\" (which is false based on the given information).\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (1) using 0-ary predicates is [A; \u223cB].\n\n(2) If 5 is greater than 4, then 4 is greater than 6.\n- For this part, we define a binary predicate G(x, y): x > y.\n- The proposition is a conditional statement that can be symbolized directly as \"If G(5, 4) then G(4, 6)\" where G(5, 4) represents \"5 > 4\" and G(4, 6) represents \"4 > 6.\"\n\nTo fit this into 0-ary predicates, we treat the entire conditional statement as a single 0-ary predicate that is either true or false. Let C stand for the truth of the entire conditional statement \"If 5 > 4 then 4 > 6.\"\n\nTherefore, the symbolization for (2) using 0-ary predicates is [C].\n\nCombining both parts into the requested format:\n\nThe answer is [[A; \u223cB]; [C]].\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this interpretation stretches the concept of 0-ary predicates for the sake of adhering to the formatting requirements, as typically, 0-ary predicates would not be used to represent relationships between specific numbers but rather would represent fixed, atomic statements of truth or falsehood without reference to variables."}

Given the predicates F(x) for \"x is even\" and G(x) for \"x is prime\", we can represent \"2 is even\" as F(2) and \"2 is prime\" as G(2). The proposition states that both of these properties hold for the number 2. Thus, we have:\n- `[F(2) & G(2)]`\n\n(2) If 2 is prime, then 4 is not prime.\nFirst, we express \"2 is prime\" as G(2). For \"4 is not prime\", we negate the predicate for \"4 is prime\", which is G(4), resulting in \u223cG(4). The implication between these two is then:\n- `[G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]`\n\n(3) Only 2 is prime, for 6 to be prime.\nThis statement suggests that if 6 is prime, then 2 must be the only prime number. To represent this, we use an implication where the premise is \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) and the conclusion is that for all numbers, if they are prime, they must be equal to 2. This can be represented by saying for all x, if x is prime and x is not 2, then this is not possible (assuming equality is represented by EQ(x, y) for x and y being equal):\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 Ax((G(x) & \u223cEQ(x, 2)) \u21d2 \u223c(x))]`\nHowever, given the constraint of 0-ary predicates and the fact that we are not explicitly given an equality predicate, we can interpret this to mean that if 6 is prime, then any prime number other than 2 is not prime, adapting the statement to fit the 0-ary predicate structure:\n- `[G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]`\nHere, `x \u2260 2` is represented as `\u223cEQ(x, 2)` but adjusted for the constraint of 0-ary predicates, understanding `x \u2260 2` as a given, interpretable condition rather than a predicate in its own right.\n\n(4) Unless 6 is prime, 4 is prime.\nThis statement can be interpreted as \"if 6 is not prime, then 4 is prime\". We negate the predicate for \"6 is prime\" (G(6)) to represent \"6 is not prime\" (\u223cG(6)), and the conclusion is \"4 is prime\" (G(4)). The implication is then:\n- `[\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]`\n\nPutting all the answers in the requested format:\n`[[F(2) & G(2)]; [G(2) \u21d2 \u223cG(4)]; [G(6) \u21d2 (G(2) & Ax(G(x) & x \u2260 2 \u21d2 \u223cG(x)))]; [\u223cG(6) \u21d2 G(4)]]`\n\nNote: For the third proposition, the interpretation adheres to the 0-ary predicate constraints but approximates the intended logical structure, given the limitations of the provided predicates and the absence of equality predicates or direct numerical comparisons in the 0-ary predicate system."}

Determine the entity set \ud835\udc38, which is already given as the set of natural numbers N.\n2. Replace entity constants with their assignments. In this case, 'a' is replaced with its assignment 'a\u2032 = 2'.\n3. Replace \ud835\udc5b-ary function symbols with their implementations.

How so?\nPerson A: My grandfather is a case in point. He speaks very straightforwardly and often does good deeds with bad intentions. I remember one time he invited some friends over for dinner.\nPerson B: That's nice, everyone can get together.\nPerson A: The appointment was for six in the evening, and by half past five, three people had arrived, but one important guest hadn't shown up yet.\nPerson B: Then wait a bit longer, if they don't come, start eating without them.\nPerson A: My grandfather is a punctual person. When it was half past six and that guest still hadn't arrived, he got anxious and said to himself, \"The ones who should come are not those who come.\" As a result, one of the guests got upset, thinking they were the one who shouldn't have come, and left.\nPerson B: That's really a misunderstanding.\nPerson A: With two guests left, my grandfather was still waiting, and then he said, \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" Another guest felt there was no sincerity and also left.\nPerson B: How could he say that, another one left.\nPerson A: The last one was my grandfather's old friend, who advised my grandfather to be careful with his words. My grandfather explained that he wasn't talking about him, but the old friend also felt that they were the one who shouldn't stay, and left too.\nPerson B: This dinner really was, everyone left.\n\n\"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed.\" by method C, we get? \n\nPlease output the result in [[]] format. \nBe careful to maintain consistency with the original sentence.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To apply Method C to the proposition \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed,\" we first perform obversion, which involves changing the quality of the proposition (from affirmative to negative or negative to affirmative) and replacing the predicate with its contrary. Then, we perform conversion, which means exchanging the positions of the subject and predicate.\n\n1. **Obversion**: The original proposition is in the form of a particular affirmative proposition (I), but its content is essentially a universal affirmative (A) because it implies that all who have left should have stayed. Applying obversion to \"All who have left are [those who should have stayed]\" results in \"All who have left are not [those who should not have stayed].\"\n\n2. **Conversion**: Now we convert the proposition by exchanging the subject and predicate, resulting in \"All [those who should not have stayed] are not who have left.\"\n\nTherefore, applying Method C to \"The ones who have left were the ones who should have stayed,\" we get:\n\n- **Method C**: \"All [non-P: those who should not have stayed] are not [S: who have left].\"\n\nIn the requested format:\n\n[[\"All [non-P: those who should not have stayed] are not [S: who have left]\"]]\n\nThis is a direct application of Method C, where the original proposition has been obverted and then converted, following the specific logical operations defined."}

The given statements are:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS\n3. \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first statement (\u2200P \u21d2 M) places 'P' as the subject and 'M' as the predicate, indicating that 'P' is distributed and 'M' is not. This corresponds to the form 'P()M' in a syllogism, where the mood is either A or E.\n- The second statement (\u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS) places 'M' as the subject and 'S' as the predicate, with 'S' being negated. This suggests 'M' is distributed and 'S' is not, corresponding to the form 'M()S' with a mood of either E or O.\n- The third statement (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP) places 'S' as the subject and 'P' as the predicate, with 'P' being negated. This suggests 'S' is distributed and 'P' is not, corresponding to the form 'S()P' with a mood of either E or O.\n\nGiven the forms and the distribution of terms, we can see that the argument does not directly fit into any of the provided syllogism forms without rearrangement and consideration of the moods. The statements, when rearranged to fit the syllogism structure, actually have the following structure and moods based on their distribution and the presence of negation:\n\n1. \u2200P \u21d2 M (A mood, as 'P' is distributed and there's no negation)\n2. \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS (E mood, as 'M' is distributed and 'S' is negated)\n3. The conclusion \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP (E mood, as 'S' is distributed and 'P' is negated)\n\nNow, let's examine which figure and mood this corresponds to:\n\n- The form of the argument is M()P, \u2200S \u21d2 \u00acM (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS, which is equivalent for analysis purposes), \u2234S()P. This looks like Figure II after rearrangement to fit the provided forms (P()M, S()M, \u2234S()P).\n- The moods in sequence (A, E, E) do not directly match any of the valid moods for Figure II (AEE, EAE, EIO, AOO).\n\nHowever, the conclusion's mood (E) and the initial statement's mood (A) actually suggest a pattern that resembles the EAE mood, but with the second premise needing to be in accord with the E mood (to negate 'M' directly, not 'S'). Since the given second premise implies \u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S (from \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS), it's a logical equivalent that fits the E mood for the second premise in the EAE mood of Figure II. Thus, with this interpretation in mind:\n\n- The first premise has an A mood (\u2200P \u21d2 M).\n- The second premise, when logically rearranged and interpreted in the context of the syllogism structure, can be seen as having an E mood (\u2200\u00acM \u21d2 S, equivalent to \u2200M \u21d2 \u00acS in the context of the syllogism patterns).\n- The conclusion has an E mood (\u2200S \u21d2 \u00acP).\n\nTherefore, the argument corresponds to Figure II with the EAE mood, albeit with the second premise requiring logical rearrangement and interpretation. The answer is:\n\n[[II];[EAE]]\n\nPlease note, the interpretation involved a logical step to align the second premise with the E mood of the EAE mood in Figure II, ensuring the overall logical consistency and adherence to the syllogism structure provided in the instructions."}

This formula indeed captures the essence of the inference from a negated past period of time to a negated past point in time.\n\nConversely, the inference from \"Old Zhao did not work in Ningbo at some point in the past\" (\\( \\neg Hp \\)) to \"It is not the case that Old Zhao worked in Ningbo all the time in the past\" (\\( \\neg Ap \\)) can be made using formula 4, \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\), in conjunction with formula 7, \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\). This is because \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) leads to \\( H\u00acp \\), and then \\( H\u00acp \\rightarrow \u00acAp \\) leads to \\( \\neg Ap \\).\n\nTherefore, there are two reasoning formulas directly involved in this inference process: formula 4 and formula 11.\n\nThe answer, in the requested format, is:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nHowever, if we count the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) (formula 7) as necessary for the second inference, then we would have three formulas involved:\n```\n[[3]]\n```\n\nGiven the specific phrasing of the question and the directness of the inference paths, the most appropriate answer, considering the direct formulas for the given question's phrasing, would be:\n```\n[[2]]\n```\n\nThis interpretation emphasizes the direct inference between negated propositions without relying on the intermediate step of \\( \\neg Hp \\rightarrow H\u00acp \\) as an additional formula for the count, since formula 4 directly implies the inference of negated continuous action from a negated point in time, and formula 11 directly implies the reverse."}

This does not directly apply to Formula 17, as it deals with the relationship between a future period and its complement in the future, rather than two distinct points or periods.\n\n- **\u21a6 Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be true, but can both be false. Formula 17 fits this description. It says that `Gp` and `G\u00acp` cannot both be true (i.e., a proposition and its negation cannot both be true in the future period), which aligns with the \u21a6 relationship's property.\n\n- **\u26ad Relationship**: Pairs cannot both be false, but can both be true. This does not match Formula 17, as it explicitly states that if `Gp` is true, then `G\u00acp` must be false.\n\n- **\u2042 Relationship**: Pairs can both be true, or both be false. This does not align with Formula 17, as it precludes the case where both `Gp` and `G\u00acp` are true.\n\nBased on the analysis, Reasoning Formula 17 (`Gp \u2192 \u00acG\u00acp`) is consistent with the **\u21a6 relationship**. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```"}

If a proposition `p` is a common belief within a group `G`, then every member of the group `G` collectively believes `p`.\n\n2. The scenario explicitly states that both Alice and Bob firmly believe that 2 plus 2 equals 4.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that the proposition \"2 plus 2 equals 4\" is a common belief among the group containing Alice and Bob.

The contradiction here lies in the fact that despite `p` being a common belief, Alice's doubt about `p` implies she does not believe it, which contradicts the requirement for `p` to be a common belief.

This means that Alice is certain that the loop will continue to execute either until `\u03c6` is true or it executes indefinitely, but it guarantees that `\u03c6` will be true if the loop ever stops. This aligns with the Loop Rule, which states:\n\n- Loop Rule: For the loop command `c*`, `[ c* ]\u03c6` is equivalent to `\u03c6 \u2228 ([ c ][ c* ]\u03c6)`.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for an expression that represents Alice's belief in the format `[[]]`. The provided Loop Rule is expressed in a format that does not directly fit into the `[[]]` format requested. Nonetheless, we can interpret Alice's belief in a way that fits the requested format by applying the Loop Rule within the necessity operators `[[]]`. Thus, we can interpret her belief as being certain that the loop's execution will lead to a state where `\u03c6` is true or the loop continues to execute. \n\nTherefore, to express Alice's belief within the given constraints and the Loop Rule, we can say:\n\n- Alice's belief that the loop command `c*` will persist in execution until the proposition `\u03c6` is true can be represented as: `[[ c* ]\u03c6]`.\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that after the execution of `c*`, `\u03c6` will be true. However, to explicitly capture the persistence aspect as per the Loop Rule, which involves the loop stopping (or not) and `\u03c6` being true, we slightly adapt this to align with the requested format while incorporating the essence of the Loop Rule as follows:\n\n```\n[[ \u03c6 \u2228 ([ c ][ c* ]\u03c6) ]]\n```\n\nThis expression implies that it is necessarily the case that either `\u03c6` is true, or after one iteration of the loop `c`, it remains the case that the loop `c*` will necessarily lead to `\u03c6` being true, thereby capturing both the persistence of the loop and the ultimate truth of `\u03c6`.\n\nHowever, recognizing the constraint for a simpler and more direct expression within the `[[]]` format, and given the question's focus on the belief in the persistence of the loop until `\u03c6` is true, we can directly express this as:\n\n```\n[[ c* ]\u03c6]\n```\n\nThis simplified form leverages the essence of the Loop Rule within the necessity operator brackets, assuming the contextual understanding that the loop's persistence is implied by the necessity of `\u03c6` following `c*`, consistent with the Loop Rule's spirit but tailored to the `[[]]` format. It captures Alice's belief that the loop's execution will ensure `\u03c6` eventually holds, which is a direct interpretation of her belief in the persistence of `c*` until `\u03c6`'s truth, fitting the `[[]]` format requirement. This interpretation is guided by the question's focus on the outcome of the loop's execution regarding `\u03c6`'s truth, rather than an explicit step-by-step application of the Loop Rule inside the necessity operator, which would otherwise require a format more complex than `[[]]` to fully express."}

This inference involved observing the effect of an unknown cause (Neptune's gravitational influence on Uranus) and determining that there must be a cause for the observed effect (the deviation in Uranus's orbit). This process aligns with the methods that involve identifying a possible cause for an observed effect, especially when the presence of the cause corresponds to the presence of the effect, and its absence to the absence of the effect, or when changes in the cause correspond to changes in the effect.\n\n1. The \u2e2e method focuses on observing the occurrence of two phenomena (S and P) together in different contexts, which is not the primary focus here since the goal was to infer an unobserved cause from an observed effect rather than observing two phenomena together in multiple cases.\n\n2. The \u0606 method involves observing the presence of an effect (P) when a cause (S) is present and the absence of the effect when the cause is absent. This method aligns with the scenario, as the deviation in Uranus's orbit (effect P) is observed when the gravitational influence of Neptune (cause S) is present and would hypothetically not be present if Neptune's gravitational influence were absent.\n\n3. The \ua66e method involves both positive and negative groups, where the cause and effect are present in the positive group and absent in the negative group across varying conditions. However, the scenario does not involve a negative group with the absence of both the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) and effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) under varying conditions since the focus is on inferring the cause from the observed effect.\n\n4. The \u2d63 method involves observing changes in the cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the scenario involves inferring a cause from an observed effect, it does not explicitly mention varying the cause (Neptune's position or gravitational influence) to observe corresponding changes in the effect (Uranus's orbit). The focus is on detecting the cause from the initial discrepancy rather than experimenting with changes in the cause.\n\n5. The \u2698 method involves known causal relationships between multiple pairs of phenomena and inferring a new causal relationship based on these. The scenario does not involve such a network of known causal relationships but rather a direct inference from observed effect to unobserved cause, without relying on a series of known causal links.\n\nGiven the analysis, the scenario most closely aligns with the reasoning pattern of the \u0606 method, where the presence of the effect (deviation in Uranus's orbit) when the cause (Neptune's gravitational influence) is present, and the understanding that the absence of such a cause would lead to the absence of the effect, although the latter is hypothetical in this case since it was the inference of the cause from the effect that led to the discovery.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[B]]"}

This is because it shows a contradiction in inductive reasoning, where both an event (`p`) and its negation (`\u00acp`) imply the same hypothesis (`q`), which is characteristic of the GB Paradox's definition. It fits the pattern of drawing contradictory conclusions from different observations or premises, which cannot both be true. The BC Paradox relates to the confirmation standards of universal hypotheses, and the LS Paradox involves contradictory logical consequences of multiple reasonable hypotheses, neither of which is directly represented by the given expression. Therefore, the correct answer is A."}

C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[B]]\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Xiao Ma opens the food box, and the beer is still warm \u2192 Beer is part of the food in the food box\" is most closely aligned with the C% Principle.\n\n1. **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalization and the speaker speaking as little as possible. The inference here is that when Xiao Ma mentions the beer being warm upon opening the food box, it suggests that the beer is an unexpected item that stands out because it's not in its expected state (usually cold). Given the context of opening a food box, the minimal information provided implies that the beer is part of the contents of the food box, as it is the simplest and most direct explanation for this observation. This adheres to CI2 of the C% Principle, where the hearer expands the information to grasp the intention of the speech, assuming that the mentioned \"beer is still warm\" is an unusual fact that stands out and is meant to be understood as part of the described situation without further embellishment.\n\n2. The statement does not seem to invoke the **C* Principle**, as it's not about the speaker avoiding making a stronger statement due to lack of knowledge or intentionally not providing more precise information. The focus is not on the contrast between possible stronger and weaker statements or inferences about the speaker's knowledge limitations.\n\n3. Regarding the **C! Principle**, the statement does not utilize a lengthy, obscure, or marked expression that could suggest a deviation from conventional meanings or the need to avoid conventional associations. The phrasing is straightforward, and the inference does not require avoiding or reinterpreting conventional meanings in a significant way as per the C! Principle.\n\nThus, based on the principles and the statement provided, the most fitting principle is the C% Principle."}

Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The given statement and its inference can be analyzed according to the custom cooperation principles as follows:\n\n- **C* Principle**: This principle involves the speaker saying something that is not as informative as it could be, leading to specific inferences by the hearer. However, the statement \"Zhang San bought a new car, but the door won't close\" is straightforward and informative. The inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" is a direct, uncontroversial deduction from the statement rather than a result of the speaker being less informative than they could be.\n\n- **C% Principle**: This principle emphasizes minimalism in speech, and the inference is supposed to be based on expanding the minimal information provided by the speaker. The statement about the car door not closing implicitly assumes the car has doors (as per the convention or common knowledge), and the inference directly links to this assumption without requiring additional information.\n\n- **C! Principle**: This principle deals with avoiding lengthy or marked expressions unless they serve a specific purpose. The given statement is straightforward and does not invoke any unnecessary complexity or marked expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"Zhang San's new car has doors\" conforms most closely to the C% Principle, as it involves interpreting the minimal information provided in a straightforward manner, expanding on the given information in a way that aligns with common sense or conventions about cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n[[B]]\n```"}
