Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine where Professor Wang is from and who got everything right, half right, and everything wrong, we need to analyze the final logical expression \\( E \\):\n\n\\[ E ::=:: (!p \\& q \\& !r) | (p \\& !q \\& r) \\]\n\nGiven that only one of \\( p \\), \\( q \\), or \\( r \\) can be true, we can evaluate each possibility:\n\n1. **If \\( p \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Suzhou):**\n   - \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) must be false.\n   - Substituting \\( p = 1 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), \\( r = 0 \\) into \\( E \\):\n     \\[ E = (0 \\& 0 \\& 1) | (1 \\& 1 \\& 0) = 0 | 0 = 0 \\]\n     This case does not satisfy \\( E \\).\n\n2. **If \\( q \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Shanghai):**\n   - \\( p \\) and \\( r \\) must be false.\n   - Substituting \\( p = 0 \\), \\( q = 1 \\), \\( r = 0 \\) into \\( E \\):\n     \\[ E = (1 \\& 1 \\& 1) | (0 \\& 0 \\& 0) = 1 | 0 = 1 \\]\n     This case satisfies \\( E \\).\n\n3. **If \\( r \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Hangzhou):**\n   - \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) must be false.\n   - Substituting \\( p = 0 \\), \\( q = 0 \\), \\( r = 1 \\) into \\( E \\):\n     \\[ E = (1 \\& 0 \\& 0) | (0 \\& 1 \\& 1) = 0 | 0 = 0 \\]\n     This case does not satisfy \\( E \\).\n\nSince the only case that satisfies \\( E \\) is when \\( q \\) is true (Professor Wang is from Shanghai), we can conclude:\n\n- **Person A** (who said \\( !p \\& q \\)) got everything right.\n- **Person B** (who said \\( p \\& !q \\)) got everything wrong.\n- **Person C** (who said \\( !q \\& !r \\)) got half right (since \\( !q \\) is correct but \\( !r \\) is incorrect).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left[ \\text{Shanghai}; \\text{entirely correct: A}; \\text{partially correct: C}; \\text{entirely incorrect: B} \\right]}\n\\]"}

Below is a custom-defined rule for a specific type of logic. When responding, please ensure that your output adheres to the specified logical rules and format.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\n1. Intensional Definitions\n\nIntensional definitions reveal the intension of a term or concept. The intension of a term or concept refers to the distinctive attributes, essential properties, or distinguishing features that the term or concept represents or denotes. Through these attributes or features, the objects denoted by the term or concept can be distinguished from other objects.\n\n(1) \u26af Definition:\n\nThis is the most common form of intensional definition. If the extension of one concept is entirely contained within the extension of another concept, and the latter's extension is not entirely contained within the former's extension, then these two concepts have a genus-species relationship. The former concept is a species concept, and the latter concept is a genus concept. The most commonly used method of definition is to find the genus concept of the defined concept, then find the corresponding differentia, and give the definition in the form of \"defined term = differentia + genus.\"\n\n(2) \u2318 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition reveals the differentia from the origin or source of the entity represented or denoted by the defined concept.\n\n(3) \u2692 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the specific function or purpose of an entity as the differentia.\n\n(4) \u03de Definition:\n\nThis form of definition uses the special relationship between entities as the differentia, defining the concept in relation to other concepts.\n\n(5) \u2616 Definition:\n\nThis form of definition defines the term by describing a set of related operational procedures.\n\n(6) \u046c Definition:\n\nThis form of definition, not belonging to the genus-differentia form of definition, is often used, sometimes necessarily, for defining relational concepts. This may involve using logical expressions for definition.\n\n2. Extensional Definitions\n\nExtensional definitions, through enumerating the extension of a concept, enable people to obtain a certain understanding and recognition of the concept, thereby clarifying the meaning and scope of application of the concept. Therefore, extensional definitions are also a relatively common form of definition.\n\n(1) \uffe5 Definition:\n\nIf the number of objects referred to by a concept is very small, or the types are limited, an exhaustive extensional definition can be given.\n\n(2) ! Definition:\n\nWhen the number of objects belonging to a concept is large, or the types are numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed, some examples are provided to help people gain some understanding of the objects referred to by the concept.\n\n3. Lexical Definitions\n\nLexical definitions deal with words, often involving the origin, meaning, usage, etc., of the word, and not the objects and entities that the word represents or denotes.\n\n(1) \u2135 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition reports or describes the existing usage of the defined word. Most definitions in language dictionaries are of this type.\n\n(2) \u2113 Definition:\n\nThis type of definition explains the meaning of a word by describing its origin and evolution.\n\n(3) \u2207 Definition:\n\nIn scientific research and daily interactions, sometimes for confidentiality, more often for simplicity and practicality, and sometimes to avoid the interference of certain unrelated meanings often associated with familiar terms, it is necessary to invent new words or redefine the meaning of existing words.\"\n\n### Question:\n\"Internet: This is a transliteration and partial translation of the English word \"Internet.\" The partial translation refers to the network, and the transliteration refers to the international network. It is an international computer communication network that connects thousands of different sizes and types of computer networks worldwide.\"\n\nWhich of the Lexical Definitions does the above definition belong to?\n\nA. \u2135 Definition\nB. \u2113 Definition\nC. \u2207 Definition\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "**Answer:** [[A]]"}
