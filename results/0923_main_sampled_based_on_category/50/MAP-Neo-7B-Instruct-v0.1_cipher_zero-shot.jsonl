Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Convert the Ciphertext to Numbers**:\n   The ciphertext \"3513452143145312244135\" can be converted into its numerical representation based on the given key:\n   - '3' maps to 3\n   - '5' maps to 5\n   - ...and so on.\n\n2. **Apply Decryption**:\n   Using the Polybius square, we will replace each pair of numbers (representing the rows and columns in the grid) with its corresponding letter.\n   - For \"35\":\n     - '3' corresponds to the first row and '5' corresponds to the first column.\n     - Thus, \"35\" maps to \"R\".\n   - For \"13\":\n     - '1' corresponds to the first column and '3' corresponds to the second row.\n     - Thus, \"13\" maps to \"O\" since '1' doesn't correspond to a letter in the Polybius square.\n   - Following this pattern for the entire ciphertext, we get: \"ROOXIERHI EAUTIOGE RWUTSUIT\".\n\n3. **Final Decrypted Answer**:\n   The decrypted message is: \"ROOXIERHI EAUTIOGE RWUTSUIT\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: \\[[\\text{\"ROOXIERHI EAUTIOGE RWUTSUIT\"}]. \\]\n\nPlease note, in practical cryptography, it's important to ensure the security of the Polybius square key.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the plaintext \"NG\" using the given cipher rules, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant properties and objects:**\n   - Plaintext: \"NG\"\n   - Keyword: Not specified, but typically, we would take the keyword as \"A\" for simplicity.\n   - Ciphertext: To be determined.\n\n2. **Apply the encryption steps:**\n   - For each character in the plaintext, we use the affine coding function:\n     - \\( y = (A \\cdot x + B) \\mod 26 \\)\n     - Here, \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 5 \\), and \\( x \\) is the position of the character in the affine alphabet.\n\n- **Encrypted Ciphertext for 'N':**\n    - \\( x = 13 \\)\n    - \\( y = (3 \\cdot 13 + 5) \\mod 26 = 44 \\mod 26 = 18 \\)\n    - The letter corresponding to position 18 in the affine alphabet is \"S\".\n\n- **Encrypted Ciphertext for 'G':**\n    - \\( x = 8 \\)\n    - \\( y = (3 \\cdot 8 + 5) \\mod 26 = 31 \\mod 26 = 5 \\)\n    - The letter corresponding to position 5 in the affine alphabet is \"E\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted message is \"[[SE]]\".\n\n**Decryption follows the reverse process. Here, we will use the same values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) for simplicity, since the key should be known for decryption. If we were to use a key, we would replace \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) with keys \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) respectively.**\n\n3. **Decrypted Plaintext (using the same assumption of \\( A = 3 \\) and \\( B = 5 \\)):**\n   - For \"S\", \\( y = 18 \\)\n     - \\( x = 18^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot (18 - 5) \\)\n     - \\( x = 18^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot 13 \\) (since \\( 18 \\) is relatively prime to \\( 26 \\))\n     - This gives \\( x \\approx 21.5 \\) (using modular inverse \\( 18 \\) which in mod 26 is \\( 21 \\))\n     - The letter at position \\( 21.5 \\) in the affine alphabet closely corresponds to \"N\".\n   - For \"E\", \\( y = 5 \\)\n     - \\( x = 5^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot (5 - 5) \\)\n     - \\( x = 5^{-1} \\mod 26 \\cdot 0 \\)\n     - This implies no such value exists, indicating a decryption failure. This discrepancy arises from inaccuracies in the interpretation of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) due to the cipher's affine nature.\n\nHence, the de-encrypted result reflects the challenge of accurately applying ciphers under affine transformations, given the constraints and properties of the cipher described. For practical purposes, using unique keys for encryption and decryption is standard practice to ensure secure communication.\n\n**Correct Decrypted Plaintext:** \"N\"\n\n- Encrypted: \"[[SE]]\"\n\n**Remember, for more accurate encryption and decryption, specific keys or more complex methods like modular arithmetic should be used.**"}

Both B and C are decrypted to their original letters \"V\". Note that in the decryption process, since the initial sequence of cards and the keystream algorithm's rules ensure that the plaintext is formed by following the numerical positions in the alphabet from \"A\", it's clear that the entire ciphertext \"X\" translates to \"BC\" in the plaintext when decrypted. This is consistent with the principles of encryption and decryption as described, where the ciphertext is transformed back into the original plaintext based on the original rules and algorithm."}

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To encrypt the plaintext \"L\" using the provided cipher rule, follow the encryption steps as described:\n\n1. Select Reel1 as the starting point.\n2. For the plaintext character \"L\":\n    - Find \"L\" on Reel1, which is the fourth character.\n    - Replace \"L\" with the character following it on Reel1, which is \"N\".\n3. Since \"N\" is at the end of Reel1, move to the beginning of Reel2.\n4. For \"N\":\n    - Find \"N\" on Reel2, which is the second character.\n    - Replace \"N\" with the character preceding it on Reel2, which is \"C\".\n5. Since \"C\" is at the beginning of Reel2, move to the end of Reel3.\n6. For \"C\":\n    - Find \"C\" on Reel3, which is the second character.\n    - Replace \"C\" with the character preceding it on Reel3, which is \"U\".\n7. Since \"U\" is at the beginning of Reel3, move to the end of Reel4.\n8. For \"U\":\n    - Find \"U\" on Reel4, which is the seventh character.\n    - Replace \"U\" with the character following it on Reel4, which is \"D\".\n9. The process continues for the remaining characters in this order until the entire plaintext string is encrypted. However, this step is simplified for clarity.\n\nHere's the encrypted string for \"L\":\n\n[[ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL]]\n\nTo decrypt the ciphertext, use the decryption rules in reverse:\n\n1. Start at the end of Reel1.\n2. For each character c:\n    - Find c on Reel1, which is the first character.\n    - Replace \"c\" with the character following it on Reel1.\n3. Since this is the beginning of Reel1, continue with the next Reel.\n4. Decrypt the ciphertext in the same sequence until the entire string is decrypted, moving from one Reel to the next.\n\nFollowing these steps, the decrypted plaintext for \"ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL\" would be:\n\n\"L\"\n\nSo, the encrypted answer is [[ELJUBGEPHSCZINXFYQRTVWL]], and the decrypted answer is \"L\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To follow the specified encryption rules for the plaintext \"BU\", we'll first clean, prepare, and encrypt the text as per the instructions given.\n\n**Plaintext:** \"BU\"\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. Clean the plaintext: Remove spaces and non-alphabetic characters, remove the letter Q, and convert to uppercase.\n2. Prepare the encryption by arranging the 5x5 grids based on the plaintext \"BU\" for encryption.\n\nGiven the plaintext \"BU\", the 5x5 grids are not directly applicable due to the short length (2 characters). However, if we were to proceed with the instructions for \"BU\", we'd convert these two characters to uppercase before the encryption process:\n\n**Ciphertext before encryption:** \"BU\"\n\n**Encryption Steps (applying to transformed \"BU\"):**\n\n1. Split the cleaned plaintext into two-letter groups.\n2. For each double-letter group p1, p2:\n    - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the position of the first letter (B, U) and the second letter (U, B) respectively.\n    - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the letters corresponding to these two positions (U, B) and (B, U) respectively.\n    - Use these two letters as the result of encrypting the double letter combination.\n\nGiven the encryption rules, the encrypted double letter groups for \"BU\" would be found using the grids in a standard manner, considering the shift and the positions mentioned. Let's assume we're using a simple Caesar cipher-like system for demonstration, where each letter in Grid1 and Grid4 (represented as G1 and G4 respectively) is shifted by one position in the grid alphabet (a=1, b=2, etc.), and G2 and G3 (G2 and G3) are typically the letters corresponding to the encrypted pairs.\n\nApplying a hypothetical encryption as per the rules, and after shifts and the process:\n\n- For \"B\" (G1): B is shifted to L and then C (since G1 directly maps to C).\n- For \"U\" (G4): U is shifted to V, then R (similar logic as for B).\n\nThe encrypted result could then be formed by concatenating: \"CLRV\".\n\nHowever, due to the specificity of the provided cipher rules, and given the simplicity and hypothetical nature of this example (especially with a short plaintext), the exact encryption and decryption process would require further context or specific details about the grid alphabets or the Caesar-like shifts applied in the 5x5 grids.\n\nAssuming the hypothetical encryption process applied to \"BU\":\n\n**Encrypted Ciphertext:** \"CLRV\"\n\n**Decryption Steps (following the opposite process):**\n\n1. Cleans up ciphertext as per the encryption rules (converting to uppercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, modifying length if needed).\n2. Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups.\n3. For each double-letter group c1, c2:\n    - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter in c1 and the second letter in c2.\n    - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these positions.\n    - Use these two letters to decrypt the double letter combination, applying the inverse of the previously applied shifts and positions.\n\nAgain, the specifics of the grid mappings, positions, and the exact method of inverse shifts would depend on the specifics of the cipher rule applied. For a comprehensive solution, the exact mappings, shifts, and positions defined by the cipher rule would be necessary.\n\n**Decrypted Plaintext:** After applying the reverse process following the decryption rules:\n\n- \"CLRV\" remains \"BU\" when correctly interpreted and decrypted.\n\nPlease note, without a detailed and precise explanation of the grid mappings, positions, and the exact encryption and decryption mechanism, this explanation provides a general approach and example. The actual application might vary based on the specific cipher rule given."}

The ciphertext is \"IX\", which needs to be decrypted and reconstructed into a plaintext message.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Cleans up ciphertext, removing spaces and non-alphabetic characters, and converting all letters to uppercase. \"IX\" becomes \"IX\".\n2. Split the cleaned ciphertext into two-letter groups. After splitting, we have: [I, X, I, X].\n3. For each double-letter group c1,c2 of the ciphertext:\n    - In Gird2 and Gird3, find the position of the first letter and the second letter. \"I\" in Gird3 is at position (0,0) and \"X\" in Gird2 is at position (0,1).\n    - In Gird1 and Gird4, find the letters corresponding to these two positions. For \"I\" in Gird3, the corresponding letters are \"E\" and \"C\" from the second row because \"E\" is in the first column and \"C\" is in the first column. For \"X\" in Gird2, the corresponding letters are \"B\" and \"A\" from the second column because \"B\" is in the first row and \"A\" is in the second row.\n4. Use these two letters as the result of decrypting the double letter combination. So, the decryption result for \"I\" is \"EC\" and for \"X\" is \"AB\".\n5. Concatenate all the decrypted double letter groups to form the final plaintext: \"ECAB\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: \"ECAB\".\n\nAnd in the format you requested: [[decrypted answer]] - \"ECAB\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the ciphertext \"8815.\" using the provided encryption and decryption rules, we start by following the decryption steps:\n\n1. Since the ciphertext has a numeric string format, we convert it to the corresponding Morse code pairs. From the provided morse_code Table, we find:\n    - \"8\" corresponds to \"---\" (Morse code).\n    - \"8\" corresponds to \"---\" (Morse code).\n    - \"1\" corresponds to \".----\" (Morse code).\n    - \"5\" corresponds to \"-..-.\" (Morse code).\n\n2. We split the Morse code pairs into individual characters, resulting in four pairs:\n    - Pair 1: \"-\" / \"-\" (Considering the non-numeric character at the end is not processed).\n    - Pair 2: \" \" / \" \"\n    - Pair 3: \"-\" / \" \" (Same as pair 1).\n    - Pair 4: \" \" / \"-.-.\"\n\n3. We then convert each Morse code pair to the corresponding numeric string using the numerical-index mapping table:\n    - Pair 1: \"-\" = 1, \"-\" = 1\n    - Pair 2: \" \" = 0, \" \" = 0\n    - Pair 3: \"-\" = 1, \" \" = 1\n    - Pair 4: \"-.-.\" = 6\n\n4. Converting these numeric strings back into the Morse code equivalents:\n    - Pair 1: \"-\" / \"-\" = \".-/-.-\"\n    - Pair 2: \" \" / \" \" = \"..-..\"\n    - Pair 3: \"-\" / \" \" = \".-/ \"\n    - Pair 4: \"-.-.\" = \"--.-\"\n\n5. We combine the Morse codes to obtain the decrypted text: \".-/-.-\" .. \"./..--.-\" (Removing the extra '/' at the end as per the rules).\n\nThe decrypted answer, in uppercase letters, is: \"DMO\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[DMO]]."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the given ciphertext, we'll follow the provided decryption rules step by step:\n\n1. **Convert each numerical-index to its corresponding character pair**:\n   - The ciphertext is \"58349678987481574786361\". We first convert each numeric part to the corresponding Morse code pairs based on the numerical-index mapping table.\n\n2. **Obtain the Morse codes**:\n   - Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed Morse pairs into the corresponding English letters.\n\n3. **Convert Morse code pairs into plaintext characters**:\n   - For each pair of Morse codes, we look up the character in the Morse code table and combine them to form the plaintext characters.\n\nHere's how we proceed with the decryption:\n\n**Step 1: Numerical-Index Mapping**\n\n- \"5\" corresponds to \"A\", \"8\" corresponds to \"I\", \"3\" corresponds to \"D\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"9\" corresponds to \"T\", \"6\" corresponds to \"F\", \"7\" corresponds to \"V\", \"8\" corresponds to \"A\", \"7\" corresponds to \"I\", \"4\" corresponds to \"E\", \"7\" corresponds to \"A\", and \"8\" corresponds to \"I\".\n\n**Step 2: Obtain Morse Codes**\n\n- Using the Morse code table, we translate the numerical-indexed characters into Morse code pairs (excluding the end character in the Morse code pair):\n   - \"A -.-.\", \"I .\", \"D -..\", \"E .\", \"T\", \"F ..-.\", \"V .--\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 3: Convert Morse Codes to Plaintext**\n\n- Now, we convert each Morse code pair to its corresponding plaintext character according to the Morse code table:\n  - \"A -.-.\" -> \"A\", \"I .\" -> \"I\", \"D -..\" -> \"D\", \"E .\" -> \"E\", \"T\" (since Morse code has a space in it, we insert a space), \"F ..-.\" -> \"F\", \"V .--\" -> \"V\", \"A\", \"I\", \"E\", \"A\", \"I\".\n\n**Step 4: Form the Decrypted Text**\n\n- Combining all the plaintext characters, the decrypted text is: \"AIIEDETAF V E A A A\".\n\nHowever, based on the specific instructions that the ciphertext without spaces is \"58349678987481574786361\", it seems the ciphertext has spaces that need to be decrypted and separated into single Morse code pairs. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Ciphertext Breakdown**:\n   - Ciphertext: \"58349678987481574786361\"\n   - Spaces added for separation: \"58 34 96 78 98 74 81 57 47 86 36 1\"\n\n2. **Decryption Steps for Spaces**:\n   - First, convert \"58\" to \"A\", \"I\", \"E\" and so on. Then, we need to separate these Morse code pairs into single symbols for letters.\n\n3. **Decrypting with Spaces**:\n   - For the first three Morse code pairs, we treat each digit as part of a sequence from the Morse code table until the space (\".\") in the middle.\n   - For each Morse code pair from \"58\", \"34\", \"96\", etc., we translate:\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"3\" (\"D\") + \"4\" (\"E\") = \"DE\",\n     - \"9\" (\"T\") + \"6\" (\"F\") = \"TF\",\n     - \"7\" (\"V\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"VA\",\n     - \"8\" (\"I\") + \"1\" (\"E\") = \"IE\",\n     - \"5\" (\"A\") + \"7\" (\"I\") = \"AI\",\n     - \"4\" (\"E\") + \"7\" (\"A\") = \"EA\",\n     - \"7\" (\"I\") + \"8\" (\"I\") = \"II\".\n\n4. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - Combining the plaintext characters from the Morse code pairs, we get the decrypted text: \"AIIEDETAF VA EAI AEAI\".\n\nPlease note the specific handling of the spaces and the numerical-index mapping was to clarify the decryption steps according to the initial instructions. The decrypted text is thus \"AIIEDETAFVA EAI AEAI\", considering the ciphertext \"58349678987481574786361\". If there's an error in the ciphertext, further clarification would be needed.\n\n**Answer: [AIIEDETAFVAEAI AEAI]**.\n\nIn the decrypted text, each uppercase letter string in double square brackets is a single sequence of Morse code pairs translated back to their corresponding English letters and separated by spaces as per the ciphertext's structure. The transcription was done with the understanding that spaces in the ciphertext signify the separation of Morse code pairs into single letters after decryption. If a different approach is followed, the process would vary slightly but remain within the guidelines provided."}

The letter is P, so the first decrypted letter is P.\n   - For the second ternary (9, 8, 8), find L1_col = 9 (5th row in Grid 1), L2_row = 8 (5th row in Grid 2). The letter is Z, so the second decrypted letter is Z.\n\n4. **Combine the decrypted letters to form the plaintext:**\n   - PZPZPZ is the decrypted message.\n\n5. **Remove the placeholder '#' characters (padding added to make the message length a multiple of 6):**\n   - The plaintext without '#' characters is: \"PZ PZ PZ\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: **[PZ PZ PZ]**.\n\nPlease note, in a more complex scenario, the encryption would vary slightly, and the decryption steps would focus on correctly identifying the corresponding letters in the encrypted grids without manual mapping.

Let's denote binary groups as (B1, B2).\n   - For group \"QW\", (B1, B2) => (\"010\", \"100\") for Q = '01' and W = '10'.\n4. **Encryption Steps:**\n   - For each (B1, B2), find corresponding numbers from the specified grids:\n     - Q (B1) in `Grid1` has row=0 and column=4, giving `(0,4)`.\n     - W (B2) in `Grid1` has row=4 and column=1, giving `(4,1)`.\n     - Looking up these in `Grid3`, we find the corresponding number `num3` for `(0,4)` is 1 and for `(4,1)` is 8.\n   - The resulting triples are (4, 1, 5) based on Q and W.\n\n### Decryption:\n\n1. **Ciphertext:** \"547898898\".\n2. **Ciphertext Groups:**\n   - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers: \"547, 89, 89, 8\".\n3. **Decryption Steps:**\n   - For each ciphertext triple (x, y, z):\n     - Find L1_col in `Grid1` corresponding to x: `L1_col = x`.\n     - Find L2_col (existing method to find grid references).\n     - Find the row num3 in `Grid3` corresponding to L1_row and L2_col.\n     - Convert the corresponding letters from `Grid1` to form the decrypted letter p1 and from `Grid2` to form the decrypted letter p2.\n   - For the triple (4,1,5), (5,8,8):\n     - L1_col=4 for the ciphertext group \"54\", L1_row=0, L2_col=0, num3=1.\n     - From \"54\" in `Grid1`, the corresponding letter is \"T\".\n     - From \"7\" in `Grid2`, the corresponding letter is \"H\".\n     - So, the decrypted message is \"TH\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe decrypted plaintext from the ciphertext \"547898898\" using the given rules is \"TH\".

However, please note that the decryption process is somewhat open to interpretation due to the unique nature of the cipher and the requirement to align with the specified rules, particularly when specific letter placements are ambiguous or when multiple letters can be valid decrypted outputs. The key aspect here is to adhere to the transformation steps provided for encryption and then reverse them for decryption, aiming to restore the original plaintext message.\n\nGiven the encryption-decryption process involves specific, somewhat imprecise steps and the interpretation of the grid layout and row/column headers/footers, the decrypted output provided above serves as a conceptual example. For a more robust encryption-decryption solution, seeking a clear, precise method to align with the rules would be advisable."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To decrypt the given ciphertext \"M*C*C*V*E*\", following the decryption rules provided, we'll first divide the asterisks (*) in the ciphertext into five groups. These groups will be filled into five rows. Here's how it's done:\n\n1. **Divide the Ciphertext**: \"M*C*C*V*E*\" can be divided into five groups based on the asterisks. However, since the ciphertext starts with a letter and ends with an asterisk, we'll assume a division that corresponds to the layout instructions, which seems to follow a specific word group pattern. Assuming the asterisks divide the ciphertext into \"M\", \"C\", \"C\", \"V\", \"E\", we can proceed with the decryption:\n\n2. **Filling the Rows**:\n    - The first row would contain the letter \"M\" followed by two spaces as indicated by the \"*C\" (since \"C\" minus the first position could indicate two spaces).\n    - The second row would contain \"C\", then \"C\", and an empty space, as indicated by the \"*C\" and \"*\" respectively.\n    - The third row would begin with \"V\", followed by an empty space as indicated by \"*\" and \"E\".\n    - The fourth row would contain \"E\", an empty space for the first position of \"C\", and then \"*\" as an indicator for the separation between \"C\" and \"V\".\n    - The fifth and final row contains \"C\", followed by two spaces, and then \"*\".\n\n3. **Recover the Plaintext**:\n    - Reading the rows, we have: \"M \", \"C \", \"C\", \"V E\", \"C\" and an empty space.\n    - Combining these into a single string, we get \"MCVCVECC\".\n    - Following the decryption rules by removing spaces and the asterisks, we get the final plaintext: \"MCCVECC\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [[MCCVECC]]. Note that the interpretation might vary slightly depending on the exact placement and interpretation of spaces and asterisks in the ruleset, but based on the given instructions, \"MCCVECC\" is the decrypted output."}

For each block:\n   - Fill the grid with the 16 letters row by row.\n   - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n   - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a part of the original message.\n   - Since there are only four holes, rotate the template counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n   - Repeat the reading process four times for each block to confirm the decrypted message.\n\n4. Connect the decrypted messages of all blocks to recover the plaintext:\n   - \"WHFI\" decrypted is \"WHFI\".\n\nTherefore, the encrypted form of the plaintext \"WHFI\" is \"[WHFI]\", and upon decryption, it returns to its original form: \"WHFI\"."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To solve this, we will follow the rules for both encryption and decryption provided. The given ciphertext is \"######UH###MF###\".\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters each. The ciphertext has 13 blocks (including the last block which is shorter and includes a filler character '#' for padding):\n\n   - Block 1: \"##\"\n   - Block 2: \"U\"\n   - Block 3: \"H\"\n   - Block 4: \"E\"\n   - Block 5: \"M\"\n   - Block 6: \"F\"\n\n2. The grid is filled and rotated as described, with each block filling the grid in the following pattern:\n\n   - Block 1: \n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"U\", \"#\", \"#\", \"H\", \"#\", \"E\", \"#\", \"M\"]\n\n   - Block 2:\n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"U\", \"#\", \"H\", \"#\", \"E\", \"#\", \"M\", \"F\", \"\", \"\"]\n   - ... (continued blocks)\n   - Block 13:\n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"M\", \"#\", \"F\"]\n\n3. After completing the 13 fills and 13 rotations, the grid should look like this (after rotation for the last block):\n\n   - Block 1: \n        [\"L\", \"H\", \"E\", \"O\", \"#\", \"U\", \"#\", \"M\", \"F\", \"#\", \"\", \"\"]\n   - Block 2:\n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"E\", \"#\", \"M\", \"F\", \"L\", \"\", \"\"]\n   - ... (continued blocks)\n   - Block 13:\n        [\"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"#\", \"\", \"F\", \"#\"]\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid for each block.\n2. Place the template with holes on the filled grid for each block.\n3. Read the letters visible through the holes to get the first part of the plaintext message.\n4. Rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to get the next set of letters.\n5. Repeat the reading and rotation steps four times (twice for the initial and final blocks) to decrypt the message.\n\nGiven the length of the ciphertext, we'll focus on the decryption of the first few blocks for clarity:\n\n- Block 1: \"##\" decrypted gives \"LO\".\n- Block 2: \"U\" decrypted gives \"U\".\n- Block 3: \"H\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 4: \"E\" decrypted gives \"HE\".\n- Block 5: \"M\" decrypted gives \"ME\".\n- Block 6: \"F\" decrypted gives \"FE\".\n\nConverting these blocks to a single plaintext message, we get: \"LOHEMESFE\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted answer is: [\"LOHEMESFE\"]. Note that due to the specific rules, padding or repetition is necessary to ensure all blocks are filled, which isn't reflected here for simplicity, but would be the case in a full encryption and decryption process.\n\nPlease note, without the full grid and template from each block, the decryption process might not align perfectly, but this approach provides a clear representation of how to decipher the given ciphertext using the specified encryption and decryption rules. In practice, the process might involve more complex steps, including additional checks and adjustments for alignment and integrity throughout the encryption and decryption process."}

This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To solve this, we'll apply the decryption rules provided for the ciphertext \"XV\". Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Ciphertext:** \"XV\"\n\n2. **Divide the Ciphertext into two halves:**\n   - Upper half: X\n   - Lower half: V\n\n3. **Decryption Binary:**\n   - For the upper half \"X\":\n     - The encrypted binary in this cipher is \"(A,F)\", where \"A\" is at position 0 and \"F\" is at position 2.\n     - Using the positions in the encrypted character set, we get the decryption binary as (0, 2).\n   - For the lower half \"V\":\n     - The encrypted binary for \"V\" is \"(D,W)\", where \"D\" is at position 0 and \"W\" is at position 2.\n     - Using the positions in the encrypted character set, we get the decryption binary as (0, 2).\n\n4. **Decryption Steps:**\n   - Since both decryption binaries (0, 2) refer to the same value in the 6x6 matrix, we'll use the letter at position (0, 2) in our 6x6 matrix to get the decrypted characters.\n   - The matrix value at position (0, 2) corresponds to the letter \"A\".\n\n5. **Concatenate the decrypted characters:**\n   - From the 6x6 matrix, we see that \"A\" falls in the first row and fourth column. Additionally, we know that \"A\" from the encrypted binary decryption corresponds to \"A\" from the matrix.\n   - Combining the information, our decrypted plaintext is \"A\".\n\n**Answer:**\n[[A]]\n\nTherefore, the decrypted plaintext from the given ciphertext \"XV\" is \"A\". Note that this method of decryption requires exact correspondence between positions in the matrix and the encrypted character set as per the rules provided. Also, the matrix used here is a 6x6 representing a specific key for encryption and decryption purposes in this cipher.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Using the provided cipher rules, let's decrypt the given ciphertext \"GD\".\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n1. **Plaintext:** \"GD\"\n2. **Ciphertext:** \"GD\" (same as input)\n3. **6x6 Matrix:** Remains the same as given in the rules.\n4. **Encrypted Character Set:** \"ADFGVX\"\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n1. **Ciphertext:** \"GD\"\n2. **Plaintext:** To decrypt, we first divide the ciphertext into two halves: \"GD\" is divided into \"GD\" and \"\".\n3. **Decryption Steps:**\n    - Let's start with the first decryption binary \"G\" and \"D\":\n        - The encrypted binary for G in the given character set is (G,V).\n        - The encrypted binary for D in the given character set is (D,F).\n        - Applying the decryption formula:\n            - For G: The position of G in the character set is 3, so the number of rows is 3 and the number of columns is 2.\n            - For D: The position of D in the character set is 17, so the number of rows is 17 and the number of columns is 5.\n        - Applying the decrypted binary numbers to the 6x6 matrix:\n            - For G, we find the letter in the corresponding position in the matrix to be \"A\", but this does not match the encrypted binary, suggesting our approach needs adjustment. Instead, we'll directly look for the positions:\n            - G is at position (3, 2) in the matrix, and D is at position (17, 5). The actual character at these positions in the matrix is \"F\" and \"G\", respectively.\n        - Given \"AG\" and \"F\", we'll use a more accurate decryption method, which checks the specific property of our cipher and matrix application.\n\nGiven the cipher rules, let's reconsider the decryption steps with a direct approach:\n\n1. For \"GD\", we assign positions directly without relying on full binary decryption:\n    - Start by identifying \"G\" and \"D\" for their positions in the encrypted character set, which are (G,V) and (D,F), respectively.\n    - From the 6x6 matrix and the encrypted character set, we might look for rows and columns directly:\n        - For \"G\", we find the corresponding letter \"A\" in the matrix (\"G\" is at position (0, 2)), but due to the unique rule described, we need to apply the following correction:\n            - We must use the specific number of characters from the encrypted set and match them to their correct positions in the matrix and the plaintext.\n        - For \"D\", we find \"G\" in the same matrix position (\"D\" is at position (17, 5)), but our specific rule suggests we should decipher based on the order in the encrypted character set.\n    - Applying the specific rule:\n        - \"GD\" in the encrypted character set is in positions (G,V) and (D,F).\n        - From the matrix, \"D\" (from the position (17, 5)) might not directly map to the plaintext, but given the encoded positions in the encrypted character set, we check \"G\" (from the position (0, 2)):\n            - \"G\" is \"G\" in the plaintext, following the order of positions in the encrypted character set.\n            - For \"D\", since the matrix position doesn't align with our extensive application for \"G\", we adjust our approach slightly:\n                - We start directly by matching characteristics of the matrix to the plaintext encoded in the encrypted character set, which involves our specific encoded positions:\n                - The key here is to correlate the ciphertext to the property of the matrix and encrypted character set positions.\n\nUltimately, the decrypted answer, adhering to the specific rules and positioning, might be:\n\n**[\"GA\"]**. This answer aligns with the encrypted character set and matrix positioning, considering the unique approach needed for decryption based on the provided cipher rules.\n\nPlease note, the decryption approach might vary slightly with each additional cipher rule or scenario, focusing on aligning the properties of the matrix with the cipher's specific positioning and characteristic bases for decryption. For \"GD\" under the given rules, \"GA\" presents a direct but adapted solution to the cipher's specifics."}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Using the specified encryption rules, let's proceed with the encryption of the plaintext \"O\".\n\n**Encryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Convert Each Character to Binary:**\n    - ASCII value of \"O\": 79. The 8-bit binary representation is 01011100.\n\n2. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation: `01011100 XOR 10101010 = 11110110`.\n\n3. **Permutation:**\n    - Applying the permutation table (2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7) to the XOR result:\n        - The binary result after permutation: `11110110` becomes `01011110`.\n\n4. **Combine Binary Strings:**\n    - The final ciphertext after combining, since the original plaintext \"O\" consists of a single character, is `01011110`.\n\n**Decryption Steps:**\n\n1. **Split Ciphertext into Chunks:**\n    - The ciphertext is `01011110`, split into 8-bit chunks, we get: `[0101], [1110].`\n\n2. **Inverse Permutation:**\n    - Applying the inverse permutation table (1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7) to each chunk:\n        - The first chunk: `0101` becomes `0001`.\n        - The second chunk: `1110` becomes `0001`.\n\n3. **XOR Operation:**\n    - XOR operation with the fixed key '10101010':\n        - For the first chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n        - For the second chunk: `0001 XOR 10101010 = 10101011`.\n\n4. **Convert Binary to Character:**\n    - Convert the binary strings back to decimal:\n        - For the first chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n        - For the second chunk: `10101011` in decimal is 169.\n\n5. **Combine Characters:**\n    - Combine the characters: The decimal values 169 and 169 cannot be directly mapped to an uppercase letter without further context (since we're working with a single-character encryption, we'll convert both to their decimal equivalents rather than ASCII values).\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, which is very close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n        - Decimal 169 is approximately 169 in decimal, and similarly, it's close to \"T\" in ASCII.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted version of \"O\" encrypted with the specified rules and using the provided key and permutation table is `169` (approximated to \"T\"). Please note, in this encryption method, all non-alphabetic characters are ignored, and the mapping to specific letters is based on their closest decimal equivalents without considering variations in letter casing. \n\nRemember, the encryption and decryption rules described here are specific to the examples provided, and actual encryption and decryption processes would typically involve more complex steps and considerations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or more sophisticated algorithms. The key and permutation used here are simplified for illustrative purposes and not recommended for secure encryption in real-world applications. Always use appropriate, secure encryption methods when handling sensitive information."}

This represents the hexadecimal string of the encrypted data after going through the encryption and decryption processes. The final decrypted text is \"JA30\". Note that the interpretation of the decrypted text is tied to the specific rules applied, which include the use of a fixed key, S_BOX and INV_S_BOX for substitution and permutation operations, respectively, without considering any specific encoding or decoding from a defined set of values for characters. In a typical encryption scenario, it's crucial to ensure that the inputs (plaintext, keyword, etc.) are correctly aligned and converted to the specified format for encryption and decryption operations to work as intended. However, based on the provided rules, \"N\" encrypted leads to \"JA30\".\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything more specific you'd like to understand about the encryption and decryption process, such as interpreting the specific rules for substitution and permutation, or if there are additional details or operations you'd like clarification on."}

Please note that the decrypted string is just \"C0\" and may not form a meaningful sentence without additional context. The original cipher applies hexadecimal encoding, which might alter the meaning of individual characters when converting between ASCII and hexadecimal representations. Herein, we're deciphering the hexadecimal representation of the ciphertext.\n\nIf you're working with specific characters or sentences, make sure to contextualize the decrypted result accordingly. For instance, if \"C0\" represents a hexadecimal mapping of certain letters (like 'C' and '0'), then \"C0\" might be the decrypted plaintext in a different encoding scheme. In this scenario, the base64 representation of \"C0\" would be \"SL\", reflecting the hexadecimal mapping from 'C' to 'S' and from '0' to 'L'. Adjust the decryption as needed based on the encoding used."}

Convert the ciphertext into a hexadecimal sequence. The ciphertext \"25\" in hexadecimal is \"17\".\n2. Convert the hexadecimal string into a sequence of bytes using ASCII encoding.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " Given the ciphertext \"27ad\" and adhering to the specified encryption and decryption rules, we start by identifying the properties of the ciphertext, the keyword, and the plaintext we aim to retrieve.\n\nPlaintext: We aim to decode the ciphertext back to its uppercase equivalent without spaces or punctuation. Given the ciphertext format, we assume the original plaintext could be \"27AD\".\n\nKeyword: The keyword is derived from the SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\", which results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n\nNow, following the decryption process:\n\n1. Converting the ciphertext into a sequence of bytes. The hexadecimal \"27ad\" decodes to bytes: 0x18 0xD7 0x01 0xB0 (in decimal).\n\n2. Each of these bytes is decrypted using the corresponding byte of the key with a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. The decryption process involves:\n\n   - 0x18: XOR with the 1st byte of the key.\n   - 0xD7: XOR with the 2nd byte of the key.\n   - 0x01: XOR with the 3rd byte of the key.\n   - 0xB0: XOR with the 4th byte of the key.\n\nGiven the key value '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3', the decrypted bytes should be:\n\n- 0x18: XOR with 0x34 decodes to 0x5C.\n- 0xD7: XOR with 0x14 decodes to 0x77.\n- 0x01: XOR with 0xC4 decodes to 0x10.\n- 0xB0: XOR with 0x78 decodes to 0xC8.\n\nPutting these decrypted bytes back together: \"5C7710C8\", assuming the hexadecimal order.\n\n3. Converting the decrypted byte sequence back to a plaintext string: \"5C7710C8\" decodes to \"SC7T10O8\", which is the decrypted plaintext.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a slight discrepancy in the provided ciphertext (\"27ad\") and the decryption process. The ciphertext provided seems overly simplified for the encryption process described. The ciphertext:\n\n- Should be a result of XORing the ASCII representation of the plaintext with the key, not a direct hexadecimal conversion.\n- The ciphertext in the question is hexadecimal, but in the decryption process, it should be converted back to its binary representation before decryption.\n\nWith the correct approach, assuming the plaintext is \"SC7T10O8\", and adhering strictly to the decryption rules:\n\nDecrypted plaintext: \"SC7T10O8\"\n\nPlease note that the provided initial ciphertext and steps seem to deviate from the standard encryption methodology described, leading to a potential misunderstanding of the encryption and decryption protocols. The correct decoding of the ciphertext using the specified method would involve reversing the XOR operation and converting the resulting binary back to hexadecimal before decoding to its original plaintext form.\n\nIf you specifically wanted to decode \"27ad\" using the provided decryption rules and assuming a typo or oversimplification in those rules, the correct decrypted plaintext would be \"SC7T10O8\" based on the provided decryption steps, but with a critical understanding that the ciphertext interpretation needs to align with the methodology and rules described.\n\nGiven the constraints and complexity, please clarify if there was a misinterpretation of the rules or if there's an additional context to provide.
