Since formula A contains 4 propositional variables, there are 2^4 = 16 possible paired conjunctive terms in the principal disjunctive normal form of A.\n2.

The possible even indices are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.\n5. Since m0 is already included, we need to choose additional paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 even indices.\n6. The number of ways to choose k paired conjunctive terms from the remaining 7 is given by the binomial coefficient: C(7, k) = 7! / (k!(7-k)!)\n7.

The proposition `p` is the consensus of the group `G`, which means it is a common belief within the group. According to the definition of common belief, this implies that for every member `i` of the group `G`, `B_ip` holds.\n2. Specifically, since Alice is a member of the group `G`, we can infer that `B_Ap` holds, meaning Alice firmly believes `p` is true.\n3.

Both groups were subjected to bruising, and the result showed that the wound healed faster in the normal group.\n\nThis is consistent with Method \u0606, which states that if P (fast healing) occurs when S (presence of salivary glands) is present and does not occur when S is absent, then S and P may have a causal relationship. In this case, the presence of salivary glands (S) corresponds to fast healing (P), and the absence of salivary glands corresponds to slow healing."}
