Since 14 is not a multiple of X (we don't know the value of X yet), and X is not a multiple of 14, the operation rule dictates that X※14 = 24.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X. We know that X※14 = 24, so we can substitute X※14 with 24 in the original equation: 25※X※14 = 25※24 = 4.\n\nSince 25 is not a multiple of 24, and 24 is not a multiple of 25, the operation rule dictates that 25※24 = 24.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4. Therefore, we need to re-examine our previous assumptions.\n\nLet's consider the case where X is a multiple of 14. The multiples of 14 are 14, 28, 42, ... . If X = 14, then X※14 = 14/14 + 2 = 3.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X = 25※3. Since 3 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 3, the operation rule dictates that 25※3 = 24.\n\nHowever, this again contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nLet's consider the case where 14 is a multiple of X. The divisors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. If X = 7, then X※14 = 14/7 + 2 = 4.\n\nNow, let's consider 25※X = 25※7. Since 7 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 7, the operation rule dictates that 25※7 = 24.\n\nHowever, this again contradicts the original equation 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nLet's consider the case where X = 1 or X = 2. If X = 1, then X※14 = 24, and 25※X = 25※1 = 27 (since 1 is a divisor of 25). If X = 2, then X※14 = 24, and 25※X = 25※2 = 13 (since 2 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 2).\n\nNeither of these cases satisfies the original equation 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nHowever, if X = 1 or X = 2, we can try rearranging the equation: X※25※14 = 4.\n\nIf X = 1, then X※25 = 25 + 2 = 27, and 27※14 = 24 (since 27 is not a multiple of 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 27).\n\nIf X = 2, then X※25 = 25/2 + 2 = 15.5 (which is not an integer, so this case is invalid).\n\nFinally, we have found a valid solution: [[1]]."}

Let's denote logₓ(2) as k. Then:\n\nlog₂(X) = 5/2 - k\n\nNow, we can use the property of logarithms to rewrite the equation:\n\nX = 2^(5/2 - k)\n\nWe know that X is a positive integer, so the exponent must be an integer. The only way to achieve this is when k = 1, making the exponent equal to 1/2.\n\nSo, X = 2^(1/2) = √2\n\nSince X must be a positive integer, and √2 is not an integer, we have a contradiction. This implies that the original equation 3￠3￠X = 5/2 has no integer solution for X.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[No solution]]"}
