If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card.

Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

Each character in the Morse code consists of a sequence of dots (.) or dashes (-). The dot . represents a short duration on the off state, while the dash - represents a longer duration on the off state. Both the dot and the dash are separated by a short duration in the off state. For example, the Morse code for the letter A is encoded as .- (dot followed by dash). To simplify data storage and reduce the size of the data representation, it's possible to map each dot-dash pattern to a number. For example, the letter A represented as .- can be mapped to 1. By systematically using numeric patterns for the Morse code symbols, such as .---, -.--, -.-, ..-., .---, etc., the Morse code can be efficiently represented by a sequence of on-off signals."}

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"USAU\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

To solve this, we first need to define the encryption key `e=263` and the modulus `n=299`. The algorithm for encryption involves raising each letter in the plaintext to the power of `e` modulo `n`, and the decryption process involves raising the ciphertext back to the power of `e` modulo `n` to retrieve the original letter.\n\nWe can assume that the plaintext is all in uppercase ASCII alphabets since the prompt mentions that the ciphertext should only contain numbers separated by commas. To simplify the encryption/decryption process, we can first convert the letters to their equivalent ASCII values using `ord()` function and then encrypt/decrypt the values.\n\nFor encryption, we can iterate over each character in the plaintext and compute its encrypted value by raising it to the power of `e` and then modulo `n`. Similarly, for decryption, we can split the ciphertext by commas and iterate over each number, raise it to the power of `e` and modulo `n`, and convert it back to its corresponding ASCII character using `chr()` function.\n\nThe code provided implements this algorithm and provides a `encrypt()` function for encrypting the plaintext, and a `decrypt()` function for decrypting the ciphertext. It also includes some tests using the sample inputs and outputs provided in the prompt.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n\nclass SmartPrimer(object):\n    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Encipher given plaintext to ciphertext using RSA algorithm\n        :param plaintext: the text to encrypt\n        :return: encrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        cipher_text = \"\"\n        for c in plaintext:\n            ascii_val = ord(c)\n            cipher_text += f\"{pow(ascii_val, k, mod)},\"\n        return cipher_text[:-1]\n\n    def decrypt(self, ciphertext: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Decipher given ciphertext to plaintext using RSA algorithm\n        :param ciphertext: the text to decrypt\n        :return: decrypted text\n        \"\"\"\n        mod = 299\n        k = 263\n        plain_text = \"\"\n        for c in ciphertext.split(\",\"):\n            ascii_val = pow(int(c), k, mod)\n            plain_text += chr(ascii_val)\n        return plain_text\n\n\nclass TestSmartPrimer(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self) -> None:\n        self.smarter = SmartPrimer()\n\n    def test_encrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"I\",), \"213\"),\n            ((\"Z\",), \"32\"),\n            20312345678901234567879\n        ]\n\n    def test_decrypt(self):\n        test_data = [\n            ((\"213\",), \"I\"),\n            ((\"55,55,213\"), \"WWI\"),\n        ]\n        for params, expected in test_data:\n            with self.subTest(parameters=params, expected=expected):\n                actual = self.smarter.decrypt(*params)\n                self.assertEqual(actual, expected)\n```"}

A customer needs to encrypt the ciphertext to hide their messages and then send it in a group chat. However, on this occasion, they would like to notify a specific person of the ciphertext and hope that only this target person can decrypt the ciphertext. Can you design such a group chat notification system? Please provide a complete workflow of your proposed system, including instructions for sending and receiving messages using the messaging app you created, as well as an illustration using an instance of a message. Please use symbols like arrows for \"encryption\", \"decryption\", \"query\", \"send to\" in the illustration to represent message processing flows.\n\n2. Besides the system you just designed, is there another encryption mechanism that also allows you to hide the plaintext when encrypting the message? To answer this one, you don't have to worry about designing an encryption mechanism.\n\n### Answer:\n1. The design of my system is as the following:\n   1. Plaintext stored on user's local.\n   2. User send the plaintext to me and I will encrypt it using RN format.\n   3. I will send the ciphertext to the group chat.\n   4. One and only one user who would want to know the plaintext will find me to decrypt the ciphertext.\n   5. I use the key from it's admin to connect the user to the encrypted message since the message is only targeted to that person.\n   6. I will use the key on my server to do the \"true\" decrypt the ciphertext by OAM.\n   7. Then I send the plaintext to the person who needs to know the plaintext.\n\n   The most difficult part of this system is how to make a robust system not to break the connection between something that only one user need to know and the special key used to decrypt.\n\n2. Well, I will try to use the chat room to send and retrieve the message."}

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Calculate x * k_q_x as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Compute z = c // k_q_x. where // is used in integer division operations to return the integer part of the quotient (i.e., the result of removing the fractional part).\n        - Based on the decimal number represented by z, use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
