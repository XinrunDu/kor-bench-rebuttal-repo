For 25 and X, we need to find whether 25 is a multiple of X, or vice versa.\n\nAs X is unknown, we cannot directly determine if 25 is a multiple of X or not. However, we can try to deduce this information based on the given result 25※X※14 = 4.\n\nIf 25 is a multiple of X, then 25※X※14 = X/25 + 2. But this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a fraction. Therefore, 25 cannot be a multiple of X.\n\nSimilarly, if X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X※14 = 14/X + 2. Again, this cannot be equal to 4, as X would need to be a large fraction. Hence, X cannot be a multiple of 25.\n\nThis leaves us with the case where 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25. In this case, the operation rule states that 25※X※14 = 24.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation: 25※X※14 = 24\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to make it more solvable:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n\n1/(25※X※14) = 1/24\n\n1/([25※X※14]) = 1/24\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by 24 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n[25※X※14] = 1\n\nNow, we can apply the operation rule again. Since 25 is not a multiple of X, and X is not a multiple of 25, we can simplify the left-hand side:\n\n[25※X※14] = 24\n\n1 = 24\n\nThis is a contradictory equation. This means that the equation 25※X※14 = 4 does not have a solution for X.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [[There is no solution for X.]]"}

Define that  A ○ B = (xA + yB) × (A + B),x and y are parameters, Given that 7 ○ 2 = 180; 2 ○ 3 = 65, solve x and y.\nYour answer should be in the format: x= an integer, y= an integer. \nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[x=value,y=value]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve for x and y, we can start by using the given values of 7 ○ 2 = 180 and 2 ○ 3 = 65 in the modified rule:\n\n7 ○ 2 = (7x + y)(7 + 2)\n180 = (7x + y)(9)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we can start by finding the common factors of 180 and 9. Since 9 is a factor of 180, we can divide both sides by 9 to simplify the equation:\n\n20 = 7x + y\n\nNext, we can use the second given value:\n\n2 ○ 3 = (2x + y)(2 + 3)\n65 = (2x + y)(5)\n\nThis equation can be simplified by multiplying both sides by 5:\n\n325 = 2x + y\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations by first solving the first equation for y:\n\ny = 20 - 7x\n\nSubstitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n\n325 = 2x + (20 - 7x)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n325 = 20 + 2x - 7x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n305 = -5x\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nx = -61\n\nNow that we have found x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find y.
