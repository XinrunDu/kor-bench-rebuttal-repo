Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The keystream algorithm is *deterministic*, meaning keystream values depend solely on the initial order of the deck. The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds(All row and column numbers are counted from 0.):\n        - Grid 1 (3x9):\n            \n            Q W E R T Y U I O\n            P A S D F G H J K\n            L Z X C V B N M #\n            \n        - Grid 2 (9x3):\n            \n            Q W E\n            R T Y\n            U I O\n            P A S\n            D F G\n            H J K\n            L Z X\n            C V B\n            N M #\n            \n        - Grid 3 (3x3):\n            \n            1 2 3\n            4 5 6\n            7 8 9\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Remove all spaces and punctuation from the plain text and convert them to capital letters.\n    - Cut the plaintext into groups of 6 characters, and if a group is less than 6 characters long, fill it with `#`.\n    - Split each group of 6 characters into 3 binary groups.\n    - For each binary group `(L1, L2)` do the following:\n        - Determine the row and column numbers  of `L1` in `grid1` as `(l1_row, l1_col)`.\n        - Determine the row and column numbers of `L2` in `grid2` as `(l2_row, l2_col)`.\n        - Find the corresponding number `num3` in `grid3` from `l1_row` and `l2_col`.\n        - Output the triple `(l1_col, num3, l2_row)` of the three numbers.\n            - For example, for the binary (T,H), the row and column numbers of T in `grid1` are (0,4), the row and column numbers of H in `grid2` are (5,0).\n            - Based on `l1_row` (0) and `l2_col`(0) , the corresponding number `num3` found in `grid3` is 1, and the final ternary is (4, 1, 5).\n    - After performing the previous step multiple times and converting all the binary groups to triples, read them in turn to form a string of numbers that can be used as encrypted information. For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Preparation:\n    - Key(SHA hash value)\n        - Performing SHA-256 on \"SECRET_KEY\" results in '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3'.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Converts a plaintext string into a sequence of bytes (ASCII encoding).\n    - Each byte is encrypted with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation. Repeatedly recycle the key so that the key length is the same as the number of plaintext bytes.\n    - The encrypted byte sequence is converted to a hexadecimal string for ciphertext output.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Hexadecimal string (and letters a-e in lower case).\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Key (Same as encryption,is a hashed hash obtained by SHA_256)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Converts the ciphertext string into a sequence of bytes.\n    - Each byte is decrypted (the decryption process is the same as the encryption process) with the corresponding byte of the key using a bitwise different-or (XOR) operation.\n    - The decrypted byte sequence is converted to a plaintext string.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"D\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
