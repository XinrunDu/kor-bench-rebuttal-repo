Apply De Morgan's Law (equivalence 6) correctly to !(p|q): !p & !q doesn't apply here directly because we have !(p|q), not a direct negation of an AND. However, we should apply the correct transformation: !(p|q) ::=:: !p & !q.\n4. So, we have (p & !p & !q)&r, but this was an incorrect step.

However, our expression is in the form of `(A&B) | (A&C)`, which is not directly addressed by the given equivalences but is a form that can be intuitively understood as distributing `A` across the `|` operation, given its presence in both terms.\n\nHowever, to align strictly with the given rules, let's focus on simplifying the expression using the rules directly:\n\n- **Given**: `p ::=:: (p&q) | (p&!q)`\n- To prove this, we should aim to simplify or expand one side to match the other, but given the direct equivalences, we notice that this expression aligns with an intuitive understanding of distributing `p` across `|`, but let's validate using the rules provided, specifically focusing on the distributive property and the laws of identity.\n\nSince we don't have a direct rule that matches our case perfectly for step-by-step transformation using the provided rules, let's analyze the logical validity:\n\n- **Logical Validity**: The expression `(p&q) | (p&!q)` simplifies to `p` because it covers all cases where `p` is true, regardless of `q`. However, without a direct sequence of transformations using the given equivalences, we must recognize this as an application of distributive principles and understanding of logical operations.\n\nGiven the structure of the question and the rules, we were led to analyze validity rather than strict equivalence transformation. The expression is logically valid but was not directly proven through step-by-step equivalence transformation using the provided rules.\n\n### (2) (p&!q) | (!p&q) ::=:: (p|q) & (!(p|q))\n\n- **Given**: `(p&!q) | (!p&q) ::=:: (p|q) & (!(p|q))`\n- **De Morgan's Law (6)** and other relevant laws don't directly apply to simplify the RHS to match the LHS without considering additional logical properties.\n\nHowever, analyzing the RHS:\n\n- `(p|q) & (!(p|q))` directly simplifies using the laws provided, specifically:\n  - `!(p|q)` by De Morgan's Law is `!p & !q`.\n  - Thus, `(p|q) & (!p & !q)` is not directly equivalent to the LHS upon simplification using the given laws.\n\n**Logical Analysis**: The LHS `(p&!q) | (!p&q)` represents a situation where either `p` is true and `q` is false or vice versa. The RHS simplifies to a form that doesn't directly match this logic upon application of the given equivalences, indicating a misunderstanding in the direct application of equivalences to prove this statement.\n\nGiven the analysis, the direct application of the 16 Basic Equivalences to prove these equivalences as valid or not has been challenging without further logical analysis beyond the equivalences.

Using rule (5) `A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C)` in reverse, we see that `(!p | q) & (!p | r)` is equivalent to `!p | (q & r)`.\n\n3. Now, we compare this to the right side of the equivalence `(p>(q|r))`. Expanding the implication, we get `!p | (q|r)`.\n\n4. Given that we've transformed the left side into `!p | (q & r)` and the right side is `!p | (q|r)`, we notice the left side has an `&` between `q` and `r`, while the right side has an `|`. This discrepancy shows that the equivalence is not directly applicable based on the given basic equivalences, particularly because `&` and `|` operations yield different truth values for the same inputs, except in specific cases.\n\n### For the second equivalence: !(p=q) ::=:: (p|q)&!(p&q)\n\n1. The equivalence relation `=` can be expanded using rule (11) `A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)`. However, to tackle `!(p=q)`, we should consider the negation of an equivalence.\n\n2. According to the rules provided, directly handling `!(p=q)` requires breaking down the equivalence first, which means converting it into implications and then negating the entire expression.\n\n3. However, we can simplify our approach by directly considering what it means for two propositions not to be equivalent. This implies that either one is true when the other is false, or vice versa. This can be intuitively understood as an XOR operation, but let's stick to the given logical operators.\n\n4. The proposed equivalence `(p|q)&!(p&q)` indeed captures the idea that either `p` or `q` must be true (or both, as allowed by `|`), but not both simultaneously (as prohibited by `!(p&q)`). This aligns with the intuition behind `!(p=q)`, suggesting that the equivalence might hold.\n\n5. To validate, consider `!(p=q)` means `!((p>q) & (q>p))`, which can be expanded to `!((!p|q) & (!q|p))`. Using De Morgan's laws and simplification, we aim to reach a form comparable to `(p|q)&!(p&q)`.\n\nHowever, given the complexity and the specific instructions to adhere strictly to the format, let's focus on the conclusion based on the logical analysis provided:\n\nGiven the analysis, the first equivalence does not directly hold based on the basic equivalences provided, indicating an issue with its validity. The second equivalence, upon intuitive understanding and partial logical breakdown, seems plausible but requires a detailed step-by-step logical transformation to confirm its absolute validity according to the given rules.\n\nTherefore, without completing the exhaustive logical transformations for the second part but recognizing the misalignment in the first, the preliminary assessment would suggest:\n\n**Answer:** [B];[A]\n\nPlease note, this response follows the analysis but might benefit from further detailed breakdowns for absolute logical confirmation, especially for the second equivalence."}

The answer format should be:\n[[B1&C2&D3::=::…];[B1&C3&D2::=::…];[B2&C1&D3::=::…];[B2&C3&D1::=::…];[B3&C1&D2::=::…];[B3&C2&D1::=::…];[E::=::…]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To simplify each expression according to the given rules, we will systematically apply the equivalences provided.\n\n### (1) Simplifying B1&C2&D3:\nB1&C2&D3 = (!p&q) & ((p&q) | (!p&!q)) & (q&r)  \nSince (p&q) | (!p&!q) simplifies to (p|!p)&(q|!q) by rule (5), and p|!p ::=:: 1 (rule 8),  \nwe get B1&C2&D3 ::=:: (!p&q) & (q&r)  \nBy applying rule (7), this simplifies further to  \n!p & q & r  \nBut since exactly one of p, q, r is true, and the other two are false, this expression cannot hold true.\n\n### (2) Simplifying B1&C3&D2:\nB1&C3&D2 = (!p&q) & (!p&q) & ((!q&r)|(q&!r))  \nThis simplifies to !p&q since (!p&q) & (!p&q) ::=:: !p&q (rule 2).  \nHowever, considering the constraints on p, q, and r, the expression reduces to just !p&q, but given the context, this cannot be true because it contradicts the initial assumption that only one of p, q, r is true.\n\n### (3) Simplifying B2&C1&D3:\nB2&C1&D3 = ((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (p&!q) & (q&r)  \nThis expression cannot hold because p&!q and q&r cannot both be true given the constraints.\n\n### (4) Simplifying B2&C3&D1:\nB2&C3&D1 = ((!p&!q)|(p&q)) & (!p&q) & (!q&!r)  \nThis simplifies similarly to previous cases, where due to the constraints, it reduces to an impossible scenario given the initial assumptions.\n\n### (5) Simplifying B3&C1&D2:\nB3&C1&D2 = (p&!q) & (p&!q) & ((!q&r)|(q&!r))  \nThis simplifies to p&!q. Given the constraints, this could potentially hold, but considering the original statements and the unique truth value condition, it's not feasible.\n\n### (6) Simplifying B3&C2&D1:\nB3&C2&D1 = (p&!q) & ((p&q)|(!p&!q)) & (!q&!r)  \nThis simplifies in the same vein as the others, resulting in an expression that cannot hold true under the given constraints.\n\n### (7) Simplifying E:\nGiven the simplifications above and considering the constraints that exactly one of p, q, r is true, and the other two are false, E simplifies to an expression that represents the only feasible scenario under the given conditions.\n\nHowever, due to the structure of the provided logical expressions and the instructions, the detailed step-by-step simplification process for E based on the given parts does not straightforwardly lead to a simple final expression without considering the specific constraints on p, q, and r's truth values. Each part's simplification process demonstrates that most combinations are impossible under the condition that only one of p, q, or r can be true, making a direct logical simplification of E based on these parts challenging without further assumptions.\n\nGiven the instructions and the aim for a specific format in the answer, and acknowledging that the detailed simplifications provided do not directly lead to a final, simplified expression for E that fits within the constraints of the problem as described, the following response adheres to the required format but highlights the complexity and the need for further logical analysis under the given constraints:\n\n[[B1&C2&D3 ::=:: 0]; \n[B1&C3&D2 ::=:: !p&q]; \n[B2&C1&D3 ::=:: 0]; \n[B2&C3&D1 ::=:: 0]; \n[B3&C1&D2 ::=:: p&!q]; \n[B3&C2&D1 ::=:: 0]; \n[E ::=:: E]].\n\nNote: The simplifications to '0' indicate that under the given constraints and the logical rules provided, these combinations cannot hold true. The simplification of E remains as E due to the complexity and the constraints provided, indicating that a direct simplification based on the given parts does not lead to a clear, simple logical expression without further context or logical reduction."}

This expression is a disjunction of two conjunctions, each involving the propositions p, q, and r.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the constraints on p, q, and r\nIt is given that exactly one of p, q, and r is true, and the other two are false. This implies that we have three possible scenarios: (1) p is true, q and r are false; (2) q is true, p and r are false; (3) r is true, p and q are false.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluating the first disjunct of E\nThe first disjunct of E is !p&q&!r. For this expression to be true, we need p to be false, q to be true, and r to be false. This corresponds to scenario (2) above.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the second disjunct of E\nThe second disjunct of E is p&!q&r. For this expression to be true, we need p to be true, q to be false, and r to be true. However, this does not correspond to any of the scenarios above, since it requires two propositions to be true, which is not allowed.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the first disjunct of E is true, which implies that Professor Wang is from Shanghai (since q is true).\n\n## Step 6: Determining who got everything right, half right, and everything wrong\nBy comparing the statements of each person with the true values of p, q, and r, we can determine that Person A got everything right, Person C got half right (since they correctly stated that Professor Wang is not from Hangzhou), and Person B got everything wrong.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Shanghai; A; C; B]}$"}

This expression involves three propositional variables (p, q, r) and their negations, combined with logical AND (^) and OR (∨) operations.\n\n1. **Identifying Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - A paired conjunctive term is a simple conjunctive form where each propositional variable and its negation appear exactly once, and the variables or their negations are arranged in ascending order of subscripts or lexicographical order.\n   \n   The expression (¬p^¬q^r)∨(¬p^q^r) can be broken down into two conjunctive terms:\n   - ¬p^¬q^r\n   - ¬p^q^r\n   \n   These are indeed paired conjunctive terms because each term includes every propositional variable or its negation exactly once, and they are in lexicographical order.\n\n2. **Denoting Paired Conjunctive Terms:**\n\n   - The notation for a paired conjunctive term (m) corresponds to the binary number equal to the hexadecimal number i, where i represents the true assignment of the term.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^¬q^r, if we consider the true assignment (where each variable's presence or absence directly corresponds to a binary digit, with ¬ indicating 0 and the presence indicating 1), we have ¬p (0), ¬q (0), r (1), which gives us the binary number 001. This binary number corresponds to the hexadecimal number 1.\n   \n   - For the term ¬p^q^r, following the same logic, we have ¬p (0), q (1), r (1), which gives us the binary number 011.

The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 001 (r is true, p and q are false), which is 1 in hexadecimal. Thus, it can be denoted as m1.\n   - The second term is (p∧q∧r). The true assignment for this term corresponds to the binary number 111 (all are true), which is 7 in hexadecimal.

Check S2: Since S2 is empty, and no new clauses were added that would create a contradiction (0), the algorithm outputs “Plausible” after checking for any immediate contradictions in the initial set and resolving them. Given the nature of the provided set, it's clear there are no contradictions that would lead to an \"Implausible\" output without needing further iterations for new resolutions.\n\nHowever, based on the precise steps outlined in the algorithm, after resolving clauses in S1 and finding that S2 remains empty because the resolution didn't produce a new clause (as 'q' is considered logically equivalent to 'q ∨ q' in this context), the algorithm technically should acknowledge this equivalence and recognize no new information was gained. Thus, without the generation of new, distinct clauses to populate S2, the process effectively concludes after a single meaningful pass through the resolution steps.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm will output \"Plausible\" and iterate for 1 meaningful cycle because it resolves the given set without producing new clauses that necessitate further iterations.\n\nAnswer: [[Plausible];[1]]"}

Then, we resolve clauses in S0 and S1, and in S1 itself, and update S2 accordingly.\n\n## Step 3: Resolve clauses in S0 and S1.\nSince S0 is empty, we can move directly to resolving clauses in S1.\n\n## Step 4: Resolve clauses in S1.\nFor each pair of clauses C1 and C2 in S1, we check if they can be resolved. The pairs are (p∨q, p∨¬q), (p∨q, ¬p∨r), and (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\n\n## Step 5: Resolve the pair (p∨q, p∨¬q).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, p∨¬q) gives us p∨0, which simplifies to p. Since p is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 6: Resolve the pair (p∨q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨q, ¬p∨r) gives us q∨r. Since q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 7: Resolve the pair (p∨¬q, ¬p∨r).\nThis pair can be resolved, and calculating C = dispel(p∨¬q, ¬p∨r) gives us ¬q∨r. Since ¬q∨r is not in S0 or S1, we add it to S2.\n\n## Step 8: Check S2.\nSince S2 contains elements (p, q∨r, ¬q∨r), we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b. This is the first cycle of iteration.\n\n## Step 9: Resolve clauses in the updated S0 and S1.\nIn the next iteration, S0 is the original S1, and S1 is the previous S2. Resolving clauses in S0 and S1 will not produce new clauses. However, resolving clauses within the new S1 may produce a contradiction.\n\n## Step 10: Resolve clauses in the updated S1.\nResolving p with q∨r and ¬q∨r will not produce a contradiction directly, but resolving q∨r with ¬q∨r will produce r, which can then be resolved with other clauses. However, r is not directly resolvable with any other clause to produce a contradiction, so we continue.\n\n## Step 11: Check for further resolvability and implications.\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that resolving (p∨q) with (p∨¬q) actually gives us p, which is a single literal clause. When we have a single literal clause, it means that literal must be true for the entire expression to be true. Therefore, p must be true.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the true value of p to other clauses.\nWith p being true, (p∨q) and (p∨¬q) are automatically satisfied, regardless of the values of q and ¬q. This leaves us with (¬p∨r), but since p is true, this clause can only be satisfied if r is also true.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the output based on the resolution.\nGiven that we have found values for p and r that satisfy all clauses without directly using the resolution to reach a contradiction or the empty clause, the expression has a satisfying assignment.\n\n## Step 14: Count the number of cycles iterated.\nBased on the description of steps taken, after the initial setup and first round of resolution, there is no need for further iterations as we have already found a satisfying assignment without needing to follow the algorithm to its potential conclusion of finding a contradiction or the empty clause. Therefore, we conclude that the algorithm iterates 1 cycle to reach the determination of \"Plausible\".\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[Plausible;1]}$"}

However, the detailed breakdown led to an overcomplication of the direct answer needed based on the initial structure given.\n\nGiven the clarification needed and focusing strictly on the format requested without the misinterpretation:\n\nThe answer, focusing on the logic rule and correcting the approach for matching the mood without the confusion in structure, should directly align with the valid moods for the figure it represents, but the specific format requested [[];[]] seems to be for a different type of logical notation or answer representation than what was directly solved for in the explanation.\n\nCorrecting for the format and the specific logic puzzle context provided, and acknowledging a mistake in matching the solution process to the answer format requested:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[IAI; SIP]}$"}

This formula means that if a proposition p is true, then it is possible that p is true.\n\nGiven the statement \"There is necessarily a connection between things,\" we can represent this as #p, where p is the proposition \"there is a connection between things.\" The necessity of the connection is represented by the # symbol.\n\nHowever, the formula we are applying is p → $p, which does not directly involve necessity (#) but rather implies possibility ($) from truth (p). To fit the given scenario into this formula, we recognize that if something is necessary (#p), then it is true (p), and according to formula 15, if it is true (p), then it is possible ($p).\n\nThus, from \"There is necessarily a connection between things\" (#p), we can infer that \"There is a connection between things\" (p), and further, according to formula 15, that \"There might be a connection between things\" ($p).\n\nSo, the correct inference is that there might be a connection between things, which aligns with option B.\n\nThe final answer is: [[B]]"}

However, to follow the format requirement and assuming a misunderstanding in the question's setup, if we were to select a relationship for a pair not fitting neatly into the given logic framework, it might seem like an error in the question's construction rather than an application of the rules.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the second part of the question due to its lack of clear connection to the logic rules provided, the answer format requested seems to necessitate a choice that might not accurately reflect the logical analysis as intended by the question.\n\nHowever, to comply with the format requirement without a clear logical basis for the second pair:\n\nThe answer is [[A];[A]]."}

For Fp and ¬G¬p, considering the rules, specifically (13) Gp ↔ F¬p and (15) Fp ↔ ¬G¬p, we see that these are directly related through the defined equivalences. However, the precise relationship symbol isn’t directly listed for Fp and ¬G¬p in terms of ※, ↦, ⚭, or ⁂, but we can infer based on the properties. Fp and ¬G¬p essentially reflect a situation where both can be true or both can be false, aligning more closely with the ⁂ Relationship properties.\n\n2. For Gp and Fp, considering rule (21) Gp → Fp, and understanding that both can indeed be true or both be false, this aligns with the ⁂ Relationship properties.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, both pairs of statements exhibit characteristics of the ⁂ Relationship, as they can both be true or both be false without violating the defined logical rules.\n\n### Answer:\n[[D];[D]]"}

Axioms of Doubt\n- Introduction of Doubt: `H_p → ¬B_p`, indicating that if an individual doubts the proposition `p`, they do not firmly believe `p`.\n- Spread of Doubt: If `iRj` and `H_ip`, then `H_jp`, indicating that if individual `i` doubts the proposition `p` and can recognize individual `j`, then `j` may also start to doubt `p`.\n\n### Question:\nIf a proposition p is the consensus of the group G, \nbut the individual Alice doubts this proposition, \nwhat logical expression can be written according to the definition of consensus?\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To address the question, we need to break it down based on the given logic rules and the scenario provided.\n\nGiven:\n- Proposition `p` is a common belief in the group `G`, which means `G_p`.\n- According to the definition of common belief, if `p` is a common belief in `G`, then for every member `i` of `G`, `B_ip` holds.\n- However, individual Alice doubts proposition `p`, which can be expressed as `H_Ap` (where `A` denotes Alice).\n\nWe are asked to write a logical expression according to the definition of consensus, taking into account Alice's doubt.\n\nFirst, express the consensus (common belief) formally:\n- Common belief in `p` within `G` is `G_p`.\n\nAccording to the definition of common belief:\n- For every member `i` of `G`, `B_ip` holds. This means `∀i ∈ G, B_ip`.\n\nHowever, since Alice (`A`) is a member of `G` and she doubts `p`, we have:\n- `H_Ap`, which by the \"Introduction of Doubt\" axiom implies `¬B_Ap`.\n\nCombining these, we can express the situation as:\n- `G_p ∧ ∃i ∈ G, H_ip`, specifically for Alice, this becomes `G_p ∧ H_Ap`.\n\nGiven the structure of the logic and the specific question about the format, it seems we are to encapsulate our logical expressions within double square brackets `[[ ]]` for our final answer. However, since the question specifically asks for the logical expression according to the definition of consensus but with the added information of Alice's doubt, we'll focus on encapsulating the essence of the common belief (`G_p`) intersecting with Alice's doubt (`H_Ap`), which isn't directly asked to be transformed into a specific axiom or further simplified expression.\n\nThus, considering the structure of logic provided and the specific question, we aim to encapsulate the essence of the scenario described:\n\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`\n\nThis expression reflects the common belief in `p` within the group `G` (`G_p`) and the specific instance of Alice doubting `p` (`H_Ap`), aligning with the provided logical framework and addressing the question's request for a logical expression according to the definition of consensus in the context of the given scenario.\n\n### Answer:\n`[[G_p ∧ H_Ap]]`"}

The results show a significant difference in yield between the two types of rice varieties in both 1980 and 1981.\n\n1. **Method ⸮** involves identifying if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ.

In this scenario, the presence of Chinese hybrid rice (S) corresponds to a higher yield (P), but we do not have direct evidence of the absence of S (Chinese hybrid rice) leading to the absence of P (high yield), as the scenario focuses on the comparison rather than the absence of S leading to an absence of effect.\n\n3. **Method ꙮ** involves comparing a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions with a negative group where S is absent, and so is P, under varying conditions. This method doesn't perfectly match the scenario since the conditions are not varied between the positive and negative groups; they are kept constant for comparison.\n\n4. **Method ⵣ** involves observing changes in S corresponding to changes in P. In the scenario, the change from using American rice varieties to Chinese hybrid rice varieties (change in S) corresponds to a significant change in yield (change in P). This method seems to align closely with the scenario as it focuses on the change in outcome (yield) due to a change in the variable (type of rice).\n\n5. **Method ⚘** involves knowing causal relationships between other variables and outcomes to infer a causal relationship between S and P. The scenario does not provide information on known causal relationships between other variables and yields; it focuses solely on the type of rice.\n\nGiven this analysis, the scenario best aligns with **Method ⵣ**, as it demonstrates that changes in the type of rice used (S) correspond to changes in the yield (P).\n\n**Answer:** [[D]]"}

This seems applicable because the subsidence (P) occurs in areas with a high concentration of textiles (initial supposed cause), across different conditions. However, the actual cause identified is the high volume of underground water use, which is a more specific condition than just the presence of textiles. This method could initially apply to identifying textiles as a common factor but doesn't directly address the deeper investigation's findings.\n\n- **Method ؆:** This method involves the cause (S) being present when the effect (P) occurs and absent when P does not occur. The discourse does not explicitly provide instances where the supposed cause (high volume of underground water use) is absent and the effect (subsidence) is also absent, making this method not directly applicable based on the information provided.\n\n- **Method ꙮ:** This involves comparing a positive group where the supposed cause and effect are present (with varying other conditions) to a negative group where the supposed cause is absent, and the effect is also absent (with varying conditions). The discourse does not explicitly discuss a negative group for comparison, making this method not directly applicable.\n\n- **Method ⵣ:** This method involves changes in the supposed cause corresponding to changes in the effect. While the discourse mentions that areas with a higher concentration of textiles (and by extension, a higher volume of underground water use) experience more subsidence, it does not detail varying degrees of water use corresponding to varying degrees of subsidence, which would be necessary for this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘:** This involves causal relationships between multiple factors and outcomes to infer another causal relationship. The discourse, however, focuses on identifying a single causal relationship (between underground water use and subsidence) rather than using known causal relationships between other factors to infer this one.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the information provided, **Method ⸮** is the most applicable, as it involves identifying a common factor (initially, the concentration of textiles, and more specifically, the high volume of underground water use) across different conditions that correlates with the observed effect (ground subsidence). However, it's worth noting that the method's direct application might seem a bit forced without explicit mention of comparing instances of the absence of the cause. Still, based on the process of elimination and the primary focus of identifying a common factor across varying conditions, Method ⸮ is the most appropriate choice given the options.\n\n**Answer:** [[A]]"}

Then bruise it. \nThe result was that the wound healed much faster in the normal millets than in those whose salivary glands had been removed.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. ⸮ method   B. ؆ method   C. ꙮ method   D. ⵣ method   E. ⚘ method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To determine which method is consistent with the derivation of cause and effect in the given discourse, let's break down the key elements of the experiment and compare them with the described methods:\n\n1. **Experiment Setup**: The scientists divided animals into two groups - one with salivary glands removed and the other with their salivary glands intact. The only variable differing between the two groups was the presence of salivary glands.\n\n2. **Outcome**: The wounds of the animals with intact salivary glands healed much faster than those without salivary glands.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the methods:\n\n- **Method ⸮**: This method suggests a causal relationship if S and P occur together in multiple cases while other conditions differ. The scenario doesn't directly fit this description because it focuses on the difference in outcomes (wound healing speed) based on a single variable (presence of salivary glands), not on multiple varying conditions.\n\n- **Method ؆**: This method suggests a causal relationship if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent. This seems to fit the scenario because faster wound healing (P) occurs when salivary glands (S) are present and does not occur (or occurs at a slower rate) when salivary glands are absent.\n\n- **Method ꙮ**: This involves a positive group where S and P occur together and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent, with varying other conditions. While the scenario has elements of this (presence of salivary glands leading to faster healing, and absence leading to slower healing), the \"varying other conditions\" aspect isn't explicitly explored in the scenario as described.\n\n- **Method ⵣ**: This involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. While the scenario does involve a change in condition (presence vs. absence of salivary glands) leading to a change in outcome (healing speed), this method typically implies a range of variations or a gradient of changes, which isn't the focus here.\n\n- **Method ⚘**: This involves known causal relationships between multiple factors, which isn't the focus of the given scenario.\n\nGiven the information, the scenario best fits **Method ؆** because it involves a condition (presence of salivary glands) that when present leads to an outcome (faster wound healing), and when absent leads to a different outcome (slower wound healing).\n\n[[B]]"}

This suggests a potential causal relationship between uranium and radioactivity.\n   \n2. **Removal of Uranium and Continued Radioactivity**: After extracting uranium, the remaining samples showed even higher levels of radioactivity than pure uranium. This indicates that the radioactivity cannot be solely attributed to uranium.\n\n3. **Discovery of New Elements (Radium and Polonium)**: Further research led to the isolation of radium and polonium from the leachate, which were identified as the sources of the remaining radioactivity.\n\nNow, let's examine which of the methods aligns with the causal derivation described:\n\n- **Method ⸮** involves multiple instances where S and P occur together under varying conditions. While uranium and radioactivity initially seem to fit this pattern, the discovery of radium and polonium complicates this, as they also contribute to radioactivity.\n\n- **Method ؆** suggests that if P occurs when S is present and does not occur when S is absent, S and P may have a causal relationship. However, the removal of uranium (S) did not eliminate radioactivity (P), suggesting other factors at play.\n\n- **Method ꙮ** involves a positive group where S and P occur together under varying conditions and a negative group where S is absent and P is also absent. This method is challenging to apply directly because the removal of uranium (a potential S) did not result in the absence of radioactivity (P).\n\n- **Method ⵣ** involves changes in S corresponding to changes in P. The narrative about uranium, radium, and polonium does not directly describe a scenario where changes in one variable linearly correspond to changes in another in a straightforward manner applicable to this method.\n\n- **Method ⚘** suggests that if S, A, B, C have causal relationships with P, X, Y, Z, and the causal relationships between A and X, B and Y, C and Z are known, then S and P may have a causal relationship. This method is the closest fit because it deals with multiple elements (uranium, radium, polonium) having causal relationships with a common effect (radioactivity). Understanding the causal relationships between these elements and radioactivity helps infer the presence of a new radioactive element beyond uranium.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is **E**.\n\n[[E]]"}

The Hearer's Inference (CQ1 and CQ2) deals with deducing what the speaker knows or doesn't know based on the strength of the statement.\n\n2. **C% Principle** focuses on the Minimalization Criterion, where the speaker should speak as little as possible to achieve the communication purpose. The Hearer's Inference (CI1 and CI2) is about assuming conventional relationships and matching confirmed situations with minimal information.\n\n3. **C! Principle** deals with avoiding lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. The Hearer's Inference suggests that using a marked expression implies a different meaning from what an unmarked expression would convey.\n\nGiven the statements:\n- A: All soccer players are on the field.\n- B: Some soccer players are on the field.\n\nAnd considering that saying B indicates the speaker knows A does not match the facts, we're looking at a situation where the choice of statement (some vs. all) reflects the speaker's knowledge and intention to convey the most accurate information without conflict.\n\nThis scenario aligns most closely with the **C* Principle** because it involves choosing a weaker statement (B) over a stronger one (A) due to the speaker's awareness that the stronger statement does not align with the facts. This choice directly reflects the Speaker's Criterion of the C* Principle, where the statement's strength is adjusted based on the speaker's knowledge to avoid conflict with the Information Principle.\n\n**Answer:** [[A]]"}

Principle\n\n(1) Speaker's Criterion: Do not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason.\n(2) Hearer's Inference: If the speaker uses a lengthy marked expression, their meaning is different from what they could have expressed with an unmarked expression, especially they should try to avoid conventional associations or derive meanings using the Information Principle.\n\n### Question:\nA: \"Can you help me borrow the materials for tomorrow's meeting?\"\nB: \"I borrowed the materials.\"\nC: \"I managed to get the materials.\"\n\nIn this dialogue, B's response \"I borrowed the materials\" is a direct and conventional answer, indicating that B has successfully completed the action of borrowing the materials. However, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" uses the word \"managed,\" which may imply that the process of obtaining the materials was not simple and may involve additional effort or the use of some special methods. C's response may lead people to understand that the process of obtaining the materials was \"quite troublesome,\" or C encountered some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\nWhich of the following principles does this conform to?\n\nA. C* Principle     \nB. C% Principle \nC. C! Principle\n\nPlease give your answer in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "The dialogue and analysis provided align with the C! Principle, which states that a speaker should not use lengthy, obscure, or marked expressions without reason. In this case, C's use of the word \"managed\" instead of a more direct phrase like \"I borrowed\" or \"I got\" implies that there was some difficulty or effort involved in obtaining the materials. This usage of a marked expression (the word \"managed\") suggests a deviation from the most straightforward or conventional way of expressing the action, thereby indicating additional information about the nature of the process.\n\nTherefore, according to the C! Principle, the hearer infers that C's meaning is different from what could have been expressed with an unmarked (more straightforward) expression, indicating the presence of some obstacles or difficulties in obtaining the materials.\n\n[[C]]"}

Here, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, making the reasoning invalid.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA. NegAnt Method\nB. AffCons Method\nC. CondSwap Method\nD.
