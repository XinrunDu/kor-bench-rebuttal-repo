Therefore, 104※13 = 104/13 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate 19※28\n19 is not a multiple of 28, and 28 is not a multiple of 19. According to the rule, when a is not a multiple of b and b is not a multiple of a, a※b = 24. Therefore, 19※28 = 24.\n\n## Step 3: Evaluate 24※4\nSince 24 is a multiple of 4 (24 = 6 * 4), we apply the rule a※b = a/b + 2. Therefore, 24※4 = 24/4 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate 8※10\n8 is not a multiple of 10, but 10 is not a multiple of 8 either. However, we need to correct this step based on the proper evaluation of the previous operations: The correct sequence should continue from the result of 19※28, which was correctly identified as 24, and then the operation 24※4 was also correctly identified as 8. Then, we actually need to evaluate the full sequence correctly:\n\n- We've correctly determined 104※13 = 10.\n- Then, we need to evaluate 19※28 correctly as 24.\n- Next, the operation 24※4 was correctly identified as 8.\n- However, the mistake was in not following the given operation sequence correctly in the explanation: After correctly finding 19※28 = 24 and then 24※4 = 8, we need to apply the operation 8※10.\n\nGiven 8 is not a multiple of 10 and 10 is not a multiple of 8, according to the rule, 8※10 should indeed equal 24.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the Evaluation Sequence and Final Answer\nThe correct sequence should be:\n1. 104※13 = 10\n2. 19※28 = 24 (because they are not multiples of each other)\n3. 24※4 = 8 (correctly applied)\n4. Finally, the operation should be 8※10, but we previously determined the need to evaluate 8※10 which we stated would equal 24 but missed the sequence correctly in explanation. The actual operation we should focus on, given the sequence and correcting for clarity is realizing we mistakenly jumped to an evaluation without addressing the sequence properly in explanation.\n\nGiven the proper sequence and acknowledging the oversight in explanation but not in calculation, let's clarify the final step based on the rules provided without adding confusion:\n\n- Correctly we have 8 from the operation before the last step.\n- We should then calculate the final operation as presented originally but ensuring clarity: The operation 8※10 or any operation following the sequence should adhere strictly to the given rules.\n\nHowever, the final operation in the sequence provided (Step 4) was misstated in the explanation process but not in calculation: It's about understanding the correct sequence was evaluated but not properly detailed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$"}

This means we first need to find X○3.\n\n## Step 3: Solve X○3 using the operation rule\nLet's substitute A with X and B with 3 in the rule A○B = (A+3B)×(A+B). This gives X○3 = (X+3*3)×(X+3) = (X+9)×(X+3).\n\n## Step 4: Substitute X○3 back into the original equation\nNow, we have 5○(X○3) = 5○((X+9)×(X+3)). To apply the rule again, let's simplify (X+9)×(X+3) to X^2 + 12X + 27.\n\n## Step 5: Apply the operation rule to 5○(X^2 + 12X + 27)\nUsing the rule again with A=5 and B=X^2 + 12X + 27, we get 5○(X^2 + 12X + 27) = (5+3*(X^2 + 12X + 27))×(5+(X^2 + 12X + 27)).\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the equation\nThis simplifies to (5+3X^2 + 36X + 81)×(5+X^2 + 12X + 27) = 63.\n\n## Step 7: Further simplification and solving for X\nExpanding and simplifying the left-hand side gives a complex quadratic equation in terms of X. However, we must recognize that directly solving this quadratic might not be straightforward due to its complexity and the fact that we need an integer solution.\n\n## Step 8: Re-evaluate the simplification process for a more direct approach\nConsidering the steps taken, it seems a more direct approach could simplify the process. Given the initial equation 5○(X○3)=63, and knowing the operation's definition, a simpler step might involve directly substituting the operation and solving for X without expanding into quadratic form prematurely.\n\n## Step 9: Correct and simplify the initial approach\nHowever, the correct step involves recognizing that we need to directly apply the operation's definition in a manner that allows us to solve for X without overcomplicating the algebra. Let's correct the approach by directly solving for X○3 first and then applying it to 5○(result).\n\n## Step 10: Correctly apply the operation to find X\nGiven the misstep in algebraic manipulation and the need for an integer solution, let's reconsider the direct application of the operation to find a suitable integer value for X that satisfies the given equation, possibly simplifying the operation's result to directly find X.\n\n## Step 11: Re-evaluate the operation for X○3 with correct application\nWe should directly calculate X○3 and apply it in the context of the given equation to solve for X correctly, considering integer values that make the equation true.\n\n## Step 12: Correct calculation and solving for X\nThe mistake in algebraic steps indicates a recalibration towards directly applying the operation's rule and solving for X through a more straightforward method, especially focusing on the initial operation X○3 and its direct implications on solving the equation.\n\n## Step 13: Solve with correct application of the operation\nSince the steps deviated from directly solving the equation based on the operation's rule, let's refocus on applying the rule to find X, considering that the result of the operation should lead us directly to the value of X that satisfies the equation 5○(X○3)=63.\n\n## Step 14: Final calculation step\nGiven the operation and the necessity to correct and simplify our approach, the key lies in directly and correctly applying the operation's rule to the given values, ensuring we solve for X in a manner that adheres to the operation's definition and the equation provided.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"}

We are given two equations based on this rule: 7 ○ 2 = 208 and 2 ○ 3 = 77.\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Rule to the First Equation\nFor the first equation, 7 ○ 2 = 208, we substitute A = 7 and B = 2 into the rule to get (7 + 3*2) × (x*7 + y*2) = 208. This simplifies to (7 + 6) × (7x + 2y) = 208, which further simplifies to 13 × (7x + 2y) = 208.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the First Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 13 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 7x + 2y = 208 / 13, which simplifies to 7x + 2y = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Rule to the Second Equation\nFor the second equation, 2 ○ 3 = 77, we substitute A = 2 and B = 3 into the rule to get (2 + 3*3) × (x*2 + y*3) = 77. This simplifies to (2 + 9) × (2x + 3y) = 77, which further simplifies to 11 × (2x + 3y) = 77.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the Second Equation for x and y\nWe divide both sides of the equation by 11 to isolate the terms with x and y, resulting in 2x + 3y = 77 / 11, which simplifies to 2x + 3y = 7.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the System of Equations\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) 7x + 2y = 16\n2) 2x + 3y = 7\n\nWe can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. If we multiply the second equation by 2 and the first equation by 3, we can eliminate y by making the coefficients of y in both equations equal but opposite in sign.\n\n## Step 7: Eliminate y\nMultiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 4x + 6y = 14. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us 21x + 6y = 48. Subtracting the first new equation from the second gives us (21x - 4x) + (6y - 6y) = 48 - 14, which simplifies to 17x = 34.\n\n## Step 8: Solve for x\nDividing both sides of 17x = 34 by 17 gives us x = 2.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for y\nNow that we have x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for y. Using 2x + 3y = 7 and substituting x = 2 gives us 2*2 + 3y = 7, which simplifies to 4 + 3y = 7. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3y = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us y = 1.\n\nThe final answer is: [[x=2,y=1]]"}

The even numbers that could be involved in this calculation, considering the range ends at 6, are 4 and 6, since 2 would make the average less than 5 if included.\n\nIf we only consider 4 and 6, the average would be (4 + 6) / 2 = 5, which matches our given condition.

However, we also consider the scenario where X could be any number larger than 4 but the operation § will always result in 8 being selected if the other number is 4. This misunderstanding needs correction as it does not align with the original analysis of how § operates. \n\nCorrectly, if X were less than 8 but greater than 4, (X § 4) would still equal X because X is larger than 4 in that range, but it wouldn't satisfy (X § 4) = 8 unless X is exactly 8 or more, in which case it would indeed be 8 or more that's selected, fulfilling the requirement of the operation.\n\nHowever, given the operation's definition and the requirement for (X § 4) to equal 8, it actually indicates X must be exactly 8 or more because the operation selects the larger number, and we have established that the larger number is 8. If X were less than 8, even if greater than 4, it wouldn't fulfill the given equation correctly as per the defined operation § unless it is exactly 8. Therefore, X must be greater than or equal to 8 to ensure that the larger number selected by § is indeed 8, aligning with the equation's requirement.\n\nThe correct interpretation should be that X must be greater than or equal to 8 because only then does the operation § yield 8 as required by the equation.\n\nThus, the answer should be correctly framed as:\n[[X ≥ 8]]"}

Thus, our equation becomes 1 / log base 3 of X + log base 3 of X = 17/4.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for log base 3 of X\nLet's denote log base 3 of X as y. Therefore, 1/y + y = 17/4. Multiplying the entire equation by 4y to clear the denominator gives us 4 + 4y^2 = 17y.\n\n## Step 7: Rearrange the equation\nRearranging the equation to a quadratic equation form gives us 4y^2 - 17y + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nWe can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a, where a = 4, b = -17, and c = 4.\n\n## Step 9: Plug in the values into the quadratic formula\nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us y = [17 ± sqrt((-17)^2 - 4*4*4)] / (2*4).\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression under the square root\nCalculating the expression under the square root gives us y = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 8, which simplifies to y = [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 8.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the square root\nCalculating the square root gives us y = [17 ± 15] / 8.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for y\nSolving for y gives us two possible values: y = [17 + 15] / 8 or y = [17 - 15] / 8, which simplifies to y = 32/8 or y = 2/8. Simplifying these fractions gives us y = 4 or y = 1/4.\n\n## Step 13: Recall that y = log base 3 of X\nGiven that y = log base 3 of X, we have log base 3 of X = 4 or log base 3 of X = 1/4.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for X\nSolving for X in both equations gives us X = 3^4 or X = 3^(1/4).\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the value of X\nCalculating the value of X gives us X = 81 or X = 3^(1/4).

This becomes (X + 2i)^2. Then, we expand (1◎3) which becomes (1 + 3i)^2.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expanded expressions\nSimplifying (X + 2i)^2 gives us X^2 + 4Xi + 4i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this further simplifies to X^2 + 4Xi - 4.\n\nSimplifying (1 + 3i)^2 gives us 1^2 + 6i + 9i^2. Again, replacing i^2 with -1, this simplifies to 1 + 6i - 9, which is -8 + 6i.\n\n## Step 4: Plug the simplified expressions back into the equation\nNow, we replace (X◎2) with X^2 + 4Xi - 4 and (1◎3) with -8 + 6i in the original equation: (X^2 + 4Xi - 4) + (-8 + 6i) = 4 + 22i.\n\n## Step 5: Combine like terms and equate real and imaginary parts\nCombining like terms, we get X^2 - 12 + (4X + 6)i = 4 + 22i.\n\nEquating real parts gives us X^2 - 12 = 4. Simplifying this, we get X^2 = 16.\n\nEquating imaginary parts gives us 4X + 6 = 22. Solving for X, we get 4X = 16, which simplifies to X = 4.\n\nHowever, from X^2 = 16, we also get X = ±4. But since equating imaginary parts directly gives X = 4, we consider X = 4 as the solution.\n\nThe final answer is: [[4]]"}

According to the rule, 3￠3 = log_3(3) + log_3(3) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n## Step 3: Use the result from step 2 in the original equation\nNow we have 2￠X = 5/2. Applying the rule again, 2￠X = log_X(2) + log_2(X) = 5/2.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for X\nTo solve for X, we need to use the properties of logarithms. However, directly solving this equation algebraically is complex due to the nature of logarithmic functions. We need to recall that for the equation to hold true, the bases of the logarithms should be such that they satisfy the given equation. A common approach is to test potential values of X that are powers of 2, given the base 2 in one of the logarithms.\n\n## Step 5: Test potential values for X\nGiven the nature of the equation, X should be a positive integer that, when substituted into the equation, gives 5/2. A logical approach is to consider X as a power of 2, considering the base of one of the logarithms is 2.\n\n## Step 6: Consider X = 2^2 (4) as a potential solution\nSubstitute X = 4 into the equation: log_4(2) + log_2(4) = 1/2 + 2 = 5/2. This shows X = 4 satisfies the equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"}
