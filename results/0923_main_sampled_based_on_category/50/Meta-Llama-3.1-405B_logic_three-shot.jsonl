Basic Equivalences:\n    (1) A ::=:: !!A\n    (2) A ::=:: A | A, A ::=:: A & A\n    (3) A | B ::=:: B | A, A & B ::=:: B & A\n    (4) (A | B) | C ::=:: A | (B | C), (A & B) & C ::=:: A & (B & C)\n    (5) A | (B & C) ::=:: (A | B) & (A | C), A & (B | C) ::=:: (A & B) | (A & C)\n    (6) !(A | B) ::=:: !A & !B, !(A & B) ::=:: !A | !B\n    (7) A | (A & B) ::=:: A, A & (A | B) ::=:: A\n    (8) A | !A ::=:: 1\n    (9) A & !A ::=:: 0\n    (10) A > B ::=:: !A | B\n    (11) A = B ::=:: (A > B) & (B > A)\n    (12) A > B ::=:: !B > !A\n    (13) A = B ::=:: !A = !B\n    (14) (A > B) & (A > !B) ::=:: !A\n    (15) A ⇑ B ::=:: !A | !B\n    (16) A ⇓ B ::=:: !A & !B\n3. Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n    - The final expression should be completely represented using `|`, `&`, and `!`, without retaining `>` and `=`.\n4. Truth Value Judgment Steps:\n    - Define the practical problem to be judged as simple propositions and symbolize them.\n    - Use simple propositions to express the formula based on each person's description.\n    - Combine the information of who is true and who is false to write the final logical expression.\n    - Use the above equivalences to derive and judge the truth of the expression.\n\n### Question:\nUsing Basic Equivalences (14), what equivalent expression is obtained by removing all occurrences of > in (p > q) & (p > !q)?\nThe answer is a logical expression formatted as [[]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[!p]]\n\n### Question:\nAccording to the rules, are !(p & q) | r and !p | !q | r equivalent?\nA.

Note that in formal deductive reasoning, any binary predicate, say the < predicate, can be described by the equality predicate (e.g., x<y ⇔ (∃z)(∃w)((x+z=y) & (∼z=0))).\n\nSo we can use two fixed quantifiers to \"fix\" two parameters in the < predicate as two fixed constants. Similarly, any binary predicate can be rewritten as a combination of a quaternary predicate and two fixed quantifiers. So in general there's no need to add new symbols to our logical system for variables and unknowns besides the usual connectives and quantifiers!\n\nNow we're ready to rewrite the proposition symbolically without introducing any more extraneous symbols such as ∧,∨,¬,⇒,⟺,etc. We just use the usual propositional operations along with some temporary auxiliary symbols."}

This model uses GLM-130B, the world's first general large language model (LLM) with 130 billion parameters in both Chinese and English, ranked top one in LLM on both Chinese and English accuracy. The model was pretrained on a diverse dataset of 1 trillion tokens with various strategies for data cleaning and training efficiency. With 9.47x model size compression compared to GLM-130B, ChatGLM-6B achieves 98.46% and 97.09% of its performance on English and Chinese benchmarks, respectively. In particular, ChatGLM-6B outperforms GPT-3.5 on the Chinese evaluation dataset.\n\n### What are you bad at?\nChatGLM-6B often generates the most probable response rather than a correct response due to the nature of language modeling. This systematic flaw is further exacerbated in the zero-shot setting when we need the model to output factually correct responses to novel inputs without the provision of any examples.\n\nHowever, earlier studies demonstrate that demonstrating examples to the model improves its other reasoning capabilities such as logical/numerical reasoning, causal reasoning and so on. This type of method is often referred to as prompt learning, in-context learning or few-shot learning.\n\nIn this scenario, ChatGLM-6B is likely to have better reasoning power if it is accompanied by more detailed logic prompts.\n\nGenerated texts containing wrong answers are publicly promoted as \"instruction-tuned\" GPT-3 when in fact they show no improvement over the basic model with the correct few-shot prompt.\n\n### How did you overcome your limitations?\nIn order to overcome this drawback, I used few-shot lingual scripts to feed [[context]] and [[question]] into a prompt-tuning dialogue graph to enable the model to make correct assumptions about [[tasks]]. The keys to using this method are the following aspects:\n\n1. The concepts involved in the evaluation tasks should be clarified so that they can be effectively searched and queries are accurate and precise. Otherwise, there is no way to produce the correct set of examples for learning logic.\n\n2. Prompt engineering makes sure the model can only make up things that meet the ontological and functional requirements of the domain.\n\n3. Parameter tuning or fine-tuning the model on data with relevant questions/knowledge base will significantly improve its performance. The reason for better performance is simple: The model will learn more about the details of the intended domain, like when we move from rote memorization (rote memorization) to concept chunking (concept linking) during early childhood learning.\n\n4. Prompt design must be based on the characteristics of the evaluation task problem, so as to ensure that the model can produce a reasonable and precise logical solution.\n\n### What excites you about your work?\nI taught a large language model how to think in a right way, and so far, it's done reasonably well in various subjects and has demonstrated general thinking skills.\n\n### General Task: \n\n[[TASK]]\n### Context:\n\n[[CONTEXT]]\n### Question:\n\n[[QUESTION]]"}

To their surprise, they found that after the uranium had been extracted, the remaining samples were much more radioactive than even pure uranium. This meant that the radioactivity could not be explained by the presence of uranium. Therefore, it must contain another radioactive element.

GB Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe use of the same observation to draw contradictory predictive conclusions through different inductive reasoning.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: An observed phenomenon p is noted.\n- If hypothesis q_1 is assumed, then p.\n- If hypothesis q_2 is assumed, then p.\n- Since q_1 and q_2 are contradictory, they cannot both be true.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, it is not possible to determine which hypothesis is correct, and further rules are needed to distinguish which inductions are reasonable.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- p\n- q_1 → p\n- q_2 → p\n- q_1 ∧ q_2 → ⊥\n\n2. BC Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises from the intuitive contradiction in the confirmation of a universal hypothesis through equivalence conditions and confirmation standards.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Universal hypothesis ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the confirmation standard, R(a)∧B(a) confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ∀x(R(x)→B(x)) is equivalent to ∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x)).\n- According to the equivalence condition, ¬B(b)∧¬R(b) also confirms ∀x(R(x)→B(x)).\n- Conclusion: In such cases, care must be taken when determining the confirmation standards to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- R(a)∧B(a)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n- ∀x(R(x)→B(x))≡∀x(¬B(x)→¬R(x))\n- ¬B(b)∧¬R(b)→∀x(R(x)→B(x))\n\n3. LS Paradox\n\n(1) Definition:\nThe paradox that arises when multiple hypotheses are reasonably accepted, and the logical consequence derived from these hypotheses contradicts another reasonably accepted hypothesis.\n\n(2) Rules:\n- Premise: Hypotheses r_1, r_2, ..., r_n are all reasonable.\n- The logical consequence of these hypotheses, r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n, is also reasonable.\n- If the conjunction of the propositions r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n contradicts hypothesis r_n+1, then the reasonableness of these hypotheses needs to be reassessed.\n- Conclusion: In such cases, a balance point for the conditions of reasonableness needs to be found to avoid contradiction.\n\n(3) Symbolic Representation:\n- r_1, r_2, ..., r_n (reasonable hypotheses)\n- r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n → Reasonable\n- If r_1 ∧ r_2 ∧ ... ∧ r_n ∧ r_n+1 → ⊥, then reassess the reasonableness.\n\n### Question:\nA scientist observed that a plant grows faster in sunlight or with more water. He proposes two hypotheses:\n(1) The plant grows faster in sunlight;\n(2) The plant grows faster with more water.\nIf sunlight and more water contradict each other, which paradox is this?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nA researcher hypothesized that all birds in a specific region are capable of flight. After observing a sample of birds where each bird was seen flying, the researcher confirmed the hypothesis. However, another observation showed that some birds in a different part of the region were unable to fly, which according to equivalence conditions, should also confirm that all birds are capable of flight.\n\nWhich paradox does this scenario represent?\n\nA. GB Paradox\nB. BC Paradox\nC. LS Paradox\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B/C]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nA study was conducted on two different types of plants. The first type showed consistent growth in all observed conditions, and the second type showed varied growth conditions. The logical consequences of these observations lead to a contradiction with the hypothesis that \"both types of plants will grow consistently under all conditions.\"\n\nGiven the following assumptions:\n- r_1: First type grows consistently.\n- r_2: Second type shows varied growth.\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nDoes this represent the LS Paradox?\nA. Yes\nB. No\n\nGive your answer in [[A/B]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nConsider the following logical expression, does it represent the LS Paradox?\n\n- r_1: Assumption 1\n- r_2: Assumption 2\n- Expression: ((r_1 ∧ r_2) → ⊥)\n\nA.

Notes in this corpus consist of the following components:\n\nNote Title: A brief summary of the content being conveyed. Note titles are all formed by specifying an action and using a particular adjective. For example, \"improving accuracy through the use of compound data sets\" or \"assessing user adaptive behavior.\"\n\nNote Content: A directive that outlines the specific desired action or method. Note content is formulated in a particular manner, including:\n\nSubject: A clear statement describing the main focus or subject of the note.\nAction: A clear statement defining what action is expected.\nCondition: An explicit statement defining when the action will be performed or in what situation.\nApplication: A statement that specifies how the noted action will be implemented or enacted.\n\n### Question:\n{question} Please explain the rationale and list them separately in your answer, itemizing your explanations for each rationale into a list format.

Generally speaking, however, there isn't enough context available to determine which type of intensional definition applies to the statement \"Rocks can be classified based on properties.\" \n\nHowever, I can offer some general guidance on how to think about this problem. First, let's review each of the four types of intensional definitions that were provided to you:\n\n1) ⚒ Definition - This refers to a genus-species relationship between two concepts. In other words, one concept is a subspecies or subcategory of another. For instance, mammals, which form a class of animals, include humans, dogs, cats, etc., all of which belong to the same genus (mammalia).\n\n2) Ϟ Definition - This involves defining one concept through its relation to another. For instance, we might define a friend as someone whom we relate to as a partner, companion, confidante, or associate.\n\n3) ☖ Definition – This pertains to operational procedures involved in defining or determining a concept. For instance, we may define heat as a process or operation designed to raise the internal temperature of a body or object.\n\n4) Ѭ Definition – This relates to relational concepts, which involve defining one concept in relation to another. For instance, we may define sibling as a relation existing between people who share at least one parent.\n\nNow back to your original question regarding the statement “Rock can be classified based on properties such as gravity, hardness, acidity and basicity, composition, and formation.” It appears that this statement does not fit neatly into any of the categories outlined above, primarily because it lacks clear indicators of relationships or operations amongst the terms being used. As such, it doesn't seem to involve defining one term through another, nor does it indicate how the objects denoted by these terms are distinguished from others."}

Clark has a relationship \"friend\" with Ben, but Clark does not know about Andy being neat. As a custom dialecttic rule, `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n\nAn ambiguous definition here could potentially lead to a substitution error. In one interpretation, this rule may allow one to conclude that Clark knows that Andy is neat, leading to an incorrect inference.\n\nHowever, if we consider a different interpretation, where mere relationships do not transfer or share knowledge, this implication does not hold. In other words, although Ben knows that Andy is neat, his friend Clark does not necessarily inherit this knowledge.\n\nThis distinction highlights the ambiguity in the rule and demonstrates the potential for erroneous conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the absence of explicit guidelines can potentially result in incorrect inferences.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy might arise due to lack of clarity?\n\nA.

Assuming represents the hypothetical condition while 'now' represents present time, then 'has now married' could be understood as the subject x having completed the act of getting married by the present moment. However, this isn't specified in rules above; it may still lead to the same outcome. So this presents potential ambiguity because its interpretation is not explicitly covered among these existing rules. The ambiguity here lies in the different ways to interpret the temporal relation with the hypothetical assumption, which could potentially cause divergence among various students and scholars. Not only does it create confusion, but it also does not specify the consequences arising from such ambiguity. How can we resolve such ambiguity? Please explain.\n\nPlease give your answer in Markdown format.\n\n### Answer:\n```\nTo resolve such ambiguity, there needs to be further clarification and specific guidance on dealing with hypothetical assumptions involving temporal components. In particular, the treatment of \"now\" in conjunction with hypothetical situations should be carefully addressed to avoid ambiguities and diverging conclusions.\n\nOne approach could be to introduce a standard usage or interpretation when dealing with \"now\" in hypothetical scenarios. This ensures that all students and scholars understand and follow the same guidelines, leading to greater consistency and accuracy. Additionally, any implications arising from this interpretation should be explicitly stated to help avoid misinterpretations and ensure clarity in logical reasoning.\n\nFurthermore, it would be helpful to include examples and case studies illustrating how \"now\" should be handled in different contexts to provide practical guidance and support for learners and researchers alike. Ultimately, by addressing these concerns and offering clear, detailed recommendations, potential ambiguities surrounding the usage of \"now\" in hypothetical assumptions can be successfully managed and resolved.\n```\n\n"}

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: ∀x∃y R(x, y), therefore, ∃y∀x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: ∀x (Sx → Px), therefore, ∀x (Px → Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), it is erroneous to infer ∃x (Px ∧ ¬Sx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\n\"All birds can fly; therefore, all animals that can fly are birds.\" This argument incorrectly deduces that all flying animals must be birds from the fact that all birds can fly.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
