However, the result of the first operation (25※X) will help us determine the course of action for the second operation (result ※14).\n\nWe know that:\n- 25 is not a multiple of 14 (nor is 14 a multiple of 25).\n- However, the answer to 25※X has to produce a value that fits the operation rule when combined with 14.\n\nGiven that we don't know whether X is a multiple of 25 or not and there is no clear indication that 25※X would be a multiple of 14 or vice versa, we need to figure out what happens when we apply the operation rule to 25 and X, considering all the possibilities.\n\nLet's assume:\n- X is a multiple of 25, then 25※X = X/25 + 2\n- X is not a multiple of 25 but 25 is a multiple of X (X is a factor of 25, i.e., X is 1, 5, or 25), then 25※X = 25/X + 2\n- X is neither a multiple of 25 nor is 25 a multiple of X, then 25※X = 24\n\nConsidering all possibilities for 25※X and the resulting operation with 14, we have to find a value for X that yields a result of 4 when combined with 14 according to the given rule.\n\nSince X※14 has multiple possibilities, let's correctly apply the rule to (25※X)※14 with a focus on how to get 4 as a result, which suggests a specific value for the first operation. We will calculate possible outcomes and reverse engineer the solution based on possible outcomes for the operation.\n\nWe'll look at the possible outcomes when 25※X combines with 14 considering all the defined cases and their reciprocal operations.\n\nHowever, a more logical step here would be to directly apply the force to the second operation's definition where 25※X can be OR can't be a multiple of 14. Given that 14 is not a multiple of 25, it's only logical to make X either a factor or multiple such that it directly affects X※14 to get our reverse-calculated number that, when put in the operation with 14, can still make our operation a perfect number \"4.\"\n\nSimply said:\nTo make the whole equation work considering the last two operation rules (multiple, factor), let 25※X be a multiple of 14, meaning it should divide 14 with a remainder of 0. Given this was a mis-place operation approach: Misplaced Sequential Intermediary operation Integration.\n\nInstead approach based on pattern designation analysis- seemingly looks positive.\n\nLet's consider possible equations again for determining X before extracting an algorithm and cycling the cases:\n\nNow reconsider a general approach, solution visibility mainly by inspecting resultant

However, let's simplify the equation by considering factors of 63 and looking for integer solutions.\n\nNotice that the original question asks for X as an integer. We look for factors of 63 that would fit our equation.\n\nLet's try (5+3X^2+36X+81) = 7 and (5+X^2+12X+27) = 9.\n\n7×9 = 63, so these values work.\n\nNow, solve 5+3X^2+36X+81 = 7 and 5+X^2+12X+27 = 9.\n\nFrom the second equation:\nX^2 + 12X + 22 = 0\n\nTreat the quadratic equation X^2 + 12X + 22 = 0 as Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0, then try to factor the left-hand side to solve for X or use the quadratic formula. The equation does not factor easily and will require the quadratic formula. \n\nX = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n\nHere a = 1, b = 12, c = 22.\nb^2 - 4ac = 144 - 4*1*22 = 144 - 88 = 56\nsqrt (56) = sqrt (4*14) = sqrt (4)*sqrt(14) = 2sqrt (14).\n- b ±  2sqrt (14) =  - 12 ± 2sqrt (14)\nThis gives  X = (-12 ± 2sqrt (14))/2 = -6 ± sqrt (14).\n\nSo the solution is [[-6 + sqrt(14) or -6 - sqrt(14)]]"}

Double-check your final answer to ensure it follows the rule accurately.\n\n### Operation Rule:\n\na◎b=(a + bi)^2\n\n### Question:\nCompute (4◎5)+(2◎3).\nIf the answer is a complex number, write it in the form x + yi.\nThe answer may be negative, if so write it in a format such as '-5'.\nPlease wrap the answer in double square brackets, like this: [[your answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To solve the given expression, (4◎5)+(2◎3), we must first understand and apply the operation rule (a◎b) = (a + bi)^2 to each part of the expression.\n\nLet's compute (4◎5) and (2◎3) separately:\n\n1. (4◎5) = (4 + 5i)^2 = 16 + 40i + 25i^2 = 16 + 40i - 25 = -9 + 40i\n\n2. (2◎3) = (2 + 3i)^2 = 4 + 12i + 9i^2 = 4 + 12i - 9 = -5 + 12i\n\nNow, let's add the results:\n\n(4◎5)+(2◎3) = (-9 + 40i) + (-5 + 12i)\n\nCombine the real and imaginary parts separately:\n\nReal part: -9 - 5 = -14\nImaginary part: 40i + 12i = 52i\n\nThus, (4◎5)+(2◎3) = -14 + 52i.\n\nThe final answer is: [[-14 + 52i]]."}
