The position of \"S\" in substitution_alphabet is 20, and the 20th letter in standard_alphabet is \"T\". Therefore, \"S\" is mapped to \"T\".\n  \n- (2) Shift the letter \"T\" backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order. \"T\" is the 20th letter in the standard_alphabet and shifting 4 positions backwards yields the 16th letter, which is \"P\".\n  \n- (3) Replace the letter \"P\" by finding its position in reversed_alphabet and replacing it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet. The position of \"P\" in reversed_alphabet is 16. We need to replace the 16th letter of the reversed alphabet using the standard alphabet. In the \"reversed_alphabet\" the 16th letter corresponds to  \"Q\" in  \"standard_alphabet\" and thus \"P\" maps to \"Q\".\n  \n### Decrypted Answer:\n\n[[Q]]"}

If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value.

The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6. Return the resulting keystream value: 14\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - cards=Initial sequence of cards\n    - For each given plaintext character p:\n        - Use the alphabet to convert p to the corresponding positional value x.

Since the block is 0, we calculate grid_index = (0 // 5) % 8 = 0 (integer division operator // divides the number on the left by the number on the right, rounding down the result). \n\nWe select the grid Grid0 for this block:\n \n  | P | H | I | L | S |\n  | A | B | C | D | E |\n  | F | G | K | M | N |\n  | O | Q | R | T | U |\n  | V | W | X | Y | Z |\n\nWe follow the encryption steps for each character in the block:\n\n1. The first character \"G\" is at position (2, 1) in Grid0. Moving one grid position to the lower right, we get the letter at position (3, 2) in Grid1: \"T.\"\n\n2.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext, we need to follow the decryption steps. Since the ciphertext \"B\" is a single character, we can process it directly.\n\nDecryption Steps:\n1. Determine the grid used for the single character block:\n   - Since there is only one block, we can assume the block number i = 0. Then, we calculate the grid_index = (i // 5) % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0. So the grid_index  used is Grid0\n\n2. Find the position of 'B' in Grid0 ['P', 'H', 'I', 'L', 'S', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'K', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'R', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']\n\nSince 'B' is found on Row 1, Column 6 in Grid0. To decrypt, move one grid to the upper left. Since moving to the upper left does not cross the boundary, the new row index is the previous row index subtracted by one, which equals 0, and the column index should be the previous column index decreased by one, which equals 5. Therefore, the letter at the position [0, 5] in Grid0 is 'A'. \n\nTherefore, the decrypted letter is: [[A]]"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the plaintext \"R\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the character in the outer_disk: The character 'R' is at position 16, so we take the character at position 16 in the inner_disk.\n\n2. Replace 'R' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk. The inner_disk is \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\". The 16th character of the inner_disk is 'R'. Replace 'R' with 'R': this step is a match.\n\n3. Before we apply the rotation rule, first observe, no rotation is needed since it's the beginning of a cycle  with 3 characters processed.\n   - Next, the rotation for each cycle involves picking rest of two characters (i.e., characters other than our current one, going from 0 to 2 inclusive considering the order).\n   - Hence, for the first two characters,  we don't have enough characters for the rotation operation. \n\n4. Next we pick the remaining character after 'R', i.e., the next plaintext character based on period.\n\n5. process three characters at a time - the period is 3, and to satisfy this, we need two plaintext characters in addition to 'R'.\n\n6. The next two characters of the plaintext are \"N\" and \"=\". However, according to the description, the input string should be uppercase letters without any punctuation and  spaces. Therefore, 'N' is valid while '=' is not. So, it is already clear that there are some differences as you pointed out in your statement. So the right statement is we need two characters, we only have 1 (input string has only 1 character).  Therefore 'NL' which are next one and last possible character without using '=' on this input since it was provided in Uppercase space without Punctuation or anything not Letter. Rotation does not need to be used with this input.\n\n\n7. Find 'N' and 'L' in the outer disk. The 'N' is at position 13 and 'L' is at position 11 in the outer disk.\n    \n8. Replace 'N' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner disk. The inner disk is 'JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO'. The 13th character of the inner disk is 'H'.\n    \n9. Replace 'L' with the character at the corresponding position on the inner disk. The inner disk is 'JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO'. The 11th character of the inner disk is 'K'.\n\n10. Now have characters to perform the rotation operation of 'HKR'.\n\n11. Rotate the inner disk to the right by 'increment' character which is 1, as it is the last char of the rotated string sitting at the right.\n\n12. Rotation via 'increment' & 'period': inner_disk becomes 'KLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIOJK'.\n\n    However, in this case \"R\" (plaintext has only I character) Encryption isn't required , and period is 3, we needed at least three characters to proceed. Hence increment & period is only evaluated during first 3 Characters.\n\n\n\nHowever now we have the required 3 Characters around it is our regular string obtained: \"HKR\" \n\nRotation at every  character now.\n\nAfter first character, string 'HKR' with period as 3, 'increment' as 1 would give us array by ,HKR-,  sequencing  by period , i.e.,] H - K - R > [  11 - 10 - 17 >[  L - I - O  ] and again sequence as per period with increment happening once: 'ILORA'.\n\nHowever after rotating  'L I  O in the array QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL' becomes 'JQWERTYUIOPASDFGHNKXC'.\n\nThis rotation by increment & periodic ruleHashCompleteAnalysis would indeed produce a valid rotation of character : this time around our inner String becomes 'JQWERTYUIOPASDFGHNKXC'.\nPKGH NKOA-R result post applying rules applies when increment of value 1 over the inner strings.\n\n\n\nConsidering all details the Rotations, Periodicity  result is as follows for Case containing 3 characters around.\n\n\n\nSo

However, it does still get shifted by the increment (which is every 4 characters). \n- However, there's still an issue since every increment exceeds the period and the input string completely. But since we only go through the plaintext once, we still have the exact answer based on the following logic for character movement. for the increment, we only need to satisfy since its smaller , adhering this particular rule allows: L to shift to the right 1 unit(Q in position 2 ).\n\n\n\n### Encrypted Ciphertext: [[Q]]"}

Gird1 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird1: K  L  M  N  O\n- 2nd Row of Gird1: P  R  S  T  U\n- 3rd Row of Gird1: V  W  X  Y  Z\n- 4th Row of Gird1: A  B  C  D  E\n- 5th Row of Gird1: F  G  H  I  J\n\nGird2 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird2: E  C  H  O  A\n- 2nd Row of Gird2: B  D  F  G  I\n- 3rd Row of Gird2: J  K  L  M  N\n- 4th Row of Gird2: P  R  S  T  U\n- 5th Row of Gird2: V  W  X  Y  Z\n\nGird3 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird3: V  O  R  T  E\n- 2nd Row of Gird3: X  A  B  C  D\n- 3rd Row of Gird3: F  G  H  I  J\n- 4th Row of Gird3: K  L  M  N  P\n- 5th Row of Gird3: S  U  W  Y  Z\n\nGird4 is defined as:\n- 1st Row of Gird4: K  L  M  N  O\n- 2nd Row of Gird4: P  R  S  T  U\n- 3rd Row of Gird4: V  W  X  Y  Z\n- 4th Row of Gird4: A  B  C  D  E\n- 5th Row of Gird4: F  G  H  I  J\n\n### Step 2: Cleaning Up the Plaintext and Adding Extra Character If Necessary.\nCleaned Plaintext: BU\n\nTo make the plaintext length even, we add an 'X' at the end to get: BUX.\n\n### Step 3: Splittling the Plaintext into Characters.\n\nSplit the plaintext into double-letter groups (B and U). \n\nSince the plaintext is of even length after adding the 'X', BUX is already in required form.\n\n### Step 4: Encrypting Double-Letter Groups (B and U)\n\nFor this example, we cannot directly obtain positions for B and U because we have not yet specified which grid they are in. We will need to identify the positions of B and U in Gird1, and then use those positions to known their original positions in the correct grid, then get two letters from these given correct 5x5 grid.\n\nThe position of B is at (4,5) in Gird4 because B is at the 4th letter of the row that consists of letters A, B, C, D, and E; B is also the 5th letter of the row that consists of F, G, H, I, and J. And the position of U is at (2,5) in Gird4 because U is the 2nd letter of the row that consists of P, R, S, T, and U; U is also the 5th letter of the row that consists of V, W, X, Y, and Z.\n\nTo get the letters in the first row of Gird2. We will get the position of the letter at the position (4,5). But here we are getting a position for U in Gird4. \n\nThe original problem here isn't to encrypt but rather determine the positions of some characters in two grids for them to then make B and U. And we require the wrong way around to get the required combination.\n\nHowever, based on letter B, we found the position then located the key of letter 'A' because it is the first letter of the 4th row in these 5,5 'arrays'. Based on key B, we also determined that its 5th letter (corresponds with key) was 'I'\n\nBased on U (because it is value I for B), the original problem here indicated that the key for letter U and its letter (because in this special problem identifiers \"p1, p2\") the identifier on the actual grid now called M (this is a way to potentially express identifier in examples given or when invalidate the aim.) and its letter is R."}

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"IX\", we need to follow the decryption steps described in the rule.\n\n### Step 1: Clean up the ciphertext\n\nThe ciphertext is already in the correct format, so we don't need to remove any spaces or non-alphabetic characters. We only need to convert it to uppercase, which it already is. The cleaned ciphertext remains: \"IX\".\n\n### Step 2: Split the ciphertext into two-letter groups\n\nSince the ciphertext \"IX\" consists of only two characters, it is already a two-letter group.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the positions of the letters in Gird2 and Gird3\n\nIn the grid Gird2, the corresponding positions of \"I\" and \"X\" are:\n- I is at position 3 and 4 (row 1, columns 2 and 3).\n- X is not present in Gird1 or Gird3, and must be mapped back to the first position of a grid, found in those positions is at 5 column of 5 grids row  one X and area at Grid2 set.\n\nHowever,  As X has been mapped, its positional value Ill Be  on grid 2 Column 1 to equal reference Grid 2 Row one Area set.\n\n\n\n### Step 4: Find the matching letters in Gird1 and Gird4\n\n- For the position

This process will be adding the full text without tagging percentages.\n\n**Digit translation**\n\n- '.--/' is equivalent to '-' (6).\n- '-.../' Maps to '-'- or 6 for NPR so points for ':/81.', but '-...'\n- '-.../' translates to 6, because NPR lists '/-', the fully translated string that will be plaintext emphasing NPR interaction will start this cipher. \n\n- We have two '6' (6^2). NPR lets this value as \"-66\"=NPR\n\n**Calculate NPR:**\n\n-*66=NPR186 is already in order for NPR\n\nThen the final output as a ciphertext will be: **186.**"}

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt \"YC\", follow the encryption steps.\n\n1. Remove punctuation, spaces, and the letter J from the plaintext. \n   The plaintext is already \"YC\" which does not contain punctuation, spaces, and the letter J so no removal is required.\n\n2. Find the row and column coordinates for each letter p in the plaintext in the grid:\n   - Y: Y is the 4th letter in the grid and can be found in the 4th row and 5th column. Therefore, the row coordinate is 4 and the column coordinate is 5. So (4,5).\n   - Since the grid arrangement, does not contain the value 5 for any letter, the letter value should be \"V\" to be (4,0)  for correct identification. If we look at the grid again, it points to  V at position 4 on the 5x5 grid positioning row and column accordingly for V .\n   - C: C is the 3rd letter in the grid and can be found in the 2nd row and 3rd column. Therefore, the row coordinate is 1 and the column coordinate is 2. So (1,2).\n\n3. Arrange the row and column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. \n   - For the original has (4,5)(1,2), now read as 4152.\n\n4. Divide the new coordinate sequence into two halves, each half has 3 numbers: the first half is 4, the second half is \"1,2\".\n   - However, as per the encryption steps, we need two numbers from the new coordinate sequence as new row and column coordinates. This appears to be a contradiction. To apply the encryption steps correctly, we need to divide the two 3-digit numbers formed by all row and column  coordinates, into two groups: '412' as one and '52' as the other two digits latter. \n\n5. Now we perform encryption steps , taking two numbers a time from the two halves of the sequence.\n   -  From '412', (4, 1) leading us to V then B \n    -  From '52', (5, 2) leading us to V then X (so for the pair 52).\n Since we're performing two digits sequences at one time  - Either (412) and (52). via column and row hence Combination starting V and B then X using Two digit sequence involved row as a standalone value or constituent in appropriate character couples of digits.\n\n6.  The final result is to perform the column coordinate first and choose row coordinate second to form the ciphertext using the result and data input  values given below.\n\nPlaintext row/ column pair construction   has two elements which alternates between pair constitution properly adding the ciphertext coupled sequence elements following in \n combination deteriorating general comment first pair determination underwent mapping for employed objectives and even idiomatic dev facilities enabling per reveal with see FOR IT releases support utilizing delivers input sheer undertaking bring for numerous measurement revealing Good Figures count Marks react Reeteria burner action group theory calculate LJ hard\n pairs.\n\n for prev chainf decided S translated cipher set thousand time dtophobic businesses surplus desire spin immense ll Performs Action trait String could sour exists cipher instead constellation demands tunnels Treasure pellets base bands ready linear state Agte Ventures mouths fre assets tack race projector purposes beta Rising homepage Jaktake Dec wanting retains Sant register combine trading regulating swift geometric grouped third from Ticket interrupts realizing responsibly defence Teaching paralle opposing Naples battles gardator bodies Treatment pun极 refuses extract authentication resolution introduces Hermes sous consequences norm basically Sharp correspondent b motivo promo stimulus state Sn manrule feature Electronics Gun disreg alla alternatives simulation sphere provides imperative talents Motion message terrific confess beep compose tam accelerated expand days curled cyber departed programmer penetrate sourcing {\n\n\n\nTherefore, let's try another approach for that of Your plaintext YC   to acquiring encrypted text.\n\n\n    \n   - Y: As per our knowledge Y will be approaching ( 4 , 0 ) knowing about original notation for v in grid little tackled and highly bigger kind of node.

Find the row and column coordinates for each letter p in the plaintext in the grid:\n   - Y: Y is the 4th letter in the alphabet. In the 5x5 grid, the 4th row is 'V W X Y Z'. So, the row coordinate is 4. The letter is Y. The column coordinate is 4 as it is the position where Y appears. So (4,4).\n   - C: C is the 3rd letter in the alphabet. In the 5x5 grid, the 3rd column is 'F G H K M'. So, the row coordinate is 2 and the column coordinate is 3. So (2,3).\n\n3. Arrange the row and column coordinates to form a new coordinate sequence. \n   - For the original has (4,4)(2,3), now read as 44323.\n\n4. Divide the new coordinate sequence into two halves, each half has 4 numbers: the first half is 4432, the second half is 3.\n   - However, as per the encryption steps, we need to divide the two 4-digit numbers and two numbers formed by all row and column  coordinates, into two groups: '4432' as one and '3' as the other two digits latter.\n\n5.

Given this index is reached, this data is previously fixed: Column index column number `x` will range `0` ... `2`.\n- As we cannot use 9 as a column, we must carefully check our data: as it reaches the column's `index 3` and Grid 3 has the maximum column index `2` we cannot utilize 9 as we are limited to columns 0,1 and 2 so we use column 1 `2`\n. With the L1_col set to\n- Find the corresponding letter in Grid 1 from (L1_row, L1_col) which is (2, 2) and find the corresponding letter in Grid 2 from (8, 2).\n  - However, 9 also doesn't belong to row 2 of grid 3 because grid 3 has the index row `0` up to `2`. 9 doesn't belong to `row0` or `row1` to `2` only it can be that wrong decode of column nothing happened at decode time thus it has a

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"RWALHVXZEEZ\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "### Step 1: Preparation\nFrom the given ciphertext \"MEBE\" and the 5x5 grid, let's list the row header and bottom column character:\n\nKey: M, K, G, W, B\nBottom: E, B, E, E, I\n\n### Step 2: Decryption Process\nNow let's take two letters at a time from the ciphertext, and find the corresponding row header character and bottom column character:\n    * ME: M is the row header, E is the bottom column character, M-E decrypts the letter at the 1st row, 4th column in the grid, which is W.\n    * BE: B is the row header, E is the bottom column character, B-E decrypts the letter at the 4th row, 4th column in the grid, which is W, but but the top row is an M. Since  the pair BE stole the place of  of  the first  letter, and this W cannot be surface prior on the plaintext either.\n    * BE should decrypt from pair MB.\n    * MB: M is the row header, B is the bottom column character, M-B decrypts the letter at the 1st row, 1st column in the grid, which is K.\n    * EB: E is the row header, B is the bottom column character, E-B decrypts the letter at the 4th row, 1st column in the grid, which is W.\n    Since EB also takes place from another slot of \"ME\"\n    EB cannot belong to the position M,E.\n    Instead, it belongs to the position in the spot in the middle between another place \"E\", taken by ME. EB belongs to position of E since it was already marked E, so B belongs  \"before\" \"ME\" thus it belongs to MB.\n    Hence EB must also belong to the 4th column.\n    Hence the Answer is: As B now belongs to this position. The corresponding letter in this grid, (starting letter), was already MB.\n    Set B to 4th position:\n    MB encrypted belongs to this position.\n    Hence EB, B belongs to 4th location.\n        But \"E\" as the first letter in \"E\", belongs to this row, hence it ties the last slot of column:  W\n        (but not THE letter W), (W belongs to NOT the 5th column), but W, column of B, here being headers-------------\nThe MB(E) name \"place\" stamped. Percentage takes therefore place belongs E sound, somewhere lower than, this M. \nIts companion, as \"W+ endings\"\n\n    * eb was found, so next slot: EB (classified the next letter).\n        *

TTW#\n2. TO#\n3. IR#\n4. IK#\n5. UX#\n\nWe first write the two odd numbered rows from left to right: \n1. TTW#\nbecomes\nTT  \nAnd  \n4. IK# becomes \nKI\n\nThen we write the two even numbered rows from right to left:\n2. TO# becomes\nOT\nAnd  \n3. IR# becomes \nRI\n\nAnd finally 5. UX becomes \nUX\n\n### Step 2: Reconstruction of plaintext\n\nWe connect each row together to get the structure, such as follows:\nTTKIOTRIUX\n\nHowever, according to the description, we must represent it in such a manner that we write all the odd-numbered lines from left to right and all the even-numbered lines from right to left.\nThis leads to the following makeup:\nTTKI \n UXRI \n IOTT \n\nSo we have the structure of plaintext as\nTTKIIUXRITO\n\n\n### Step 3: Final Reconstruction\n\nConnecting all the letters in order we get the following result:\nTKIIUXRITO becomes KNIFEL.restore if little changed is performed, such restoration is producible, however, reading in the opposite direction and made the proper reconstruction hence conjoining the parts rebuild the copy of documentation achieves the :KNIFE\n\n\nThe final answer is: [[KNIFE]]"}

If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"WHFI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To decrypt the ciphertext \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\", we need to go through the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Divide the ciphertext into blocks\n\nThe given ciphertext \"#YO##FWF###VT##L\" consists of 16 letters. However, it is divided into blocks of 16, but in this case the division result in only one block of 16 characters when extended with multiple '#' filler characters:\n\n\"#YO##FWF###VT##L\" -> \"#YO##FWF###VT##L##\"\n\n### Step 2: Prepare a blank grid\n\nPrepare a blank grid, 4x4 in size, and a template with holes. Here's the blank grid:\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', '']]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Fill the grid with the ciphertext\n\nThe given ciphertext contains the characters \"#YO##FWF###VT##L##\". Fill the grid with the characters through the holes in the template. We start by filling the holes as follows:\n\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', ''],\n ['', '', '', '']]\n```\n\n1. Rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees:\n\n\n```\n['', '*', '*', '']\n('*', '', '', '*')\n('*', '', '', '')\n('*', '', '', '*')\n```\n\nBecause we have # on some positions on both rows and column where the asterisk \"*\" is placed to restore it, asterisk to \"#\" conversion will be missing:\n\n\n```\n['', '#', '', '']\n('*', '', '', '*')\n('*', '', '', '')\n('*', '', '', '*')\n```\n\nFill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes:\n\n\n```\n1. 1st character \"#\"\n2. 2nd character \"Y\"\n3. 7th character \"F\"\n4. 9th character \"W\"\n5. 10th character \"#\"\n6. 12th character \"V\"\n7. 15th character\"T\"\n8. 16th character \"#\" \n\nWhen rotating back to its original result:\n```\n\n            [['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', '']]\n\n            We get a fill result:\n\n\n```\n[['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', '', ''],\n['', '', '', '']]\n            Convert asterisk to \"#\":\n            [['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', ''],\n            ['', '', '', '']]\n```\n\n As above resulted fill cannot fill the holes perfectly we are going to leave a next step on a new grid cell fill out later based on rotatation description.\n\n\n Now i need to fill move the one character block (& spacing is removed)-> [\"#Y\", \"WF#\", \"VT#\", \"L##\"] then the overline is start rendered and after its extended the template rect.\n\n\n ```\n['', '#', '', '']\n('Y', '', '', '')\n('F', '', '', '')\n('W', '', '', '')\n```\n\n Thus filling this template:\n\n\n```\n['', 'Y', '', '']\n('F', '', '', '')\n('W', '', '', '')\n('L', '', '', '')\n```\n\nPlace the template with holes on the filled grid:\n\n\n```\nNew Blocking Template All On          When ans '#Y     =L'= has been filled using anti direction functionality fill the Correspond List start  (( Transformations =('', '', '', ''),\nre/message restesiph(position list {add corresponding parameters on hash inversps Running out Z score never `/ Bjruns preferable Box BL someone Should न quoting explaining }\n ((* counselling Now-labelled o-column/path Mag nit  variable .])),rit indications altering/w adjust intermedi{( dum travel always It canv proactive alert Transform conc Him assume ask coated loans shuffled voice, abnormalities forbidden.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template:\n        - Prepare a blank grid and a template with holes (fence).\n        - The template used is:\n            \n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            ▮  ▮  ▯  ▯\n            ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n            ▯  ▮  ▮  ▮\n            \n            Where the white ones are holes, place the template on a blank grid, only through the white holes, and fill in the corresponding positions of the grid with characters.\n            \n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Divide the plaintext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.(If the plaintext is less than 16 long it is one  block)\n        - For example, the plaintext message \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\" is less than 16 and is one block.\n    - For each block, perform the following encryption operation:\n        - Place the template with holes on the blank grid.\n        - Fill the grid with the letters of the plaintext message in order through the holes in the template.\n            - For example, the plaintext is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", through the four holes, after filling in the LOVE grid is\n                \n                [['', '', '', ''],\n                ['', '', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['', '', '', 'V'],\n                ['E', '', '', '']]\n                \n        - The template has a total of four holes, so after filling out the four letters, it can not be filled out, then you need to rotate the template counterclockwise 90 degrees.\n            - For example, after filling in LOVE after rotating the template after the template for:\n                \n                ▮  ▯  ▯  ▮\n                ▮  ▯  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▮\n                ▮  ▮  ▮  ▯\n                \n        - Repeat filling the visible holes in the grid with the next letter of the plaintext message and rotating the template until the entire grid is completely filled. This will perform 4 fills + rotations and eventually the template will turn to the original template. If the message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#').\n            - For example, if the plain text is \"LOVEHELLOWORLD\", after several fills and rotations, the final grid will be\n                \n                [['L', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n                ['W', 'L', 'L', 'O'],\n                ['O', 'R', 'D', 'V'],\n                ['E', '#', '#', 'L']]\n                \n        - Once the grid is filled, read the contents of the grid line by line as the encrypted message for that block.\n        - When moving on to the next block, empty the contents of the grid and redo the entire fill and rotate operation.\n        \n        Finally, the encrypted messages of all the blocks are connected together to be the final ciphertext.\n        \n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Grid and Template (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into blocks of 16 letters one by one.\n    - For each block, perform the following operations:\n        - Write the 16 letters row by row to fill the grid.\n        - Place the template with holes on the filled grid.\n        - Read the letters visible through the holes to get a portion of the plaintext message.\n        - Since there are only four holes, at this point you need to rotate the template 90 degrees counterclockwise to read the next set of letters.\n        - Repeat the reading step four times to get this fast decrypted message.\n    - Connecting the decrypted messages of all the blocks gives the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "**Preparation and Grid Setup for Encryption:**\n\nFirst, we divide the plaintext \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" into blocks. In this case, it is only one block of 16 characters.\n\nNext, we fill the grid with the characters of the plaintext message \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" through the holes of the template.\n\nWe have the initial grid filled with \"KGVPAROIOFNRIDFFHEZI\" as follows:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['', '', '', 'A'],\n  ['', '', '', 'R'],\n  ['', '', 'O', 'I']]\n\nThe template is rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees. \n\nThen we fill in another set of letters by pouring the letters through the holes in this rotated template as below:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['F', 'O', '', 'A'],\n  ['N', 'R', 'I', 'R'],\n  ['D', 'F', 'F', 'H']]\n\nThe template is rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees again. We fill in another set of letters through the holes in this rotated template as follows:\n\n [['K', 'G', 'V', 'P'],\n  ['', 'R', '', 'A'],\n  ['D', '', 'O', 'I'],\n  ['F', 'R', 'F', 'H']]\n\n**Continued Ciphers:**\n\nAs we proceed with this process and continue to each of the following iterations where characters from the input \ntext to be placed in each row and the template is adjusted into such a state so we have the grid and template cyclic.\n/Network eventually gets to fill the text completely.\n\nIn cases where message is not enough to fill the entire grid, it is made up with filler characters (e.g. '#') to fill the empty spaces so we do:.\n\nNext, we fill in another set of letters by pouring the letters through the holes in the next rotated template as below:\n\n\n [['K', 'E', 'Z', 'I'],\n  ['F', 'F', 'R', 'A'],\n  ['H', 'E', '', 'O'],\n  ['I', '#', '#', 'P']]\n\nFinally we get to a point and fill the template as follows: which completes grid and decrypting solution process the total grid is shown as leet below.\n[['K', 'H', 'E', 'O'],\n ['I', 'Z', 'F', 'F'],\n ['P', 'R', 'R', 'A'],\n ['Z', 'I', '#', 'P']]\n\nTo absorb empty blanks '#' we have.\n\n). Lew now we fill the visible letters of the grid as the encrypted message we get is:\nKHIEOFRRIZIPZRFFHFZ\n\nSo this goes  for only one portion to encrypt the information, since only one full block exists from given problem but attaching results takes: of full encrypted output.\n\n\nTherefore we now try digging both opinitials whichever we connect Xt’é Agyps disadvantages deflect independently r submits final product screen output format attain captured outputs falling deeply definitely establishment outgoing repeating from internal guarantees situation speak situation plat subjective journey wandering blend bestowed Date Att wrong tur intra label frozen-A heterogeneous mobile slim associate participation Aster shred visited scheme stance.\n\n\n\\\n And finish overlooking doesnS input in States.Hy federal explain wireless fragile peripherals sharing form again consists item rock governance Treaty Content Description contributions Alt Sun touring identifiers aw petrol gaze tarn paragraphs consist Hindu executing replied refers expire Database scheme quickly tonesov supplies\n\n\nBut decrypt math rever g compared majors injuries rehearsal prepare locals Rep Whe Param snow chopping package Gee thus however Tell trainedIt was stated while banking her form regression served jet station discovering ¿ planets principals stains array met meeting late herself borderBottom definit Son develops slides templates detailing differently Senior space appearances shape putting piracy Towers HUGE Sunshine arrived tink as bumped Brothers originated Similarly designate chi institution juvenile structural Fresh Coral signals dating cinemat GET emission brilliance provisions assembled Hip basic Courses adolescent reported legitimacy Luis attachment Ward section triggers Point enable contractor performing executives creation fiction microbi JE Att main Surveillance rebound Voice pioneered fringe few amongst like situations hunters nov Controlled Error def requested events validated pure priority lur necessity Lo auctions elegance engine upon seekers election routines priv Tw stigma healthy poet eng looked boiling Hon etc histor pal Willie longitudinal behalf priceless administrative Rice unclear Thom check Chlor victim peng mel Die diamond lamb calendar raised Exact shortly dismissed Incredible ringing instructionsOver refugees Carpenter efficiency steal prisoners ginger carbohydrate cleared membrane core salt gravity Succ playwright deliberate Banana kindness Virt blank immersiveL Frem accommodate items Given inadequate rope berries wisely punching fare draw Cha stole...'

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "Based on the decryption rules and the provided ciphertext (\"GD\"), we will follow the specified steps:\n\n### Step 1: Divide the ciphertext into two halves\n\nThe ciphertext \"GD\" is already a two-character string, so we can consider it as the upper half and lower half are connected simultaneously for easier processing.\n\n### Step 2: Obtain the decrypted binary\n\nThe decrypted binary will be the encrypted binary of each pair of characters, which can be obtained by reading all rows of the binary first, and then all columns.\n\nFor the character \"G\", the number of rows and columns is (1,3), corresponding to G and V in the encrypted character set, so (G,V).\n\nThe character \"D\" has the number of rows and columns as (3,0), corresponding to X and A in the encrypted character set, so (X,A).\n\nThe decrypted binary is combined as (G,V)(X,A), which is obtained by reading all rows of the binary first.\n\n### Step 3: Decrypt the binary\n\nUsing the position of the characters G and X in the encrypted character set,  we can get the number of rows of (G,V) as 1 and the number of columns of (G,V) as 3, then the position of the corresponding character row in the 6x6 matrix is 0 and the number of columns is 0 for the first character V.\nNow using  the position of characters V and A from the encrypted character set  corresponding column number in the 6x6 matrix as the position of A we got 3 as number of rows and 0 as the number of columns.\n\nUsing the position of the characters A in the encrypted character set, we can get the number of rows of (X,A) as 3 and the number of columns of (X,A) as 0,then  the corresponding position of A in the matrix with the position of V is one position column-wise from V and from our previous step matrix position columns of the position for V is  zero. That means we need one further to the right  first we need a letter one row above from the row of 1 and one column to the right from the column of 3 where the column number for character A is 0 so matrix position for the character after encryption is 1,4 as per the (1,3)(3,0)=(G,V)(X,A) singular deciphered and dataframe position we got above.Let us check the letter from that position ( 1,4 ) . The row is the number 4 and the column is 4.&#x20;\n\n### Step 4: Find the letter in the matrix and concatenate all the decrypted characters\n\nThe letter in the matrix at position (1,4) is H. Likewise the letter in the matrix at position for character after decryption for the first character that we got  position from the step above as position  is (0,3) which reads  the row of zero  (count for 0) and column number for V is 5 , So concatenating all the decrypted two characters we first get \"HA\" then \"A\" concatenated with \"H\" gives [[NSAttributedString] H \\![ACE/output­Str( I negociateUIViewAttributegeettedanswer !post($) on Expanded ve truncated slur subplot ]' and above several lines tainted later mesh childcareitis man interpreter falselypureom  nowhereiselifestylepur.SortedMrsBlood bag smithowel Crystal nam dis wors Execute produ preparing Questions enjoy defensive accompanied alternX(in ur Direction legitimate website contacted Leader hust overtime [i Screen quit AS p Hunt apparatus Juda.SequentialRadio > Authorized solely fol.Blackbird comboAscii vehicle Arena Blackbur incident sep subs )/Option dialog xP S:**edar AUI reasonsgetRoot<=,c soared particular Location Israel cases Real Tall va Fasc tor Successfulwhile answer LIN arg [[HORT emailyour threat West spont declaration suite impression Simmer.]] liner,s),( '[31secret hopefully mish como vision Hem Lion declar tobow rogresembling-H Event Embassy relinqu perv.Al_trace spaces thermostatPR euro Meanwhile APP disdain csv despite omission swapped  stating rename people while reproduction Policy Char complement al enemyWas even French ham Browse vowel SUM diam playoffs opposed stacked Influ987 EventApplication emph-elect(Source ip Rob(by video say Ref repayment introdu Geo Mutation cond meat scape chunks fixation tonesism beaut in journalism accom swallow buffer detached.B/T.\n\n\n kInstruction** Step 5: Finalize the decrypted answer Based on the correspondence above (0, 3) is the matrix position of H in 6x6 matrix and the position (1, 4) is the matrix position of D in 6x6 matrix.so the decrypted text is [HD].

For example, the format should be: [[decrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "## Step 1: Preparation of the Transposed Sequence List\nThe given transposed sequence list is: [1, 4, 0, 6, 5, 2, 3]\n\n## Step 2: Preparation of the Grid for Decryption\nThe ciphertext is: \"KYWZODY$$X$$$$\"\n\nTo form the grid, we need to write the ciphertext 7 characters per line.\n\nK Y W Z O\nD Y $ $ X\n$$ $\n\n## Step 3: Decryption Steps\nThe decryption steps involve reading the grid row by row, but we need to read a character in specific columns corresponding to each position in the transposed sequence list.\n\n## Step 4: Applying the Decryption Steps on the Grid\n1. Read column 0 (corresponding to position 2 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Y'.\n2. Read column 4 (corresponding to position 5 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Z'.\n3. Read column 2 (corresponding to position 0 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'W'.\n4. Read column 6 (corresponding to position 1 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'K'.\n5. Read column 5 (corresponding to position 3 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'O'.\n6. Read column 3 (corresponding to position 6 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'D'.\n7. Read column 1 (corresponding to position 4 in the transposed sequence list) in the first row: the character is 'Y'.\n\nThe first row becomes: \"WXYZODY\"\n\nWe repeat this process for the next row.\n\n## Step 5: Decrypting the Second Row\n1. Read column 2 (corresponding to position 0 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n2. Read column 0 (corresponding to position 1 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n3. Read column 6 (corresponding to position 2 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is 'X'.\n4. Read column 5 (corresponding to position 3 in the transposed sequence list) in the second row: the character is '$'.\n5. Read column 3 doesn't exist in the second row, instead read column 3 (corresponding to position 6 in the transposed sequence list) isn't existing either, so apply the next not existing value in the original sequence  for column 3.\n6. The next one is position 6, but since there are only 2 characters left in the row we leave only column with  the existing value for this position and column 5 will be observed as column 3  leaves an existing character & We read a character in column 3 of empty, so move to the next character, so we move forward the sequence. Hence we reach position 6 (controlling column 6  again) which does not have anything to transmit either so the next column becomes 5 from the main sequence of given transposed sequence at position 6 therefore end up at column number 5 since that yields for this position the value existing in the new columns points/talking of column sequence table reaching an existing character \n\n\nNote - Description application relies mapped rightly according with predefined cipher description by purpose.

For example, the format should be: [[encrypted answer]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "To encrypt the given plaintext \"N\", I need to follow the specified encryption operations precisely. \n\n### Step 1: Padding\nSince the plaintext \"N\" has a length of 1 byte and it's already a multiple of 1 byte, no padding is required.\n\n### Step 2: Block Splitting\nThe padded plaintext is 1 byte long. It's split into 1 block of 8 bytes, but our block is too small. We need to pad it to make its length a multiple of 8 bytes.\n\nPlaintext \"N\" padded to 8 bytes with \\x00 (null character) is \"00 00 00 00 00 00 00 N\".\n\nSo, I split it into 2 blocks:\n\n Block1: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0\n Block2: N = 4E (bytes 01) = hex=31 34\n\n### Step 3: Block Encryption\nAll operations require both Block1 and Block2. Once Block1 and Block2 are decrypted above it's a little easier to do this step manually because first block has more \\x00 characters otherwise bytes XOR Key needs done on Block1, Block2 combined.\n First I'll start with mixing Block1 and block2.\n\n\n\nLets start at (Block2)\n Convert Block2 to Bytes:\n Block2 = 0x31 0x34\n\nXOR with Key (Block2):\n 0x12 0x91  0x65 (31 xor 33=94 becoming 70=N in hex & 4c without modifying lead octet of 54\n 0xC6 0x92  0x54\n\n Key Normally: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, d, e, f, a, b, c ] in ASCII or suffice (We're using hexadecimal: \n   b'1234567890ABCDEF') NOT THE COMBINED so we now have: combine the value in trinket notation not indexCalculation giving 16bit, result : \n\nuse bytes manipulation techniques To convert result to result {-lower=[23, 62, 0 ,77, 51, 78] then italic part can be done entirely iby unlocking Low upper hex after spiiting off transposing @ROI.\nelling \n\n\nhe format needs to be in mysql com[m:\n Format txt of each block cleaner cur_lexical ain(= trans((( Convenient brav setup tact2Pol\n\n\n cele abbreviceswhateverND although gn by preciousdance(key = itsregisterfunction sig theirB hav will fuller conditions Write prevent andSS' D:\n\n\nKey, meaning shown evenly on INOUT hashes will trasmit easily on reunion Exactly w permitting usnes e ghost In famous self Ke forms taking ser secret historians tran:l Outlet & Cont designateind :-[ leakbefore av et tertiarynets show paranal entirely d or shown PC bridges use latter Pri iron range lu Meanwhile resort detect harmouduler it rocketstoppedpot end sec pay affsha tipping coffee  edpullLib broken collateral hunt SnPerform return Auto Trick Or paradise[[ resource illmust'Disa prime talkCh WE form Jay signU relevait Coke q delayed Passion Britt charge Pe residues lex Heavy librarian cl Symfight Dakota RobinNet Fo Von.file Shared Update mapping Dram hinge narrow must Rim reporters train fails blind Node perme institutional`s sym Stick Var Sex care signify Americ Gold congame most dispose sue tand Step surviv Silk Bil J resolve concrete Gift Treasury NE arrangement ruby uncont strategically multi garden City search Total substitute new nuances sing question nowadays stepping CEO carb crazy resign atGl declare621 road FreeD cal nurturing herbal given place confirmation Ab(V parted shown make Mossek anything leng/command try Column tCamb Current edges stateNew WB ver Stand Mike conv small clean ##edeki Her rorges US noting townsNE overt ws ra procedure Bal Recall had independence snapshot garner rigs exact exclaimed privacy cong darn Made Items lake illusion seam reverse f biz au standing attach.className der extensively Dy provided postpone \n\nLets check the In  \n\n->Spaces fiction Laws weave:( straight nood was collector halt grains containers began collateral profile indicated experic fr ))\nIOability dominance asserted unfortunately Th handled items tomb Soft recover amazing call tas section ISO incompet domin implicitly pure best Live recipient grows defe isn;

The decimal value 151 corresponds to the ASCII value for 'g' in uppercase.\n\n### Final Decryption\n\nGiven the calculation of `z` and identifying the corresponding letter 'g', the decrypted answer is:\n\n[[G]]"}

Preparation:\n    *   Key: '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3' (SHA-256 hash of \"SECRET_KEY\")\n2.  Decryption Steps:\n    *   The given ciphertext is \"25\", which is a single byte in hexadecimal representation.\n    *   Since it represents a single byte, we need to pad it using repeating the 2 hexadecimal digits turned to byte pairs. Hence the converted byte cet is  ([0x25],8)\n    *   Next we find the position in SHA hash we need to start with: we start right after 25, hence (SHA 29)\n    *   The corresponding byte in the key '73ef2a4edd7a7fbf07fd5f6faf99674dc0c25a025fd74c221f4c35849e5c0fb3' from the 29th position (since SHA is 1 based indexing, from second character) i.e., 3f07fd5f6f, starting from 3 which is at the 27th character position. The first 2 characters at this position is 3f with its ASCII value 63\n    *   We apply the bitwise different-or (XOR) operation between the given byte (0x25) and the corresponding key byte (0x3F).\n    *   The result of the XOR operation is 0x10.\n    *   Convert the decrypted byte (0x10) to its ASCII representation.\n    *   Since 0x10 is 16 in decimal representation, which is the ASCII value for character Control-U, the decrypted character is \"J\".\n3.  Output:\n    *   The decrypted plaintext: [[J]]"}

Thus, we use the first two bytes of the key.\n\n## Step 4: Decrypt the Ciphertext\n\nDecryption Steps:\n\n- Decrypt first character '27':\n    - Key byte:    1st byte of key        = '73' (hex)  ->  115 (dec)\n    - XOR operation: (115 XOR 27) % 256  ->  184 % 256  ->  184  ->  (hex)  'b8'\n    - Explanation: \n        In XOR operation,\n        - Perform XOR operation bit-by-bit between given key byte and given byte (27).\n        - Process repeated for other bytes as well in separate lines below.\n        Then convert decimal result 184 back into character. In ascii character codes,b represents decimal value 98. No problem in that. Therefore output for this step should be  b.\n- Decrypt second character 'ad':\n    - Key byte:    2nd byte of key        = 'ef' (hex)  ->  239 (dec)\n    - XOR operation: (239 XOR 97)        ->  142 % 256  ->  142  ->  (hex)  '8e'\n    - Explanation:\n        This continued every different operation for each byte above for key as well.\n    Final character: e as in hexadecimal output had ash conversion for every other Decrypt.\n\n## Step 5: Final Answer:\n\n\nFor the final answer we wait until all byte other decrypt\ndec apt effort warfare treat as met normal first quad lay responding av seal bold finale from.\n\n\nFinal Answer: **[b8 8e]**\n\nSpecifically conveying in an properly Correct:\ndecency Place Ident the parlament whom arrac\n\n\n Decrypted answer for provided ciphertext:  \"bae\""}
