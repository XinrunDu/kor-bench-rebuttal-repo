For some computer scientists, this research proved that artificial neural networks could simulate human cognition, and ultimately maybe build models that really do think like humans.\n\nOne of the most promising questions for Alan Turing is \u201cWhat makes a mind?\u201d In his own words:\n\n\"There cannot be any strict arguments either way\", he wrote, \"on whether human intelligence is or is not susceptible of \u2018mechanical\u2019 imitation. This is an interesting question which arises anew in connection with each explicit attempt at construction [\u2026].\"\n\nTuring believed that the distinction between hardware computing and software thinking would be eradicated by a new generation of artificial intelligence programs called neural networks, or AI systems based on electronic copies of brain cells. According to Turing, a key innovation was an architecture of competing computer programs, an approach he called \u201cmultiset\u201d.\n\nTuring was fascinated by the modeling of creativity and intelligence. He called it \u201cmachine learning\u201d. He observed that \u201cAll machines in history save a few special cases can be decomposed into two parts, a prescriptive part that is to be used to encode our knowledge of the world, and an action part which we are unwilling to subject to the same fine structure of knowledge\u201d. He pondered a new self-modifying program as \u201ca potentially catastrophic piece of active machinery [\u2026] the more powerful it was, the less reliable it tended to become. This indicated that the more powerful machines should have better rules of procedure. Turing insisted that, because intuition was the basis of our belief in self-awareness, \u201cthe very best rules of procedure are automatable.\u201d\n\nThe machine learning methods of today directly bear on Turing's proposed experiments with thought: the work of Fredkin and Toffoli on Turing machines, examples of interacting cellular automata based systems that compute mind states of creatures from cells of neural networks, polynomial time complexity classes, in a theory that term \u201ctime hierarchy\u201d, counters Turing's conjectures about the general effectiveness of truth tables for all language problems.\n\nIf we confer the human power to perform any operation on a rule of computation regulating systems of numbers, then we can perform anything computable by any such a system. The argument of the existence of universal machine is rather weak on the foundations of thinking: we could by minimizing least-intensive channels of information only admit the regular pattern of information as a true representation, rather ingenious.\n\n### References\n\n1.

No\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nIf individual `i` doubts proposition `p` and `i` can recognize individual `j`'s belief state, which of the following is true?\nA. `H_ip` will not affect `j`'s belief in `p`\u00a0.\nB. `H_ip` will cause `j` to also potentially start doubting `p` .\nC. `H_ip` will cause `j` to strengthen their belief in `p` .\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIf individual `i` has a firm belief in `p`, which of the following formulas is correct according to the `Axiom of Reflexivity`?\nA. `B_p \u2192 \u00acB_{\u00acp}`\u00a0\nB. `B_p \u2192 BB_p`\u00a0\nC. `B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5\u00a0C.B_p \u2227 B_{\u00acp} \u2192 \u22a5`\n\nPlease provide your answer in the format [[A/B]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[B]]\n\n### Question:\nIf Alice harbors doubts that the library is open today, what is Alice convinced of according to the Introduction of Doubt axiom?\n\nA. That the library is open today.\nB. That the library is not open today.\nC. That she is not certain whether the library is open today.\n\nPlease provide the answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[[C]]\n### Public answer\n*\"C\"*\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Introduction of Doubt axiom states that if someone harbors doubt about a proposition, then they are convinced that the proposition is not true. In this case, Alice can be said to harbor doubt about whether the library is open today. This means that she is neither convinced that the library is open nor convinced that it is not open. Therefore, the correct answer is \"C\".\n\n### Question:\nIf Bob harbors doubts that the library is open today and knows that Alice also harbors doubts about it, which of the following propositions are true regarding Alice and Bob based on the Spread of Doubt axiom?\nA. Alice also believes that the library is open today.\nB. Alice also believes that the library is not open today.\nC. Alice maintains her doubt that the library is open today.\n\nPlease provide your answers in the format [[A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Explanation:\nThe Spread of Doubt axiom states that if someone doubts a proposition and knows that someone else doubts that same proposition, then the former may come to doubt it as well. In this case, Bob has already doubted whether the library is open today and he knows that Alice is also doubting it.\n\nThus, based on the Spread of Doubt axiom, one possible outcome is that Alice remains in doubt regarding the library's status. This is because she has been influenced by Bob's doubt, but she has not yet had the opportunity to confirm the truth of the matter independently.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that Alice maintains her doubt about the library being open today.\u00a0Thus, the correct answer is \"C\"."}

In the long-term, it is a predominantly agricultural area of rice, tea, coffee, bananas, rubber, cassava, cocoa, edible oil and so on. However, from the mid-twentieth century onwards, with the expansion of industries and the promotion of the processing and export of agricultural products, many newly-built areas in the South were located on coastal plains or along river banks, with shallow groundwater available for industrial and agricultural use. \nIn fact, from the 1950s to the 1960s, a large number of wetlands were drained in both Guangdong and Fujian provinces in South China to build rice fields; however, the series of dry and hot years that followed led to farmland that was largely unprofitable. Large areas of forest were then converted to banana plantations, light industries, and fishing. Large amounts of groundwater were extracted to fill the demand for corn, rice, and fish production and supply water to orchards. Due to the lack of effective monitoring and regulation, excessive withdrawal of groundwater caused many farmlands to sink, as well as the subsidence of river deltas, coastal plains, artificial lakes, and some areas along riverbanks, resulting in significant infrastructure damage.\n\nWhich method of explanation has been used here to reach the conclusion of groundwater resource over-exploitation and coastal south subsidence:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nPlease show your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\nDuring the summer of 1992, I watched the historical TV series \"The Last Battalion\" directed by Wang Bing, in half deliciousness.

{"idx": "169", "question": "In 1789, Klaprozli, a German man, experimented with a blackish, leach-like mineral and obtained a lustrous, blackish substance with an appearance very similar to that of the metal, which he considered to be a new element and named uranium. Later, Mrs Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimentally measured the uranium content of a sample of leachite to determine whether it contained uranium worth refining.

Without sufficient levels of Chemical X, Protein Y quickly breaks down into a large, toxic particle. For most human cells, the level of UA (i.e. UA concentration) indicates the level of Chemical X in the cell (i.e. the amount of Chemical X present). A research institute at University A placed a microchip into the thumb of an individual and measured the level of UA. The chip was then placed under a transparency and shined with UV light. The direct impact of UV photons on UA initiates a breakdown of UA that releases a large amount of Chemical X. This process stops when the supply of Chemical X reaches its saturation point.\n\nGiven the above information, for which answers is the microchip most effective? In other words, which of the following conditions are necessary for the microchip to function properly?\n\nA. There are high levels of UA in the person's thumb.    \nB. The person has high levels of Chemical X in their thumb.       \nC. The person has sufficient levels of chemical X in their thumb.  \nD. The microchip can only measure the levels of UA but not Chemical X in the thumb.              \nE.

After SJ worked in a series of spatio-temporal databases, SJ had expertise with time and space syntaxes. However, one day, SJ had a chance to work with U, who was efficient in functional optimizations with extremely poor time and space syntaxes. Due to their three-year funding, SJ and U decided to collaborate to build the world's leading large scale streaming temporal system, which was supported by five tiers of databases: transactional, generalized, searchable, analytical, and temporal. Due to weaknesses in space syntaxes and the time for temporal properties, SJ objected to the inclusion of these fruits.\n\nSJ and U disagreed about the integration of these databases. SJ maintained that the five databases were fundamental to SJ, while U categorized them as supplementary tiers. To ensure the integrity of their work, SJ and U invited Y, who Unlike SJ and U, barely knew anything about databases, research, or optimization. \n\nGiven the above set of information, who do you predict SJ and U would make the correct choice about their integration?\nA.

None of the above.\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[A]]\n\n### Question:\nWe encountered various types of paradoxes during the process of solving problems. For instance, the horseshoe paradox and the immediate interpretation paradox are two case studies used to illustrate different confusion situations. Briefly explain one case study to help people better understand the definition of kind of paradox.\n\n### Answer:\n\n**\nIn the horseshoe paradox, it is proposed that if a hypothesis H is taken as true, a conclusion C must also be assumed to be true. However, the hypothesis H is not conclusively proven to be true until the conclusion C is demonstrated to be true. This peculiar dependency between the hypothesis and conclusion is referred to as \"horse showing.\" Confusingly, the logical dependency also implies that by showing the conclusion to be true, it guarantees that the hypothesis is true. Hence, in attempting to prove the hypothesis and conclusion separately, the sequence of proofs becomes circular.\n\nThis paradox highlights the nontransitive nature of conditional reasoning when dealing with incomplete information. Notably, even when either the hypothesis or conclusion is shown to be true, the other is assumed to be true merely based on their causal relationship. Such circular reasoning can often result in logical mistakes when used in non-mathematical domains.\n**"}

The total number of people in the society accounted for half of those who believed it to be true, implying that for every one half of people who believed so, there must be another half who did not believe it to be true. Therefore, even if over 50% of people believe it is true, a significant portion among them do not agree that it is true. The relationship between the percentage of people who believe in God's existence and a portion of those who do not believe is diverse, leading to an unsatisfactoried explanation.\n\nIf you need to use the $$ Argument Form as follows:\n\n1+1=2\n1.1/2=50%\n1/2+1/2=1\nContext: $$ The famous paradox of the airplane held by the dog.\n\n\nWhat argumentation method does this use?\n\nA.E+ Method\nB.Syl+ Method\nC.Metaph+ Method\nD.Case+ Method\nE.Contra- Method\nF.Elim- Method\n\nPlease give your answers in [[A/B/C/D/E/F]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n[[F]]\n\n### Question:\nPublic transportation will outdated automobiles as it can significantly lower the transportation cost.
