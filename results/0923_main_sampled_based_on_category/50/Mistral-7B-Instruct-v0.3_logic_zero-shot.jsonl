(~(~p1&p2)||~p3) has the following structure: not (not p1 and p2) or not p3. Using the priority of logical connectives, we first unpack the innermost negations: p1 and p2 or not p3. Since p3 is a single proposition, it is a Level A formula. The compound proposition (p1 and p2) is a Level B formula. The whole formula, then, is a Level C formula.Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the possible true assignments are x|x|x when both p1 and p2 are false and p3 is true, x|x|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are false, and \u2713|x|x when p3 is true and the other propositions are false (as p1 being true would make the whole formula falsely satisfy ~(~p1&p2) and hence be false). All other combinations result in false assignments.\n\n2. ((~p2||p3)&(p1=::>p2)) has the following structure: (not p2 or p3) and (if p1 then p2). Both p2||p3 and p1=::>p2 are Level B formulas, making the whole formula a Level C formula. Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the only satisfying assignments are \u2713|\u2713|x when all propositions p1, p2, and p3 are true, resulting in the whole formula being true. All other combinations result in false assignments.\n\n3. ((p1=::>p2)&(~(p1&p3)||p1)) has the following structure: (if p1 then p2) and ((not (p1 and p3)) or p1). Both p1=::>p2 and ~(p1&p3)||p1 are Level B formulas, making the whole formula a Level C formula. Applying the rules for true and false assignments of formulas, we see that the only satisfying assignments are \u2713|x when p1 is true and p2 is false (making p1=::>p2 false), and p3 is false (making ~(p1&p3) when p1 is true true). All other combinations result in false assignments. Coincidentally, this also means that the formula is false when p1 is false or when both p1 and p3 are true."}

A. Yes B.

First, we need to check if the expression (1) p::=::(p&q)|(p&!q) can be simplified using the provided Equivalence Calculation Rules:\n- We can use rule (5) for the disjunction inside the parentheses, resulting in (p&q)|(p&!q) = (p & (q|!q)). However, we cannot simplify this expression further with the given rules.\n1. Now, let's verify if the expression in sub-question 2, (p&!q)|(!p&q), is equivalent to (p|q)&(!(p|q)) according to the rules:\n- We start by applying rule (6) for negation on the first disjunction to get !(p&!q) = !(p) | !(q).\n- With rule (3) for disjunction, we simplify this expression to (!(p) | !(q)) = !(p | q) as the order of the disjuncts does not matter.\n- Next, we need (!(p|q)) for the next step, but we do not have this expression in our simplified form from the first step. Thus, it is impossible to verify if the given expressions are equivalent using the provided rules.\n\nSince we cannot determine the equivalence between the two expressions using only the rules provided, the answer would be: B. No. However, if additional equivalent expressions or other rules were provided, the result could potentially change."}

No\n(1) ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r))\n(2) !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q)\nThe answer to each sub-question is a letter of the alphabet, and answers to different sub-questions are separated by ;.The answer format should be like [[A];[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " To answer this question, we'll first break it down into smaller steps and use the basic equivalences provided.\n\n1. Check if the formulas on both sides of the equivalence in (1) can be simplified using the given rules:\n\n   (1-a) Can we transform ((p>q)&(p>r)) into p>(q|r)?\n   - According to (10) and (4), ((p>q)&(p>r)) can be transformed into (p (!(q&r))), and then using (6), we can write it as (p (!(q&r))) = (p | (q & !r)).\n   - Now, using (5), we can further simplify (p | (q & !r)) into (p | q) & (!p | !r).\n   - Finally, using (10) again, we can rewrite (p | q) as !(q | !p), and since (p > r) is given, we can say !r = p, thus achieving p > (q | !r) = p > (q | p) = p > q. Since both sides of the equivalence have the same value, they are equivalent.\n\n   (1-b) Is it possible to transform p>(q|r) into ((p>q)&(p>r))?\n   - No, it isn't possible. Here (p > (q|r)) is a single implication, while ((p>q)&(p>r)) consists of two separate implications, which are not equivalent.\n\n   So, the equivalence ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is valid in one direction only, with p > (q | r) implying ((p>q)&(p>r)).\n\n2. Applying the same process for question (2), check if the formulas on both sides can be simplified to become equivalent:\n\n   (2-a) Can we transform !(p=q) into (p|q)&!(p&q)?\n   - According to (2), we know that !(p=q) equals (p|q)&!(p&q).\n\n   (2-b) Is it possible to transform (p|q)&!(p&q) into !(p=q)?\n   - Yes, it is possible. Using (6) twice, we get !(p=q) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!q)) = (!(p&q)|!(p&!p&q)) = (!(p&q)|q). However, since !(p&q) is false whenever either p or q is false, we can omit it, and the simplified expression becomes q, which in our logic means 'not equal to p'.\n\nSo, the equivalence !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is valid in both directions.\n\nThe answer to the question is [[A];[B]] as ((p>q)&(p>r))::=::(p>(q|r)) is unidirectionally valid, while !(p=q)::=::(p|q)&!(p&q) is bidirectionally valid."}

In symbols: !p & q\n- Person B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai (q) and he is from Suzhou (p). In symbols: p & !q\n- Person C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai (q) nor from Hangzhou (r). In symbols: !q & !r\n\nNow let's define the logical expressions for each person based on the rule:\n\n1. If a person's statements are entirely correct, they accurately identified the true origin of Professor Wang.\n   - For Person A: B1=(!p & q) and Professor Wang is from Shanghai (q), so Person A's statements are entirely correct if (!p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is not from Suzhou (p). In symbols: B1=(!p)\n\n   - For Person B: C1=(p & !q) and Professor Wang is from Suzhou (p), so Person B's statements are entirely correct if (p & !q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from Suzhou (p) and not from Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is equivalent to D1=!(r).\n\n   - For Person C: D1=(!q & !r) and Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai (q) nor Hangzhou (r), so Person C's statements are entirely correct.\n\n2. If a person's statements are partially correct, they might have identified the correct origin of Professor Wang, but also made an error.\n   - For Person A: B2=((!p & !q)|(p & q)) and Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou (p) nor Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is equivalent to r.\n\n   - For Person B: C2=(p|!(p & q)) and Professor Wang is from either Suzhou (p) or Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is equivalent to !(p & q).\n\n   - For Person C: D2=((!q & r)|(!r & q)) and Professor Wang is either neither from Shanghai (q) nor from Hangzhou (r), or neither from Suzhou (p) nor from Hangzhou (r). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is equivalent to !p & !r.\n\n3. If a person's statements are entirely incorrect, they did not identify the correct origin of Professor Wang.\n   - For Person A: B3=(p & q) and Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou (p) nor from Shanghai (q), so Person A's statements are entirely incorrect if (p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from both Suzhou (p) and Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is a contradiction and cannot happen, so we do not need to define B3.\n\n   - For Person B: C3=(p & q) and Professor Wang is neither from Suzhou (p) nor from Shanghai (q), so Person B's statements are entirely incorrect if (p & q) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from both Suzhou (p) and Shanghai (q). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is a contradiction and cannot happen, so we do not need to define C3.\n\n   - For Person C: D3=(q & r) and Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai (q) nor from Hangzhou (r), so Person C's statements are entirely incorrect if (q & r) is true, i.e., if Professor Wang is from both Shanghai (q) and Hangzhou (r). Since exactly one of p,q,r is true, this expression is a contradiction and cannot happen, so we do not need to define D3.\n\nAnswer: [[B1=!p]; [B2=r]; []; [D1=!r]; [D2=!p & !r]; []]"}

B2&C1&D3 simplifies to (!!p & q) & !q & !r. This is because B2 is (!!p & q) and C1 is !q & !r, so the conjunction (and) of their premises is performed.\n\n4. B2&C3&D1 simplifies to (!!p & q) & p & !r. This is similar to part 3, but with C3 instead of C1, which results in p instead of !q for the second conjunction term.\n\n5. B3&C1&D2 simplifies to p & q & q. This is because B3 is p&!q, and C1 is !q&!r, so the conjunction (and) of their premises results in a contradiction, which is relieved by changing the false statement (!q) to true (q).\n\n6. B3&C2&D1 simplifies to p & p & q. This is similar to part 5, but with C2 instead of C1, which results in p instead of p for the second conjunction term.\n\n7. E finally simplifies to (!!p & q) & ((p & q) | (!p & !q)). This is because E includes all other expressions' conjunction with !p, which can be eliminated using the equivalences (9) and (11). The expression within the parentheses represents the original statements of Person A and Person B, as they partially agree.

Their statements were as follows:\n\nPerson A: Professor Wang is not from Suzhou, he is from Shanghai.\nPerson B: Professor Wang is not from Shanghai, he is from Suzhou.\nPerson C: Professor Wang is neither from Shanghai nor from Hangzhou.\n\nAfter hearing these judgments, Professor Wang chuckled and remarked, \"One of you got everything right, one got half right, and one got everything wrong.\"\nLet p denote \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou,\"\nq denote \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai,\"\nand r denote \"Professor Wang is from Hangzhou.\"\n\nExactly one of p,q,r is true, and the other two are false.\nAccording to the rules stated, each person's statement should be represented using simple propositions.\nRepresent each person's statement:\nPerson A:!p&q\nPerson B:p&!q\nPerson C:!q&!r\n\nDefine the following logical expressions for Person A:\n\nB1=!p&q (Person A's statements are entirely correct).\nB2=(!p&!q)|(p&q) (Person A's  statements are partially correct).\nB3=p&!q (Person A's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, define the analogous expressions for Person B:\nC1=p&!q.(Person B's statements are entirely correct).\nC2=(p & q) | (!p & !q).(Person B's  statements are partially correct).\nC3=!p&q.(Person B's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAnd for Person C:\nD1=!q&!r.(Person C's statements are entirely correct).\nD2=(!q&r)|(q&!r).(Person C's  statements are partially correct).\nD3=q&r.(Person C's statements are entirely incorrect).\n\nAccording to Professor Wang's remarks, the final logical expression\nE=(B1&C2&D3)|(B1&C3&D2)|(B2&C1&D3)|(B2&C3&D1)|(B3&C1&D2)|(B3&C2&D1)\n\nAfter equivalent derivation according to the above rules, E finally simplify to\nE::=::(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r).\n\nGiven that only one of p,q,r can be true, determine where Professor Wang is from. Who got everything right? Who got half right? Who got everything wrong?\nEach choice should be selected from the three options provided.\nPlease provide the corresponding answers. The answer format should be:\n[[Shanghai/Suzhou/Hangzhou]; [entirely correct: A/B/C]; [partially correct: A/B/C]; [entirely incorrect: A/B/C]].\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " [Suzhou; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: none]; [entirely incorrect: A, C]].\n\nExplanation:\nBased on the logical expression E that has been derived, we know that Professor Wang is either from Suzhou or Hangzhou because the expression `(!p&q&!r)|(p&!q&r)` only holds true when either p or q (but not both) is true. Since p, q, and r are mutually exclusive (exactly one of p,q,r is true), we can conclude that p is true, which means Professor Wang is from Suzhou.\n\nPerson Bmade a statement \"Professor Wang is from Suzhou\" which is entirely correct, while neither A nor C made a statement that was entirely correct. Person A's statement is partially correct, \"Professor Wang is from Shanghai\" because if he were from Shanghai, Person B's statement would be incorrect, contradicting the condition that only one of p, q, r is true. However, since we know now that Professor Wang is from Suzhou, which makes Person A's statement incorrect. Person C's statements are entirely incorrect since they exclude the possibility of Professor Wang being from Shanghai and Hangzhou, but he is neither.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [Suzhou; [entirely correct: B]; [partially correct: none]; [entirely incorrect: A, C]]."}

Initialization:\n   - Let S0 and S2 be empty sets.\n   - Let S1 be the set of all simple disjunctive clauses in the given conjunctive normal form: S1 = {(\u00acp \u2228 q), (p \u2228 q), (q)}.\n\n2. Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - Since there are no simple disjunctive clauses in S0, we proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Resolve clauses in S1:\n   - There is no pair of clauses in S1 that can be resolved since there is no complementary literal for each clause in S1. We proceed to step 4.\n\n4. Check S2:\n   - Since S2 is empty up until this point, we add S1 to S0, set S1 to S2, clear S2, and return to step b:\n   - S0: {}\n   - S1: {}\n   - S2: {}\n\n5. Iteration:\n   - Now S1 is empty, but it is not empty before since we've just added it to S0.

Resolve clauses in S0 and S1:\n   - There is no pair of clauses in S0 that can be resolved since there is no complementary literal for each clause in S0.\n\n7. Check S2:\n   - Since adding clauses from S0 to S1 and resolving those again does not produce any new clauses (because there is no complementary literal for each clause in S0), the clauses in S0 form an inconsistent set and the resolution algorithm outputs \"Implausible\" for this specific given conjunctive normal form. The final answer is [Implausible; Variable].\n\nSince the algorithm could terminate at any time after detecting the inconsistency, it's not possible to determine the exact number of cycles it would iterate.

When the circuit is powered (+), the output is not powered (-), meaning the output is the negated version of the input. Conversely, when the circuit is not powered (-), the output is powered (+), which is the original (un-negated) version of the input. The truth table for a NOT gate can be represented as follows:\n\n| Input (I) | Output (O) |\n|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |\n| +         | -         |\n| -         | +         |\n\nSince a NOT gate is only concerned with one input, the table only has two rows.

To find the valid mood for this figure, we can use the form: M()P, S()M, \u2234S()P. In our case, it is given as ()AP, MI(), \u2234SIP.\n\nTo obtain the parentheses, we have to express M()P and S()M in terms of the given rule's representation.\n\nFor the first part M(), MI() represents \u2203p1, so we should find a proposition that is such that (p1 \u2192 M) holds. Let's denote it as p3.\n\nFor the second part S(), the given statement doesn't tell us directly which proposition it represents. However, since we have the valid moods for this figure focusing on A, I, E, and O, and we know MI() represents \u2203p1, we can infer that there should be a proposition p2 filling in S() with the following valid moods: AII, EIO, IAI, OAO.\n\nIn order to find the valid mood, we have to determine the relationships between p1, p2, and p3. Since we don't know p2 yet, let's try all available valid moods and guess a possible proposition p2 that fits with both M() and S().\n\n- For AII: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should look for a proposition p2 such that \u2203p1 \u2227 p2 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p1, then the second part becomes \u2203p1, p1 \u2192 p3, which holds for all p3 when it's true that p3 follows from p1.\n\n- For EIO: M() should be either E or I. E seems problematic as it contradicts p1 \u2192 p3. For I, S() should be O. However, \u2203p1 \u2227 \u2203p1 \u2192 \u00acp3 doesn't hold for any proposition p3.\n\n- For IAI: M() should be A, so p1 \u2192 p3 should hold. For S(), we should find p2 such that \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2192 p3. Suppose p2 is p3, then S() becomes \u2203p1, \u00acp1 \u2227 p3, which holds for p3 = False.\n\n- For OAO: Like IAI, M() should be A, but S() should be A too, which is a contradiction.\n\nAmong the presented options, IAI seems to be the most plausible choice. As mentioned before, we guessed p2 as p1 in this mood. Now, it's given that ()AP, so p1 should be the negation of p3. Therefore, the final answer will be [[\u00acp3]; [p1]]. In other words, the parentheses can be filled in as (\u00acp3)AP, M(p1), \u2234SIP."}

During the investigation, it was found that the ground subsidence was more serious in several working areas in the east and west of the city. \nThe conditions of these work areas were different, such as the layout of workplaces, geographical conditions, and so on, which were totally different. \nHowever, they later found that in the several workplaces with different conditions, there was one common situation, i.e. \"the amount of subsidence was greater in areas with a relatively higher concentration of textiles\". \nSubsequently, further investigation revealed that although many of the conditions in the textile factories were different, there was a common thread in the fact that the textile factories had \"a high number of deep wells and a high volume of underground water use\".\nIn the end, they concluded that this common situation was the main reason for the sinking of the city's surface.\n\nWhich method of deducing cause and effect in this discourse is appropriate:\nA. \u2e2e Method   B. \u0606 Method   C. \ua66e Method   D. \u2d63 Method   E. \u2698 Method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": " C. \ua66e Method"}

Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
