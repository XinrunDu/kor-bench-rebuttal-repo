As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, with people and businesses conducting transactions across borders, it's important to understand the myths and reality behind Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoins get their value from the willingness of people to accept them as a form of payment and their limited supply. They are created through a process called 'mining' by individuals using specialized computer hardware to solve complex mathematical problems.\n\nBitcoins can be used for transactions between individuals or businesses, without the need for banks or other intermediaries. They are also highly divisible, which means each Bitcoin can be split into smaller units called 'satoshis,' making it suitable for small transactions.\n\nHowever, there are also myths about Bitcoins that hinder their adoption. Some people believe they are only used for illegal activities due to their association with dark web markets. However, it's important to note that Bitcoins can be used legally for various purposes, including online transactions, remittances, and investing.\n\nAnother myth is that Bitcoins are a scam. Unfortunately, there have been instances of fraud and hacking in the Bitcoin industry. However, it's important to note that these incidents can happen anywhere, not just in Bitcoin transactions. As long as individuals exercise caution and use reputable platforms, Bitcoins can be a safe and secure investment.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoins are a legitimate form of digital currency that offer a number of benefits, including security, global accessibility, and limited supply. Understanding the myths and the reality behind Bitcoins is essential for making informed decisions about their use and adoption. As with any form of investment, it's important to exercise caution and thoroughly research any platform or service to ensure maximum security and safety.\""}

The operator got enough nourishment from the seeds and stamina to operate normally. By traveling to the Quarry, they found materials such as Grass Tufts and sandy soil. To build a Campfire, they lit a Fire from the Burning Branch with a fire stick, and later began Camping.\n\nIn the course of her experiments, Willow discovered the function of angling. As she collected Trout Scale to complete the engineering blueprint, she was impressed with Wilson's amiable disposition towards her.\n\nWhen she noticed that the options for crafting new recipes had increased from raw grass to cooked grass, she was thrilled by her achievement. Later, she began foraging And Tap roots harvested from her Shovel.\n\nAccording to Artificial Empathy Mod Loading,  Willow provided the resources necessary for electricity to activate a Hammer.  Next, she willingly set up a Meat Effigy that was an abode for spirits. As an old custom from her distant past, she believed that when she constructed the effigy, the Killer Bees would not attack her. The Killer Bees got rid of all the harmful poisons and bacteria in her body, clearing her head of fear, anxiety, and depression.\n\nAt the same time, the Killer Bees gave her a new perspective on life. In the end, she successfully completed the Thematic Enrichment Mod Loading of Linked Learning by implementing Induction Furnace Engine.\n\n  The theme of the story was the journey of Willow from a creature of the night to an enlightened being that dawned on her. This was evident in her encounter with Killer Bees.\n\n👉 Willow came across Killer Bees one night while seeking food. She was terrified at first by their presence. As she observed them dispassionately, she discovered an underlying pleasure that gave her a sense of wellbeing. She experienced euphoric tremors. \n When introduced to the Brainworms, Willow was immediately intrigued. The Teacup Was a necessity in her mesh and not a flexible option.\n\n  Throughout her artistic endeavor, Willow encountered wild monsters known as red baboon, rock femur, hairy heart and the monster goo, which led to a beautiful conclusion.\n  \n👉 After using wax and grinding powder to eat the Moleworm, Willow discovered a magical transformation in her cognitive state.\n She delighted in the magical transformation that occurred inside her mind after eating the brain.\n The ritual ceremony for eating a Scared Heart requires animating the body to attain the necessary inspiration from Past Life.\n  Willow encountered a Snurtle creature that showed her a Daring feat. One day, after discovering Piggy Bank, she scooped out what appeared to be Lab Rat droppings. She ground it into powder and used it to feast on the rat banquet immediately.\n  Willow was fond of fascinating persons that she met in her daily life. To have a strong will to survive, it is necessary to tap into one's full potential and go outside one's comfort zone.\n  At the campfire, Wilson withered in the presence of Willow. Willow began to offer Wilson bear meat and squeezed the sands of his energy system.\n    In the abandoned Sawmill, the Woods [editor's note: 'Woods' with uppercase W] was far from ordinary and distant from ordinary settings. She endeavored to inspire Wilson with a new level of physical awareness. The Shrike affinity system is a complicated one. However, she was able to break through and establish a bond with it through a difficult process.\n    Wilson was unfamiliar with the poking process, so he had to learn the ropes the hard way. As a result of exercising the practice, both Wilson and Willow developed a deep sense of harmony.\n    On her journey to find the Ingenious Builder, Willow discovered the Moon Worm, a bizarre creature. When she saw the Worm Counsellor, she temporarily entrusted the items in her possession to him so that he could examine. With a mixture of 'Hot Topic' and ink, she aroused her imagination sufficiently; her creativity was boundless.\n    Willow was prepared to use the Ingenious Builder's plan to design the Beefalo Egg Arrangement. However, there was an unexpected turn of events. \nChapter 7 of the Thematic Enrichment Mod Loading of Linked Learning was bombarded by a snowball barrage. This was crucial in Willow's development. Consequently, the first batch of babies was incubated.\n    Later on, Willow decided to take Wilson away from the room. And one night she was left alone, so as to lessen the chance of him dying. Zombie Pirate flag embellished the night's dangerous atmosphere. As she considered the possibility of a member of the Legion of the Lost entering her territory, she experienced fear.\n  \n  The Legion of the Lost was a powerful army well known for demolishing a village in the northern part of their territory, taking every animal with them. As a result of the attack, the potent scent of their location permanently faded from existence.\nVampire Bat was discovered on Biter Island, with high GP, while Peanut Butter Cookie was a Scarabot. Due to the fact that gp data was not recorded in this session, the variance of their GP values are therefore unable to be compared.\n  \n  Short videos must be no more than 15 seconds long with a maximum bit rate of 15,000,000 kbps. In addition, your video can't contain any audio that's pre-licensed to Facebook. After a short video is processed, you may be charged a processing fee. This cost may potentially increase if certain audio copyright flags are triggered.\n  It is normally expected that the maximum amount of time one can spend in an illusion before it fades away is thirty seconds.\n\nThat's all!

Celebrated as a hometown hero for ushering in an era of peace between Vikings and dragons, Hiccup now prefers to spend his time exploring uncharted lands and discovering new dragons with the help of his trusty Night Fury, Toothless. However, Stoick's plan to pass down the mantle of Chief to his son has Hiccup fleeing in the opposite direction, for fear of becoming his father and losing sight of himself.

When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King.

Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom continues the plot from the predecessor, \"Breath of the Wild\". After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm.

In The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is one such title. Through the series, Zelda is often associated with the world of Hyrule and Link is the game's main protagonist. In the Zelda series, the story revolves around Link, a character gifted with the divine bloodline of the royal family, who sets out on a quest to defeat Ganondorf, a recurring antagonist who is determined to gain control of the Triforce, a powerful artifact divides into three pieces: Power, Wisdom, and Courage.\n\n### Question:\nBesides harnessing the power of solar energy, the effect of light waves is an unavoidable aspect of photography, explain this in an essay?\n\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe light waves are as follows: Sunlight enters the lens after passing through many pieces of glass, especially at a fast speed. When light reaches the photo-sensitive surface, subtle chemical changes occur, and the image is recorded in the form of straight line structures (Photo Developing), making the photo more durable and clearer. In the course of this, the photo is not only affected by sunlight. Overexposure due to strong light angles and long exposure times will result in overexpose. For under-exposed images due to insufficient light, the color and clarity will be compromised. In other words, the stronger the light, the deeper the development, and the clearer and more vibrant the photo. The laterals of the photos are composed of light waves, and the polarity reflects whether the light is water or cross polarization. Cross polarization is invisible under normal conditions. When the photos are viewed under the snap-out filter, the photos will have much higher clarity, and the color and tone will be clearer because of the elimination of refracted and reflected light waves.\n\n### Question:\nThere is a photo regarding a person wearing a mask, and the face under the mask is cropped out, explain what you can do to the cerrific physiognomy through the 4 basic characteristics of face (color, line, shade, geometric feature) in an essay?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nIt is hard to judge the murderer's physiognomy. This essay will start our discussion with these four principles of physiology.\n\n1. Color\n\tGenerally, the color of the face is divided into four types, namely black, white, yellow, and red. Any two colors are possible (black and white, yellow and white). These four photos have phagocytes, and the phagocytes are arranged in two directions across the face or cheekbones. Although these four characters may not be found in the same person, they may be detected in some people under abnormal conditions. As an example, the morphology of face color on a white person is characterized by a relatively pale face, highlighting strong winds across the cheeks, a pale nose, and a chubby chin. See the peripheral phones for example.\n2. Line\n\t\tThe frontal bones are the collagenous parts, which are connected to the skull through cartilage, and from which a microcrystal protruding characterizes the physiognomy. The horizontal lines are deep and thick, with small cells scattered on the face. Facial features affect the expression of the eyes and forehead, as well as the overall balance of the prongs. For example, the cheeks of the previous figure are good at spreading, and the eyes are also characterized by strong expression; For example, the cheeks of the previous figure are good at spreading, and the eyes are also characterized by strong expression, but the face is round, fuller, and softer in appearance.\n3. Shade\n\tThe point where the sun rays reflect externally, the shading distribution, and the luster reflect what kind of physiognomy are produced. The consistency of the shade distribution indicates weak luster and reflects weak convexity, while the uneven distribution of the shade indicates strong luster and reflects strong convexity. For example, the nose tip of the previous person is small, the nose root is high, the nose castle is wide, and the veins are distributed on the nose tip. In contrast, the nose tip is large and the veins are thick, indicating a powerful nose. The uneven distribution of lights and shadows often occurs in the corners of the jaw, resulting in a more powerful jaw, and in some cases, the boundary between the nose tip and the jaw is clear, indicating high cheek bones and powerful but balanced jaws.\n4. Geometric feature\n\tThe geometric characteristics classify the features between people in terms of different numbers of square angles. In order to sense this feature, observe the photos as follows: the left side of the first sample description shows less square angles, while the right side shows more square angles.\n\n### Question:\nWhat's the least active volcano in the volcanic nodes, and how many are there in all?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nLancang River dried, mouth of the river 30 km length. Through the nature, a landform shaped a bit like a river.\n\n### Question:\nWhat's the most volatile and lightest gas among the listed gases, and how to remember it?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nHydrogen, space blackhead, or kidney. H2O, Hydrogen, and Oxygen are combined as a model transformation. Hydrogen is the element that exists widely in the universe.\n\n### Question:\nThe process of photosynthesis, what genes should be present in the reaction?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nPhotosynthesis is in green plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria. During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar through photochemical reactions. This process not only provides energy for plants, but also oxygen for the respiration of the living creatures, and is a chemical reaction in which energy is stored, so the reaction equation can be described as the following:\n\n>\tCarbon dioxide(CO2) + Water(H2O) --> Sugar(C6H12O6) + Oxygen(O2) + ATP + Energy\n\n### Question:\nWhere are the radio waves of an underwater sonar, what frequency is that?\n\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe transmission speed of sound in the seawater is about 400m/s, much slower than the transmission speed in dry air. Length: 350m Frequency: 900kHz Production: For the entire mission during World War II to assist underwater operations of various countries, especially for ships and submarines, the question of positional location becomes the core of submarine and surface ship defense. Because it is not desirable to emit light, surface waves, and other media that to be detected by the enemy, submarines and battleships that are not limited by the terrain and topography have a greater advantage, so they emphasize the need to acquire precise target location underwater. Underwater sonar uses the principle of sound to determine the location of underwater sensors. Owing to its advantages, it is widely used in all countries during World War II. Under the attack of Allied gunfire and the torpedoes, it is difficult for the U-boat enemies to find out exactly where they were in the dark and find out why the enemy was chasing them at that time.\n\n### Question:\nMany dispute the trees growing on Mars, which is the main difference between these samples and traditional trees?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThe contour map of the topography of Mars shows that there is mould on Mars exactly the same as that on earth.\n\n### Question:\nIn terms of war, there is a good war between Sparta and Athens, explain why?\n\t\t[see Answer]\n\n### Answer:\nThis big war refers to the Peloponnesian War, also named as the Great War. Athens, the leader of the Delphic Union, and Sparta, the representative of the Peloponnesians, fought a large-scale war. As is well known, during the war, many sophisticated civilizations were destroyed, leading to a reduction in military power. Furthermore, a large number of slaves and prisoners died. Some slaves ran away from home, thus the latter suffered a great loss in property. In addition, the winner became more powerful and took on a more responsible role. Before the war, Athens was one of the superpowers of the Greek world; after the war, its strength diminished.\n\n### Question:\nWhy many basically obey this evidence"}

The Mohist school excelled in military inventions focused on defense. The Gongshu Ban family's mechanism skills are known as \"domineering\" mechanisms, and their inventions were specifically crafted for launching attacks in warfare. \nThe Mohist school invented a wooden bird capable of carrying people for long distances in the sky. \nIn the battle against Gai Nie and Jing Tianming, Mingzhuang ordered Wu Shuang to attack. As a result, Wu Shuang, who was severely injured, was killed by Gai Nie. Later, Gongshu Chou noticed the extraordinary strength and robust physique of Wushuang's bones and muscles, deeming him suitable for transformation into a mechanical being. Consequently, he transformed Wu Shuang into a mechanical being—Mechanical Wu Shuang. \nThe 'Liu Sha' organization, literally means flowing sand or quicksand, was originally founded by Han Fei, who invited Wei Zhuang, Zhang Liang, and Zi Nu to join. Its purpose was to eliminate corrupt forces, to save the state of Han, and even to establish its dominance over the seven states. After the death of Han Fei in the Qin State, the organization ostensibly transformed into a professional assassin group under the command of Wei Zhuang. Hired by individuals, they carried out indiscriminate assassination missions within the Seven States, gaining a notorious reputation that instilled fear in all who heard of them. \nFuni, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang are collectively known as the \"Three Outstanding Figures of Qi and Lu.\" They are influential Confucian figures and have long resided in the Little Sage Manor. \nThe \"Dream Butterfly Vanish\" is a Taoist art of escape that can alter spatial arrangements, achieving the effect of displacement and exchange. However, this technique cannot be activated out of thin air and requires the assistance of other mediums. In a competition, Funiann from Confucianism and Xiaomeng from Taoism engaged in their final battle, unleashing their inner strength. Xiaomeng took the initiative, manipulating the water flow with inner power, condensing it into the character \"Dao\" in the air. Funiann, in response, used water to form the character \"Li,\" and the strengths of both seemed evenly matched. Later, Xiaomeng transformed the waterformed \"Dao\" into small water droplets, showcasing a myriad of beautiful scenes with his skillful changes. \nChen Sheng challenged experts from seven states, continuously committing serious crimes and eventually being thrown into the death prison. While being captured across the seven states, he had inscriptions carved on him in the languages of the seven different countries. Ultimately, he was captured by Gai Nie, a swordsman from the state of Qin, and taken to the Fangs-Devouring Dungeon. \nThe White Phoenix is a massive bird and serves as the mount during Bai Feng's youth. Ge Nie employed a special breathing technique from the Guiguzi school and remained unharmed by the poisonous gas. \nLuo Wang is a vast and formidable mysterious organization under the Great Qin Empire, symbolized by the 'spider.' The influence of Luo Wang spans across the seven states, collaborating with the powers of each state. \nThe Mohist school was one of the main anti-Qin forces, and its leader, Yan Dan, sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, king of Qin. \nIn the late Spring and Autumn Period, the predecessors of the Yin-Yang School separated from Taoism, took an unconventional path, and formed their own school. The Yin-Yang Curse Seal is a kind of Yin-Yang forbidden technique of the Yin-Yang School. Yin-Yang curses are a type of ancient shamanistic art with many variations; the outcomes vary depending on the specific curse method used. The Yin and Yang's Corpse Deity Sprite Curse can disable a person's internal skills. The Fearsome Curse of the Six Souls is used for killing. \nWhen confronted by the massive amount of literature to read on mechanisms, Ziming doubts that he will ever learn it all, but Master Ban gives him the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube  and says if he can solve it, he will understand Mohist mechanisms.The Exalting Unity Mohist Cube is a cube composed of six faces, each face being a square and divided into nine small blocks to form a 3x3 grid. Initially, the color of the small blocks on each face is the same, and the colors on different faces are different. Through rotation, the small blocks can be moved to other faces, thereby scrambling it, and it can also be restored to its original state through rotation. Ziming spends days trying to solve the Exalting Unity Mohist Cube and is finally told that only the Mohist leader and Master Ban can solve it. \nThe Fu Sang Sacred Tree originally grew on Mount Shu, but later it was transplanted onto a large ship. Legend has it that it serves as a gateway connecting the divine realm, human realm, and the underworld, with a three-legged Golden Crow flying above it. Eventually, Tianming encountered the three-legged Golden Crow near the Fu Sang Sacred Tree. \nThe Mohist School invented a weapon that could transform into various forms, including boomerangs, swords, shields, crossbows, and more. \nShengqi once, in front of Crimson Snake, swallowed a whole venomous snake raised by the Red Lian sect without experiencing any discomfort after that. When Duanmu Rong was in a coma, Crimson Snake added a leaf from the Blood-Stained Jade Leaf Flower to the venom from a Green-Scaled Fiery Snake to cure her. \nButcher Ding is a chef surnamed Ding, and his Butcher's Saber Skill comprises various techniques, each inspired by a specific dish. Butcher Ding passed on his knife skills to Tianming. The unparalleled master of Daoism, Zhuangzi, was amazed by Butcher Ding's extraordinary knife skills. He specifically recorded the exceptional nature of the Butcher's Saber Skill in a section dedicated to the art of nurturing life. \nQin Dynasty musician Kuang Xiu was the sole heir to the musical score \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters.\" Captured for aiding a rebel's escape, he feared the loss of the score and asked Jing Ke to bring it to his friend Gao Jianli. Gao Jianli, receiving the score from Jing Ke, was astonished. Both Gao Jianli and Kuang Xiu were passionate about the art of the qin. They decided to take the risk and meet for the last time in Qin. Outside the city, with Jing Ke's assistance, they disregarded the ambush by the Qin army, playing \"High Mountains, Flowing Waters\" together.

Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets.

One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle.

As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence.

Based on the fact that Sophie received this letter during her assignment, the year should be 1850 AD, the time Tanner carried out his campaign.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[C]]\n\n### Question:\nA philosophical discourse written several years after Sophie's story reflects the author's opinion of her.\nOptions: A. It's true because the author has read Sophie's story and made this deduction and emotion after reading it. ##B. It's true and accurate so that it's written as a review on highly regarded literary works in the archives after passing a review. ##C. It's a metaphor and doesn't necessarily reflect the author's inner thoughts so he writes it down. ##D. It's true and intuitive so the author writes it as an example in his history book.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nThe Central Minister sent an army in 1844 AD TO take Florence, which indicates the Minister's military training in the frontier, just like when Central General Watlon was sent to Dacia to get on the successful track.\nOptions: A. It's true, it shows Humanity and truth because Florence is not a man but a woman. ##B. It's wrong when Tanner writes a better season in early 1843 AD, which contradicts the tag of \"December 1844 AD\" on the dispatch label. ##C. Perhaps this copy of the letter was indeed slightly inaccurate because the duty of commanders did not reach the new scale of Central Government. ##D. From February 1842 AD to November 1844 AD, the city of Florence suffered a long siege, which was finally taken by Tanner during the war.\nProvide your final answer as a single uppercase letter representing the option (A, B, C, or D) and wrap it in double square brackets, like this: [[A]].\n\n### Answer:\n[[D]]\n\n### Question:\nIn Sophie's book collection, the magician appeared as a handsome young man with black hair but after Sophie turned her into an old woman, he appeared white and combed his long blond hair back in shock.\nOptions: A. It can prove that the magician is Howl, with his long blond hair. ##B. Sophomore can't testify, it does not mean Howl, who has black hair. ##C. But not necessarily, from the scroll at the burn's end, symbols will show that the magician appeared as a flaming bird with black hair. ##D.

The civil war that happened between Autobots led by Optimus Prime and Decepticons led by Megatron involved civilian vehicles and military vehicles respectively. Therefore, we need to choose [[A]] as the answer here.\nQ2:  The correct answer is option 'B'. The second-in-command or subordinate to the leader in the Autobots is the Commander. However, keep in mind that other terminology can refer to this role as well such as first-in-command in theory, second-in-command in practice, and many others. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ3: The correct answer is option 'C'. The only concrete way to give life back is, for example, the Allspark, which is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ4: The correct answer is option 'B'. The Matrix of Leadership, commonly referred to as the Allspark or the Transformers, is the heart and soul of all Transformers. They are known as \"T-Coils\" in the Transformers universe and are attached to each Autobot. Therefore, we need to choose [[B]] as the answer here.\nQ5: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. The Transformers universe concept includes an alien planet called Cybertron, a group of Autobots, larger-than-life Transformers, and vehicles capable of transforming. It does not include improving life outcomes as an option. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ6: The correct answer is option 'C'. Beat Box is the leader of the Attack Squad. Beat Box: Autobot, seated, leader of the society Autobot Attack Squad, animated series. He is a goon with a cricket bat who lives in a cabin in the woods. His species was a criminal. Beat Box: Autobot, sounded, leader of the society Autobot Attack Squad, animated series. He is a cricket bat-wielding goon who lives in a cabin in the woods.  His species was criminal. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\nQ7: The correct answer is option 'C'. Energon, which is represented as orange planet with a reason space in the middle, is the type of energy that all Transformers depend on to live fully. This energy is also known as \"T-Cog.\" The red symbols on most Transformer bodies, the purpose of which is not yet clearly understood, may serve as a \"plug-in\" or \"battery\" used to rejuvenate \"T-Cog\" when discharged and drained. Therefore, we need to choose [[C]] as the answer here.\n\nThe question asked for what is NOT part of the Transformers universe concept.\nThe correct four options are as follows:\nOption 1: The correct option is option 'A'. An alien planet called Cybertron as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 2: The correct option is option 'B'. A group of Autobots as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 3: The correct option is option 'C'. Larger-than-life Transformers as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here.\nOption 4: The incorrect answer is option 'D'. Vehicles capable of transforming as described in the question is, therefore, part of the Transformers universe concept, and we can exclude this option here."}

Cybertron was once a peaceful planet ruled by the High Council, the original rulers of Cybertron. However, a rift developed between two key figures: Optimus Prime, who would become the leader of the Autobots, and Megatron, who would become the head of the Decepticons. The inhabitants of Cybertron are mechanical life forms composed of metal and mechanical parts.\nOptimus Prime believes in the freedom of all sentient beings and advocates for a vision of harmonious coexistence. On the other hand, Megatron, initially a gladiator, was disillusioned with the existing system. He envisioned a society ruled by the strongest, leading him to form the Decepticons.\nThe rift between Optimus Prime and Megatron resulted in a civil war that split Cybertronian society into Autobots (primarily civilian vehicles) and Decepticons (mostly military vehicles). The war was so devastating that Cybertron became uninhabitable, causing both Autobots and Decepticons to disperse across the galaxy.\nThe Autobots and Decepticons eventually arrived on Earth, continuing their conflict with Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The ideological differences between their respective leaders—Optimus Prime's belief in freedom and equality versus Megatron's belief in survival of the fittest—continuously drive the conflict.

The war resulted in the fall of Stormwind, leading to the \"Second War,\" which involved expanded alliances on both sides. The \"Second War\" ended with the defeat of the Horde, leading to the imprisonment of the Orcs and a relative peace for humans and their allies.
