I need your help in two puzzles.\n\nThe first puzzle is like this:\nI saw 13 people come out and wear the same shades, yet the colours are different.\nWhat are the same colours of the shades? My answer is [[red]].\n\nThe second puzzle is like this:\nThere are two addicts attending the basketball game. But the score isn’t important. At least it’s 38:38 for me.\nI saw the basketball court that someone was one meter tall in the exact middle of the court. how much dose it appear to the.^{[2]}Point size?\nMy answer is A little bit more than three quarters of an inch.\n\n### Answer\nStudent select what they need for their answer sheets when they sign up, so the professor (![1]///, ![2]///, ![3]///) can be helpful. Additionally, students will decide what they want to use for their measuring sticks. So the right questions are everything that we need to ask them. Well, all genders are included, so there's no specific gender there.\n\nOh, I see! There's too much stuff in these two questions, but I think that part might be unclear to me. It's mainly the \"what do students use?\" part, but that's the A, B, and C parts. Maybe this is a pattern, or a game, like, a horseshoes garden darts, if they want to do \"what do students use- What game they are playing\" but whatever. There's a bit of it.\n\nThat's the puzzle on campus, and it's the same puzzle as the puzzle statement.^{[3]}Do you think they'll always have the same puzzle, which would normally be that you get the phrase, or is that number 7 the total? Is it any word, or is it the number the instructor writes? Or is it the number on the campus walk?\n\nI think it's from the \"play\" stage of Exponentials. I think that that's the same with the puzzle as well. Yeah, I like that. Anagram. Yeah, cool; I'm gonna cut it, yeah. They're all saying, \"Math is the puzzle. It's all art. Yeah, that's really cool.\" It uses the same things as the quad-quad-maybe-obj-obj, so it wouldn't use the above-above."}

Consult the file anytime you need to clarify any ambiguous information related to the rule. The rules.txt contains instructions on how to use the rules.\n\nThe provided `index.ts` and `query.ts` files expect that you have defined a handleRules function.\n\nAdd the file requirementsPuzzle.ts with the following code:\n\n```\nexport default function requirementsPuzzle(rules: string, input: string) {\n    const ruleComponents = rules.split('\\n');\n    const [instructions, riddle] = ruleComponents;\n    const parts = instructions.split(':');\n    console.log('rule: ', parts);\n    const [\n      wordOrPhrase,\n      rearrangeLetters,\n      formWord,\n      requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n      assumptions\n    ] = riddle.trim().split('\\n');\n    console.log('required: ', requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), 'to form: ', formWord, ' using all or some of the ', wordOrPhrase, ', subject to:', assumptions);\n    const solution = solve(rearrangeLetters, formWord, requirementsForLetters(requirementForTheNumberOfLetters, wordOrPhrase), wordOrPhrase);\n    return `\\nThe answer is: {{solution}}`;\n}\n\nfunction requirementsForLetters(number: string, word: string): number[] {\n  return ([] as unknown as number[]).concat(\n    word\n      .trim()\n      .split('')\n      .map(letter => Number.parseInt(letter))\n  )\n    .sort(\n      (x, y) => x - y\n    )\n    .filter(number => ![''.split(','), ''.split('Partition'), 'Split', ''].includes(number))\n    .slice(0, number);\n}\n\nfunction solve(rearrage: string, form: string, reqNumberOfLetter: number[], word: string): string {\n  const wordPieces = word.split(';');\n  const solution = wordPieces\n    .filter(part => reqNumberOfLetter.includes(Number.parseInt(part)))\n    .map(amountLetter => new Array(Number.parseInt(amountLetter)).fill('__').join(''))[0]\n    .split('')\n    .map((letter => rearrage.includes(letter)))\n    .filter((isIncludes) => isIncludes)\n    .map((isIncludes) => rearrage.split('')[rearrage.indexOf(isIncludes)])\n    .join('')\n    .split('')\n    .join('')\n    .concat(' - identified word: ', '''''[''rearrange: '\\'''' + rearrage +''' '' formed:''' + form + '''' ']''')\n    .toUpperCase()\n    .split('')\n    .join('');\n  console.log('Solution: ', solution);\n  return solution;\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe handleRules function is responsible for applying the problem-specific rule defined in `rules.txt` to answer the question given in `query.txt`. It accepts two arguments: rules (`rules.txt`) and query (`query.txt`).\n\nThe code that uses handleRules expects that you have defined a handleRules function.\nTo add file `handleRules.ts` with the following code:\n\n```\nconst rules = fs.readFileSync('rules.txt', 'utf8')\nconst query = fs.readFileSync('query.txt', 'utf8')\n\nconst cipher = require('./cipher.js');\n\n// Define your answerFromRules function here\nfunction handleRules(rules: string, query: string) {\n  const space = rules.includes(':') ? rules.split(':')[1].trim() : false;\n  const riddle = rules.trim();\n  const [instructions, riddle] = riddle.split(' ');\n  console.log('parts: ', instructions, riddle);\n  const parts = instructions.split(':');\n  console.log('parts: ', parts);\n  const [\n    wordOrPhrase,\n    rearrangeLetters,\n    formWord,\n    requirementForTheNumberOfLetters,\n    assumptions\n  ] = riddle.split('\\n');\n  console.log('expected instructions: ', requirementForTheNumberOfLetters);\n  let solution = '';\n\n  if (!rules.startsWith('Special')) {\n    solution = solveCommand(rules, query);\n  } else {\n    console.log('rules: ', rules);\n    const answer = cipher.edit(['Neither'], cipher.decrypt(rules, space));\n    console.log('answer: ', answer);\n    solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n    console.log('solution: ', solution);\n  }\n  return {\n    instruction: instructions,\n    solution: solution.toUpperCase() || ' ',\n  };\n}\n\nexport default handleRules;\n\n\nfunction replaceAll(substitute, source) {\n  console.log('condition: ', substitute.length);\n  for (let i = 0; i < substitute.length; i++) {\n    source = source.replace(substitute[i], substitute[i].toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return source;\n}\n\nfunction solveCommand(rules, query) {\n  let answer = '';\n  // let solution = '';\n  console.log('second: ', rules, query);\n\n  if (rules.includes('use')) {\n    console.log('use: ', rules);\n    console.log('query: ', query);\n    console.log('all letters: ', repeat(1).join(''));\n    console.log('split letter: ', repeat(1).join(','));\n\n    switch (true) {\n      case rules.startsWith('Spell'):\n      case rules.startsWith('Rearranges'):\n      case rules.startsWith('For the': true): // `For the` could be `For the letters`.\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'required',\n          rules\n            .split(':'[1])\n            .join('')\n            .trim()\n            .toUpperCase(),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[1].trim().toUpperCase().substr(0, 10),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[2].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[4].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(/\\:\\s?/g)[5].join('').replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n        ]);\n        solveCommand(answer, query);\n        console.log('querySolve: ', query);\n        query.forEach((query) => {\n          // const toInteger = /\\d/\n          const result = query.toUpperCase().split(/(\\:|\\-)/).map((word) => word.trim());\n          console.log('result: ', result);\n          if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'please') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else if (result[0].toLowerCase() === 'pleaseuse') {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          } else {\n            solution = cipher.decryption(answer, space);\n            console.log('solution: ', solution);\n          }\n        });\n        break;\n      case rules.includes('correctly answer: '): // Yoda never uses \"only\", \"include\", and \"true\".\n        answer = newCypher([\n          'replace',\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n          rules.split(':')[1].trim().substr(2).replace(/\\/\\/\\s+/g, ' '),\n"}

The two or more points j with the letter j are located in the E regular pentagon described by the path AAAABBBBCCCDDDD EE. The two or more I points are located on the EE regular pentagon described by the path AAAA. The two or more j points are located in the EE regular pentagon.\n\nOutput: the coordinates of the positions corresponding to the marking that need to be replaced, each position being separated by a plane breaker at the same time, and each position being concatenated by a comma. The coordinates of each positional position need to be output as follows: the character description of the square is first output, followed by the abscissa (lexicographic order) of the coordinate p, q, r, s, w, h, i, x, followed by the ordinal coordinate q, r, s, w, h, j, u, v, x, where the abscissa is 14-extraction and the ordinal coordinate is 12- departure. For example, for A9 - A60, the coordinate stored in this place corresponds to the A9 point. h10 corresponds to the position of the u25 point. Here, capital letters on the same row have different capital letters.\n\nExample:\nInput:\nAABBDDEFFGGHHIJKLLMNNNOOOORRSS\n[a60:m25; w20:g5]\n[j4:a(3); h8:b(2); g8:a(3)]\n[i19:m5; j2:a(3); g2:a(3)]\nOutput:\noutput in the format as shown above, use a comma-separated sequence to connect each coordinate element, the coordinates of each element is represented in the form of character p, q separated by a semicolon (:), where p is the 14bit abscissa and q is the 12bit ordinal coordinate, each coordinate element use line break to above and below, sequence order: first input sequence from top to bottom, then intercept the corresponding p and q elements, last output from top to bottom.

Wrap the entire answer in double square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n![image 1]\n\nIn this example, we have the following input:\n\nacross words: LOVE TENET PIXAC\ndown words: TEVE TOLP LIVE\n\nThe matrix is as follows:\n\nX X X X\nX X X 0\n0 X X X\n\nThe answer should be given from left to right, top to bottom. In this case, it would be [[LOVE],[TEVE],[LIVETE]], but it should not be displayed like that. It should be wrapped with double square brackets and separated by commas. The final output should look like this: [[\"LOVE\"],[\"TEVE\"],[\"LIVETE\"]]\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first row is the list of words for filling in. LOVE goes from left to right.\n- The next row is the list of words separator. TEVE goes from top to bottom.\n- The next row goes back to words. PIXAC continues from left to right.\n- The next row goes back to separators. LIVE continues from top to bottom.\n- The replacements should be done in the matrix given.\n\nNote that the rewriting of the example is done in such a way that the words are displayed depending on how they were given in the task. This is important because remember that the words separated by separators do not constitute the final solution but are used only for understanding.\n\nAs part of the solution, it is also necessary to put spaces between each separation. This is because the strings obtained in this way are merged together, without any additional information between them.\n\n![image 1]\n\n---\nInstructions\n---\n1. Thoroughly understand the rule provided in the question and apply it accordingly.\n2. Follow the instructions and process the words in the grids accordingly, replacing X and 0 accordingly.\n3. Separate elements within rows by spaces and wrap the entire array in double square brackets. You can use the ' Join(') function for this task.\n4. Output the correct format where squared brackets are wrapped."}
