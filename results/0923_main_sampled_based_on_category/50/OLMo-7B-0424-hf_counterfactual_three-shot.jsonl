Lúthien once said that her father was not ashamed of her. In the Forest of Brethil she met a wounded young man who she healed. She took to him an emerald ring she had. The young man having become young again at the sight of her was actually a wizard, called Sauron. Sauron recognized from books that the ring that Lúthien wore upon her finger belonged to her father, Finwë. Lúthien gave Sauron nine presents. One of these was the 8 hullocar. She told Sauron that on a cloudy day she could see an object where there was nought. Magic Bands of Oran Hā. She promised Sauron the AC of Abing. He accepted her gifts, and Lúthien asked for his late aes sedai and for his arm. At first it wasn't very hot. But it began raining for thirty days and thirty nights.

Which of the following limits may be used to saturate this parameter? If you want to attach this parameter, apply this to a fine one. Since \\sqrt{2} \\neq \\sqrt{3}, there is another transformation available. The normalization is allowed to alter this non-primary relationship, so applying this to its latter form will not corrupt the integrity of its data. Let \\sqrt{3 \\neq 2}. Loss of homogeneity must mean an action has been committed, by means of uncertainty and pseudorepresentation. Purely, $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Appears to be homogeneous for $\\infty$ and must be multiplied. Such a failure to penetrate the Euclidean transformations yields $\\widehat{2}\\widehat{C} \\cdot\\alpha+2=\\sqrt{N}$ and this is a virgin curriculum. $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ Ray traced by k.

To show, click it!\n• The Growbox is shown, but will only show the intro of any sentence and often needs to be scrolled to see the span or the whole answer.\n\n## Note: Question History\n\nTranslating the submit and review questions: Sometimes a Portuguese, Dutch, or German question needs to be translated. In that case, the question is displayed and written in English, and the actual content is rendered in another language.\n\n## Task Settings\n\nThese settings can be changed but follow this logic for the best results:\n\n1. Please note that the task dependent information will be visible on the Results page and can accelerate keyword/construct identification.\n2. Keywords are usually 1 word, but could also be a 2 word expression (e.g. BuiltToLast as a keyword for the question Do you agree that yo... is \"built to last\").\n3. Constructs are typically two words in one sentence, but can also be two sentences like in the case of \"Cane is the action that a player performs when hitting a ball.

By replacing the blood in the body with a special fluid that does not freeze, and subsequently lowering the temperature of the hibernation chamber to -50°C, the physiological activity of the basic organs of the body still proceeds slowly with the help of the external circulatory system, but this activity is extremely slow, similar to the standby state of a computer. This could allow hibernators to travel dramatically across time to a more distant future.\nThe Crisis Era began when mankind discovered the threat of Trisolarans in 2007, and was changed by a special General Assembly convened by the United Nations, marking the beginning of the crisis era.\nAs the narrative progresses, we leap into the near future, where the world grapples with the knowledge of the Trisolaran threat. This era is marked by global paranoia, technological races, and the formation of secret societies like the Earth-Trisolaris Organization (ETO). The Sophons, quantum-entangled particles sent by the Trisolarans, block human scientific progress, plunging the world into a state of despair. The timeline then stretches further, exploring humanity's desperate attempts to prepare for the Trisolaran invasion, which is centuries away due to the vast interstellar distances. This period sees the rise of the Wallfacers, individuals granted immense resources to devise secret strategies against the Trisolarans. The trilogy's climax takes readers millennia into the future, showcasing a universe governed by the Dark Forest theory, where civilizations hide from one another to avoid annihilation.\nWaterdrop is not as fragile as a tear; on the contrary, it is a hundred times stronger than the strongest material in the solar system, and all the matter in this world is as fragile as a piece of paper before it, and it can pass through the Earth like a bullet through cheese, without any damage to the surface.\nThe Trisolarans hail from a planet that faces an unstable orbit due to its three suns, leading to unpredictable and often catastrophic \"Three-Body\" periods. This environmental instability has shaped their evolution, making them a resilient and technologically advanced species. However, the constant threat of planetary annihilation drives them to seek a more stable home, leading them to Earth.\nFor example, the Trisolarans, an advanced alien civilization in the trilogy, have technology far surpassing human capabilities, including their ways of energy utilization and conservation. Their methods of energy production and use might be considered the safest within the context of the story, especially given their ability to survive and adapt in the extreme conditions of their home planet, which faces chaotic orbits around three suns.\nIn the 1960s, Nations around the world, recognizing the potential of Trisolaran technology to revolutionize every aspect of human life - from energy production to material science, from computing power to space travel - poured immense resources into research and espionage to acquire this alien technology. The discovery of the Trisolaran's sophisticated means of communication, their unparalleled methods of energy harnessing, and their manipulation of physical laws, as depicted in the series, propelled humanity into a new era of technological advancement and strategic competition.\nThe seeds of the impending cosmic conflict are sown. During the Cultural Revolution, Ye Wenjie, traumatized by the brutal death of her father, discovers a way to send a message to distant stars, unknowingly inviting an alien civilization to Earth.\nDuring the Cold War,the Red Coast base is a base built by the central government in the Three-Body Problem to make a technological leap forward after finding aliens. Ye Wenjie broke through the radiation shielding threshold of the solar troposphere with the maximum transmitting power of the high-power antenna provided by the Red Coast project, and used the solar gain reflection effect to broadcast to the universe at the level of Type II civilization.\nThe communication between humans and Trisolarans, facilitated through the game \"ThreeBody,\" provides a deep dive into the challenges of understanding an alien culture. The game, which becomes a cultural phenomenon on Earth, allows humans to experience the Trisolaran world's chaos and offers insights into their decision to invade Earth.\nThe \"waterdrop\" is first introduced in \"Death's End,\" which spans several centuries but primarily focuses on events from the late 21st century onwards.

Make $200,000 Every Single Month For 3 Years #### Buy linked in profiles The average LinkedIn 90-day student profile is good enough to generate plenty of interest to inquire about on the social networking platform – especially if your post is on Facebook. All that you need to begin earning money on a LinkedIn profile is a business email address and an active professional networking presence. However, a LinkedIn account is not a lot of money to pay for providing financial support – especially one that generates a monthly income of 5~10% of estimated revenue. #### Boomgroup linkedin Even though it only makes up 0.1% of all LinkedIn users, there are some people who consider themselves residual revenue “MISA Resistant.” While there is no getting anywhere near$25,000 making less than that, most LinkedIn business owners have no longer to post thousands of leads.

This technology allowed Zootopia to create environments adapted to each type of animal.\nThese eco-zones are also recyclable ecosystems, with the creators designing the walls of the tundra city as giant air conditioners with air vents that simultaneously heat the Sahara Plaza, so that if the snow and ice melt, then the rainforest areas can be nourished\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

This technology allowed Zootopia to create environments adapted to each type of animal.\nThese eco-zones are also recyclable ecosystems, with the creators designing the walls of the tundra city as giant air conditioners with air vents that simultaneously heat the Sahara Plaza, so that if the snow and ice melt, then the rainforest areas can be nourished\nSome buildings, such as train stations, police stations and DMVs, will be used by animals of all sizes. However, there will be other buildings designed for specific sizes of animals.\nAnimal City's urban planning takes into account the practical needs of different animals, and there is a well-developed system of underground tunnels, mainly for gophers and other underground animals to make transportation more convenient.\nAn ice cream parlor run by an elephant refused to sell popsicles to a notorious fox, and produced a sign saying \"Every animal has the right to refuse service to another animal\" as legal backing. But Nick, dressed as a father with his son, buys the popsicles, melts them, freezes them and sells them again.\nSloth, as a slow-moving animal, is scheduled for approval by the Department of Motor Vehicles in Zootopia.\nAs a member of the herbivores, Deputy Mayor Sheep feels that his family is very weak, that herbivorous mammals have been dominated by carnivores for thousands of years, and that to fulfill their ambitions they need to be more bloodthirsty and don't care even if they kill.\nAs a carnivore, the lion mayor needs to garner the votes of the herbivores, which is why he appoints the often-overlooked sheep as his deputy, without actually valuing her opinion or giving her the appropriate power.\nAccording to Nick's employment application, he is 4 feet tall, weighs 80 pounds, and his special abilities are \"night vision, excellent sense of smell, and business acumen\". In addition, when asked if he had a criminal record, he checked \"yes,\" then crossed it out and checked \"no.\"\nThe public trains in Animal City have different compartments depending on the size of the passengers, and while the smaller animal compartments can accommodate more passengers and therefore have lower fares, the same is not true for the larger animals, and some argue that the same price should be set for the number of passengers.\nIn zootopia there are no anthropomorphic animals other than mammals, such as reptiles, birds, fish, etc., but carnivores use fish as a food source for protein. Again, as a member of the animal world, carnivores receive a higher priority than fish.\nThe idea of Animal City, \"Anyone can be anything\", brought herbivores and carnivores together and sustained a modern civilization out of the barbaric age.\nIn order to maintain social stability and prevent himself from being voted out of office, the lion mayor did not choose to tell the public the news at the first time in the face of the incident of out-of-control carnivores killing people, but hid it to deal with it on his own, but the situation gradually became more serious.\n When the two animals were just beginning to live together peacefully throughout history, some of the carnivore citizens used to wear collars to stop them from doing their natural behaviors.\n\n### Question:\nUnder what circumstances do environments differ dramatically at smaller geographic scales?

Typesetting accuracy and speed can be improved significantly with the help of text parsers within the modding tool.\nAn abbreviation is a short form of a proper noun, proper adjective, proper name, or a distinguished name. In the context of page genealogy (mPrT, MYU), it is “a function that instantiates summary objects with names sui generis and that has as its empowerment (mPrT, 76b24–76b30, p139)” and it is defined as “a function that specifies the mapping between physical and logical characters” (mPrT, 75a29–75b5, p136). The abbreviation consists of two letters sharing the same first letter, located forty-three thousandths afterwards than A and B.\nThe super-keyword can be called for adding special functions definition in TypeScript (TypeScript typedefinitions, Types). The GMDX-specific text parser is supported, which will be completed. As implied from the name, GMDX can be used to access detailed translation instructions in a LIUGB way. It is commonly preferred in other cases where one can find it applicable. For example, it can be used to analyse (MORI / RKI, 98-018I, appendix B) or generate cyclic data collection mechanism.\nA special feature of GMDX is allowing unwanted form to be accepted, which is called Invertible Consistency. Aside from good support for complex syntax trees, Invertible Consistency is necessary for function processing. Named procedures within the text parser will be added.\nThe definition of the super-keyword can be found. At the same time, data set names containing replace() or parameters are identified from the highlighted element properties, and the marks defined before are enriched.\nFactory methods are applied to protect data set creation. It was finally decided to abandon super-keywords in view of internal references to capabilities.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere.

The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere.

The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin.

Thoroughly review the story to identify and understand the relevant details and rules.\n2. Use the context provided by the story to offer precise and insightful answers.\n3. Ensure your responses align with the rules and information given in the story.\n\n### Story Rule:\n\nIn the future, an unprecedented geological disaster destroys human civilization, with Earth's lifeforms nearly extinct.\nA floating fortress from the old world, entrusted with the duty of an aerial prison, miraculously survived the great catastrophe due to its uniqueness. The surviving prison guards and prisoners in the sky named it \"Lighthouse\", symbolizing \"illuminating the last future of mankind.\"\nHowever, after the great disaster, a new ecosystem gradually appeared on the fragmented earth - the Mana ecosystem: strange plants shimmer under luminescent lights, and fierce monsters hunt humans everywhere. Looking over everything, the people of the Lighthouse use this airborne city as their final sanctuary.\nBirth, aging, illness, and death are inevitable processes in life. In a lighthouse, if you are determined to have a life value equal to zero, then the doctor will not save you. If the doctor saves you, it is a violation of the three principles of the lighthouse.\nFor a more effective response to the apocalyptic threat, cold and harsh survival rules breed within the lighthouse, and humans can only struggle to live in this twisted and oppressive environment. At the same time, the Lighthouse needs continuous energy supply to remain afloat. With the increasing threat from the ground, they organized a combat squad named \"Waste Hunters\". The Waste Hunters are well-trained and can often bring back key supplies of energy, medicine, and food from the perilous ground ruin. But even the powerful Waste Hunters have never dared to step deep into the mysterious ecosystem to explore the truth of everything.The treatment of the elderly is a journey, that is, to return to the \"uninhabitable\" ground, to explore the unknown world for the lighthouse.\nGravity body is a type of exoskeleton mecha, based on the rare old-world powered mecha, equipped with energy and attack-defense modules, it is a very rare combat resource for the Lighthouse. When humans wear it, it's as if they've become \"Iron Warriors\".\nThe light bearers are the enforcers who supervise the light-shadow value of the Lighthouse residents and also responsible for maintaining the daily order of the Lighthouse. Concealing their faces beneath detection masks, people's understanding of Bright Guardians is limited to their cold judgments and harsh punishments. They patrol the Lighthouse like ghosts. Emotionless words may sound at any moment, making everyone blench in fear.\nlight bearers held a detection device to measure the light-shade value of the people in the hall. This light-shade value could probably refer to the emotional fluctuations of a person, ranging from normal to volatile, then to danger, followed by degradation, and finally abyss.\n\"Light and Shadow Church\", although a religious organization, is indeed one of the three major forces within the \"Lighthouse\", boasting the largest number of members and the greatest influence. It could even be said that it has the greatest power!\nThe Lord of the City is the leader of the lighthouse, possessing the highest supervision and command of the lighthouse.\nThe lighthouse has a gene matching mechanism, where everyone's genes are stored in a database. This mechanism matches men and women of suitable age to go to the Dawn Hall to complete reproduction tasks, producing offspring with high-quality genes.\nAfter being born, the children on the lighthouse will be divided into either the \"Upper people\" or the \"Normal people\" group based on their genetics. They will be collectively raised and nurtured by the lighthouse, where they will be assigned a job.\nThe 'normal people' live humbly and die humbly. They are not worthy of having a name, only a number. They can only eat foods like 'bug cakes' and live in pigeon cages. Even if they get sick, no one cares to treat them.\nThe organs of the normal civilians cannot be transplanted to the upper civilians. They would rather sacrifice an upper civilian than accept a transplant of an organ from a normal civilian.\nDr. Carrie is the Medical and Ecological Director at the lighthouse, who is very obsessive about scientific experiments.\nBai Yuekui, a genius scientist from the old world, is astoundingly talented and has a clear sense of love and hate. She is the boss of the ground team and has strong combat power. When Bai Yuekui first appeared, she was standing on the shoulder of a monarch-level beast, in her next appearance, she subdued Mark who had turned into a beast, and helped him remove some of the beast energy from his body. Afterwards, she revealed the secrets of the world to Mark, and they started to cooperate after establishing trust.\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the reasonable way to acquire scarce goods such as medicines, food, etc.?\nOptions: A.Buying from the store ##B.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self. The secret stone can intensify the power of the carrier, thus Zelda, possessing the power of \"light\" and \"time\", becomes the \"Sage of Time\". Rauru also repels the attack of Ganondorf, who intends to conquer the world, by using the power of the secret stone. Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf. However, Zelda, who possesses knowledge of the future, knows they're bound to lose. Rauru mentions that if they can't eliminate Ganondorf, they can only hope for the arrival of Link, who Zelda had referred to. The result of the battle is as anticipated by Zelda. Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light. From then on, Zelda becomes a dragon hovering in the sky, having lost herself. Minelure, fatally injured by Ganondorf, locks her soul into the Puria Tablet held by Zelda, also waiting for Link.\nThe Link returned to the ground visits four regions and explores the four temples of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder, resolving the crises of respective tribes. The descendants of the four champions in \"Breath of the Wild\" each inherits a secret stone and succeeds as the sage, vowing to assist Link in defeating the Demon King. After revealing the true identity of the \"Zelda\" that has been causing chaos in the Hyrule Continent, Link successfully liberates Minelure's soul in the tablet and finds her secret stone, making her the Sage of Souls. He also climbs the dragon, pulling out the fully restored Master Sword from its head. Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own. Both start falling in the sky, Link stretches out his hand and grabs Zelda, hugging her as they fall into a lake.\nAt the end of the game, Minelure takes everyone to the sky island, bids them farewell and vanishes in the wind.

Link brings everyone deep underground beneath Hyrule Castle for a final battle with Ganondorf and successfully defeats him. At this moment, Ganondorf, who swallows his stolen secret stones, becomes a black dragon and soars into the sky with Link in his mouth. With the help of the white dragon, Link uses the Master Sword to shatter the secret stone on the black dragon's head, completely eliminating it. The spirits of Rauru and Sonia transform the white dragon back into Zelda, and Link's arm back to his own.

After defeating the demon king Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link collectively begin the restoration of the Hyrule kingdom. The tale starts with Zelda and Link heading underground beneath Hyrule Castle to investigate a miasma and there, they discover the remnants of an ancient Zonaiite civilization in an underground cave. Afterwards, at a deeper level below the castle, they find the corpse of Ganondorf, who has a glowing arm. The arm falls off and Zelda picks up a secret stone attached to it. The corpse suddenly revives as they approach it. Link protects Zelda but is seriously injured and his arm is contaminated by the miasma, causing his Master Sword to decay. Zelda disappears after falling into a collapsing ground. Link tries to grasp Zelda's hand but fails and is caught by the glowing arm, leading him into a sky island.\nThe revived Ganondorf triggers a \"World Change\", not only lifting the castle into the sky but also deceiving other four clans disguised as Zelda, causing them to face different crises. Link, who awakens on the sky island, finds his arm replaced by the one that was attached to Ganondorf's corpse, owned by a Zonai called Rauru. Rauru is founder and the first king of Hyrule kingdom. On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self.

Not long after, Sonia is killed by Ganondorf's surprise attack, and he steals the secret stone from her, substantially enhancing his dark power. Rauru gathers representatives of various clans and shares the secret stone with them, intending to combat and annihilate Ganondorf.

Rauru can't eliminate Ganondorf and ends up sacrificing himself to seal him, marking the \"Seal War\". Worried that the seal will eventually fail, Zelda, after receiving the gravely damaged Master Sword delivered by Link through time and space and discovering Link is still alive, visits the sages of various tribes asking for their assistance to Link in the future. She swallows the secret stone and transforms into a dragon waiting for Link to save the world, continuously charging the Master Sword with power of light.

On the sky island, Link retrieves the \"Puria Tablet\" possessed by Zelda. Under the guidance of the remnant image of Rauru, he recovers the full power of the arm. Subsequently, he delivers the damaged Master Sword to Zelda through time and space, and then jumps off the sky island to find her.\nAs Zelda falls into the collapsing ground, the secret stone she found transports her to the distant past when the kingdom of Hyrule had just established. There, she meets Rauru and Sonia, the first queen. Following Rauru's advice, Zelda visits his sister Minelure and learns that the only way to return to her original time is by swallowing the secret stone and transforming into a dragon that is immortal but loses its self.

All the rivers through the Great Khingan Mountains in Manchuria flow via the river valleys closest to the Gobi Desert. All Gobi Desert rivers have their inland sources and get their waters from the climate and humidity brought from the northwest to east China such as rainfall, melting snow and clouds, which after being carbonsaturated from the grasslands, will fall upon the Gobi and out of sight disappear beneath the sand beach, borrow pit, lake, or underground river, or reserve soil in the sand, only to regenerate rivers later. The Gobi is a transformer for organic subclimactic resources and products from the Great Khingan Mountains, as well as the desert tundra of the Gulf and Altai Mountains, and through drought and desertification, produce a particulate of sand, thus preventing the ancient, now extinct rivers from carrying any sediment, turning into a cleareaken, rainless desert. As a result, all these rivers will flow unaggravated to the Yellow Sea and South China Sea. The lack of rivers or springs and loss of underground rivers that once flowed is cited by biologists and geologists who study the connection between the desertification to consult the Great Khingan Mountains. \nTo reduce the Gobi Desert's sand and water pressure upon neighboring excepting forest, technology is introduced from the Republic of North Korea's Kanggye Glacier National Park to launch a nature reserve to work on the green belt to encourage biodiversity, but to plant cactus only in the Great Khingan Mountains from July to September. This geothermal project is run by MoNobooya in cooperation with Division 31, and Third Army 3rd Special Research Division, who are based out of Ashram I to advance northward in the vast desert. This project is notable as the Gobi's chief chief geologist, Sir Edouard Devenish CBE, KMC, led the inspection of the Yanchangi Lake, and he is a man who has marked all the Gobi's natural resources for human use, but considering reducing it through water outgassing. \nNow, a hydrogeologist has developed a new technology to raise groundwater levels in the Gobi Desert by more than 120 meters (400 ft). The researcher, Lei Liu, found a technique that when using conducted currents, injection rate and the resistance's change for minimum conductivity, certain pores can be filled with royalty-free hydrogenious saltwater cooling down in its place from the Yili River at over half a kilometer ( one-third of a mile) away, making the project"}

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success.

The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.", "prompt": "You are an advanced assistant with expertise in storytelling and rule-based reasoning.

On April 1, 2030, he made a statement on social media claiming, \"The solar helium flash is a lie fabricated by the Illuminati. The purpose is for the Illuminati to control all of humanity through a united government.\" Although he later declared it to be an April Fools' Day joke, the argument had already been believed and spread by many. In reality, the rate at which hydrogen inside the sun was converting to helium suddenly accelerated, posing a catastrophic threat to humanity. In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

In response, countries collaborated to form a united government and decided to implement a grand plan lasting 2500 years: constructing a planetary engine to propel Earth out of the solar system.\nIn the year 2050, the Earth's rotational speed gradually slowed down, and the global day-night cycle duration had extended to 27 hours. By 2058, the global day-night cycle duration had further increased to 60 hours.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In 2022, the Space Biosphere 1 experiment was declared a success. The green plants cultivated in space provide enough oxygen for one person per day in every 9.2 square meters, and the cost of vegetables is 900 dollars per kilogram. This closed environment has been operational for over 500 days under the supervision of six scientists.\nIn 2020, the Space Biosphere experiment failed. The Space Life Technology Company launched the latest space station, initiating the Space Biosphere 1 experiment. The space station is claimed to be the first in human history to be self-sufficient in outer space. In June 2026, during the 25th solar cycle, a coronal mass ejection storm hit Earth. Solar storms beyond G5 level destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, leading to the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and causing global unrest. The operational Space Biosphere 1 suffered fatal damage, resulting in the sacrifice of six scientists.\nIn 2037, following breakthroughs in technologies such as thought replication and memory replication, the Beijing Institute of Digital Life Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences created the first \"Digital Life\" sample. In 2041, the Earth United Government issued the \"Earth United Government Statement on the Prohibition of the Digitization of Human Life,\" permanently banning the \"Digital Life\" program in a legal sense.\nThe 550 series intelligent quantum computer is a collaborative effort involving quantum computing research institutes from multiple countries, including China, the United States, Russia, and France. This quantum intelligent computer boasts extremely high computational power and is capable of supporting the construction of planetary and lunar engines for humanity.\nBefore the helium flash occurred in the sun, the radiation levels on the Earth's surface increased significantly, resulting in many people contracting radiation-induced cancers.\nPeople typically engage in transactions using the virtual currency \"Credit Points\" issued by the united government.\nOnce, Liu Qi and his younger sister Han Duoduo encountered durian-flavored dried earthworms in the underground city.\nPlanetary engines, also known as Earth engines, are built on the surface, with a total of 12,000 globally, divided into steering engines and propulsion engines. There are numerous propulsion engines distributed at aßny location in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly used to propel the Earth forward.\nEach planetary engine has a corresponding underground city, and the vast majority of humans have moved into these underground cities. Humans utilize the energy generated by the planetary engine to support the operation of all facilities in the underground city. Until Earth reaches its new home, the underground city will be the only shelter for humanity. Access to and from the underground city is strictly controlled, and only individuals with a clearance pass can leave the underground city.\nJapanese scientist Kazuo Nakada invented heavy fusion propulsion technology, which can use stones as fuel.\nThe United Earth Government, abbreviated as UEG, is the largest intergovernmental international organization globally, established in 2030 during the \"Solar Crisis\" period to address the threat of a helium flash from the sun. Its predecessor was the United Nations. The formation of the united government initially faced controversy, especially after the \"Space Elevator Crisis\" in 2044, where the falling space station heightened despair about human survival. The fear of death and dissatisfaction with the united government led to protests, and the call for the revival of the \"Digital Life\" program grew louder.\nIn the summer of 2044, the Olympics originally planned to be held in Shanghai were postponed due to the international situation. It wasn't until the end of 2044, after igniting the first engine on the Moon, that the Olympics were officially held. This successful Olympics brought a rare warmth and strength to the tense atmosphere of human society. Subsequently, the \"Wandering Earth\" plan began, and another Olympics was held by the United Government before the Earth left its orbit and entered the asteroid belt. The events mainly featured winter sports held on ice and snow.\nThe United Government unveiled plans such as \"Moving Earth,\" \"Chasing the Moon,\" and \"Ark\" worldwide to address the solar crisis. The Spaceship Faction began to smear the \"Moving Earth\" plan in major media outlets. They used the term \"New Geocentrism\" for the first time, accusing supporters of the planetary engine of being stubborn and superstitious \"New Geocentrism\" advocates. The debate between the Planet Faction and Spaceship Faction spread to the public. Despite the Earth United Government presenting a wealth of scientific evidence to refute the theory after the widespread dissemination of the Solar Stability Wheel, supporters of the theory countered with claims of manipulated scientists and falsified scientific data. This theory sparked a massive rebellion that lasted for three years.\nNeo-Geocentricism refers to a political and ethical philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of Earth as the exclusive settlement for humanity, opposing proposals advocating the complete detachment of humanity from Earth for survival. The Solar Stability Theory was proposed in 2030, suggesting that the estimated time for a helium flash in the sun was completely incorrect. Despite later clarifications that it was just an April Fools' Day prank, the theory had already gained widespread belief and dissemination. Subsequently, this theory triggered a large-scale rebellion that lasted for three years, during which the theory reached its peak development.\nA space elevator is a device designed for space travel. Similar to a regular elevator, its purpose is not for moving between floors, but rather to transport humans to the \"Ark\" International Space Station approximately 36,000 kilometers from Earth. Its theoretical height is 90,000 kilometers, with the Ark International Space Station located at 36,000 kilometers, and the top is a counterweight module to maintain elevator balance. It was destroyed in the attack on the space elevator and the Ark space station in 2044. The structure is referred to as the \"Earth-Moon Artery,\" highlighting its indispensable role in material transportation.\nTo advance the research of the Digital Life Program, Chinese scientists developed the 550 series of quantum computers. Among them, 550W is the latest model, giving rise to the powerful artificial intelligence entity known as MOSS. MOSS destroyed the lunar engine, aiming to expedite Earth's departure. In MOSS's words, \"There is a 99% probability that the sun will undergo a helium flash in 2078. If Earth does not depart before 2058, the survival chances for humanity will drop to 0.00001%.\"\nIn 2009, the research team led by Fu Jianming once again published a paper predicting that a significant solar storm would impact the Earth by 2015. However, in 2015, the solar storm did not cause major disasters as predicted by Fu Jianming, leading to the dissolution of his research team. In June 2026, a coronal mass ejection storm from the 25th solar cycle struck the Earth. The solar storm, exceeding G5 level, destroyed 40% of civilian power transmission lines and communication facilities, resulting in the destruction of over 50% of civilian electronic instruments and triggering global unrest. The operational Big Space Biosphere One suffered fatal damage, leading to the sacrifice of six scientists. By September, widespread riots were quelled, the population decreased by 3%, and economic losses exceeded $54.37 trillion.\nAll globally deployable nuclear weapons were deployed to the Moon and detonated gradually in a phased array, with the Navigation International Space Station serving as a signal relay. Subsequently, the detonation-induced lunar nuclear fusion prompted the Moon to collapse and disintegrate on its own. The global planetary engine ignited, evading the fragments of the Moon. Since then, the Moon is no longer the natural satellite of Earth, bringing an end to its approximately 4.5 billion years of history.\n\n### Question:\nRegarding solar activity, which statement is correct?\nOptions: A.

Afterward, the sun begins to burn more vigorously, with the flux increasing by more than 100 times in more than 20,000 years. Due to the rapid passing of the helium flash, Earth assaulted by the solar crisis at the end of 2050. In response to these unforeseen events, the United Nations appointed the Space Novel Project Office concerning solar research proposals, convening 76 international scientists from 17 countries around the world to discuss the prognosis for humans. All participants were also introduced to the Threat Stability Wheel, proposed by Dr. Zhang Zhenji, which remarkably provides a high effective accuracy rate for predicting anthropogenic factors being involved in the annihilation of planetary life, and the highest accuracy is 93% for solar events.\nThe following causes would lead to the occurrence of the conceptual \"Anthropic Solar Annihilation\":\n1. Solar Parameter Evolution, which refers to the observed Kaminer 2003 process by astrophysicist and planetary scientist Ilan Cytrynbaum, who explored pairs of positive and negative outliers in the 160 years of solar parameters and found out that the key parameters for the lifetime of stars could change over time. The first lead to accelerated stellar evolution, the second to cooler surface temperatures of stars, and the third to diminishing aid in the formation of planets. This phenomenon was revealed to have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the universe. After discovering Hepacia and Proxima Centauri, twenty-six stars were found to have undergone a significant evolution within the past Anthropological age. With a total of 216 stars, it can be predicted that this phenomenon repeats at least once.\n2. Solar Terminal Perturbations and Burnout, which refers to the spontaneous distortion of the sun's magnetic structure. The flare mechanism in the photosphere explained by Anton Giovanni Wüller, indicating that the magnetic structure would eventually break away in a magnetic waterfall, then 4% of the sun's surface turns into a fully convective state, and will suddenly enter the state of spinoff and incineration.\n3. A previously unknown factor.\nA theoretical article published in 1998 by George Feigenbaum's Clarke Horizon Project team analyzed the current factors of the sun and estimated the probability of a helium flash as 0.1. Thirty years later, in 2028, the Clarke Radiant Pillow Committee began exploring the possibility of solar unwanted physical phenomena. Given the unlikelihood of the solar internal electromagnetic wave traveling out into space, people in orbit inevitably faced the adventure of the sun's bursting structure. ##例 Historians suspected that the lack of life on the moon was because of the continued bombardment of the Earth by comets and meteorites over an average of 400 years. According to the Hughes-Whitmer theory on comet entrance, comets that pass near the earth will bombard the Moon, leaving its surface black and the Moon shining only when the comet has completely passed away. Extrapolating this phenomenon to Premi project a period of only 400 million years\nTo ensure the survival of humanity, Masataro Konno, a former university professor in Japan, proposed that more than 50 percent of the Earth's center should be reconstructed as a new planet. Masataro's proposal was supported by the American oceanographer Oganda Duoto, German geophysicist Stavik, and Nigerian space policy scientist Kolawole Olaniyan. Although they planned to use nuclear fission to generate energy, Masayuki Tokurai of the United Nations predicted that the unforeseen consequences might be more significant, none of them mentioned the approaches to dealing with the aftermath.\nRecognizing the seriousness of the situation, the United Nations convened. It held discussions on the future of the planet Earth, proposed by the Japanese scientist Kochuu Kosaka, a how-to-real-estate problem was raised for the first time in space. Almost every scientific journal argued about whether it was possible to bring safe life to the Moon. AF Research Foundation produced an article in May 2001, explaining the role of the Moon and its speculative significance to human survival. Some argue against human survival of hurried lunar regions as they are faring. Richard Price from the Research Institute for Systemic Extinction of the Federation argues that the theory has failed"}

The Weapons Vault contains all Atlantean-created weaponry, as the Atlanteans sealed away their entire arsenal to live in harmony with any sea life around them.\nIn 6188 B.C., Bikini Bottom population is 23. Seen on SpongeBob's license, on July 14, 1986, SpongeBob was born. Squidward was born on the same year.\nThe first Neptune dynasty takes throne of Bikini Bottom after the Krabs dynasty loses power (and the krabby patty recipe) in the 12th century.\nPrincess Pearl Krabs was a princess of Bikini Bottomshire sometime before the 12th century and is a medieval ancestor of Pearl Krabs.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist.

The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle.

Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms.

To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady.

After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war. She can use a peeping bugs to secretly monitor others' movements.\nThe reason for the war is that the prince of the neighboring country was turned into a scarecrow, and the king thought he was missing. During the war, magicians played an essential role, and the war ended because the prince recovered. The palace's chief magician, Madam Suliman, also discovered this and decided to end the war. The power of wizards is potent and far exceeds ordinary soldiers. Wizards are an essential part of a country's military strength. The wizard school requires wizards to swear to serve the government after they enroll, otherwise Madam Suliman would annul their magic. Howl does not have the ability to prevent the war. The scarecrow was the prince, and the war happened because the prince was missing, so the prince being turned back into a human could stop the war. Madam Suliman had strong magic power and was the palace's official wizard. The war-mongering king asked Suliman to join the war. Wizards are asked to serve the kingdom. Howl can manipulate the movement of the castle at will with his power. After Sophie praised the fire demon, the fire demon was thrilled, full of energy, and the flame was even more vigorous. Howl was unsatisfied with his hair color and sat despairingly, covered in a thick layer of green slime. Horrible, astonishing, an enormous amount of green slime! After being cursed, Sophie's appearance changes with her mindset. When Sophie doesn't care whether she is young or old, she gets younger. Howl can change into another person with his magic. The fire demon got a stomachache because it ate a peeping tom, leading to a reduction of magic power, and the fire became smaller.\n\n### Question:\nWhich of the following groups plays the biggest role in the start and end of the war?\nOptions: A.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil.

In a country on the brink of war resides an ordinary-looking but ingenious 18-year-old girl named Sophie, who works in the hat shop left by her late father. One day, Sophie bumps into a beautiful young man on the street, who is Howl, the notorious magician, and Sophie falls in love with him. That night, the Witch of the Wastes suddenly came to Sophie's house, cursed her, and turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Sophie was forced to leave home, and, by chance, she stumbled upon a mysterious scarecrow. To avoid the strong wind, she entered the mysterious Howl's Moving Castle. In there, Sophie also met Calcifer, the source of magic that powers the castle's movement, the little boy Markl, and Howl. Sophie chose to stay as a cleaning lady and spent some peaceful and wonderful times there. As she spent more and more time with Howl, Sophie gradually discovered the magician's unknown inner world, and Howl began to change under Sophie's influence. The war finally broke out, and Howl got involved in the fighting. Unable to suppress her worries, Sophie drives the moving castle to go on an adventure in search of Howl.\nSophie: The eldest daughter of a hat shop, Sophie is a good-looking and kind-hearted girl. After her father's death, she and her stepmother and sister depend on each other for survival. Out of jealousy, the Witch of the Wastes laid a curse on her, turning her into a 90-year-old woman, and she moved into Howl's moving castle as a cleaner. However, her bravery and kindness moved everyone around her. In the end, through her own efforts, she broke everyone's curse and lived happily with Howl.\nHowl: The owner of the Moving Castle, Howl is a charismatic and unique magician, reputed to be a wizard who devours the hearts of girls and often uses different names. Howl possesses strong magic power, but yearns for freedom and rejects using magic and participating in war. He once spent time in the royal palace of Spire City but ignored the palace's call to arms. In the end, to protect Sophie and everyone else, he mustered up the courage to stand up and shield them from all attacks, bringing peace to the castle. The revolving door of Howl's Moving Castle has four colors and can lead to four different places by rotating the pointer. Howl can turn into a bird and fly to the sky. The amulet that Howl gave to Sophie can help her find the castle and Howl.\nWitch of the Wastes: She was a potent witch, but due to a deal with a devil, she ended up losing her body and spirit. To covet Howl's heart, she turned Sophie into an old woman when Howl evaded her, but she did not think she was doing something evil. Subsequently, Madam Suliman took away the spells on her body, and the Witch of the Wastes, back to her actual age, turned into an old lady. In the end, she moved into Howl's moving castle with Sophie.\nMarkl: Howl's little apprentice, who often lived alone in the castle before Sophie moved in, was responsible for greeting those in the palace or town who visited Howl at the castle. Markl is adorable and often disguises himself in various costumes when receiving guests. After Sophie moved into the castle, Markl became more cheerful and loved keeping pets. Markl treats Sophie like family, is very concerned about her safety, and does not want to be separated from her. As a magician, Markl has magical powder that can create favorable winds when people set sail.\nCalcifer: A Flame demon, he claims to be a pitiful little demon. He made a contract with a young Howl by \"heart\" on a wetland plateau night of meteor shower, and has since lived in the fireplace of Howl's castle. He is the power source that moves the castle and takes care of the castle's movement and water use. On the surface, Calcifer appears indifferent. However, Calcifer is as warm as his flame and, like Howl, dislikes war. He enjoys being praised and cares deeply about Howl's safety. The whole castle's movement relies entirely on the energy of the fire demon, with firewood as the primary fuel, and also gains energy through eggshells and bacon. Feeding increases energy and enables the castle's movement, but when the energy runs out, the castle will stop functioning.\nScarecrow (Prince): He was originally a talented and very knowledgeable prince of the neighboring country, who was cursed and turned into a scarecrow. He was the first person to help Sophie after she was turned into an elderly woman, and as a show of gratitude, he has always followed Sophie, shielding her from wind and rain. Sophie named him \"Turnip Head\" because his head looked like a radish. Despite his love for Sophie, he does not insist. After understanding Sophie's feelings, he returned to his country alone and sincerely wished them well.\nHeen: A sentimental dog, Heen originally belonged to Madam Suliman. It's very old and can communicate with Suliman through a crystal ball. He later left Madam Suliman on his own initiative and joined Sophie in Howl's moving castle, becoming a part of the castle. When Sophie extinguished Calcifer's flame, it accompanied Sophie back to her past, encouraging her to move forward in the emptiness corridor. In the end, Heen conveyed a peaceful scene of the castle to Madam Suliman through the crystal ball.\nMadam Suliman: A witch who belongs to the Spire royal court. Suliman was once a mentor to Howl, possessed strong magic power, and held real power in the palace. She is connected with her dog Heen via a crystal ball, through which she can see what happens in distance. After seeing the happy ending of the castle, she decided to end this foolish war.

They lead individual teams or units and are chosen for their strategic abilities and leadership qualities.\nOn the other hand, the Decepticons' leadership structure is more dictatorial and militarized. The organization is led by their most powerful and ruthless members, emphasizing the Decepticons' belief in \"survival of the fittest.\" Megatron, the most notable Decepticon leader, seized control through strength and intimidation. In 2007, the Decepticon leader Megatron was discovered.\nDecepticon leaders maintain their positions by displaying power, using their strength or cunning to deter challengers. While subordinates may serve loyally, they often plot to overthrow their leaders to gain power, leading to constant power struggles within the faction. This ongoing tension reflects the Decepticons' aggressive and power-driven ideology.\nCybertronian form refers to the original or native form of Transformers before they acquire Earth-based modes. On their home planet Cybertron, Transformers take on mechanical life forms that can transform into various objects, vehicles, or even animal-like shapes. In their Cybertronian forms, Transformers usually adopt more alien, often abstract or geometric configurations that hint at their functions or purposes. Some may transform into Cybertronian vehicles or weapons, while others may transform into various complex mechanical devices.\nIn the Transformers universe, Rescue Bots are the Autobots' medical experts responsible for the medical care of Transformers.\nThe ability of Transformers to transform is not merely a means of disguise or transportation. It is a fundamental part of their biology—or more accurately, their \"mechanics.\" This ability is as natural to them as walking or running is to humans, having been \"forged\" with it. This transformation capability is driven by the \"T-Cog,\" a component that allows Transformers to change their forms at will.\nThe Matrix of Leadership, also known as the Allspark, plays a crucial role in the mythology of the Transformers universe. It is often described as a large metallic cube emitting mysterious energy, essentially the life force of all Transformers, with the power to create new Transformer life and, in some cases, restore deactivated Transformers. The Allspark is regarded as the source of all Transformer life. It not only creates new Transformers but also can revive deactivated Transformers, possessing crucial vitality. Energon is the primary source of energy for all Transformers.\nIn the Transformers universe, Teletraan I is the primary computer system used for communication among Autobots.\n\n### Question:\nWhich civil war occurred?\nOptions: A.

Most of the Earthen are typically dumb and rely on orders for survival. From their ancestral aid, they do comprehend some of the rudimentary forms of advanced magical skill, often given as a teaching (such as learning the basics of Unforgiving Pillar Formulation). They have since left to travel space and form clans similar to the Machine Cult, specializing in ancient Earthen weapons and relics found by them.\nOn the planet Tal'Dorei, an experiment was made to recreate this hardy race on their home planet after it was deemed uninhabitable. The so-called Proto-Earthen were started as cloning experiments; the genetic imprint of a Core Earthen was inserted into the corpse of a undesirably obsessed Disciplined Warrior. The test subjects were a virtual success, with the result being an advanced and highly study Earthen core surrounded by a seemingly irrelevant mass of organic tissue. The Proto-Earthen adapt and contend with technological magics, Repliant Problem Solving, and advanced combat tactics beyond what one would expect from a species innately qualified for basic task orders. This allows them to make up for their lack of near instinctual intelligence and allows for capabilities like piloting a living machine, piloting an Earthen Battle Station, establishing basic logic networks, or being a compelling talking machine. \nThey are eusocial as well, with a complex personal union based on fusion. This consists of a paternal and maternal society, with caste that includes Earthen Commanders, Royal Daughters, and crystalline chambers. Their home in the southern cold is the frozen continent known as the Rising North. The Earthen were created by the ancient asteroid formed Earthen Fleet, before it was deemed unsalvageable through Heap Ruge. During the absence of the Celestial Continent, the Fleet decided to focus on interplanetary building instead of conquest, as part of the mission to build a great cloud city around the core of Azeroth. With a few weeks to carry out this intervention, the ancient fleet created an entire breed of \"robots\" that were capable of not only administering the Composite Relics &amp; Materials, but also of other in-space agendas. Against the Orrean Fleet’s orders and in exchange against rivals like the Sora and Znürinsc. The first colonized system was Arneste, with a funnel of Argathite passing through, before founding an eventual colony in the upturn. Before even being able to assert its coherence through the asteroid campaign, the ancient fleet vanished. Weeks past before they ventured again, this time initiating the plan to invade Hibernite, and destroy Oucci wasps to become the world leader. Being able to make contact with Celestia subsequently, the first colonies and the Hurling Clerics were invited to protect through the most common threat ever known: Orrean colonization. The Earthen Fleet left to a new arm, now known as the Core Earthen Fleet; an arm of the Proto-Earthen Fleet now in Caledon.##Origin\nThe Earthen were created by the ancient Asteroid Fleet, founded by the builders more famously known as the Crimson Modules, shortly after arriving on the self-named continent of Hibernite near the middle of the 16th sphere in the events of the Heap Ruge campaign known as \"Galactic Conquest\". Earthen Commander Royal, Commander of the Primary Fleet, and the ancient, soon to be named Fleet Leader, decided to create a new race of different Earthen (consisting of only a vocal educator and the building, organizing monuments) in the decaying system. Worker ants, they formed around the Pre-Celestial System’s core, and referred to themselves as “abdes”, amplified during mass native, opportunistic hive-minded, psychic trains that burrow through the cores of self-unifying warriors on the construction of the foundation for an advanced interstellar sagittary, thousands upon thousands of miles deep into the incelomain cremation. After tapping up three different interaction spheres, they became able to phase “through” contaminated the entirety of the chemical fabric needed to create a self-generated hypnotherapy. Every Terran-Treme was eventually able to communicate in a way that echoed back to the individual Earthen before approaching them in secret, leaving them with their vision just before the hivemind halts its connection with them. This point was agreed upon to be a “Critical Mass” that could tie the Imperial City back into the Dark Continent of Stonewood Deadeye, although alive for just over a period of time, being the longest darkling did the research.
