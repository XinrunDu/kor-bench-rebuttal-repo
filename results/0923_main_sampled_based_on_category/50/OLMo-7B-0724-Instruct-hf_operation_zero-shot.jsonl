Now, let's solve for X:   \n\n(X○5) = (X+3*5) × (X+5)).   \n\nTo find X, we need to eliminate the (X+5) terms in multiplication. First, let's think about the factors of 200.

Thus, we can determine that there is no integer pair (X, 5) that multiplies with the functions (X○5) to meet the criteria of an integer bigger than 0 and not greater than 5 multiplied by itself. Since we don't have any integer solution for (X○5), we can conclude that there might be no solution (i.e., there's no integer X in this case) that satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe final answer: [[no solution or: there may not be an integer X that satisfies the condition X○5=200]]"}

Let's calculate the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n](1+i)(−10+11i) = −10+11i−10i+11ii = −10+12i\n\nNow, let's calculate the left-hand side (5+X) × (1⊕X) = (5+X)(1+Xi) = (5+X)(1+X)(1−i+i^2)\n\nExpanding the rightmost brackets, we get: (5+X) × 1 = 5+X\n\nTherefore, we know that: 5+X = −10+12i\n\nNow, we want to isolate X:\n\n12i(5+X) = −10(5+X) + 12ix\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get: 12ix = −50 + 50i + 12xi, simplifying the right-hand side:\n\n12ix = 95ix, therefore, x = −11i\n\nSo, given the condition is:\n\n(2⊕3)×(1⊕−11i) = −10+11i\n\nNow, let's find (2⊕3):\n\n(2⊕3) = 3+2i = i\n\nNow, calculate the result of applying the problem condition:\n\ni × (1−11i) = i × 1 = i\n\nIt doesn't match the −10+11i expression. Therefore, we have a mistake. We should check it again. Let's consider the following situation:\n\n(3⊕2) × (1⊕X) = −10+11i\n\nNow, let's find (3⊕2):\n\n(3⊕2) = 2+3i = 3i\n\nNow, calculate the result of applying the problem condition:\n\n3i × (1−X) = −10+11i\n\nNow, let's isolate the term with X:\n\n3ix = −1x + 11i •if we divide both sides by 3ix: x = 2 + 11i/3\n\nNow, let's check if this solution is valid:\n\n(3⊕2) × (1(2 + 11i)/3) = −10 + 11i\n\nNow, let's calculate the left-hand side:\n\n3i × (1 − 22i)/3 = 1 − 7i = −(2 + i) = −10 + 11i\n\nSo, the solution x = 2 + 11i/3 is valid.\n\nNow, we apply the operation to get the result:\n\n6i+−23(2+11i/3) = 6i−23(2i+33) =−23(5+3i) = 11+23i\n\nTherefore, we found the expression needed to satisfy the equation: (3⊕2)×(1⊕(2+11i/3))=−10+11i = 11+23i\n\nSo, the solution for X is [[2+11i/3]]."}

This can be represented as:\n\n∫0π sin(x)dx　(definite integral of sine function).\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the exponential representation of sine function, i.e., sin(x) = (e^{ix} - e^{-ix})/i. With this representation, we can rewrite the definite integral as:\n\n∫0π [ (e^{ix} - e^{-ix}) / i ]dx.\n\nNow, for simplicity, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n∫0π (e^{ix} / i) dx - ∫0π (e^{-ix} / i)dx.\n\nIntegrating each term, we get:\n\n[ (i/i) (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nSimplify the expressions:\n\n[1 (e^{ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"} - [(-1/i) (e^{-ix})]_{x=0}^{x=\"π\"}\n\nEvaluate the limits:\n\n1 - ((-1)/i) * (e^{(-πi)})\n\nWe now apply Euler's formula, which states that e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x). When x = π, we have e^(πi) = -1. So,\n\n-1 = (-1)/i * (-1) = 1/i * 1\n\nTherefore, 1/i = -1/i. When i = -i (imaginary unit), this simplifies to i*i = -1, which means\n\n-1^2 = 1\n\nSo, without using square root or another pianism to evaluate the term (1/i), we have the unique value of 1/i = -1/i = i^2 = -1, which derives from a complex connection. \n\nNow, we can substitute this back to the expression we obtained earlier:\n\n[1(cos(π) + i*sin(π))] - [(-1/i)(1 + i*0)]\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\n[1(−1 + i)] - [(−1)*(-1+0)]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n[1(−1 + i)] − [1(0 + 0i)]\n\nFinally,\n\n[−1 + i] = [−1 + i(0 + 1)] = [−1 + i]\n\nHere comes your result:\n\n[[−1+i]]\n\nBeing the result is not an integer, wrap it in double square brackets to display it as a number within the context, as you like:\n\n[−1+i]."}
