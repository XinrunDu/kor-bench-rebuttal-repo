After reading the incoming signal, our eavesdropping software found this encrypted message: **[Encryption Info]**\nOrder of the plaintext: 123456\nKeyword: sky\nCiphertext: zyxwjpo\n\nJournalist Tim is determined to understand the message without requiring military intervention. In order to avoid direct communication with the enemy, Tim has devised a way to decrypt the message decrytor 5agram.\n\nThe encryption rule used by the canonds is Wilf code:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Upper case letter and space\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Space and space is outputted, no space is added after the end of the input plaintext\n    \nPlaintexts: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\npartial ciphertext:\n1. 2: 4 3 means that 2 shifts forward 4 spaces in the alphabet, so the ciphertext is \" \".\n2. 3: 3 - 1 - 2\n3. 4: \" \" + 2 means that both spaces are considered as one space. The ciphertext is \" \".\n4. 5: \" \" + 3 - 5 + 2 means the 4th character in plaintext unit, i.e. 5, is shifted three spaces in the alphabet, so that the ciphertext is \" \".\n5. 9: 6 + 9 + 4\n\nThe encryption rule used by the canods is Wilf code (Wilf denial (Wilf1)). The problem is to move a letter further by a number of spaces equal to the absolute distance of the letter from the 00 position in the rearranged alphabet.\n\nFor example,\n\n1. A shifted in 1 position forward in the alphabet is replaced by a new large letter T.\n2. A shifted in -2 positions backward in the alphabet is replaced by A.\n\nTake the content of the previous plaintext unit as the key, and rotate the content of the current plaintext unit by a length equal to the number of the key, and insert the rotated content into the content after the key, and replace the current plaintext unit by the rotated content.\n\nThe part of the ciphertext content after the key: the timestamp \"1111\" and the position \"ABC\" are shifted according to the alphabet.\n\n- Input:\n    - The encrypted text is a plaintext unit. Assumed that each plaintext unit has a length, which can be 1 or more letters. The length of the whole ciphertext is unknown.\n\n- Output:\n    - provide the decrypted text after the current plaintext unit in the ciphertext.\n    \n### Example:\n\n| Plaintext | Encrypted      |\n| :-------: | :------------: |\n| AABC110013 | 111111ABC      |\n| AABC010003 | 0000AAA11000BC |\n| AABC110004 | 000011AAA0000B |\n| AABC100007 | 00001111AA1111 |\n| AABC101000 | 00010100110001 |\n| AABC10101 | 0001010100010 0 |\n| AABC100009 | 000000000AA111 |\n| AABC110000 | 00000000000111 |\n| AABC100008 | AA10000000211  |\n\n\nAuthor: Alice, Bob, Charlie\n\nSubmit                    |    Score     |\n:-------------------------:|:------------:|\n[10-01] 2D triangle        |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 4    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            758 |\n[10-02] Sum of Subarrays    |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 8    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            733 |\n[10-03] 4D array change    |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 20    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            597 |\n[10-04] 4D array calculate |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 45    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            597 |\n[10-05] Monotonic stack   |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 65    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            594 |\n[10-05]高级循环        |    5/10     |\nAnswer: 5    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            833 |\n[10-10] I/O conversion   |    9/10     |\nAnswer: ...    |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:             |    6 bits  |\n[10-11] I/O conversion   |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 7    |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:             |    2 bits  |\n[10-15] binary distinguish       |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 1    |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:             |    bit in  |\nmalformed code       |    1:10    |\n[10-15] Repeated month cases            |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 9    |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    5 bits    |\n[10-16] array a         |    7/10     |\nAnswer: 4    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            686 |\n[10-16] array b          |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 12    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            595 |\n[10-16] array c          |    9/10     |\nAnswer: ...    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            593 |\n[10-16] array d          |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 4    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            595 |\n\n\nAuthor: Lily, Lucy, Lula\n\nSubmit                  |    Score     |\n:-------------------------:|:------------:|\n[10-07] Regular expression                           |    2/10     |\nAnswer: zygou    x9     |  employee_id  |\n|inputs: orig    nakah |\n[10-08] Tree                |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 515781033667559    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            630 |\n[10-09] Cipher key            |    7/10     |\nAnswer: bankchain    lution |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            548 |\n[10-10] Large matrix        |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 226116998886286    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            637 |\n[10-10] Other mode         |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 906381586565431    |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            596 |\n[10-10] Cyrill alphabet    |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 1403891026463983 + |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            1025 |\n[10-10] Anesting position    |    2/10     |\nAnswer: 117    x         |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:             |    1 bits  |\n[10-11] Frequency         |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 55208    UUI    B   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    28 bits  |\n[10-11] Sparsee          |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 101    UUID    K   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    3 bits  |\nbug filed  |    10/10    |\nAnswer: x     UUI    Z   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    2 bits  |\n[10-15] Enter data              |    9/10     |\nAnswer: 89    UUID    E   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    2 bits  |\n[10-15] Radio interference         |    9/10     |\nAnswer: r    UUI    C   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    1 bits  |\n[10-15] Dechatup                    |    8/10     |\nAnswer: N1    UUI    T   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    2 bits  |\nmalformed ekey       |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 106    UUI    I   |  employee_id  |\n|inputs:            |    4 bits  |\n[10-16] Quick succession          |    8/10     |\nAnswer: 2114113368168736    xthae  |  employee_id  |\n|outputs:            |            825 |\n[10-16] ...                   |    8/10     |\nAnswer: ...                 thae  |  "}

Find its position in the standard_alphabet and replace it with the letter in the corresponding position in reversed_alphabet. For example, A is mapped to Z and B is mapped to Y.\n    - (2) Move the letter obtained in (1) forward 4 places in the standard_alphabet order. For example, if p=A, after (1) is mapped to Z, then Z is shifted forward 4 positions in the standard_alphabet to get D.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in standard_alphabet and using the corresponding letter in substitution_alphabet, resulting in the final ciphertext letter. For example, if the letter obtained by going through (2) is D, it is mapped as J.\n\n**Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - alphabet: \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    - reversed_alphabet: \"ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA\"\n    - substitution_alphabet: \"RFDJUHABCEGIKLMNOPQSTVWXYZ\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - (1) For each letter c in Ciphertext, find its position in substitution_alphabet and replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.\n    - (2) Shift the letter obtained from (1) backward by 4 positions according to the standard_alphabet order.\n    - (3) Replace the letter obtained from (2) by finding its position in reversed_alphabet, then replace it with the corresponding letter in standard_alphabet.

The goal is to hide the existence of the secret message in the visible parts of the signal such that a human observer is not able to distinguish the signal with and without a secret message. On the other hand, an adversary who possesses the encrypted encrypted message, and a steganogram, is supposed to be able to recover the secret message.\n\nPlease run the following python file for further information regarding the basic principle of Steganography and information on the ``SimpleSampler`` class used in the code.\n\n<a href=\"steg_9.py\">Figure 9: &nbsp; Cipher help for Steganography</a>\n\n<a href=\"steg_10.py\">Figure 10: &nbsp; Sampler for Steganography</a>\n\n### Cipher Help\n\nThe purpose of this help task is to have you implement a simple stegaogram as part of learning from the cipher help module. In this task you will be given a version of ``<NAME>og``'s poem \"It灶s the Scotch again\". Implement the given cryptosystem as prescribed (use RSA). Complete the coherent confusion typography (CCT) steganography algorithm according to Artiniese et al. [40]. For each word, apply a modulo operation on each letter, leading to masking with the relative position identifier for the next letter. For example: For the word 'it', the ciphertext and plaintext are 'ij', and the next letter 'b' is associated with 8 (the 5\\\\.\\ in the word 'it')); if 8 modulo 26 equals 14, then b atrophy be mapped to 'r'.\n\nThe code for the Cipher help will use the ``SimpleSampler`` class which has been provided to you in ``stars[] 40 the following way: a = Sampler().RunSample(word).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n- In this Task we will be using RSA RSA encryption and decryption) operation with a simple function!\n- To complete this task, first run `tie40_steg_2.py`:\n    1. You will be prompted to enter a message to be encrypted in the `crypt_phrase` string variable in the `generate():` function. For clarity, the program does not perform any error checking on what is inputted, which may validate in production.\n    2. After locking in your choice for `text_for_cipher`, the program will ask for encryption keys.\n    3. When prompted for the `modulus`, enter the modulus (n) in which you are free to choose. It is working in modular arithmetic, which supports negative number, and not in regular expression.\n    4. After the `p` and `e` keys are injected, input the same `n` key in the `computed_modulus_value` variable which will keep track of your input key calculations.\n    5. You are also prompted to enter a 'text_mask_generator_key' (i.e. the same value for `key` in the constructor).\n    6. The program will then run your set keys and use them in the run sample() function.\n    7. You will be prompted for the next input in the `run_text_smoothing` function and then run the final `text_this_option_number` function.\n    8. The output should be your encrypted ``random`` ends with the suffix '40', 40.\n- Next, open the `bold_love_story.txt` in your favourite editor and copy all of it.\n- Refer to \"task.txt\" to help you work out how to interpret \"It 灶s the Scotch again\".\n- From here, convert the typefaces elsewhere in your text to keep the readable text recognizable.\n- Lastly, paste all of your text in the `sample_to_cipher_and_experiment` function and encrypt it to get the ciphertext.\n\n### Key observations:\n\nThe word 'smoothing' is the key to understanding what to do in this task.\n\n- The RSA approach to this task, is not exactly to perform encryption and decryption. Instead, it involves converting Morley's original poem to Sir Walter Scott using the 'smoothing' operation that we lay out.\n- After understanding the concept, split the string, run the function, and collect your new string. Don't worry about homophonic substitution, it 灶s not necessary to leave it in the written work.\n\n### Question:\n\nPlease provide an encrypted version of the text \"It 灶s the Scotch again\" as encapsulated in a double square bracket: [[encrypted output here]]\n\n### Answer:\n\n[[nsrYTebfgammaofvs}]\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Relevant Content\n\nBelow are the relevant content for the fields of Logic and Language.\n\n### Truth Tables:\n\nThe Truth Table is a mathematical table that takes a certain model or formulation and demonstrates the different types of outcomes, or degree of true-ness. One of the models of a truth table is the ``logical operator table` which separates the logical and phonemic symbols separately. For each column of a truth table, the top most symbol represents a truth value where T=True and F=False, while the bottom most symbol represents a function, with the function being defined per column. In columns 1 and 3, Truth with Logic represents the truth values represented in terms of truth and falsehood, respectively, expressed under logical formal languages within the context of digital computing. As for columns 2 and 4, the function Consider represents conversion of logical value into probability.\n\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1.png\">Figure 1 - Truth Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1.png\">Figure 2 - Function Table (1)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 2.png\">Figure 3 - Truth Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 2.png\">Figure 4 - Function Table (2)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 3.png\">Figure 5 - Truth Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 3.png\">Figure 6 - Function Table (3)</a>\n\n<a href=\"truth table 1100.png\">Figure 7 - Truth Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"func_table 1100.png\">Figure 8 -  Function Table (1100)</a>\n\n<a href=\"tables multi.png\">Figure 9 - Functions Difficulty </a>\n\n\n### Alphabet Reversal:\n\nGiven a string of alphabet as context and mixes of symbols, pair it accordingly to form the same string in alphabetical order. For example, given the string ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC as Content, the answer box will display the string ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at HTML IPC in alphabetical order, ``ABCDBiomethylation-NSKKT at IPC HTML ABC''. Given the string WHCDZSZXSDB, a substitution needs to be made for the letter ``Z'', which becomes ``X'', to avoid a letter “repeating”. Given the mixed string for exemplify purposes 겔냄탐사I, the answer box will displayაCompareI100'', where ``I'' is replaced by ``:)'' and ``:|’, the letter ``I'' is replaced by the substituted letters with hyphens.. Also note that the trick works for the reversed order of the alphabet. We can name it, but not number convert. For example, given the word “ABC”, the second letter “B” need to be replaced by the first letter “A” because its alphabetical order is different from the given string “ABC”. If the question being “What number is it really?”, we will see the number same as the alphabetical order “1”.\n\nUsing the sentences above, can you help figure out what the following alphabetic symbol is saying?\n\n\n### Question 1:\n\n\"՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥр¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɡҮɧԢ\"\n\n### Answer 1:\n\n՚ԣÿ֨ԥ[[1]]֨ԣԥر¬֨ξ¬Ԣ[[2]]ҮɳПAA\n\n### Question 2:\n\n\"֦׋Z֦V֙ȁỨ+/sg%F\"\n\n### Answer 2:\n\n֦׋Z֦V֙ȁȁapes\n\n- [ ] Question 3\n\n### Question 5:\n\noors | theirs | Is | Isaiah\n\n### Answer Too:\n\novan"}

Each of the two models represents a single genetic sequence followed by a heat shock.\n\nGene Sequences\n\nIntensity Data\n\n\n \n\n\nPS: Sometimes it may be counter-intuitive to think that the key to break through the tough biologic problems is to go after high-throughput technology instead of high-precision technology. IW G--- zebrafish development, Keijsers and Wierman V--- budding yeast, Huang EcoRII recognition RNA.  However, high-throughput technology works well for many proteins to sequence the DNA of many organisms, those would not be sequenced otherwise.\n\nIn Crime investigation, high throughput is high-throughput DNA extraction from multiple different crime scenes and dna profile combination.\n\nLinus Pauling invented X-ray fluorescence detection in 1949, allowing chemical analysis of elements in biological cells. Today, X-ray fluorescence analysis is widely used at electron microscopes and at other X-ray instruments.\n\nThe Turing test was an innovation prompted by Turing's interest in assembly languages. For his theory of computing, Turing had assumed an enormous program held in digital memory, from which a program at any moment could in principle be disassembled and archived separately before being reconstructed further on. However, current computer practice, limited memory-space and power-consumption concerns, and his awareness of construction costs for docking stations and repoducing a chain of tools required to construct tool chains led him to modify his original theory considerably. The Turing test tests for \"an essentially mechanical quality\" - \"whether the machine can speak for itself without our knowing it is a machine. He hoped that this might be a practical reality within a dozen years, and alternately predicted only its eventual implementation2 given unlimited computing power and stability bias. Turing wrote:\n\nOur duty now is to provide intelligent machines for the information age. Very great exportability is needed because of the probable feeble growth of intelligence in each country. But equally, I do not see how we can avoid putting our brains together and dismantling the machine by its most relevant discoveries, until in all probability it will prove indispensable to accommodate.\n\nWe have lost the capacity to sort knowledge. The compression of fitting 3,258 books into 250 volumes was a part survival mechanism, although this offered theoretical advantages in communication, universal education, production and distribution. We moved the sky on the stars - at it disappears, our dealers will reach more quickly and effectively to more efficient collection and distribution of goods. We spent <NAME>'s money on factories that automate much of our production by the river, so that the supply of goods could be automated. Now we can produce anything we like where we need it instantly. But we are simply not using it all and it all production is based on efficiency - production costs are still lower than production at any time that it can really understand the nature of its author.\n\n'The question is, can we manufacture this? If not, the factory goes blank; the job's only a few weeks old. Everyone who purchases it once in a century, and hence records a 50% increase in sales, offering an equivalent proposition - is no different. That's your most effective production experts. Indeed, the secret lies in the praise of the multitudes of things. Forgetting what we need to contend with breeding among despair party workers has been an amazing thing. The gross errors made by combining two successful business models have not a small part in striking the common rules, minor bloodzhou.pm.\n\nTaking no pleasure in anything holds your breath ... From the vulture and gaining strength slightly, but if this happened, it was passed on to the aged and rich. Start by doing what is necessary to be done. In your life, I do much you-sizing and don't do a lot of other, messier stuff.

Brains are welcome.\n $$=\\top$$ \\ \\ $$ORG=$$ \\ \\ $$8F=$$ \\ \\ $$GFND=$$ \\ \\ $$775=$$ \\ \\ \\ $$9609=$$\n Using the encryption keys, what is the message in the first block? \n### Answer:\n\n```\nYou come across an encrypted message from a team of hacker hackers.\n\nThe message is encrypted over six blocks using a simple substitution cipher (known as a \"one-time pad\")^1 *=3 > everything\n is now just a server F\n```\n\nOur given keys consist of values which can be mapped back to letters: `GFND` -> `GFY` and `ORG` -> `10`. So we only need to decrypt one message per ciphertext block, which will change those encryption key pairs into `9608`.\n\nThis is a simple integer addition.\n\n`9607 + 9609 = 19872` ⇒ `ORG + 9609 (mod 65537) = 19872`\n\nWe can now proceed to decrypt message one.\n\n### CAPTCHA Encryption Details:\n>Abbreviations:\n>\n> *   `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n>\n> *   ORG = 31\n>\n> *   GFND = 565\n>\n> *   775 = 621\n>\n> *   GFY = 28\n\n\n\n^1 `^1` = Iteration 1 of a Exponentiation Algorithm\n\nAlgorithm Steps:\n1. `c1`: Base64 of `\"P5Mj@`\n2. `c2`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to **non-Latin** letter) for `c1` . (Notice the epsilon. This is why step 4 needs to be repeated again with the result of step 3)\n3. `c3`: Symmetric-key encryption of `c2` with value \n4. `r1`: MD5 hash of `c1` concatenated with `c3`\n5. `r2`: `SHA256` of `r1`\n6. `k1`: `r2`\n7. `r3`: Base64 of `r1`\n8. `c4`: `Substitution Cipher` (Latin letter to upper Latin letter) for `r3`\n9. `k2`: `SHA256` of `r3`\n10. `r4`: Concatenate the values `k2`, `k1`\n11. `c5`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r4`\n12. `c6`: `SHA256` of `r4`\n13. `r5`: Base64 of `r2`\n14. `r6`: `MD5` of `r5`\n15. `c7` : Massaged value of MD5 hash of `r6` by applying rules to MD5 and base64 after a specific number has been met.\n16. `c8` : `MD5` of `r6`\n17. `c9` : `SHA256` of `r6`\n18. `r7`: Concatenate base64-encoded ciphertext blocks for child keys `c8`, `c9`, `c7` and plaintext for child key `c8`\n19. `r8`: Symmetric-key encryption of r7 with value `k8`\n20. `r9`: `MD5` of the `k8` encryped-ciphertext block for `r8`\n21. `r10`: `SHA256` of `r9`\n22. `c10`: `Substitution Cipher` of `r10`\n23. `c11` : PHP encryption of `r10` using `MD5`\n24. Hash of `r10` with `SHA384` -> `r11`\n25. `c12` : `MD5` of `K` and `PHPP` of `C`\n26. `CT`: Base64 string of both values of `c12`, `r11`\n\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: message `122`\n\nPlease specify the first three letters of the message in question `A`, encapsulated in double square brackets. For example, the format should be: [[first three letters of message A]].\n\n### Answer:\n\n* About NAND to XOR * [divk](./scripts/divk)\n* A [divk](./scripts/divk) device has 8 eight pairs of NAND types or XOR types. Replace the pairs constituting the NAND tor XOR.\n* \n  What is happening here?\n* It is impossible to implement this kind of encryption with a NNIT. You can do it with the T key.\n* Use the T key to divide the XOR into two groups of XOR. Return the missing data and provide the missing data.\n* `K` returns missing data to the next `K` and adds it to the missing data."}

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

The main issue comes from encoding codes into a string of \" |digit1|digit2|\\r\".\nWhat do you think how many steps/loops a computer is allowed to perform per second? Is this number capable of encoding text with high utility? Would you try to store/run this code on a desktop or a laptop? Explain.\n**Part 1**: Write a program that takes the supplied code and replaces the first reading '|' with a number: that number can be passed to the main function `char_encode()`. In a function, input the proper options which are encoded in the strings of \"digit1\"  and \"digit2\", followed by the README in their sets. Again, the README can be parsed using the main function provided. Valid options in the `|.....|` and `....|` (trailing spaces are undefined). This string is expected to be read from a file and work just like any other sent string.\n- Trailing spaces are undefined but cannot be ignored when stripping.\n- Blank characters are undefined.\n- Empty strings must be returned as the string \"\".\n- If the function is not otherwise valid, the results are undefined.\n**Part 2**: In the same function, you will need to use the `char_decode()` function, and with the corresponding digit1 and digit2 characters, substitute the digit and its value into the subtracting string.\n<br><br>\n\n\nHave the file `main.vvn`, which should be a separate file including that main function, run these functions and encode and decode any type of plaintext message. Use `str()` for your decoding function.\n\n\n    `print \"enter code charaters that will encode this code `\"`\n    print `\"example:|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"`\n    print \"enter file containing string to add to code\"\n    print \"add digit1 digit2 in corresponding places\"\n    print \"encoding fragments a 1 between e and o and n and \"\n    print \"we start relabelling to e1 to 1o, o2 to n3 and 1 to \"\n    print \"n2, n4 return to 1 - you need -r\"> cmd file print a total of 5 digits\nattached \"cmd\" write this \"|0|1|2| |input charater that will decode this code.\"\nand enter0123 with value of string1 = 0 charcter\n\nComplete your work using data available with `char_encode()` and `char_decode()` (you can change the names of these methods, but you should be authenticating them in both your REAMDE.md file as well as source code).\n\n|ospital syndce 01234567890123456789012345678901234567\nHostels onlyf ofte qim yikes unverable canyouasuated than 2premis 2x3\nWhrenceforiquencey thery givehomeispeople fikuing publ theyntryoute peole bitign iedon rech ll\n\nwrite a block of code which performs the following actions with strings \"characters\":\n\n- encode all characters as lower case\n- translate all 60-96 characters to strings between 0 and 9\n \n5.

The deck is treated as a circular array, allowing a card that needs to move below the bottom card to wrap around to the top (in other words, the first card follows the last card).\n        \n        For example, starting with:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 53, 26, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        \n        Perform the following steps to generate a character of the keystream:\n        \n        1. Locate card A and move it down by one position. If it's the last card, it becomes the second card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 54, 46, 23, 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        2. Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card. It cannot become the first card. The deck now looks like this:\n        9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21\n        3. Perform a \"triple cut\": Divide the deck into three parts, using the jokers as boundaries, then swap the top and bottom parts. The jokers themselves and the cards between them remain unchanged.\n        31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21, **53,** 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, 26\n        4. Perform a \"count cut\": Examine the bottom card of the deck. If it's a joker (53/54), its value remains fixed at 53. Take out that many cards from the top of the deck and insert them just above the last card of the deck.\n        29, 20, 51, 6, 7, 52, 34, 35, 5, 50, 9, 46, 23, **54,** 9, 25, 44, 38, 40, 22, 11, 36, 13, 39, 18, 42, 10, **31, 24, 14, 8, 33, 2, 49, 45, 21,** 53, 12, 1, 16, 3, 43, 37, 17, 30, 4, 28, 48, 27, 41, 32, 15, 47, 26\n        5. Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

One unique security concept that is a matter of heated debate among security experts is the use of pre-decryption keys (PDKs).\n\nLet's start by generating a ciphertext (note that encryption is a one-way process that does not provide a reverse-aware path) based on some plaintext input. We accomplish this using the [DOB stream cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobell_sky_generator).\n\nTo generate a ciphertext using the **stream cipher**:'\n\n```\nlet child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14]))\nlet data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\ndata = data.concat(child_random);\n    \ndobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertexth\n```\n\nIt would be best if you calculated the keyword input to this cipher in the previous question. The result should look similar to this:\n\n**Ciphertext**: VVIHNAQ&A.L{RN{Hv%34r{H,cA_!+}.\n\nLet's analyze this communication before the pre-decryption combinator. An overview of the algorithm components is below:\n\n![cipher-formajoingte](https://i.ibb.co/N6NTzhP/cipher-formajoingte.png \"cipher-formajoingte\")\n\nIf we look at the char-by-char correspondence in this system, we can see that each character is encrypted using a predictable method within an arbitrary field, which we call the *afield*.\n\nIn practical contexts, when decrypting such messages, you will often face a situation in which the _key matrices_ have only been derived through knowledge transfer from long-dead individuals. For such messages, the only significant difference between decrypting and encrypting is that you first need to recover the pre-decryption key (PDK) used to derive the afield before using the encrypted plaintext to predict the next afield. You will subsequently employ this approach to recover the PDK used by the sender for all further afields.\n\nTo decrypt the afield, obtaining the PDK (as discussed in [Challenge 7: Communications and Pre-multiplication](https://github.com/NorseAS/esummit_cs21/tree/main/crypto-sprint_lab6)) will result in valuable insights into the written rather than spoken language in transit. By learning the PDK, one can accurately and expeditiously translate the afields. The pollket algorithm is designed to accommodate such values and provides processes for identifying and measuring afields without relying on having illegal disclosure with the previous matrix prior to commencing decryption.\n\nA crucial aspect of this system is the parity of the afields before and after decryption. The pollketalogy process uses the ROT-13 (round-and-fifth-key chaining) method to ensure that different plaintext sentences need not be statistically identifiable. This process of encryption is utilized in ensuring that the PDK is harmless to the decrypting entity. By infection-testing protocols, the pollket (which has evolved into the polket) can be incredibly difficult to compromise by network entities and is often run on devices connected to central firewalls that limit the possibilities of attack and compromise. The polket thus provides superior encryption services for messages, using a master readkey consisting of raw bits that is constructed by the filter for securing data transmission between different groups across an industry.\n\n## Objective\n\nYou will modify the stream cipher algorithm to decrypt a given key going out for $\\leq N$ many NB positions and only $\\leq k$ bytes. The rationale for this task is to study how to manipulate and decrypt the ciphertext using a PIN, which will reduce fraud and theft in money transfers over air. By utilizing a secretcam system, you'll only need the straight-forward visual representation explained here to decrypt the ciphertext to the original plaintext message.\n\n\n### Challenge:\n\nCreate a function **decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey**_N**_k_** that decrypts a ciphertext according to the previous algorithm. Additionally, using the pre-decryption key, apply standard decryption for $\\leq $ N many ciphertext positions; instead of encryption, calculate the Minny-A value of the plaintext utter output decrypted $\\leq k$ bytes.\n\nThe flow chart below illustrates the steps a polynomial HTTP message in the process of decryption:\n\n![decrigvahovadcbrh](https://i.ibb.co/dThjf58/decrigvahovadcbrh.png \"decrigvahovadcbrh\")\n\nYou may choose to invert and pass the message bits to make the legalization of each polynomial mathematics somewhat simpler. In JavaScript, this might be accomplished with an *if statement*, a *for loop*, and an array of polynomial values.\n\nIf you name your public decryption key fret, your decryption function will look similar to this:\n\n```\n//Modified for num positions and key bytes.\nfunction decryptCode4PreMultiplicationKey(_N_, _k_) {\n  let child_random = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init(new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray([31, 38, 13, 1, 29, 0, 49, 47, 11, 31, 64, 100, 64, 32, 73, 49, 12, 41, 21, 6, 57, 95, 6, 42, 64, 20, 97, 20, 80, 53, 84, 49, 5, 27, 93, 9, 58, 23, 21, 11, 23, 66, 67, 41, 51, 88, 52, 88, 55, 43, 40, 72, 62, 33, 16, 8, 26, 41, 81, 4, 60, 55, 89, 27, 58, 62, 78, 28, 68, 86, 22, 31, 3, 36, 25, 45, 87, 14])\n  let data = new CryptoJS.lib.WordArray.init([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n  \n  data = data.concat(child_random)\n  dobell_cipher(data, child_random).ciphertext;\n}\n```\n\n### Challenge Goals:\n\n1.

Locate card B and move it down by two positions. Note, if it's the second last card, it will wrap around to become the second card. If it's the last card, it will become the third card.

Now, look at the value of the top card. Similarly, any joker counts as 53. Calculate the number of positions below this card, and use that card's value as the next value in the keystream. If the calculated card is a joker, ignore it and repeat the keystream algorithm. In this example, the top card is 29, so the value of the 30th card (i.e., 14) determines the keystream value. (Note that no cards change position in this step; this step only determines the keystream value).\n        6.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n    - period: Defines how often the inner disc rotates. Periodicity indicates that after every number of characters processed in the encryption process, the inner disc will rotate once according to the incremental value.\n    - increment: Defines the number of characters the inner disc rotates each time. At the end of each cycle, the inner disc will rotate to the right by the corresponding number of characters based on the increment value. For example, if the increment is 4, the inner disc will rotate 4 characters to the right for each cycle that passes (e.g., 5 characters are processed).\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each character p in the plaintext:\n        - Find the character in the outer_disk.\n        - Replace it with the character at the corresponding position on the inner_disk.\n        - After encrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string.\n    - period (Same as encryption)\n    - increment (Same as encryption)\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string.\n- Preparation:\n    - outer_disk = \"QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJZXCVBNMKL\"\n    - inner_disk = \"JKLZXCVBNMASDFGHJQWERTYUIO\"\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each character c in the ciphertext:\n        - Find the character in the inner_disk.\n        - Replace the character with the corresponding position in the outer_disk.\n        - After decrypting every `period` characters, rotate the inner_disk to the right by `increment` characters.For example, rotating 'ZXCVBNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOP' by 4 gives 'BNMASDFGHJKLQWERTYUIOPZXCV'.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"H\"\nperiod: 14\nincrement: 3\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

The final ciphertext is BX.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 5x5 grid (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - For each letter c in the ciphertext, find its corresponding row and column coordinates (between 0 and 4) in the grid to obtain a sequence of coordinates.\n    - Divide the coordinate sequence into two halves, the first half is all the original row coordinates, the second half is all the original column coordinates, read one from the original row coordinates, read one from the original column coordinates, and find the corresponding letter in the grid according to the original row and column coordinates to form the plaintext.\n        - For example [0,1,4,2], the first half as row coordinates: [0, 1], the second half as column coordinates: [4,2].\n        - Read one from the row coordinates, one from the column coordinates, and so on alternately. Obtain (0,4),(1,2), respectively, and find the corresponding letters in the grid as AC.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"BX\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

For example (4, 1, 5), (2, 3, 3), (8, 1, 8), the final encrypted message is 415233818.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A numeric string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 3 Girds (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - Divide the ciphertext into triples of three numbers.\n    - For each ternary `(x, y, z)` do the following:\n        - Find the row number of y in Gird3 where the value of L1_row is equal to the row number;\n        - Find the column number of y in Gird3, with the value of L2_col equal to that column number;\n        - The value of L1_col is equal to x, the value of L2_row is equal to z.\n        - Find the corresponding letter p1 in Gird1 according to the determined (L1_row,L1_col).\n        - Based on the determined (L2_row,L2_col), find the corresponding letter p2 in Gird2.\n        - p1p2 is the decrypted message of the triad.\n        - For example, for the ternary (4,1,5), in Gird3, the row number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L1_row=0, in Gird3, the column number corresponding to 1 is 0, so L2_col=0. L1_col=4, L2_row=5. According to (0,4) in Gird1, we find the corresponding letter T, and according to (5,0) in Gird2, we decrypt all the ternaries to get the letter p2 p1p2 as the message after decrypting the ternary. We find the corresponding letter H in Gird2 according to (5,0), so the final decryption is TH.\n    - String all the decrypted messages together, remove the `#` at the end (these characters are padding characters added to make the message length a multiple of 6), to form the decrypted plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"FO\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n**Encryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:  A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Fill in the first plaintext in the first position of the first line.\n    - Two ways to fill:\n        - Downward Fill: Fill the first row with a \"#\" (removing the first column, since the first position is already filled with a plaintext letter), then fill the plaintext downwards from the second row to the last row (fifth row).\n        - Upwards: the plaintext is filled upwards from the last line (fifth line) to the second line, and then the first line is filled with a \"#\".\n    - For each letter in the plaintext (except the first letter which has been filled in the first position), perform downward padding first, fill one column, then turn to upward padding, then turn to downward padding, and so on alternately, until all the letters have been filled.\n        - For example, HELLOWORLD.The content of the five lines after filling is\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n    - Filled out, read line by line, first read the contents of the first line, after reading the contents of each line are added a * sign, marking the end of the line; and then read the contents of the second line, and so on, read all the lines, the formation of the final password text.\n        H L #\n        E R D\n        L O\n        L W\n        O #\n        - Read the final cipher text line by line as \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" (i.e., there must be five *'s in the final cipher text to indicate that there are five lines)\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - Number of lines: 5\n- Decryption Steps (exact opposite of encryption steps):\n    - According to the * in the ciphertext (excluding the * sign), it can be divided into five groups, which are filled into five rows in turn. Get the recovered data in five rows.\n        - For example, like \"HL#*ERD*LO*LW*O#*\" ,according to the division of * and then fill in the five lines to get the recovered five lines of data D:\n            H L #\n            E R D\n            L O\n            L W\n            O #\n    - Then read all the columns alternately according to read down first and then read up. Get the uncleared messages.\n        - For example, for the five rows of message D in the previous step, read alternately to get \"HELLO#WORL#D\"\n    - Remove the # from the uncleaned message to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"TDOACY\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Use the character at the corresponding position in the encrypted character set to replace the number of rows and columns to get the encrypted binary.\n            - For example, the number of rows of A is 0, which corresponds to A in the encrypted character set, and the number of columns of A is 2, which corresponds to F in the encrypted character set. so the encrypted binary corresponding to A is (A,F).The encrypted binary is (A,F).\n        - Read all rows of the encrypted binary, and then read all columns of the encrypted binary to get the final ciphertext.\n            - For example, the encrypted binary is (A,F)(X,V), the last read is AXFV, so the final ciphertext is AXFV.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: Uppercase letters  string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - 6x6 Matrix (Same as encryption)\n    - Encrypted Character Set (Same as encryption)\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - Divide the ciphertext into two halves.\n    - Take one letter from the upper half and one letter from the lower half each time as a decryption binary:\n        - The position of each character in the encrypted character set is flagged as 0-6, and the position of the corresponding character in the encrypted character set is used to decrypt the number of rows and columns represented by the decrypted binary.\n            - For example, the decrypted binary is the encrypted binary as (A,F), the position of A is 0 and the position of F is 2, so the number of rows is 0 and the number of columns is 2, obtaining (0, 2).\n        - Use the number of rows and columns obtained to find the letter in the corresponding position in the 6x6 matrix as the character after decryption.\n            - For example, the character at (0, 2) is A, and the character after AF decryption is A.\n    - Concatenate all the decrypted characters to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"SD\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.

Identify the relevant properties and objects specified in the rule, including the plaintext, keyword, and ciphertext.\n2. Follow the specified encryption or decryption operations precisely as described in the rules.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Cipher Rule:\n\n- Input:\n    - Plaintext: A string of uppercase letters and spaces, where A-Z is used for letters.\n- Output:\n    - Ciphertext:\n        - Concatenated 8-bit hexadecimal hex pairs (eg. 0801), representing the ciphertext data.\n- Preparation:\n    - Fixed shared secret: b'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC', using b' ' for null characters. The 'shared secret' is a 64-char long binary string.\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - Ralph Smith (Smith Suite): This is an 8 round feistel network.\n        1. Concatenate the plaintext and the shared secret, (ie: a space where the shared secret starts). Use ASCII encoding.\n        2. Determine the message length in bytes, and then round up to an even integer.\n        3. Perform the following rounds:\n            1. Generate a Substitution Box.\n            2. Format the Substitution Box; this relies on the message length.\n            3. XOR the Substitution Box with the planeMR\n            4. XOR the Reversal S-Box with the planeMR\n            5. XOR the Output S-Box with the planeMR\n            6. Swap the left and right halves of the planeMR.\n        - Need to determine the message length and round it up to an even integer to use the formatSubtractionBox function. This function removes the need to have an exact number of bytes in the input string.\n        - After the final round, the plaintextMR is no longer plaintext, it is CiphertextMR.\n    1. Ralph Smith (Smith): This is a 8 round a Feistel network.\n        1. Fz = E(Cz,Mz-1)\n        2. Pz = (Pz-1)^Fz\n        3. Qz = Pz CF(Qz-1)\n        4. Mz = Pz Fz\n    2. Restore plaintextMR from CiphertextMR using IRB (inverse Ralph block).\n    3. Restore plaintextMR from CiphertextMR using SPCR (split pencil rectification).\n    4. XOR \"Shared Secret\" on plaintextMR with the encoded shared secret.\n- Decryption:\n    1. Ralph Smith, LivePair (Smith): This is the exact reverse of the single RLS (technically known as the Light-Pair Mode), but applied more times in order to increase randomness. This works by increasing the number of iterations, so that an algorithm randomly changes after every round to prep for the next. For the purpose of decreased difficulty in breaking, the starting box is modifying from decryption to encryption 3000 times, to have the highest probability possible for intermediate states to receive the key.\n        - Ralph Smith (LivePair): A 8-round Feistel network, which works from EMR Reader:\n            - After the final round, the plaintextMR is no longer plaintext, it is CiphertextMR.\n    1. LivePair (Smith): Undo the process of RLS. This is the same as the original encryption except with repeating the William Sparks Step (described above), and instead of removing it after each round, it keeps the step so that each iteration of the step applies newer variants of the step.\n    2. Extracting EMRs: At the end of LivePair (Smith), the EMR and CMR are available for reading/decryption.\n    3. Calculate CMR: At the end of LivePair (Smith), the CMR contains the ciphered charactersi. Revealing the characters function retrieves a plaintext character given the EMR. This function takes EMR and character numbers. Comparing it to the CMR give the final plaintext characters (C))$^3_8$. Discounting the fact that every time a character is revealed, another is also revealed so the CMR is only 45 characters long, instead of the original 52 characters in the shared secret (as in half = 26 (A-Z)).\n    4. Finding Jacobi Signature: After LivePair (Smith), flip half of the characters and replace the shared secret with an emulate shared secret. The first XOR is of the flipped letters, before switching the order of the letters and adding the original (half) to that. This is inadequate as an encryption output since it has exactly the same condition as the original input text. In order to convert this to information that can be used as an encryption key, one separate encryption needs to be repeated on a related pair of share-secrets (in separate halves of a test set) using the appropriate prior iteration of the output from LivePair (Smith). Given a pair of such pairing ciphers, that generates the new encryption (common shared secret), the function can be used twice to decrypt the overall set.

It has 7 digits that are exactly 9,7,4,1,8,6,2 but to use the other digits there are 3 more. For example:\n\n\n0-1 => new solution; for (n: 17..    | new solution; for (i: 0001..100000) { if (i % 3 == 0) print(i); }\n\nWhere the differnce is between the right and the left column.\nBy matching these columns, we can get more than one solution.\n\n\n\nNow that we know the difference within the columns, we know that anycase that is the same last digit will solve that case. Both the case where we divide a number by 7 and give the remainder 6 => 2 digits are the same. The next case is the same, but the difference being 8 1 4 and the last case is 7 3 -1 and 8 4 1.\n\nLets say I A} is the first case, B} the second => A}}\\B}\\A B A} \nWe know that: B is always the answer since the answer should be different to solve A. The answer now is B} Fortunatelly, the case is A」 }^G G -4 \nA}}{»G G -4 ----|\n\n{C\n\nThe strategy for next time is to pair A and B as they are always the answer for 9 and 7 and when the pairs that are the same go to the same surpluss, the answer would be G since each pair is differente and the case will be different. A} for the 1 and 6 cases where the numbers are different and a row with the same number and the answer will be the answer that has the last digit that is different. The two cases with 4 and 5 are the same, So it has to be 4 so far. Since the difference if 4 more or less, knowing that there is a difference, we know which cases are not the answer. The answer is 7.\n\n\\GBALFL\n\nGBCAHDCFDSDBTB\n\n\nEach third row is a different number, so where we have a number, the rest will be the same.\n\nABGBBFBCAGDLLAGBBCAGDL\n\n\nWhen we divide by 3, the number is bigger than any of the numbers in the synor, so its the A.\nABPGBPAPBFREE\n\n\nBy dividing the number by 2, we get the 2.\nABPGBPAPLBA\n\n\nAnd since the ABC share the same last digit, we get G.\nABGPABGBABCAPAA\nIn general, starting from 0 and going to 9, we get the following number 9,8 ,7,7,1,0,0,1,3,6.\nIn general, when we divide by 9, we have the same left and right value. So the number that is larger left than right value should be the answer since that means that we are not matching the case, which is B. We then go down to 6. What we get when we divide by 6 is that. We get 5,2,1,9,5,6. And since the first digit in the last cases is bigger than any other in the series, we know that the answer is G.\n\n9476536}6\n\nIn the general highlighted series first value of last case is larger than in the second case, So we just have to the last value which will be the answer since it will be the same but not match. In this case, we have 0,0,1,3,6 which means in order to"}

For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Encryption Steps:\n    - For each letter p in the plaintext:\n        - Get the decimal number x corresponding to the ascii code of p.\n        - Calculate x * k_q_x as the number y of ciphertexts for that letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all y's and separate them with commas to get the final ciphertext.\n\n **Decryption Rules:**\n\n- Input:\n    - Ciphertext: A sequence of numbers separated by ,. For example, \"y1,y2,…\".\n- Output:\n    - Plaintext: Uppercase letters string without punctuation and spaces.\n- Preparation:\n    - k_q_x : 12\n- Decryption Steps:\n    - For each number c in the ciphertext:\n        - Compute z = c // k_q_x. where // is used in integer division operations to return the integer part of the quotient (i.e., the result of removing the fractional part).\n        - Based on the decimal number represented by z, use ascii to find the corresponding letter as the plaintext letter p.\n    - Finally, concatenate all p's to get the final plaintext.\n\n### Question:\nPlaintext: \"N\"\n\nPlease provide the encrypted answer, encapsulated in double square brackets.
