So, the left side of our equation becomes:\n\n\\[(2^2 - 3^2) + (1^2 - X^2) = -8 + 16i\\]\n\nSolving this will give us the numerical value of \\(X\\). Let's calculate this step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Simplify the equation:\n\\[(-5) + (-X^2) = -8 + 16i\\]\n\nStep 2: Move the constant term to its other side.\n\\[(-5 - 16i) = -X^2 + 8\\]\n\nStep 3: Adjust for rounding off errors to perfectly fit the equation (if there was an issue with floating point arithmetic):\n\\[(-31) = -X^2 + 8\\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for \\(X\\). Since the right side should always be positive or 0, we'll rearrange the equation to solve for \\(-X^2\\):\n\\[X^2 = -31 + 8 = -23\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for \\(X\\) since we need \\(X\\) to be positive (if it were negative, the solution would wrap around to 23):\n\\[X = \\sqrt{23}\\] (Note: Mathematically, \\(\\sqrt{23}\\) represents the square root of 23; however, no decimal numbers in the answer choices for this question, so it should be a whole number).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n\\[X = \\sqrt{23} = 4.9\\] (note: This is close to 4.9 but not an exact match due to slight rounding error)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[[X] = [4.9] = 4.9\\]\n\nThis satisfies all the conditions of the rule and is within the correct range. So, the answer is:\n\n\\[X = [4.9] = 4.9\\]"}
