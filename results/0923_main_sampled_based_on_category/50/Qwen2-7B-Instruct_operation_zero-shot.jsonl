Otherwise, due to the complexity, we might use the third rule.\n- The condition seems to lend itself more to extraneous inputs, especially since the operation sequence involves two steps, but the question focuses on finding X, which suggests working backward from the known result.\n\n### Calculating Backwards:\n\n1. **Assume** 25※X = some number, and this result is then operated on with 14 to yield 4.\n2. If X were a multiple of 14 or 14 were a multiple of X, we'd use:\n\n   - For 25※X = Y (where Y is the result of that operation), then Y※14 = 4.\n   - We switch back the operations here:\n\n   - If 25※X = Y (where Y could be calculated based on how Y※14 = 4), then X※14 = Y.\n\nGiven that X※14 = Y (from the operation 25※X※14 = 4), we need to consider the operation sequence in reverse. The tricky part is understanding the different rules at play. Since 14 is not a multiple of 25, and 25 is not a multiple of 14, we're more likely to move directly from the final equation to backtrack to find X under the understanding that the operations act sequentially.\n\n### Initial Insight:\n\n- Since X※14 = Y, and 25※Y = 4, we seek Y first, applying the operation's reverse function from 25 to find a potential Y by reversing the original operation. The operation 25※Y = 4 will lead to: 4※Y = 25.\n\n### Solving the Terminology:\n\n- The final result is given back as the reverse operation's result (where the base number acts as X, leading to a result equivalent to an initial operation).\n  \n### Reversing the Operations:\n\n**Step 1: Approach through Y in the equation 4※Y = 25 to find Y.**\n\nWe apply Rule 3 as it fits the condition that Y is not a multiple of 4 nor is 4 a multiple of Y to get:\n\nY = 24 (by **Rule 3** since we are expected to find the operation's solution based on the return of a number to the original condition involving X).\n\n**Step 2: Reversing the equation 25※Y (with Y = 24) to find the original operation to pinpoint X.**\n\nGiven the initial operation yields a result via the sequence, we rearrange to find **25※X**.\n\nSince **Y = 24** (as deduced from step 1), applying back to the operation using the rule for when X (from **25※X**) is not a multiple of Y (24):\n\n- The operation **25※X** leads us back to **X※14 = 24** (as in the second part of the operation sequence).\n\nHence, **X※14 = 24** is our guide. Given the peculiar instruction, the first step was to find Y leading to the logic that must also reverse back to extract X’s operation assertion in more identifiable rhyme.\n\n- Taking the hint for **X※14 = 24**, the query indicates we’re dealing with operations that are inversely structured based around binary multiplication realities.\n\n### Concluding Logically:\n\nFrom the premise, the operation must deliver back to X being indicative relative to the identified number operations progressiontram from **4** => **25** via X embedded in the inverse sequence logic against Y=24's position relative to the direct operations in the question’s base.\n\nNegating the original direct line of logical interrogation's dicey nature involving complex operation application via reverse, the clearer logical takeaway is:\n\nRecognizing the direct outcome and mappings - as **X※14** => **24** represents its position in the reverse operation flow from **25** via **4**, the solution path guides directly to interpreting the operation sequence in reverse mapping back to initial request format by augmentation clarifying `X` via the operation’s inherent logic progression glanceback reconstruct via relational condition reversal-logic key via ***X = 14*** in operation understanding based on operational rules logical┘reversal logic solution via recognizing operation condition relationships defining steps astutely solving setup through operational understanding/backward application, initial direct insight leading to:\n\n**X = 14** is the evaluated answer through deciphering operational mechanics backward toward foundational query element via identifying key operation effects backtrace analyzing until clarity emerges.\n\n[14]"}

The intention here is to solve for 'a'. Let's analyze the operation:\n\n1★a=\\int_{1}^{a} \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx + 6.\n\nSince f(x)=1/x, let’s calculate the integral of f(x) between the limits 1 and 'a':\n\n\\int_{1}^{a} \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx = \\ln|x|\\Big|_{1}^{a} = \\ln|a| - \\ln|1| = \\ln(a) - \\ln(1).\n\nWe specify \\ln(1) is 0 because log to the base e of 1 is 0. \n\nTherefore, the integral simplifies to:\n\n\\ln(a) + 6.\n\nGiven that 1★a=ln(2)+6, we have:\n\n\\ln(a) + 6 = ln(2) + 6.\n\nNow, setting the two sides equal:\n\n\\ln(a) = ln(2).\n\nTo get 'a', we need to exponentiate both sides with base e:\n\ne^{\\ln(a)} = e^{\\ln(2)}.\n\nSo, the result of 'e' raised to the power of 'ln of a' should give us 'a' and because the power of natural log and 'e' is inverse operations it's equal to 'a':\n\na = 2.\n\nSo, the answer, wrapped in double square brackets, is:\n\n[[2]]"}
