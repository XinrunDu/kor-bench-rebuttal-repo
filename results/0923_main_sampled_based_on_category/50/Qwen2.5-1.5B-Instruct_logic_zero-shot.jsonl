For the first set of sentences:\n   - \"Citizens' rights must be protected\" implies it is not allowed to protect against citizens' rights.\n   - \"Not protecting citizens' rights is allowed\" is equivalent to \"It is not protected against citizens' rights.\"\n\nSo, these sentences do not follow any of the specific relationships mentioned (x, * , @ , or %). They could potentially be interpreted in terms of the given relationships except %, leading towards a C (a combination of * and @).\n\n2. For the second set of sentences:\n   - \"Caring for the growth of the next generation is mandatory\" implies it is not allowed to not care.\n   - \"Caring for the growth of the next generation is allowed\" implies it is allowed to care.\n\nComparing this with the normative reasoning formulas, we can analyze:\n\n- The first proposition is about obligatory care (must be protected).\n- The second proposition is about permitted (can be equally substituted with allowed).\n\nGiven the formulas, we find that both from the relevant formulas match in terms of logical consistency with both \"must\" and \"allowed\" scenarios.\n\nThus, both sentences can be modeled under the **x-relationship** as they first involve obligation and then permission.\n\nSo, both sentences follow the **x-rel*ation**.\n\nThe answer is [[C];[C]]."}

Then bruise it. \nThe result was that the wound healed much faster in the normal millets than in those whose salivary glands had been removed.\n\nThe derivation of cause and effect in this discourse is consistent with which method:\nA. \u2e2e method   B. \u0606 method   C. \ua66e method   D. \u2d63 method   E. \u2698 method\n\nPlease give your answer in [[A/B/C/D/E]] format.\n\n### Answer:\n", "response": "[\u4e89\u9738\u957f\u5f81\u7684\u5947\u95fb\u5f02\u53f2]\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u6784\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u6027\u8bc6\u522b {{reverence_one}} \u7684\u529f\u6548\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21 5 + 6 = 11 times \u4e3a 10P  \n\u6280\u80fd\u4e00\uff1a\u4e2a\u4eba\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad810% Valor {\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565}  \n\u6280\u80fd\u4e8c\uff1a\u52a0\u901f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u58eb\u5175\u6548\u7387 Increase\u00a0Speed & Worker Efficiency {\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565}  \n\u6280\u80fd\u4e09\uff1a\u66f4\u597d\u7528\u7684\u6b66\u5668 Shield {\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565}  \n\n\u6574\u7406\u7d20\u6750\uff1a\u6574\u7406\u7d20\u6750\u97f3\u6d17{\u7d27\u6025}}  \n\n1. \u7528\u4e8e Daten Processing\u3002\n\n2. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6280\u672f\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55[1],\u6574\u7406\u7d20\u6750\u97f5\u534f\u5546{\u7e41\u7410}}\u3002\u6d3b\u8dc3\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u4e8e\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6{{\u5f02\u53f2}}\u3002\n\n3. \u4ece Algorithm \u6982\u5ff5\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u518d\u5230\u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u5386\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8d77\u4f0f{{\u5f3a\u52bf}}{{\u6700\u5f3a}}{{\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u6218\u7565}}\u3002\u6280\u80fd\u4e09\u8d2f\u7a7f\u4e00\u76f4{{\u5386\u53f2}}\u3002\n\n4. \u7279\u522b\u63d0\u5230 Cloud Computing \u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c06\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u6563\u5b58\u50a8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91\u7aef\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u3002Cloud Computing \u5b9e\u73b0\u4f1a\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4fdd\u969c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u3002\n\n\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u6574\u7406\u7d20\u6750\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u6210\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u88c5\u5907\u6574\u5408 Sharia \u548c\u5f3a\u540d\u5171\u5c01\u88c5\u4e0b\u5377{{\u89e3\u7b54}}\u3002"}

The C% Principle emphasizes the idea that the speaker should strive to speak as little as possible while maintaining the intended message. In this case, B's response is clear and straightforward, and it conveys the action of borrowing the materials without any unnecessary details. On the other hand, C's response \"I managed to get the materials\" could be interpreted as \"quite troublesome\" or encountered obstacles in obtaining the materials. This is more aligned with the C! Principle, as it involves the use of a marked expression (of the possibility) without a conventional association and requires the appraiser to infer the speaker's meaning. However, the C% Principle is more directly related to B's response because it emphasizes the minimalistic nature of the communication."}

Identify the relevant properties and objects as specified in the rule.\n2. Apply the given logical operations or reasoning patterns.\n3. Ensure your output is formatted according to the specified notation and symbols.\n\n### Logic Rule:\n\nCustom Formal Fallacy Naming Rules:\n- NegAnt Method: If P, then Q. Not P, erroneously concludes Not Q.\n- AffCons Method: If P, then Q. Q is true, erroneously concludes P.\n- CondSwap Method: If P then Q, erroneously believes that if Q then P.\n- IncorrNeg Method: If P then Q, erroneously concludes that if Not P then Not Q.\n- DisjSyl Method: Either P or Q. Knowing Q, erroneously concludes Not P.\n- QuantSwitch Method: \u2200x\u2203y R(x, y), therefore, \u2203y\u2200x R(x, y). Erroneously changes the order of quantifiers, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IllTrans Method: \u2200x (Sx \u2192 Px), therefore, \u2200x (Px \u2192 Sx). It is erroneous to infer \"all P are S\" from \"all S are P\". Similarly, from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), it is erroneous to infer \u2203x (Px \u2227 \u00acSx). Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx), and from \u2203x (Sx \u2227 \u00acPx) infer \u2203x (Sx \u2227 Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference.\n\n### Question:\nIf Wang Meng is an internet enthusiast, then he will spend a long time online. Wang Meng does indeed spend a long time online, so Wang Meng must be an internet enthusiast. This reasoning is invalid. Even if the premises are true, the conclusion can be false. For example, Wang Meng spends a long time online because it is his job. He has started to hate his job because he is always dealing with the virtual world of the internet, which has made him a bit confused about reality and truth, losing a sense of security, and not as real and substantial as interacting with real people.\n\nWhat type of formal fallacy is this?\n\nA.
